In candid online posts and workplace forums, employees have shared how customers often mistake them for being “on duty” simply because they are wearing a uniform, even while sitting away from the counter or dining with colleagues.

""Just because we’re in uniform doesn’t mean we’re available 24/7,"" said one worker anonymously. ""We deserve a moment to breathe, eat, and reset—just like anyone else.""

In an announcement this week, PCH said it was using the bankruptcy process to “finalize a shift away” from its legacy business of direct-mail, retail merchandise and magazine subscriptions. The company is hoping to instead transition to a “pure digital advertising” model, where it will continue to offer free-to-play entertainment and prizes.

The Chapter 11 proceedings, filed in New York on Wednesday, arrive amid growing financial strain for PCH — which has struggled with rising operational costs and changing consumer habits in recent years.

Pivoting from its old way of doing business will help the company break free from past constraints and “establish a strong foundation for our future,” CEO Andy Goldberg said in a statement.

But that doesn’t mean the famous sweepstakes are going away. PCH says it plans to operate in a “business-as-usual manner” throughout the bankruptcy process — noting that the “Prize Patrol” team will continuing to deliver awards across the U.S. The company says it’s lined up debtor-in-possession financing from Prestige Capital to fund operations through its restructuring.

PCH’s roots date back to 1953 — when Harold and LuEsther Mertz and their daughter, Joyce Mertz-Gilmore, formed a business out of their Long Island, New York home to send direct-to-consumer mailings that solicited subscribers for a number of magazines through one single offering.

The company later grew with chances for consumers to win money — first launching a direct mail sweepstakes in 1967 — and expanded its offerings to a wide variety of merchandise, from collectible figurines to houseware and “As Seen on TV” accessories, in the years that followed. Its in-person “Prize Patrol” team was formed in 1989.

PCH became known for surprising prize winners with oversized checks, which was often filmed and featured in TV commercials. In Wednesday court documents, the company said it has awarded over half a billion dollars in prizes and continues to attract millions of contestants today.

But its operations haven’t been without financial strain — particularly in recent years.

“While PCH’s direct mail and e-commerce programs were profitable for decades, changing patterns of consumer behavior, costs and competition, along with a declining pool of new prospecting names, negatively impacted the business, resulted in losses beginning in 2022,” William H. Henrich, co-chief restructuring officer for PCH, wrote in a court declaration Wednesday.

Henrich pointed to a handful of cost pressures — including rising shipping and postal rates, inventory and supply chain challenges that have continued since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and rising competition from major retailers today, like Walmart and Amazon, that have dominated the e-commerce space.

PCH also faced some scrutiny from regulators who previously raised concerns about consumers mistakenly believing that making purchases from the company would improve their chances at winning its sweepstakes. As a result, PCH has racked up several costly legal settlements over the years — most recently, Wednesday’s court documents note, paying $18.5 million to resolve allegations from the Federal Trade Commission in 2018.

As of the end of March, PCH had total assets of nearly $11.7 million and total liabilities of about $65.7 million, court documents show. The company currently has 105 employees and an annual gross revenue of about $38 million.",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.post-journal.com/images/2016/10/31144144/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-04-12 03:59:11.096623

The fast-food empire began rolling out its new recipe to all US restaurants earlier this week.

Its new lemonade, created by the chain's beverage experts, features real lemon juice, bits of lemon bulb, and sugar.

Multiple Reddit users have praised the beverage and claimed it's 'way better' than the chain's Minute Made option.

'Every McDonald's I've been to has already changed over to the new lemonade, it's way better than the Minute Made,' a fan wrote.

The drink's grand rollout comes two years after McDonald's began testing it at select locations.

McDonald's lemonade costs between $2.73 and $3.44, on average.

Despite the lemonade addition, McDonald's will keep serving the Minute Made orange juice option to customers.

One of the fast-food chain's top competitors is Chick-fil-A, which started serving lemonade in 1977.

The restaurant chain says its beverage is made from real lemon juice, with no preservatives or artificial colors.

It quickly became Chick-fil-A's most ordered drink, and led to the introduction of other beverages like Key Lime Lemonade and Cherry Berry Lemonade.

Fast food chains are competing to produce the most popular variation of the fruity beverage.

Wendy's entered the race with its Dave's Craft Lemonade, which comes in flavors like Blueberry Pomegranate and Pineapple Mango.

Arby's also offers multiple flavors of its signature Market Fresh Lemonade.

Other lemonades with 'real fruit juice' are being offered in chains like Sonic, Panera Bread, and Chipotle.

All restaurants fighting for the reign of best lemonade are also battling it out to offer the cheapest menu items to customers - a competition which has been dubbed the 'value meals wars.'

The new lemonade is not the only health-conscious item McDonald's has tested in the US.

The chain famously tested a meat-free burger named The McPlant at select locations in Texas and California.

The sandwich began its trials at several hundred restaurants in 2021, but was killed off due to poor feedback last year.

Even though it failed, McDonald's is currently testing another meatless burger at restaurants called The McVeggie.

The McVeggie is being tested at several Canadian locations in British Columbia, Ontario, and New Brunswick.

The sandwich testing will last until April 14, and despite hints of a US expansion, it is unclear if the McVeggie will reach the States.

The fast-food chain is also busy testing its spinoff, which focuses on drinks called CosMc's.

The first CosMc's opened in 2023, and despite recent store shutdowns, McDonald's has shown no signs of axing the concept.

McDonald's continues to be the largest fast-food chain in the US, but its latest quarterly revenue fell flat of expectations.

Chick-fil-A has been having massive revenue increases over the past few years despite being dethroned as America's favorite fast-food restaurant.

Another lemonade-serving chain to keep an eye on is Wendy's, which aims to open 1,000 new stores by the end of 2028.

If the chain reaches its goal, it could potentially take over McDonald's title.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/11/21/97187211-0-image-m-153_1744402501864.jpg,N,,2025-04-12 02:59:21.494072

The industry body representing the companies even met with NZ diplomats in Geneva to raise its concerns about marketing restrictions.Anusha Bradley, Investigative Reporter

10 April 2025

Baby formula companies tried to convince the government to resist an expanded global ban on internet marketing of infant milk, despite evidence that online advertising was discouraging mums from breastfeeding.

The former chief executive of the local formula industry body even met with diplomats based at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva to raise its concerns, documents obtained by RNZ under the Official Information Act show.

Meanwhile, French multinational Danone, whose Karicare and Aptamil brands dominate the market in New Zealand, separately told senior ministers that new World Health Organisation (WHO) digital marketing guidelines were “misguided” and urged officials not to enshrine them into law.

“A communication blackout will deny New Zealand parents and carers the information to make informed choices on the best nutritional options for their infants,” Danone wrote.

WHO issued the new guidelines last year, recommending a ban on “digital” advertising of all formula – and baby food – for children under three years old, after a review found social media was now the main way parents were exposed to formula marketing.

It said “exploitative” and “insidious” marketing practices online had led to increasing sales of formula, while dissuading mothers from breastfeeding.

“Through tools like apps, virtual support groups or ‘baby-clubs’, paid social media influencers, promotions and competitions and advice forums or services, formula milk companies can buy or collect personal information and send personalized promotions to new pregnant women and mothers,” the WHO report said.

The World Health Assembly is expected to formally adopt the guidelines into its International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes in May.

The New Zealand government’s 2023 submission to the draft guidelines – made in consultation with formula companies – did not support the full scope of the proposed rules banning digital marketing of foods for infants and young children, or the expanded definition of breastmilk substitutes covering infants up to three years of age.

New Zealand has been a signatory to the Code since 1983, but only partially complies with it because compliance is based on a voluntary, industry-run code of practice, rather than regulations enshrined in law.

The Code, which is run by industry body the Infant Nutrition Council (INC) and overseen by the Ministry of Health, currently prohibits members from marketing products for infants up to 12 months of age, including digital marketing.

Rules ‘misguided’

Documents released to RNZ show that Danone urged senior ministers against adopting the new guidelines into law, despite the company’s own ‘advocacy policy’ stating it supports national legislation that supports the WHO International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes.

“The guidance is misguided and will have profound consequences for the infant formula industry and consumers,” Danone New Zealand operations manager Steve Donnelly wrote in a December 2023 letter to Food Safety Minister Andrew Hoggard and Trade and Agriculture Minister Todd McClay.

He urged ministers to apply a “national interest test” to the WHO guidance, referring to the National-New Zealand First coalition agreement requiring the government to apply such a test before it accepted any United Nations agreements.

“Our view is that the consequences of the WHO guidelines for breast milk substitute digital marketing are of the national interest and should not be adopted,” wrote Donnelly.

The guidelines would lead to a “total ban” of all digital communications about its products for newborns up to 36-months old, he said.

Even though potential ratification by New Zealand was “likely years away” and led by the health ministry he urged the ministers and MPI to “take an active interest in these developments.”

Danone had also raised its concerns to the Ministry for Primary Industries’ Dairy Product Safety Advisory Council (DPSAC) in November 2023, questioning what action the government was taking over the issue.

DPSAC was set up in 1999 to “promote communication between MPI and industry and assist in developing standards and policies.” Danone has been a member since 2020.

At the time, MPI told Danone the final guidelines had already been issued and there was nothing it could do, documents show.

Danone raised concerns again in April 2024 with Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters.

“Our primary concern is that babies and parents do not become the poor relation of regulation,” wrote Donnelly.

The letter was forwarded to Associate Health Minister Casey Costello, who oversees maternal health, to respond to.

Her officials noted the guidance issued by WHO was not legally binding, and health, MPI, MFAT and Health NZ would work together to determine “whether any actions from the guidance will be implemented.”

Costello told Donnelly the government had no plans to change the voluntary INC code of practice currently in place.

“If evidence emerged that suggested New Zealand’s current approach does not adequately cover digital marketing practices, then New Zealand may consider measures covered in the guidance,” she wrote in a June letter.

She would expect the industry to be consulted if changes were proposed, she said.

‘A bit of a shocker’

RNZ asked Danone why it was against the new guidance when the current INC code already banned the use of digital marketing.

The company declined to be interviewed, but in a statement said it wrote to senior ministers over the “concerning language used in the digital marketing guidance which suggested it was mandatory and superseded national laws”.

When asked why it opposed national laws when it was its own policy to support national legislation supporting the WHO code, it responded that it supported the code but the digital marketing guidelines were not yet officially part of it.

“We believe it must be made clear to policymakers that preventing infant formula manufacturers from providing factual information about their products via digital channels may exacerbate existing issues faced by parents and carers, such as the rise of misinformation and unreliable content online,” it said.

Danone’s own 2023 global advocacy policy stated the company would support the WHO code.

“As a first step we will support the adoption, implementation and, critically, enforcement of national legislation to meet the needs of each market.”

It also stated it is “committed to lobbying only in support of measures to improve health and nutrition, consistent with the public interest and nutrition”.

Danone was not the only organisation opposed to the WHO guidance.

INC, which runs the voluntary code of practice for marketing formula in New Zealand, told MPI the guidelines were “a bit of a shocker”.

“We think it should not proceed,” INC policy analyst Carole Inskter told MPI officials in September 2023.

That same month, then-INC chief executive Jan Carey flew to Geneva and met with Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials based at New Zealand’s permanent mission to the World Trade Organisation over the issue.

“From industry’s point of view, digital marketing is already covered under the WHO Code including in New Zealand’s response which is the INC Code of Practice for the Marketing of Infant Formula in New Zealand,” she wrote.

The College of Midwives said it would like to see the WHO code enshrined in New Zealand law “to protect breastfeeding.”

In a 2023 submission to the Commerce Commission about the INC code it raised concerns about New Zealand not fulfilling its obligations under the WHO code.

Legislation would “support unbiased information about the safe and appropriate use of commercial milk formula for parents and carers,” it said.

“The marketing of commercial milk formula directly undermines breastfeeding protection.”

The INC Code requires Commerce Commission approval because it brings companies together in a way that could be perceived as collusion.

In February, Australia’s competition regulator denied extending the INC’s code on that side of the Tasman for another five years over concerns about its voluntary nature, limited scope and ability to restrict digital marketing methods.

Australia’s health department has recommended replacing it with a mandatory code, which is expected to take two years to implement.

The health ministry told RNZ there was no timeline for implementing the new WHO digital marketing code in New Zealand.

The pushback against the WHO guidelines was revealed amid a recent RNZ investigation into a government backdown over trans-Tasman formula guidelines.

That investigation found a handful of formula companies, led by Danone and The A2 Milk Company, successfully lobbied against the government adopting tougher trans-Tasman food standards for baby formula.

The congruency report could shed light on the gaps between Starbucks' outward-facing promises and actual practices.","A press release from the National Center for Public Policy Research reported on the hypocrisy of Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol's transportation practices when considering the company's public commitment to eco-friendly practices.

Niccol travels regularly from his home in Newport Beach, California, to Starbucks' headquarters in Seattle, Washington, via private jet. Each 2,000-mile round-trip commute releases nearly nine tons of carbon dioxide.

The National Center for Public Policy Research's Free Enterprise Project's director Stefan Padfield pointed out the discrepancy of policy and practice during his presentation of Proposal 8 requesting an annual report on emissions congruency. He noted that each round trip made by Niccol ""is roughly the annual energy-consumption footprint of the typical American household.""

This analogy paints a vivid picture of the hypocrisy between Starbucks' public environmental commitments and the practices of the CEO. Gaps are apparent.

Private jet pollution releases a significant amount of harmful gases into the environment that contribute to the warming of the planet. They are often used over relatively short distances and transport very few people, so they are not energy-efficient at all. Using a private jet is basically the opposite of carpooling. It is probably one of the least environmentally friendly travel methods.

The environmental impact of luxury travel is significant.

Large companies often use private jets to transport executives with little regard for the negative impact of their pollution.

The Starbucks CEO's use of a private jet is especially remarkable since the practice is in direct conflict with the company's public embracing of environmental causes.

An article in the Marketing Magazine points out Starbucks' relationship with greenwashing, when a company makes claims about the environmental benefits of its products or policies that are misleading. It is considered deceptive marketing.

The article pointed out, ""Through its Environment, Social, and Governance initiatives, Starbucks seeks not just to minimize its impact on the planet, but to exceed expectations in how it operates."" The company's commitment to protecting the environment includes using sustainable coffee beans and reducing waste in stores.

Starbucks is under increased scrutiny due to greenwashing allegations, and the congruency report would help highlight target areas for improvement.

Padfield suggested, ""Perhaps the problem is not the related business practices, but rather the ill-conceived decision to wrap the company in unrealistic climate goals.""

LG India’s December IPO prospectus warned without specifics that higher recycling rates “had a significant financial impact on our company”.","NEW DELHI: India wants to tackle its mounting e-waste problem. Global electronics companies say the cost is too high.

Daikin, Hitachi and Samsung are among manufacturers alarmed by new Indian government rules that require them to pay significantly more to recycle air conditioners, refrigerators, TVs and other appliances, court papers and lobbying letters show.

The electronics giants are urging environment officials to abandon the approach, with four companies suing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration in New Delhi over the measures they say will heighten compliance woes and unsettle businesses. The previously unreported standoff marks the latest chapter in foreign companies’ battles with India over what some perceive as protectionist policies and shifting regulatory goal posts. India is the third-biggest e-waste generator behind China and the U.S. But government data shows only 43% of the country’s e-waste last year was recycled and at least 80% of the sector comprises informal scrap dealers, whose methods can pose environmental and health risks.

Concerned about poor waste-processing practices, New Delhi in September set a floor price that electronics makers must pay recyclers, with the aim of formalising the sector and encouraging investment in e-waste management.

A Reuters review of hundreds of pages of non-public court papers and letters to the government by an industry group representing Samsung and LG reveals the impasse over the new rates, which the industry says have roughly tripled manufacturers’ recycling costs.

Johnson Controls-Hitachi, Japan’s Daikin, India’s Havells and Tata Group’s Voltas each sued Modi’s government between November and March to quash the pricing rules.

The measures are unconstitutional, exceed the government’s powers under environmental law, and raise compliance costs manifold, the companies said in submissions to New Delhi judges. The government has called for the cases to be dismissed.

Daikin said no Indian government had ever previously drafted policies with the “sole intention” of providing financial gain to some businesses, in this case recyclers, at others’ expense. Voltas predicted a “cascading effect” on product prices.

The companies are part of an Indian consumer electronics market Euromonitor estimates will be worth $62 billion this year. The sector has experienced average annual growth of 10% since 2021.

As sales of consumer electronics skyrocket due to rapid urbanisation, companies such as Daikin, Hitachi and Samsung have expanded production in India. In line with global trends, India’s e-waste reached 1.7 million metric tons in 2023-24, more than doubling in six years.

Samsung declined to comment. The other companies and India’s Environment Ministry didn’t respond to Reuters queries about the pricing rules and the industry’s response.

‘Reasonable’ intervention

For years, India has resisted foreign companies’ demands to revoke protectionist policies. Lobbying by Walmart and Amazon, for example, failed to ease regulations that protect small retailers.

On e-waste, too, Modi’s administration is digging in.

In a March 18 submission, the Environment Ministry urged the judges to dismiss the lawsuits, saying it was “reasonable” and within its powers to fix prices.

The alternative of letting companies and recyclers determine prices may not account for all costs of environmentally sound waste management, the ministry said, adding that it wanted to prevent a “race to the bottom” in pricing.

India’s government says there are 322 authorised recyclers in the country.

But informal waste handlers flourish nationwide, using methods such as open burning and acid leaching to extract metals and components, which can release hazardous materials.

In western Gujarat state, 60-year-old scrap dealer Mustakeem Malik uses a hammer to dismantle televisions, air conditioners and routers.

Inside his tin-roofed shed where electronic equipment was stacked in haphazard piles, Malik told Reuters he earns 50,000 rupees, or about $580, a month by selling the plastic, circuit boards and copper he extracts from the devices. He doesn’t want to work in the formal e-waste sector.

“That business has a lot of expenses. It’s for the big guys,” he said.

Happy recyclers, worried companies

India’s new rules mandate a minimum payment of 22 rupees (25 U.S. cents) per kilogram to recycle consumer electronics and 34 rupees/kg for smartphones.

Makers of heavier devices such as air conditioners are likely to be hit hardest because their per-unit recycling cost has risen by a greater amount compared with makers of lighter gadgets like smartphones.

Research firm Redseer in February said India’s recycling rates were still low compared with the U.S., where they are up to five times higher, and China, where they at least 1.5 times higher.

“We are talking about peanuts here,” said Nitin Gupta, CEO of one of India’s biggest recyclers, Attero, who added that the government rates require manufacturers to pay about $10 to recycle a washing machine.

“If you have to create scientific capacity for recycling, you need extra profits. This is good for us,” said Gupta, whose firm counts LG and Daikin as clients.

The electronics makers, though, feel threatened.

India’s Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association, which represents LG and Samsung, among others, said in a letter to the government in November that e-waste compliance expenses had risen to 2% to 8% of production costs. The group asked environment officials to reconsider the pricing rules.

Samsung and LG haven’t sued the government but have signaled concern. LG India’s December IPO prospectus warned without specifics that higher recycling rates “had a significant financial impact on our company”.

A person with direct knowledge of the matter said Samsung had told senior Indian officials its recycling costs would be five to 15 times the previous rates, and urged New Delhi not to interfere in commercial dealings with recyclers.

In court, Johnson Controls-Hitachi was the only company to reveal what it previously paid for recycling: 6 rupees per kg, or 7 U.S. cents. That figure has now almost quadrupled.

The company disclosed that it recycled more than 10,000 tons of air conditioners last fiscal year, which would amount to roughly $2.6 million under the new rates. Its India business reported a net loss of $8.8 million the previous year.

Then, on April 1, 2022, the lawsuit states Kroger told Inclusion and Wellness Your Way Festival LLC it was terminating the arrangement with them.
The event became the Kroger Wellness Festival and continues.
Kroger argues in its motion to dismiss that it never had an actual partnership agreement with Inclusion and Wellness Your Way Festival LLC.","Singer-songwriter Jewel and another co-founder of Kroger Co.’s annual Wellness Festival are suing the supermarket giant, claiming the company unjustly took control of the event away from them just as it turned profitable.

The case features an upcoming deposition of former Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen, who suddenly resigned March 2 following a board investigation of his personal conduct.

Wellness Your Way Festival LLC, a company in which Jewel has an ownership stake that was formed to operate the festival, and Inclusion Cos., her festival co-founder’s company, filed the lawsuit against downtown Cincinnati-based Kroger (NYSE: KR), the nation’s largest operator of traditional supermarkets, in December 2023 in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court. They accuse Kroger of breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation and unjust enrichment, among other causes of action, according to the complaint.

Kroger has disputed those claims and filed a motion to dismiss the case.

The plaintiffs are seeking an unspecified amount of damages and an order prohibiting Kroger from using Inclusion and Jewel’s intellectual and proprietary property.

Two key events are coming up this month in the case involving a high-profile celebrity and Cincinnati’s largest company. Plaintiff lawyers are scheduled to depose McMullen April 18, according to court filings. That date was confirmed this week, Brian O’Connor, lawyer and partner at downtown-based Santen & Hughes who is representing Inclusion, Wellness Your Way Festival LLC and Jewel in the case, told me.

And a hearing is set for April 28 for the judge to hear Kroger’s motion to dismiss the case.

The plaintiffs don’t specify damages and are seeking “damages in an amount to be proven at trial,” according to the lawsuit. But the plaintiffs lost more than $2 million in out-of-pocket costs and at least $5 million in lost future profits, the lawsuit alleges.

Trevor Drinkwater, CEO of Inclusion, an operator of retailer-sponsored, celebrity-backed festivals, and Jewel Kilcher, better known in the music world as simply Jewel, came up with the idea for a festival promoting mental and physical wellness, according to the lawsuit. They considered partnering with several national retailers and ultimately chose Kroger.

In December 2017, they sent a written partnership proposal to Kroger with plans for a five-year festival that Inclusion would fund, according to the lawsuit. Kroger would be considered a founding sponsor, get the right to approve all aspects of the event and encourage its suppliers to participate. Inclusion insisted on a five-year agreement, saying it took three years with another festival it operated to become cash-flow positive.

After some back and forth regarding details, the lawsuit says a Kroger executive replied, “Wanted to give you the good news that we are a go!”

Kroger never asked for a formal agreement.

Inclusion formed Wellness Your Way Festival LLC to produce the festival. Jewel received an ownership interest in that new company in return for supporting the festival and waiving her usual performance and promotional fees, the lawsuit states.

Wellness Festival roots date back to 2018

The Wellness Your Way Festival was launched in 2018 in Cincinnati. It also took place in 2019 and 2021. Jewel, whose hit songs include “You Were Meant for Me” and “Standing Still,” was heavily involved. Over those years, the lawsuit says, she performed 12 musical shows, took part in 45 speaking panels, attended 16 VIP events for Kroger executives, attended 20 press events, was able to get 65 thought leaders and celebrities to participate at low or no cost and got Kroger executives on a Discovery TV show.

The event turned a profit for the first time in its third year, 2021, generating a $500,000 profit, according to the lawsuit. The organizers still had an accumulated debt of $2 million at that point.

Then, on April 1, 2022, the lawsuit states Kroger told Inclusion and Wellness Your Way Festival LLC it was terminating the arrangement with them.

Plaintiffs accused Kroger of a “corporate bullying mentality that led to its breach of the partnership agreement and theft of the festival,” according to the lawsuit.

The event became the Kroger Wellness Festival and continues. Kroger and partner Advantage Solutions Inc. “went on to produce the highly profitable year-four event in 2022, and even more profitable year-five event in 2023, using the know-how, marketing materials, contracts and sponsor lists that plaintiffs had contributed to the partnership,” according to the lawsuit.

The event took place Sept. 27-28 in downtown Cincinnati and is planned for this year.

Kroger argues in its motion to dismiss that it never had an actual partnership agreement with Inclusion and Wellness Your Way Festival LLC. It never had a written agreement, so none of its executives ever signed such an agreement, Kroger alleges. A statute related to fraud requires that any contract that can’t be performed within one year be in writing.

Kroger also argues that even if the parties had entered a valid contract, “its purported terms satisfy none of the requirements of a legal partnership in Ohio. For example, partnerships are profit-sharing enterprises, but plaintiffs allege that they were to own the festivals in question and take all of the profits from themselves,” it said in its motion to dismiss.

Kroger goes on to refute each of the plaintiffs’ allegations, largely on the basis of the absence of a valid contract, in seeking a dismissal of the lawsuit.

McMullen's deposition comes weeks after his resignation from Kroger

McMullen's resignation as CEO last month followed a Kroger board investigation of his personal conduct that, while ""unrelated to the business, was inconsistent with Kroger’s Policy on Business Ethics,” the company said in a news release. No other details have been released. Lead director Ron Sargent was named interim CEO and chairman.

McMullen is being deposed because he was involved in the event’s development, had become friends with Jewel and exchanged emails with her as the problems arose, according to court filings.

“McMullen was personally involved in this partnership and these annual festivals – festivals that were crucially important events for both McMullen and Kroger,” the plaintiffs said in a court filing.

McMullen had mentioned the festival on several conference calls with investors. And he had told Jewel in a 2018 email, “I really appreciate our growing partnership.”

On April 7, 2022, after the partnership was terminated, “Jewel wrote Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen, with whom she’d developed a friendship over the years based on what she thought were shared values, explaining that it ‘appears we have been hijacked. I’d love to get on the phone or meet in person to resolve this if we can,’” according to the lawsuit.

But McMullen replied, “I’m not involved in planning of the Festival this year. That’s Colleen (Kroger Health President Colleen Lindholz)’s responsibility. Please communicate with her on this.”

No trial date has been set.

This is just one of multiple lawsuits Kroger is facing. Albertsons Cos. Inc. sued Kroger in December after Kroger’s planned $24.6 billion acquisition was halted by two courts due to antitrust concerns. Albertsons and Kroger each canceled the transaction the next day. Albertsons is seeking a $600 million termination fee from Kroger along with additional, unspecified damages.",https://media.bizj.us/view/img/12935048/kroger-building-4*1200xx3600-2025-0-188.jpg,N,,2025-04-11 23:02:40.649677

Parcel shipping dynamics are shifting in the United States as traditional carriers FedEx and UPS are experiencing a decline in market share. According to a report by ShipMatrix Inc., online retailers and regional couriers are increasingly capturing the burgeoning e-commerce demand for last-mile delivery. Data from IndexBox reveals that in 2024, parcel volumes reached a record high of 23.8 billion, a 4% increase from the previous year and a staggering 50% rise since 2019. This growth has propelled parcel delivery revenues to $188 billion, with an average revenue of $8 per parcel.

ShipMatrix predicts that U.S. parcel volume will continue to grow at a compound annual rate of 4% over the next three years, reaching 26.8 billion by 2027. However, the bulk of this growth is expected to be managed by private networks of major retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, and Target, which poses a challenge for legacy carriers like UPS, FedEx, and USPS. Amazon, for instance, delivered 6.1 billion packages in 2024, a significant increase from 1.7 billion in 2019, while other carriers, led by Walmart, saw a 44% year-over-year growth to 2.3 billion packages.

UPS and FedEx are grappling with this competitive landscape. UPS, which recorded a flat parcel volume of 4.8 billion, announced plans to reduce its volume handled for Amazon by 50% over the next 18 months. Meanwhile, FedEx reported a slight decrease in its parcel volume to 3.4 billion packages.

Walmart's strategic ability to fulfill orders directly from its stores and clubs has been instrumental in its e-commerce expansion, as highlighted by CEO Doug McMillon. The retailer has expanded its same-day delivery coverage to 93% of U.S. households, up from 76% two years ago. E-commerce now constitutes 17% of Walmart's total net sales, with expectations to drive 50% of the company's topline growth over the next five years. The U.S. e-commerce business is projected to achieve profitability for the full year, according to McMillon.

The decline in temp billings at the UK-level also moderated.
Given the substantial effects of the Government’s decision to increase payroll taxes hugely, these figures were if anything slightly better than expected and suggest that there is potential in the market.
We can’t ignore the immediate and second-order effects of this context even if the UK is better positioned than many nations to weather the storm.
Announcing support for the auto sector is one thing but the faster we have clarity on how the industrial strategy will support all sectors the more likely employer sentiment on hiring and investing will remain stable.","The latest KPMG and REC UK Report on Jobs survey, compiled by S&P Global, indicated that hiring activity across the UK fell again in March.

Recruiters reported that weaker confidence “around the economic outlook, tighter client budgets and fewer job openings led to notable falls in permanent placements and temp billings.”

At the same time, overall vacancies “fell at a softer, but still substantial rate.”

Redundancies and reduced recruitment activity “led to a steeper increase in candidate availability.”

Notably, total labor supply increased at the “sharpest pace since December 2020.”

Improved candidate numbers and muted “demand for workers constrained rates of pay growth, with both starting salaries and temp wages increasing at historically weak rates.”

The report is compiled by S&P Global from “responses to questionnaires sent to a panel of around 400 UK recruitment and employment consultancies.”

UK recruitment consultancies signaled a “further reduction in hiring activity in March.”

Panel members frequently mentioned that “economic uncertainty, tighter recruitment budgets and reduced client activity had weighed on staff hiring.”

Permanent placements have now declined in each month “for the past two-and-a-half years, with the pace of reduction broadly unchanged from February and sharp.”

Temp billings meanwhile fell at the “softest rate in three months, albeit solidly overall.”

The availability of staff increased sharply in March, “with the rate of growth the quickest seen since December 2020.”

Recruiters noted steeper upturns in both “permanent and temporary labor supply, with the former registering the sharper rate of expansion.”

The increases in availability were often linked “by panel members to redundancies and fewer job openings.”

Overall demand for staff continued to weaken “at the end of the first quarter, with the respective seasonally adjusted index posting in contraction territory for the seventeenth month in a row.”

Though sharp, the pace of decline was the “softest recorded since last October, as both permanent and temporary job openings fell at slower rates.”

The rate of starting salary inflation picked up “from February’s four-year low, but remained comfortably below the survey’s long-run average in March.”

Concurrently, temp wage growth improved “slightly to a three-month high, but was only modest.”

Anecdotal evidence indicated that while many employers “increased pay to attract suitably-skilled candidates, panelists also acknowledged that tighter client budgets, muted demand for workers and improved staff supply had suppressed rates of growth.”

Three of the four monitored English regions signaled a “reduction in permanent placements, with the steepest fall in the North of England.”

London bucked the wider trend and recorded “a renewed, albeit modest, expansion.”

All four monitored English regions recorded lower temp billings in March, with the steepest reduction seen in the North of England.

Demand for permanent staff fell across “all ten monitored job categories during March.”

Meanwhile, the Construction sector saw the “softest decline.” As was the case for permanent vacancies, Retail saw the “sharpest reduction in temporary staff demand in March, closely followed by the Executive/Professional sector.”

Engineering noted the softest “drop in temp vacancies and saw only a marginal reduction.”

Jon Holt, Group Chief Executive and UK Senior Partner KPMG, said:

“At a time when global uncertainty is peaking and businesses are assessing the impact of market volatility alongside rising employment costs, the latest data demonstrates how the economic reality continues to weigh heavy on the labour market. With cost management a focus, those employers who are hiring are focused on securing the best talent, and while the rate of pay inflation has improved from last month’s four-year low, growth in starting salaries remains below the historic average.”

They added:

“Recent global events have put pressure on any growth prospects in the UK, so it is unlikely that we will see an improvement in the data in the near term. Therefore, redoubling employee engagement programmes and maintaining morale for existing employees, who will also be concerned about uncertainty in the market, will ensure that businesses are ready to take advantage of any green shoots when they do appear.”

Neil Carberry, REC Chief Executive, said:

“Today’s report shows that there were some signs of progress in the jobs market in March with permanent hiring in London ticking up a little, while the drops in other locations were not as sharp as those seen at the start of the year. The decline in temp billings at the UK-level also moderated. Given the substantial effects of the Government’s decision to increase payroll taxes hugely, these figures were if anything slightly better than expected and suggest that there is potential in the market. Nevertheless, activity in the UK jobs market has now been subdued for almost two and a half years.”

They also mentioned:

“A cyclical hiring upturn was always likely in 2025, but the near-term prospects for this have been made all the more uncertain by the actions of the US Government in upending the global trade system. We can’t ignore the immediate and second-order effects of this context even if the UK is better positioned than many nations to weather the storm. Announcing support for the auto sector is one thing but the faster we have clarity on how the industrial strategy will support all sectors the more likely employer sentiment on hiring and investing will remain stable.

He reviewed again the past week's turbulence spurred by unpredictable tariff policies and messaging from the White House, adding that any more statements from President Donald Trump this weekend could affect trading.

""This tape has it all, doesn't it, as the White House throws so much at you at all hours of the day,"" he said. ""We have press conferences, Truth Social posts, off-handed statements that move trillions of dollars.""

Monday brings earnings from Goldman Sachs. Cramer noted that the group as a whole hasn't been performing uniformly. He observed that the investment bank's business can be ""pretty episodic,"" but said he feels confident about Goldman's management and optimistic it can beat the estimates, especially because of its downsizing efforts.

On Tuesday, two more major banks are reporting, Citigroup and Bank of America . Cramer said he thinks the Citigroup's stock will see gains regardless of the quarter. He predicted that Bank of America would post decent earnings as it has done in recent months.

Cramer noted that the drug stocks have been tricky recently as the industry adjusts to new federal leadership and tariff policies. Johnson & Johnson is also set to report Tuesday, and Cramer said he'll be looking for an update about the company's ongoing litigation. He suggested shares could rise if the pharmaceutical company reveals big news about a new drug. Cramer also said he'll be paying attention to J.B. Hunt 's earnings. He thinks the report will be downbeat.

Abbott Laboratories and semiconductor capital equipment company ASML will post earnings on Wednesday. Cramer said he's expecting Abbott to report strength in its franchises but also mention the lawsuits that have dragged down the stock for a while. He called AMSL a crucial company in its sector and said he fears it will miss estimates.

Also on Wednesday is the release of retail sales data, and Cramer said he thinks the numbers will be strong given that names like Walmart , Amazon and Costco signaled that business was good over the past month.

Thursday brings earnings from Taiwan Semiconductor , UnitedHealth and American Express . The semiconductor company's quarter could reflect the entire sector, Cramer said, adding that some investors view it as a proxy for Nvidia .

Timeline

France, Belgium Object To Trump’s Pressure On Dei Initiatives

American embassies sent letters to foreign contractors, including those in France, Belgium, Denmark, Italy and Spain, directing them to comply with Trump’s DEI orders, prompting pushback from multiple countries. “If contracts were to be terminated solely because a company is committed to diversity and inclusion, this could constitute a violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,” Belgian deputy prime minister Maxime Prévot said in a statement Tuesday, stating the U.S. embassy “must comply with Belgian law in its actions.” “This practice reflects the values of the new American administration. They are not ours,” French economy minister Eric Lombard said in a statement.

Is Target Losing Traffic After Dropping Dei?

Foot traffic at Target has dropped for eight straight weeks, dating back to the company’s announcement at the end of January that it would roll back DEI policies, Retail Brew reported. Retail Brew cited data from Placer.ai, which measures foot traffic, that found traffic year-over-year declined at an average of 6.2% over the past eight weeks. Retail Brew compared the figure to Costco’s foot traffic, which has stood behind its DEI policies, noting the retailer’s foot traffic has grown for 13 straight weeks.

Why Is The Fcc Targeting Disney And Other Companies?

FCC Chair Brendan Carr said last week he would investigate Disney and ABC over their DEI programs, telling company CEO Bob Iger in a letter he would investigate whether the company is “violating FCC equal employment opportunity regulations by promoting invidious forms of DEI discrimination.” Carr threatened in an interview earlier this week ABC could lose its broadcast license if the FCC finds the company was “engaged in race- and gender-based discrimination.” T-Mobile also reportedly pared back DEI language on its website, Fierce Network reported, ahead of closing a deal with fiber provider Lumos. T-Mobile executive vice president Mark Nelson had sent a letter to the FCC last week stating the company is “conducting a comprehensive review of its DEI policies, programs, and activities.” Carr has also opened DEI probes at other companies, including Comcast and Verizon.

Contra

Some companies, including Costco and Apple, have not backed down from their DEI policies. Costco’s shareholders overwhelmingly voted to reject a proposal that would have obligated the company to review the potential risks of maintaining its DEI initiatives, with more than 98% of shareholders voting against the proposal. The board said it “believes that our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary.” Apple’s board similarly urged shareholders to reject a proposal raised by the same think tank, accusing the group of “inappropriately” attempting to “restrict Apple's ability to manage its own ordinary business operations”—prompting Trump to slam Apple and call DEI a “hoax” on Truth Social. Delta Airlines also said it remains committed to DEI on a Jan. 10 earnings call. Peter Carter, the company’s executive vice president for external affairs, told a reporter the company is not reevaluating DEI or sustainability policies because “they are actually critical to our business,” stating DEI is “about talent and that's been our focus.” Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins told Axios “a diverse workforce is better” because “there’s too much business value.” Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing said at a press conference the company stands “firmly behind” its “integral” DEI programs, stating the company can “see how Deutsche Bank has benefited from it.” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said at a press conference ahead of Super Bowl LIX the NFL—which requires teams to interview at least two minority candidates for vacant head coach, general manager and coordinator positions as part of its broader commitment to diversity—will continue its diversity efforts “because we’ve not only convinced ourselves, I think we’ve proven ... that it does make the NFL better.” Coca-Cola warned in an annual filing that abandoning DEI could hurt business, stating its diverse employee base “helps drive a culture of inclusion, innovation and growth,” and if the company’s employees don’t reflect the “broad range of consumers and markets we serve around the world, our business could be negatively affected.”

How Are Trump’s Department Of Justice And Pam Bondi Targeting Dei?

Shortly after being sworn in, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a memo to Justice Department staff stating the department will “investigate, eliminate, and penalize illegal DEI and DEIA preferences” at private companies and universities that receive federal funds. She urged the department to enforce federal civil rights laws to push private companies to roll back DEI, and cited the Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard Supreme Court case, which ended affirmative action, as cause for eliminating DEI at universities.

What Has Trump Said About Dei Programs?

In an executive order issued on the first day of his second term, President Donald Trump ordered the elimination of diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government—but it has also threatens to punish some private entities, like public companies, non-profits and universities, that use them. In his executive order, Trump slammed the “infiltration” of the federal government with DEI programs, citing an executive order former President Joe Biden issued on his first day in office that directed federal agencies to address racial inequities. Trump’s executive order directs federal government agencies to no longer consider diversity in hiring and revise employee training programs to gut DEI training. The order also demands the elimination of “environmental justice” offices and positions in federal agencies. During his inaugural address, Trump vowed he would “end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life,” stating he would “forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based.” Trump also signed an executive order eliminating DEI offices and policies within the military, Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security, which he considered to be “race-based and sex-based discrimination,” and in a separate executive order, effectively reinstated his 2017 ban on transgender troops, banning “identification-based pronoun usage” and prohibiting troops assigned male at birth from using women’s bathing or sleeping facilities.

What Did Ceos—and Trump—say About Dei At Davos?

Several business leaders addressed diversity, equity and inclusion at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, while Trump railed against it in his speech. In his address, Trump said his administration is moving to “abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense” in both the government and the private sector, and said the United States will become a “merit-based country.” But some CEOs who attended the forum this week defended the practice, CNBC reported, including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who said his company will “continue to reach out to the Black community and Hispanic community, LGBT community, and the veteran community.”

What Is The National Center For Public Policy Research?

A conservative think tank, the group pushes shareholder resolutions at many companies that would roll back corporate DEI and environmental regulations. The group launched its Free Enterprise Project in 2007 to combat what it calls the “woke takeover of American corporate life” through these proposals. Apple previously rebuffed the National Center for Public Policy Research in 2014, when shareholders rejected a resolution that would have forced the company to disclose more about the cost effectiveness of its investments to combat climate change. Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly became visibly angry at the company’s annual meeting when a NCPPR representative asked him questions, stating the company considers more than just profitability when it invests in environmental causes. “If you want me to do things only for [return on investment] reasons, you should get out of this stock,” Cook said.

Why Are Dei Policies Under Attack?

Diversity, equity and inclusion policies—which can include employer-mandated diversity trainings, resource groups for underrepresented minorities and commitments to equity in hiring—swept corporate America after the 2020 police killing of George Floyd. But recently, these programs have faced legal and political challenges and a wave of backlash from conservative critics and free speech advocates, who consider DEI policies racist and “woke.” Billionaires Bill Ackman and Elon Musk are among the anti-DEI crusade’s most outspoken advocates. Ackman became DEI’s fiercest crusader last year when he pushed for the eventual resignation of former Harvard University President Claudine Gay after her remarks to Congress about antisemitism on campus following the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel were widely criticized. Ackman, in an essay slamming DEI, claimed he had learned Gay was hired through a Harvard presidential search process that primarily considered candidates who met certain diversity criteria, though a Harvard spokesman said DEI officers had no hiring authority. Many Republican-controlled state legislatures took action against DEI in 2024, with several states, including Alabama, Iowa and Utah banning DEI at public colleges and universities. The wave of conservative backlash against companies deemed “woke” picked up significant steam in 2023 when Bud Light became the target of a conservative boycott after it briefly collaborated with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney for a marketing promotion. The boycott tanked the beer brand’s sales and unleashed a wave of smaller copycat boycotts against companies who engaged in marketing outreach to the LGBTQ communities or voiced commitments to DEI.

Who Is Robby Starbuck?

Robby Starbuck, a former music video director, has led the charge on social media against companies that are committed to DEI policies and has orchestrated public pressure campaigns to get companies to abandon these commitments. Several of the companies that have abandoned DEI policies in recent months were targeted by Starbuck, who encouraged his followers to boycott companies including John Deere, Harley-Davidson and Lowe’s. Starbuck has claimed credit for these policy changes, stating in a post on X in November he had threatened to expose the “wokeness” at Walmart, but claimed he had “productive conversations” with the company that influenced its decision to scale back its DEI efforts. Starbuck again claimed credit for McDonald’s rolling back its DEI policies, posting on X that he had told the company he would publish a “story on woke policies there” three days before it announced its DEI policy changes.

Chief Critics

The Human Rights Campaign, whose Corporate Equality Index is a frequent casualty of the DEI policy rollbacks, criticized the anti-DEI crusade in its fall 2024 magazine as a “coordinated campaign led by the same actors who have been driving the wave of anti-LGBTQ+ legislative and legal attacks across the country.” HRC called out Starbuck for “misrepresenting” the Equality Index as a “coercive tool forcing businesses to adopt ‘woke’ policies,” instead clarifying it is a “voluntary, widely respected benchmark for LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion.” Mark Cuban has frequently defended DEI, stating in April he believes “DEI is a positive because I see its impact on bottom lines,” citing the hundreds of companies he invests in.

Key Background

Some companies slashing their DEI programs have cited the Supreme Court’s June 2023 decision, Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which ruled race-based affirmative action programs in college admissions violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

BNY beats Q1 profit estimates to kick-off 2025, helped by jump in assets under custody

In This Article:

By Jaiveer Shekhawat

-BNY beat analyst expectation for the first-quarter profit on Friday, benefiting from growth in assets under custody which led to stronger fee-based revenue streams.

The bank's fees, typically calculated as a percentage of assets under custody, benefited from the acquisition of new clients and heightened market volatility that led to investors aggressively revamping their portfolios to cushion against the impact.

Adjusted profit came at $1.58 per share, for the three months ended March 31, beating analysts estimates of $1.51 per share.

There is near- and medium-term uncertainty in both the capital market and the economy. So in times like this, the bank will position itself conservatively, said Robin Vince, BNY President and CEO in a call to reporters.

Its total fee revenue grew 3% year-on-year to $3.40 billion in the reporting quarter.

Net interest income - the spread between earnings from assets and expenditure from liabilities - rose 11% to $1.16 billion.

BNY's assets under custody and administration were $53.1 trillion in the first quarter, 9% higher than last year.

The pace of tariff news has been dizzying this week. In the latest developments, President Trump increased total tariffs on Chinese goods to 145 percent. And on Friday, China retaliated by increasing tariffs on U.S. goods to 125 percent (the tariffs imposed by China go into effect Saturday, per Bloomberg).

Manufacturers aren’t the only ones anticipating a bleak economic outlook. The combination of global tariffs (which remain in effect), a trade war with China, and general uncertainty have spooked consumers as well.

A new economic survey from the University of Michigan found that “Consumer sentiment fell for the fourth straight month, plunging 11% from March.” Notably, consumer confidence fell among Democrats, independents, and Republicans alike.

Coming up in our roadmap, that will clear the way for very clean ways of doing software and AI-native software development for IoT.
One of the takeaways from the Corai solution is “that ambient sensing was one of the key features for IoT devices.
We’ve been in the IoT market for a decade.
It worked very well with priorities for Google and we want to see how open and standards-based we could make the entire software stack.","Sally Ward-Foxton of EETimes interviewed Billy Rutledge, Goggle’s Director of Edge AI, and Nebu Philips (News - Alert) , Senior Director of Strategy and Business Development at Synaptics, about their collaboration and the future of AI, IoT Edge, and the benefits of their collaboration for developers.

In particular, the companies have collaborated on adding an open-source AI accelerator core to Synaptics’ (News - Alert) next generation of Astra line of IoT chips. For those not familiar with Synaptics Astra, paraphrasing Philips, let me highlight that the Astra platform was announced “just over a year ago and it comprises ARM (News - Alert) based SOCs with built-in AI accelerator engines that are targeted, designed, and built for the IoT.”

IoT is a fragmented market and not every application lends itself to silicon solutions, even when they are looking to impact the cost, power, or performance. Synaptics sees this as opportunity to solve the problem by developing the next generation of Astra as an “AI-native” solution – what I consider part of AIoT.

Philips continues about this next generation as a “line of processing solutions which pair very well with our connectivity portfolio that is very specifically targeted for an IoT …[and]… these different modalities, whether it’s vision, audio, or voice, graphics. All these functions are inherently becoming more AI aware. So, we want to enter the market with the right class of silicon that is built from a performance, cost, and power standpoint that is ideal for these workloads in IoT.”

To overcome the fragmentation in the market, Synaptics worked with Google (News - Alert) to create use standards “to the extent possible, and power that with open-source software.”

Synaptics Astra is now open source and publicly available on Github. Google is very well known for its commitment to create open ecosystems.

“So this current engagement for Synaptics with Google is an engineering and a research collaboration that is built and based on open source software and standards that is targeted at bringing a bit more of an order to how we do things in IoT and especially targeted at a lot of the different classes of devices, whether it is consumer, enterprise, industrial, some segments within the IoT. So, we are really excited about working with Google to sort of define and clean up a lot of these best practices so that a lot of innovative solutions can be brought out with AI built in for this space. So, it is a research collaboration, and we’re very excited about moving forward with a partner like Google on this.”

Ward-Foxton then asked the logical question: “So, why is it a collaboration and not a license? I think you mentioned a research partnership. You’re going to be working together on this, right?”

Philips responded, “That is right. As I was saying, there is a need to plug a lot of these gaps about best practices all the way from built frameworks to integrating the right kind of accelerators in a way that is scalable from low-, mid-, and high-performance tiers across the vendor portfolios. Through this research partnership and collaboration, we want to integrate these learnings into the Synaptics Astra portfolio. Coming up in our roadmap, that will clear the way for very clean ways of doing software and AI-native software development for IoT. There are a lot of things that we still need to build on and define. That’s why we’re calling it research/engineering collaboration.”

At Ward-Foxton’s request Rutldge explains, “Open Se Cura is an effort that we started in 2022 into 2023, and it comes on the heels of an earlier research program that we launched called coral.ai, which was a brand that centers on hardware components and software tools to experiment with bringing AI to edge devices for the first time. The goal of that project was to learn what people might do with this technology if it was affordable and easy to use. Coral is still there today and it’s still selling, and we’re excited about what it’s doing for the IoT markets.”

Corai is stable and no longer a research project for Google, so ASUS, which worked with Google on the project, manages the solution today.

One of the takeaways from the Corai solution is “that ambient sensing was one of the key features for IoT devices. So, basically, giving devices on the edge the ability to see and hear at human level sensing, using the edge chip ASIC that we had in that portfolio. Some of the feedback that we heard in addition to that was, the device ecosystem and the neural processing units that people are talking about are very fragmented. For developers, it’s quite difficult to build a model and compile it down through the various tool chain components to land something on an architecture. Even when you’re able to do that, the model might behave in different ways with different performances or different accuracy.”

Rutledge continued, noting that Google Research “wanted to try to affect the broader ecosystem by providing a new version of our work, which is soft IP, to try to unlock this ambient sensing use case specifically, but do it in a way that’s open source, using open hardware as well as open software, and packaging it to be commercial ready, so that any silicon company can pick it up and use it as a front end to what they might be building. So, the overall effort is really about just making it easier for developers to build on edge devices and, obviously, we would like to see them use Google services on the back end, which is important for our company. But there’s no lock-in. It’s completely open, and it can operate kind of across the board with a lot of open source technologies..Private ambient sensing is the theme of Open Se Cura, and the goal of that project was to release system designs that have not just the machine learning accelerator component, but also an architecture that provides the right level of security guarantees to build user trust. So, as devices are aware of your surroundings, they see what you see. They hear what you hear.”

Rutledge explains that, “with Synaptics, we’re talking about the Kelvin component – that’s the name of the open source machine accelerator project that we’re promoting, with Synaptics being the first commercial adopter.”

Ward-Foxton drills down and clarifies that Kelvin, is “a RISC-V CPU that’s part of Open Se Cura, but can you give us a few more details about Kelvin itself?”

Rutledge goes on to say that Google “decided to build Kelvin, again, as soft IP that’s open so that anyone could take it and extend it, really as an attempt to try to de-fragment the ecosystem of MPUs. We are members of the RISC-V consortium, and we try to participate in driving the ISA extensions for different parts of RISC-V. So, Kelvin is actually a way of implementing those extensions that we’ve helped contribute to and bringing them forward in a specific way for a specific purpose. Kelvin is a very small machine learning accelerator. With the Coral portfolio, we had an edge GPU that was four teraOPS of performance at a low power budget at the time. Here we’re shrinking it down even further. This is in the range of 5 or 12 GOPS, so a fraction of that, and we’re starting really, really small, just to try to affect a market that we think is growing across the ecosystem, and that’s wearable devices, which are likely to be the front end for the new generative AI experiences that the world is excited about. But, Kelvin, as a design, is really open, and it can be adjusted in different ways to achieve bigger performance, higher scale. So, it’s an architecture that is quite flexible for other use cases – starting small and giving people the right information to customize it, extend it, to really tailor it for the industry that they might be targeting, whether it’s transportation all the way down to, say, medical devices or wearables for consumer interest.”

Ward-Foxton then asks Rutledge if Synaptics is the first implementer of Kelvin, and Billy explains that Google released version one in November of 2023.

“You can go to the Github repo, pull down the Rtail, build cover yourself, and run it on an FPGA board spec that we provided. We did do a test chip in real silicon with one of our silicon services providers as part of our commercial readiness program. So, it has been proven in real silicon. But, with Synaptics, they are the first to adopt it into a commercial line that will be taken to market.”

Rutldge adds that Google “selected Synaptics to be our flagship partner for a number of reasons. We have a long history with Synaptics and are excited about what we can do together as a team. Their specialization in low power and interest in IoT and wearable devices align with what we would like to pursue. But, we encourage everyone to take a look at it and our hope is that by partnering with all the silicon companies that are building MPUs in small form factors, we can help lower the barrier for developers to build models for these devices.”

Ward-Foxton bring Philips back into the conversation about the collaboration and he explains, “To Billy’s point earlier, I think there was quite a good overlap in the market focus and the device and the form factor focus for both companies, from Billy’s team at Google and for Synaptics. We’ve been in the IoT market for a decade. We understand the space quite well and we’ve had AI accelerators built in into our silicon since 2018. So, that’s been supporting some of our vertical markets. What we have done as part of making Astra a broader platform is to take on the learnings from how we have done that for certain targeted vertical markets and open it up to a broader base, supplemented with open-source AI frameworks. Again, to Billy’s point earlier, if you look at the whole software and the stack, the language around models and frameworks, and driven by companies like Google, that’s becoming a lot more common. You can talk about the TensorFlow ecosystem. You can talk about PyTorch or Onyx. That language is becoming a bit more common. But, the moment you step into the world of models, into how you compile them, it becomes very fragmented. You know that experience sort of breaks every inherited license, and nothing is that open about these compilers just yet. Even a lot of silicon vendors have their own tooling. So, that is an area that we addressed very early on. It worked very well with priorities for Google and we want to see how open and standards-based we could make the entire software stack.

I cannot recommend EE Times enough, but particularly I appreciate the insights I gain by reading Foxton-Ward’s work. My take on this effort is it is a noble aspiration, and certainly medical wearables are on the rise, but as a market in itself, it is as fragmented as trying to find an effective treatment for dysautonomia (look it up).

Cloud Starbucks location successfully unionized earlier this year.","Sartell Starbucks workers successfully voted to unionize, becoming the 14th store in Minnesota to do so.

Workers cited desires for better compensation, scheduling improvements, and equity as reasons for unionizing.

Current hourly wages at the Sartell store range from $15.75 to $17.88, below the MIT calculated living wage for the area.

This follows a successful unionization effort at a St. Cloud Starbucks earlier this year.

SARTELL — Workers at a Sartell Starbucks announced on Friday that their efforts to unionize were successful.

The store at Highway 15 and Riverside Avenue South is the 14th Minnesota Starbucks location to unionize, according to the announcement.

""When we were first hired, Starbucks claimed we were partners, and the majority of us are happy being partners,"" barista Connor St. Aubin said in a release. ""We love working with each other, and the job is pretty fun. But we’ve more than earned our keep, and my fellow partners and I believe we deserve more for the hard work we put in for Starbucks.""

Sartell barista's are joining more than 570 stores that already unionized in 45 states and Washington, D.C. Unionization efforts at Starbucks involved more than 11,000 employees working toward issues of compensation, scheduling and racial and gender equity.

The hourly pay rate for a barista at the Sartell Starbucks is $15.75 to $17.88 per hour, according to an online job posting. The Sartell location's address is 1608 Crossing Loop.

Starbucks wages fall short when compared to the living wage in the St. Cloud area. According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a single adult without children needs to earn $20.63 per hour to meet basic living expenses, while each adult in a two-parent, two-child household would need to earn $30.65 per hour.

The downtown St. Cloud Starbucks location successfully unionized earlier this year.

""Just having a voice in our own workplace, in our schedule, in our hours, making sure every partner feels safe and welcome, like they can have a career here,"" barista Courtney Fahland of the St. Cloud store previously told the St. Cloud Times.

With roots dating back to 1784, BNY is one of the oldest banks in the world. But in recent years, it's been betting big on some of the newest financial technologies. In 2022, BNY launched a product offering direct custody of cryptocurrencies, starting with bitcoin.

That product ran into a regulatory roadblock from the Biden-era Securities and Exchange Commission, which required custodians to list crypto assets as a liability on their balance sheets. Under Trump, however, the SEC quickly dropped that rule.

The reversal, which came less than a week after Trump's inauguration, was so sudden that it caused some whiplash during a recent interview with one of BNY's executives. At a conference hosted by UBS in February, Emily Portney, BNY's head of asset servicing, said the bank was proud to be ""one of the very few institutions"" that can have custody of digital assets.

That prompted a puzzled reaction from the moderator, UBS analyst Brennan Hawken. ""I thought that was against the rules,"" Hawken said.

He started his career at Google back in 2006, when data science as a field was in its early days, then worked on Facebook’s ad sales.","When Dr. David Reese, Amgen’s first chief technology officer, set about hiring a head of artificial intelligence last year, he looked at people who’d worked in consumer products, finance and other areas. He ended up finding one in shoes. Last August, he brought on Sean Bruich, who’d spent the past 11 years of his career working at Nike, as senior vice president for AI and data, a move that might seem almost laughably incongruous.

“When I was in discussions with him, we were having dinner one evening, and he said, ‘I’m not a molecular biologist or a chemist or anything like that,’” Reese told Forbes. “I said, ‘We’ve got those, they are really good, among the best in the world, and we need what you can bring to the table.”

Like both its peer Big Pharma companies and smaller biotech startups, Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen is counting on AI to both speed up the process of drug discovery and make its operations more efficient. But most of the best data scientists aren’t working in healthcare–at least not yet. So Bruich’s career path took him from Google to Facebook to Nike before he landed at Amgen, the $151 billion (market cap) developer of blockbuster drugs like Enbrel for autoimmune diseases and Repatha for lowering ‘bad’ cholesterol.

In his role at Amgen, Bruich is responsible for accelerating its AI and data science across everything from protein folding, which is a key element of drug design, to regulatory filings. “My job is to figure out how to scale these things from proof points to systems that operate at enterprise levels,” Bruich said. While biology may be new to him, the underlying data science is not.

“There are many skeptics out there. They are going to be wrong.”

Dr. David Reese, Amgen’s chief technology officer

Life sciences is generally further behind in adopting AI than tech companies or financial services firms, which have long been incorporating AI into their operations. So Amgen isn’t alone in hiring from outside of the industry, said Joni Noel, co-head of global healthcare and life sciences at executive search firm ZRG Partners. “All I see is hires that come from elsewhere,” she said.

Reese sees enormous promise for the use of AI and data science in healthcare–despite the equally enormous complexity. “There are many skeptics out there. They are going to be wrong,” he said.

An oncologist by training who was previously Amgen’s executive vice president of research and development, Reese believes that recent advances in AI technology have created “a once-in-a-generation moment that will ultimately change this industry.”

Reese has said that he wants to use AI to increase the success rates in drug discovery and to shorten the time it takes for a drug to progress from the lab to commercial approval. It currently takes at least 10 years and costs an average of $2.6 billion to bring a drug from initial discovery to approval, according to the trade group PhRMA. AI has the potential to cut years off that timetable. Reese also sees potential for AI in what he calls “the unsung hero of all this”—automating its plants.

Last year, Amgen installed an Nvidia supercomputer at its deCode genetics subsidiary in Reykjavik, Iceland, where it is using that compute power to mine massive amounts of genetic information in hopes of finding new treatments. This could be particularly helpful for diseases that are complicated on a molecular level, such as autoimmune diseases like lupus, Reese said. “It’s one of my core beliefs that it is only through AI and its computational power that you have any hope of sorting that out.”

“This the moment to be in biotech and I am a science dork so I get it.”

Sean Bruich, Amgen’s senior vice president for AI and data

Bruich may be new to healthcare, but not to the complexity of data or the partnerships that big companies form to speed up AI’s adoption. He started his career at Google back in 2006, when data science as a field was in its early days, then worked on Facebook’s ad sales. Then, at Nike, he was in charge of the efforts to digitally power the company’s internal operations through data-driven measurement and forecasting.

“Between working on the Facebook algorithms and going to Nike and building out their direct-to-consumer stack and customer experiences that are personalized algorithms, that’s the expertise that I’m going to apply first,” he said. “At Nike, we were teaching marketers to do digital marketing and teaching business leaders to use data.”

While there’s a big difference between selling running shoes and hoodies and developing drugs, Bruich figures that while the biology is new to him, the technology that underpins the work cuts across industries. “Not only is this the moment to be in biotech and I am a science dork so I get it, but he [Reese] has built something really different by bringing together the science and the technology in a different way,” he said.

How is everyone feeling? If your neck is smarting from whiplash… I would not blame you. One week after President Trump announced sweeping tariffs that roiled global markets and pushed odds of a U.S. recession higher, he reversed course on Wednesday, saying he would institute a 90-day pause on most tariffs—though 10% levies do remain and the size of the tariff on Chinese products is increasing by the day.

Within this environment, consumers and entrepreneurs (and really, all people in general) are reeling. I spoke to one female founder who’s facing a doubling of her supply costs, because her primary supplier is in China. Going with an American manufacturer instead is not an option, she says, because these manufacturers would increase her supply costs by fourfold. And yet, she’s taking creative approaches to future-proofing her business, opening a crowdfunding campaign and partnering with other small businesses in her area to help cut costs.

Other entrepreneurs are looking to the recent past as proof that moments of economic disruption can also be moments of opportunity—let’s not forget that companies like Uber, Venmo, WhatsApp and Cloudflare were all started during or right after the 2008 financial crisis—and advise their fellow business owners to stay as “nimble” as possible.

Exclusive Forbes Investigation: Inside The Epic Battle Between Danone And Lifeway Foods—And Its Squabbling Founding Family

The publicly traded kefir company Lifeway is fighting a takeover by the French dairy giant, its partner of more than 25 years. But for CEO Julie Smolyansky, the Ukraine-born daughter of Lifeway's founder, it’s personal—and her mom and brother are not on her side. “I come from a long line of survivors in the Soviet Union, a land of war, scarcity and famine,” says Smolyansky, noting that her grandmother lived through the 1941 Babyn Yar massacre in Kyiv. “All of my ancestors are with me and they're helping me. I have an obligation to continue to fight and survive.”

On Thursday, Forbes released its seventh annual AI 50 list, produced in partnership with Sequoia and Meritech Capital and spotlighting the most promising privately-held AI companies in the world. Among those companies is Writer, which was founded by May Habib and has raised some $320 million from top venture capitalists. Its November $200 million round valued the company at $1.9 billion; Habib retains an estima­ted 15% stake worth $285 million.

New York-based Jones just raised $10 million to expand its nicotine lozenge company in the stodgy, $3 billion smoking cessation market.

While Dick’s Sporting Goods stock has fallen amid Trump’s tariff wars, its strong five-year performance (up more than 850% in that time) has propelled the fortune of longtime Dick’s CEO Dick Stack’s ex-wife, Denise Prenosil. By holding onto some 4 million common shares of Dick’s stock after her divorce from Stack, Prenosil is now worth an estimated $1 billion and is one of the richest women in America.

Margaret Spellings, who served as Education Secretary under President George W. Bush, spoke to Forbes about her response to President Trump attempting to shut down the Department of Education. “I have a lot of questions about it,” she says.

Congress passed a bill this week that could make it harder for millions of American women to exercise their right to vote. The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act would require people registering to vote or updating their voter registration to show documents in person proving American citizenship. But the 69 million married women in America who have taken their spouse’s last name and don’t have a birth certificate matching their legal name could face hurdles when registering to vote or updating their voter registration.

The Checklist

1. Take an implicit association test. Studies show that women are subject to more negative stereotypes at work than their male counterparts. I discussed this with Mika Brzezinski and Huma Abedin today for a Know Your Value segment, and I’ll share here what I said on air: To combat stereotypes at work, we should all become aware of our implicit biases, and we can do that by taking ForbesWomen contributor Lindsay Kohler’s advice and doing an implicit association assessment.

2. Handle the responsibilities you never asked for. Whether by curse of competence (IYKYK) or sheer business emergency, you might find yourself managing tasks you never asked for. Here’s how to navigate the unwanted work.

3. Turn to the stars. A new survey of 2,000 Millennials and Gen-Z workers reveals that 63% believe astrology has positively impacted their careers (either through checking colleagues’ zodiac signs and consulting the stars over job offers). Will you align your career moves with the cosmic cycles?

Trump says he wants to slash the U.S. trade deficit and achieve what he calls ""energy dominance.""
The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said the U.S. had a goods trade deficit of $235.6 billion with the EU in 2024.
""They're going to have to buy our energy from us, because they need it,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.
The European Union, Japan and South Korea are already major purchasers of U.S. LNG.","President Donald Trump has opened a potential pathway for trade partners to avoid higher tariffs — buy more energy from the U.S.

Trump paused ""reciprocal"" tariffs on countries except China on Wednesday in an attempt to pull back from a full-blown global trade war. Most nations now face a base tariff rate of 10% and have a three-month period to negotiate bilateral deals with the U.S. to avoid higher duties on their goods.

Trump says he wants to slash the U.S. trade deficit and achieve what he calls ""energy dominance."" He linked those two goals Monday, demanding that the European Union buy $350 billion of American energy to erase its trade surplus with the U.S. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said the U.S. had a goods trade deficit of $235.6 billion with the EU in 2024.

""They're going to have to buy our energy from us, because they need it,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. ""We can knock off $350 billion in one week,"" the president said. The European Union faces a 20% tariff rate if it does not reach a deal with Trump.

The U.S. is the largest oil and gas producer in the world. It is the third-largest crude exporter and the largest liquefied natural gas exporter in the world. Energy represented about 15% of total U.S. exports in 2024, according to research from Barclays.

LNG is ""the commodity where there's room for countries to increase their energy imports from the US,"" Barclays analysts led by Betty Jiang told clients in a Tuesday note.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday that a potential investment by Japan, South Korea and Taiwan in a flagship LNG project in Alaska could form the basis of a deal with those countries. They would provide financing for the project and also purchase a significant amount of LNG from it, Bessent said.

""That could be an alternative for them to come forward with that because not only would that provide a lot of American jobs, but it would narrow the trade deficit,"" the Treasury secretary said. Japan faces a 24% tariff rate and South Korea a 25% rate if they don't clinch deals with U.S.

Trump has sought to boost U.S. LNG exports since taking office, with a focus on developing Alaska's resources. He issued an executive order on his first day in office prioritizing LNG development in the state and singled out the Alaska LNG project in his address to Congress in March.

The proposed Alaska LNG project would transport natural gas from the state's North Slope through an 807-mile pipeline south to a liquefaction facility at Nikiski on the Cook Inlet for export to Asia. It would cost more than $40 billion to complete, according to a 2018 estimate from one of the developers, Alaska Gasline Development.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told a conference in Houston last month that the Trump administration views the project as crucial to U.S. energy security and independence.

The European Union, Japan and South Korea are already major purchasers of U.S. LNG. The EU bought 39% of U.S. LNG exports in 2024, followed by Japan at 7%, South Korea at 6% and India at 5%, Barclays said.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108092029-1737729186528-108092029-1737729039959-gettyimages-2193208056-dscf2361.jpg?v=1744309322&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-04-11 20:03:48.887738

One of the takeaways from the Corai solution is “that ambient sensing was one of the key features for IoT devices.
We’ve been in the IoT market for a decade.
It worked very well with priorities for Google and we want to see how open and standards-based we could make the entire software stack.","Sally Ward-Foxton of EETimes interviewed Billy Rutledge, Goggle’s Director of Edge AI, and Nebu Philips, Senior Director of Strategy and Business Development at Synaptics, about their collaboration and the future of AI, IoT Edge, and the benefits of their collaboration for developers.

In particular, the companies have collaborated on adding an open-source AI accelerator core to Synaptics’ next generation of Astra line of IoT chips. For those not familiar with Synaptics Astra, paraphrasing Philips, let me highlight that the Astra platform was announced “just over a year ago and it comprises ARM based SOCs with built-in AI accelerator engines that are targeted, designed, and built for the IoT.”

IoT is a fragmented market and not every application lends itself to silicon solutions, even when they are looking to impact the cost, power, or performance. Synaptics sees this as opportunity to solve the problem by developing the next generation of Astra as an “AI-native” solution – what I consider part of AIoT.

Philips continues about this next generation as a “line of processing solutions which pair very well with our connectivity portfolio that is very specifically targeted for an IoT …[and]… these different modalities, whether it’s vision, audio, or voice, graphics. All these functions are inherently becoming more AI aware. So, we want to enter the market with the right class of silicon that is built from a performance, cost, and power standpoint that is ideal for these workloads in IoT.”

To overcome the fragmentation in the market, Synaptics worked with Google to create use standards “to the extent possible, and power that with open-source software.”

Synaptics Astra is now open source and publicly available on Github. Google is very well known for its commitment to create open ecosystems.

“So this current engagement for Synaptics with Google is an engineering and a research collaboration that is built and based on open source software and standards that is targeted at bringing a bit more of an order to how we do things in IoT and especially targeted at a lot of the different classes of devices, whether it is consumer, enterprise, industrial, some segments within the IoT. So, we are really excited about working with Google to sort of define and clean up a lot of these best practices so that a lot of innovative solutions can be brought out with AI built in for this space. So, it is a research collaboration, and we’re very excited about moving forward with a partner like Google on this.”

Ward-Foxton then asked the logical question: “So, why is it a collaboration and not a license? I think you mentioned a research partnership. You’re going to be working together on this, right?”

Philips responded, “That is right. As I was saying, there is a need to plug a lot of these gaps about best practices all the way from built frameworks to integrating the right kind of accelerators in a way that is scalable from low-, mid-, and high-performance tiers across the vendor portfolios. Through this research partnership and collaboration, we want to integrate these learnings into the Synaptics Astra portfolio. Coming up in our roadmap, that will clear the way for very clean ways of doing software and AI-native software development for IoT. There are a lot of things that we still need to build on and define. That’s why we’re calling it research/engineering collaboration.”

At Ward-Foxton’s request Rutldge explains, “Open Se Cura is an effort that we started in 2022 into 2023, and it comes on the heels of an earlier research program that we launched called coral.ai, which was a brand that centers on hardware components and software tools to experiment with bringing AI to edge devices for the first time. The goal of that project was to learn what people might do with this technology if it was affordable and easy to use. Coral is still there today and it’s still selling, and we’re excited about what it’s doing for the IoT markets.”

Corai is stable and no longer a research project for Google, so ASUS, which worked with Google on the project, manages the solution today.

One of the takeaways from the Corai solution is “that ambient sensing was one of the key features for IoT devices. So, basically, giving devices on the edge the ability to see and hear at human level sensing, using the edge chip ASIC that we had in that portfolio. Some of the feedback that we heard in addition to that was, the device ecosystem and the neural processing units that people are talking about are very fragmented. For developers, it’s quite difficult to build a model and compile it down through the various tool chain components to land something on an architecture. Even when you’re able to do that, the model might behave in different ways with different performances or different accuracy.”

Rutledge continued, noting that Google Research “wanted to try to affect the broader ecosystem by providing a new version of our work, which is soft IP, to try to unlock this ambient sensing use case specifically, but do it in a way that’s open source, using open hardware as well as open software, and packaging it to be commercial ready, so that any silicon company can pick it up and use it as a front end to what they might be building. So, the overall effort is really about just making it easier for developers to build on edge devices and, obviously, we would like to see them use Google services on the back end, which is important for our company. But there’s no lock-in. It’s completely open, and it can operate kind of across the board with a lot of open source technologies..Private ambient sensing is the theme of Open Se Cura, and the goal of that project was to release system designs that have not just the machine learning accelerator component, but also an architecture that provides the right level of security guarantees to build user trust. So, as devices are aware of your surroundings, they see what you see. They hear what you hear.”

Rutledge explains that, “with Synaptics, we’re talking about the Kelvin component – that’s the name of the open source machine accelerator project that we’re promoting, with Synaptics being the first commercial adopter.”

Ward-Foxton drills down and clarifies that Kelvin, is “a RISC-V CPU that’s part of Open Se Cura, but can you give us a few more details about Kelvin itself?”

Rutledge goes on to say that Google “decided to build Kelvin, again, as soft IP that’s open so that anyone could take it and extend it, really as an attempt to try to de-fragment the ecosystem of MPUs. We are members of the RISC-V consortium, and we try to participate in driving the ISA extensions for different parts of RISC-V. So, Kelvin is actually a way of implementing those extensions that we’ve helped contribute to and bringing them forward in a specific way for a specific purpose. Kelvin is a very small machine learning accelerator. With the Coral portfolio, we had an edge GPU that was four teraOPS of performance at a low power budget at the time. Here we’re shrinking it down even further. This is in the range of 5 or 12 GOPS, so a fraction of that, and we’re starting really, really small, just to try to affect a market that we think is growing across the ecosystem, and that’s wearable devices, which are likely to be the front end for the new generative AI experiences that the world is excited about. But, Kelvin, as a design, is really open, and it can be adjusted in different ways to achieve bigger performance, higher scale. So, it’s an architecture that is quite flexible for other use cases – starting small and giving people the right information to customize it, extend it, to really tailor it for the industry that they might be targeting, whether it’s transportation all the way down to, say, medical devices or wearables for consumer interest.”

Ward-Foxton then asks Rutledge if Synaptics is the first implementer of Kelvin, and Billy explains that Google released version one in November of 2023.

“You can go to the Github repo, pull down the Rtail, build cover yourself, and run it on an FPGA board spec that we provided. We did do a test chip in real silicon with one of our silicon services providers as part of our commercial readiness program. So, it has been proven in real silicon. But, with Synaptics, they are the first to adopt it into a commercial line that will be taken to market.”

Rutldge adds that Google “selected Synaptics to be our flagship partner for a number of reasons. We have a long history with Synaptics and are excited about what we can do together as a team. Their specialization in low power and interest in IoT and wearable devices align with what we would like to pursue. But, we encourage everyone to take a look at it and our hope is that by partnering with all the silicon companies that are building MPUs in small form factors, we can help lower the barrier for developers to build models for these devices.”

Ward-Foxton bring Philips back into the conversation about the collaboration and he explains, “To Billy’s point earlier, I think there was quite a good overlap in the market focus and the device and the form factor focus for both companies, from Billy’s team at Google and for Synaptics. We’ve been in the IoT market for a decade. We understand the space quite well and we’ve had AI accelerators built in into our silicon since 2018. So, that’s been supporting some of our vertical markets. What we have done as part of making Astra a broader platform is to take on the learnings from how we have done that for certain targeted vertical markets and open it up to a broader base, supplemented with open-source AI frameworks. Again, to Billy’s point earlier, if you look at the whole software and the stack, the language around models and frameworks, and driven by companies like Google, that’s becoming a lot more common. You can talk about the TensorFlow ecosystem. You can talk about PyTorch or Onyx. That language is becoming a bit more common. But, the moment you step into the world of models, into how you compile them, it becomes very fragmented. You know that experience sort of breaks every inherited license, and nothing is that open about these compilers just yet. Even a lot of silicon vendors have their own tooling. So, that is an area that we addressed very early on. It worked very well with priorities for Google and we want to see how open and standards-based we could make the entire software stack.

I cannot recommend EE Times enough, but particularly I appreciate the insights I gain by reading Foxton-Ward’s work. My take on this effort is it is a noble aspiration, and certainly medical wearables are on the rise, but as a market in itself, it is as fragmented as trying to find an effective treatment for dysautonomia (look it up).

Agilent grows in Colorado Additions in Frederick will add about 160 roles to the 500-plus people working at the facility now, Unterreiner confirmed.
The Frederick facility opened in 2019 alongside a surge in oligo medicines in development.
How oligos are made Inside the Agilent manufacturing labs, the first step of building oligos involves an automated synthesizer, which helps to build the molecules one base at a time.
Between the company's Boulder and Frederick facilities, Agilent produces close to one metric ton of oligos per year, Unterreiner said.","Agilent Technologies Inc. is gearing up to hire employees as soon as next year to support a facility expansion in Frederick that will double its manufacturing capacity.

The bioscience giant announced plans in 2023 for a $725 million investment that will add 198,000 square feet, including two manufacturing lines, at its 20-acre property in southwest Weld County. Agilent (NYSE: A) said that plans to expand production in 2027 have only grown more urgent with the rising popularity of the pharmaceutical ingredients that it makes.

Locally, the Santa Clara, California-based company produces therapeutic nucleic acids, or oligonucleotides (oligos for short). Agilent makes these molecules — the active ingredients in drugs that treat illnesses such as cancer or cardiovascular disease — for clients that range from small biotech enterprises to the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.

Because of the way oligos react at a molecular level, they can operate in the body more precisely than mechanisms used in legacy pharmaceutical products.

For that reason, drugs made with oligos more effectively treat patients with some diseases than those without, said Blake Unterreiner, vice president and general manager of Agilent’s Nucleic Acid Solutions Division.

""We're able to go upstream and make a more meaningful outcome in a human body with this type of medicine,"" he said.

The ability to achieve such accuracy means drugmakers increasingly want oligos in their medicines.

Unterreiner joined Agilent in 2007, before any business was producing oligos commercially, he said. Since then, the company has grown from producing zero oligos to manufacturing six varieties for its pharmaceutical clients. Agilent is preparing to commercially produce at least another eight to 10 over the next two years, he said.

""We absolutely need our Frederick expansion to stay on track,"" Unterreiner said.

Agilent grows in Colorado

Additions in Frederick will add about 160 roles to the 500-plus people working at the facility now, Unterreiner confirmed. He said the company expects to open the two new lines by 2027 and will likely begin hiring next year to get ahead of training new engineers and other specialists.

Colorado Economic Development Commission in 2022 approved $1.79 million in job growth tax credits for the project if Agilent hires all 160 roles over a five-year period.

Agilent says it works with scientists across 110 countries to support life sciences with research, patient diagnostics and safety testing. The company, which spun off from Hewlett Packard in 1999, reported net revenue of $6.51 billion in fiscal year 2024 and employs 18,000 people worldwide.

In Colorado, the company has facilities in Boulder and Frederick that support the oligo-production side of Agilent's business. Unterreiner said the Boulder site has been producing oligos since 2006. The Frederick facility opened in 2019 alongside a surge in oligo medicines in development.

Agilent's local leaders said that the company's $925 million acquisition of Canadian drug manufacturer Biovectra in 2024 will help it capture more clients and will likely push demand for oligos even higher.

How oligos are made

Inside the Agilent manufacturing labs, the first step of building oligos involves an automated synthesizer, which helps to build the molecules one base at a time. The starting materials for each of the bases most often come in a freeze-dried powder that is dissolved in a solvent, Unterreiner said. Once the molecules are built, they need to be cut from their support mechanism and purified.

After that, they go through a process called lyophilization, or freeze-drying, and are usually packed in high-density polyethylene bottles and wrapped in foil. Most of Agilent's shipments are in temperature-controlled vessels that keep them at 15 below zero or 20 below zero degrees Celsius, Unterreiner said.

To make it all happen, he said, Agilent employs people in business development and finance, as well as engineers, analytical roles and quality assurance.

Between the company's Boulder and Frederick facilities, Agilent produces close to one metric ton of oligos per year, Unterreiner said. That quantity should double once the expansion is complete.

Unterreiner said he is excited about the potential for oligos production to grow more widely accepted and to be used for physical afflictions that affect larger populations of people, such as cardiovascular disease.

""It is just amazing to see the promise of this type of therapy finally starting to get realized and validated in the market,"" he said, ""and to actually see patients benefiting from that.""

Science Corner

What sets oligos apart?

Oligos treat diseases by bonding with mRNA, which is the molecule that transports genetic information from DNA to cells in the body that carry out essential functions, Unterreiner said. The tiny molecule targets how specific genetic information is communicated and executed in the body, whereas legacy pharmaceuticals target proteins at the end of that DNA communication process, he said — allowing oligos to be more precise.",https://media.bizj.us/view/img/12955633/agilent-frederick-site-4*1200xx5550-3122-0-567.jpg,N,,2025-04-11 23:02:37.456733

Major pharmacy chains CVS and Walgreens are slashing store counts by the thousands, yanking critical lifelines from patients across the country.

Health experts have warned the cuts, combined with President Donald Trump’s looming pharmaceutical tariffs, could send drug costs skyrocketing and worsen dangerous medication shortages.

The closures are already hitting underserved communities hardest, fueling the rise of so-called ""pharmacy deserts.""

'PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS'

Over 26,000 pharmacies have disappeared in just over a decade, a brutal 29% drop, according to Kavelle Christie, a healthcare policy expert.

Drugmakers depend heavily on international production for key ingredients and manufacturing, especially for cheaper generics made in China and India, reported CNBC.

""This is not just a business trend; it’s a public health crisis,"" Christie told The U.S. Sun in an exclusive interview.

The impact has left 15.8 million people nearly 5% of the US population, with ""extremely limited"" access to medications, vaccines, and healthcare services, she warned.

CVS has already shuttered 900 locations over the past three years and plans to axe another 270 stores by the end of this year.

The pharmacy giant claims the cuts are ""strategic"" and tied to shifting consumer habits, population trends, and overlapping store locations.

""We’re closing locations strategically to better meet consumers’ health, wellness and pharmacy care needs,"" CVS said.

SOUTHERN STATES HIT HARD

Walgreens has slashed more than 1,000 stores since 2018 and is on track to shut down another 1,300 in the next three years.

Meanwhile, struggling rival Rite Aid is in talks to sell itself to private equity firm Sycamore Partners after exiting bankruptcy last fall.

Closures are hitting southern states especially hard, Christie said, pointing to Mississippi and Louisiana as some of the worst-affected.

Many of the areas losing stores are left with no nearby options for essential medication and pharmacist consultations.

""The impact is devastating, especially for people managing chronic conditions, pregnant individuals, and those relying on regular prescriptions for their health,"" Christie added.

While California and New York have slowed closures with laws requiring pharmacy benefit managers to be more transparent about pricing and reimbursements, other states remain vulnerable.

Meanwhile, branded drugmakers may fare better under tariffs, since they typically have higher profit margins and more US-based production.

DRUG SHORTAGE RISE

On the national level, Trump’s tariff push could add to the panic.

The president plans to slap “major” tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, claiming it will bring drug manufacturing back to the US.

He said the move would not be reversed, even as he rolled back other industry-wide duties this week.

Experts say the duties could disrupt an already fragile supply chain and lead to higher costs for patients.

""We are already in a state where prescription drugs are unaffordable to many,"" Mariana Socal, a health policy professor at Johns Hopkins told CNBC.

""Anything that we change, any trade policies, any tariff policies, anything that further increases the cost of prescription drugs, be it in the supply chain, the distribution network, risks increasing costs to the consumer even further and just worsening the affordability crisis for drugs in America that we’ve had for a long time,"" she added.

Branded drugs with patents could get even more expensive, experts say, because manufacturers can easily pass on the extra cost to patients.

It’s still unclear what Trump’s tariffs will look like.

A patient with a 20% coinsurance rate could see their monthly out-of-pocket expenses rise if tariffs are imposed since their share of the cost is directly tied to the branded drug’s price, reported CNBC.

Some generic drugs may vanish altogether as companies exit the US market due to squeezed margins, she warned.

Shortages of critical medications already at record highs could grow worse, particularly for injectables like IV saline, chemotherapy, and lidocaine.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/04/ch-drug-prices-off-platform.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-04-11 18:04:23.734877

Novartis will substantially expand its U.S. footprint, announcing Thursday plans to spend $23 billion over five years to build six new factories, expand three existing ones and add a new research and development hub.

The Swiss drugmaker said its expansion will allow it to manufacture all of the medicine intended for U.S. patients in the country, at a time when President Donald Trump’s tariff policies have thrown global trading plans into turmoil. Novartis follows Eli Lilly, Merck & Co. and Johnson & Johnson in rolling out new capital expenditure initiatives as Trump pressures major corporations to bring manufacturing to the U.S.

Novartis’ plan appears to reverse some of the company’s recent pullback in the U.S., including closure of an R&D hub in San Diego — the announced site of the new U.S. R&D site — and shutdown of sites in North Carolina, Colorado, and Illinois. The company has disclosed closure of seven manufacturing sites between 2021 and 2024.

Dive Insight:

Novartis’ expansion will substantially boost its capital spending, which has run around $1 billion the past several years. It will also broaden Novartis’ commercial footprint, adding six new facilities to the 12 it already has. In the U.S., it currently lists its subsidiary headquarters in New Jersey, an R&D hub in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and plants in Indianapolis and New Jersey.

Novartis said it will build two new plants to manufacture radiopharmaceuticals like its cancer drugs Pluvicto and Lutathera in Florida and in Texas, as well as expand existing plants in Indianapolis, Millburn, New Jersey, and Carlsbad, California.

The sites for four facilities haven’t been determined yet. Three will make biologic drug substances, products, devices and packages, while the fourth will make chemical drug substances, pills and packaging.

Already, Novartis relies on U.S. sites to make some of its most complex medicines, such as cell and gene therapies. With the new investment, it will locate some of its antisense oligonucleotide drug manufacturing in the U.S. for the first time.

Novartis will also establish a $1.1 billion “biomedical research innovation hub” in San Diego. That site is due to open between 2028 and 2029.

“These investments will enable us to fully bring our supply chain and key technology platforms into the U.S. to support our strong U.S. growth outlook,” said CEO Vas Narasimhan, in a statement.

He also said the company is well-positioned to adjust to trade disruptions, stating that executives are “fully confident in our 2025 guidance, mid- to long-term sales growth outlook and 2027 core margin guidance of 40%+.""

Pharma was exempted because the industry’s supply chain is spread out and complicated, and also because the medication it makes can be lifesaving.
“Shock [to] the pharma supply chain threatens our own public health and access to medicines—from generic antibiotics to complex biologic and peptides,” they wrote.
Companies like Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson have already committed billions of dollars ($50 billion and $55 billion, respectively) to reshoring.
“Whether it’s large or small pharmaceutical companies, the supply chain is very complex, very distributed, very tangled with a lot of countries,” Bhalodia said.","The pharmaceutical industry seemingly came out on top when President Donald Trump announced import tariffs on April 2. And while those are currently on a 90-day pause for every country except China, giving a break to industries like auto and steel, it seems the shoe might be on the other foot for pharma now.

Under the original plan, those industries faced at least 10% tariffs for goods imported to the US, kicking off a stock market drop. But pharma had been excluded, and major players’ stocks responded positively.

Companies like Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly saw small bumps (1.4% and 1.6%, respectively from April 1 to 2) as the rest of the market suffered. Pharma was exempted because the industry’s supply chain is spread out and complicated, and also because the medication it makes can be lifesaving.

“I was encouraged that they were exempted from tariffs, just given the essential nature of pharmaceuticals and also the complexity of the pharmaceutical supply chain,” Evan Seigerman, biopharma analyst at investment bank BMO Capital Markets, told Healthcare Brew. “You can’t just easily move manufacturing from one jurisdiction to another.”

But when announcing the pause on April 9, Trump also said the grace period for pharma could end “very shortly,” which caused the pharma market to dip. By around noon on April 10, J&J’s stock was down 13% and Lilly’s dropped 5%.

Seigerman and his colleagues wrote in an April 9 report they’re “strongly opposed” to tariffs for pharmaceuticals because the strategy is unlikely to bring manufacturing back to the US. “Shock [to] the pharma supply chain threatens our own public health and access to medicines—from generic antibiotics to complex biologic and peptides,” they wrote. “The ongoing gutting of [the] FDA is bad enough, only now to be compounded by what we believe to be real talk of pharma tariffs.”

Bringing it home

When Trump announced the tariff pause, he said “[pharmaceutical companies] will leave other places because they have to sell—most of their product is sold here and they’re going to be opening up their plants all over the place.”

According to the FDA, the number of manufacturing facilities in China making active pharmaceutical ingredients doubled from 2010 to 2019.

Roche, a pharmaceutical company with more than 25,000 US employees, has an “entire pharma and diagnostics value chain” in the country already, with four R&D, production, and distribution sites in the pharmaceutical division as well as seven R&D and manufacturing sites for diagnostics, according to Nina Maehlitz, the company’s global media spokesperson.

Still, Maehlitz said it’s “considering additional US investments to continue to meet patients’ needs.”

Eric Axel, executive director at American Medical Manufacturers Association, which represents companies that make medical supplies in the US like masks and gloves, agreed that more products should be made domestically.

A 2021 report from the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Side Catalog found that 46% of manufacturing facilities that make medications and 26% that make active pharmaceutical ingredients for drugs taken in the US are made domestically.

“If we rely too much on foreign suppliers, we leave ourselves at the mercy of these foreign countries, which a lot of times do not have our best interests at hand,” he said, adding that there are many domestic manufacturers who want business from companies “complaining” that their supply chain has been disrupted.

Cost concerns

Plus, Seigerman said, costs are likely to rise if other tariffs go back into effect, as the prices of non-drug goods used in research and development—like microscopes, glass bottles, electronic equipment, and raw materials—may go up.

Eli Lilly declined to comment, but CEO David Ricks told the BBC if the company does face rising costs, it may have to make cuts, likely in staff and in R&D research and development spending.

But other experts said there are benefits to making drugs in other countries, namely the environmental impacts. Among these issues is the rise in animal poisonings, contaminated algae, and drug-resistant bacteria, according to the European Environmental Bureau.

“A lot of the processes to make the API, or active pharmaceutical ingredients, are not really environmentally friendly processes,” Seigerman said.

Uncertain future

On Feb. 18, for example, Trump said pharmaceuticals could see tariffs upward of 25% or more that would increase over the year, but he wanted to “give them time to come” back to the US.

Companies like Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson have already committed billions of dollars ($50 billion and $55 billion, respectively) to reshoring. J&J plans to open three facilities, including one that is already under construction in North Carolina. Lilly is planning four manufacturing sites in North Carolina and Wisconsin as well as expansions in Indiana.

Pankit Bhalodia, a partner in life sciences at consulting firm West Monroe, said it’s hard for many companies to make decisions amid the uncertainty.

On April 3, West Monroe released the results of a survey across all industries that showed tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and cost of materials were among supply chain executives’ top concerns in Q1.

“Whether it’s large or small pharmaceutical companies, the supply chain is very complex, very distributed, very tangled with a lot of countries,” Bhalodia said. “It’s not truly exempt as it was perceived.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/a77f11ad05269a65f6aeeabb29c6708df08dc378-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-04-11 17:04:39.459920

Personalization addresses health equity, which is an important factor in achieving outcomes in population health.","Upfront by Health Catalyst recently collaborated with Hartford Healthcare in Connecticut to integrate a tech-enabled patient engagement program for the seven-hospital system.

The omnichannel outreach was deployed to HHC patients to engage the population, close gaps in care, schedule annual wellness visits, follow through with specialist referrals and generate an uptake in vaccine adherence. This digital approach resulted in over five million appointments scheduled, according to Carrie Kozlowski, COO and cofounder of Upfront Healthcare, a company recently acquired by Health Catalyst.

What's happening, she said, is healthcare organizations are seeking ways to recover their business and drive revenue following COVID-19, while reducing costs.

""'How do we grow again?'"" she said is the question asked.

The answer, according to Kozlowski, is a personalized patient experience.

""To really succeed at doing patient engagement,"" she said, ""you are going to touch multiple parts of the health system and the organization.""

To find out more, listen to Kozlowski's conversation with Susan Morse, executive editor of Healthcare Finance News.

Talking Points:

Upfront was recently acquired by Health Catalyst and is now known as Upfront by Health Catalyst.

The company works with health systems, large medical groups, health plans and value-based enablers.

Upfront works with hospitals' EHRs, running analytics on a daily basis to prioritize the next steps in care.

Health organizations need to know a person's motivations and influences to create a personalized pathway that has a higher rate of success.

This means knowing whether a patient wants to be contacted by text, email or a phone call.

Personalization addresses health equity, which is an important factor in achieving outcomes in population health.

AI is not yet playing a role, but there is potential for its use.

Meanwhile, not just having but using data is all-important.

The white paper notes that nonadherence to prescribed medications drives 16% of U.S. health spending each year, or about $500 billion.
Patients are considered adherent with a PDC over 80%, CVS said, but increasing that number further can have benefits.
And all of those things contribute to you having a lower health care spend for yourself, and you're healthier and you're happier,"" he continued.
""I think that that's the advantage of CVS Health ... we cover the entire ecosystem.","A better consumer experience has implications for clinical improvements, according to a new report from CVS Health.

The healthcare giant is putting a focus on innovation in this area, and to identify opportunities, conducted an analysis that compared Net Promoter System (NPS) scores with clinical outcomes. It found that, for example, patients who were highly satisfied with the experience at their pharmacies were more likely to be adherent to their medications.

The white paper notes that nonadherence to prescribed medications drives 16% of U.S. health spending each year, or about $500 billion.

Affordability, motivation and health literacy are all factors frequently discussed as to why patients would not take their medications, but the team wanted to dig further into how the consumer experience could intersect with adherence. It found that patients who were most likely to recommend CVS Pharmacy had the highest portion of days covered (PDC), which tracks a day's supply of medication over time, indicating whether they're taking a drug consistently.

Patients are considered adherent with a PDC over 80%, CVS said, but increasing that number further can have benefits. For example, raising PDC from between 80% and 90% to between 90% and 95% for individuals with diabetes and hypertension grew total cost of care savings by between $870 and $1140.

Patients with the highest promoter scores in the study had an average PDC of 91.7%.

""If we make it easier for you to get your scripts, and make that process something that's enjoyable, you're more likely to stay adherent to those medications,"" Srikant Narasimhan, vice president of enterprise customer experience at CVS Health, told Fierce Healthcare, ""and when you're adherent to those medications, you have better health outcomes.""

""You don't end up in the hospital. You don't end up in the ER. And all of those things contribute to you having a lower health care spend for yourself, and you're healthier and you're happier,"" he continued. ""So I think when you put all that together, the benefit here is not just for CVS, not just for the patient, but societal.""

He noted that about 50% of Americans are not adherent to their medications per their doctor's instructions.

Beyond the implications for pharmacy customers, the study also found that members who are very satisfied with their Medicare Advantage coverage through Aetna are more likely to receive flu vaccinations and visit their primary care providers.

They're also more likely to stick with Aetna for their insurance, according to the report.

Narasimhan said that one of the things the customer experience team at CVS focuses on is finding ways to make the healthcare journey easier, and part of the equation in solving that challenge is being more proactive in identifying customers' needs. For instance, someone calling about a prescription may need to transfer between business units to solve their query, extending the interaction into a long and negative one, he said.

""We have a tremendous amount of visibility into what is driving pain points or frustration into the experience,"" he said. ""I think that that's the advantage of CVS Health ... we cover the entire ecosystem. In many ways, we can follow that patient through that journey and understand those pain points.""

""We have the access and the information to know that this patient's likely going to face a problem, or they're going to have to go back to their provider, or they're gonna have to go get a re-auth. Let's just fix that,"" Narasimhan said. ""So I think these are things that we're, we're bringing forward now that we have this connectivity across the businesses.""

He said there's also a trust component that's key to making these customer experience improvements. At CVS, they're leaning on their pharmacists to help bridge those gaps, as patients often see these clinicians more frequently than other providers.

It also gets pharmacists out from behind the counter and offers more face-to-face time with patients.

""We've been trying to think about innovation that gets the pharmacist in front of the patient. That increases your engagement with a clinician, someone that you can talk to about the medications, that can speak intelligently about it, especially if you're on a new med,"" he said. ""So that's just making it easier and more trustworthy to engage in the healthcare system.""",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/fiercehealthcare/1638444331/CVS.jpg?VersionId=z3LvDpncnSc0mtn8HD6THIlYdZM4BLY_,N,,2025-04-11 17:04:33.239588

Two chain restaurants are closing. One temporarily and one for good.

The Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen at First Street and McKinley Avenue near the canal and dd’s DISCOUNTS has closed.

The restaurant was listed as “temporarily closed” on the company’s website for weeks. But now it is closed for good.

One small “Sorry, we are closed” sign hangs on the door. The seats, menu signs, cash registers and most of the equipment have been removed.

It’s no longer listed on the website and a real estate company’s “available” sign hangs on the building.

Popeyes and the franchisee that owns the location did not return repeated messages seeking comment about why it closed. The owner, California QSR Management, also closed another of its locations in San Diego.

In Fresno, Popeyes still has four restaurants open: on Blackstone Avenue, Kings Canyon Road, Cedar Avenue north of Shaw Avenue, and West Shaw Avenue.

McDonald’s

A busy McDonald’s in southeast Fresno is also closing — but not forever.

The restaurant at 5645 E. Kings Canyon Road near Clovis Avenue will shut down in June and reopen about two months later in August, according to an employee and a notice filed with the state of California.

During that time, the restaurant will remodel, according to a permit application filed with the City of Fresno. The restaurant already has a double drive-thru lane, but will build a new drive-thru window and a bypass lane.

It will add a new roof over the trash enclosures, re-stripe the parking lot and make minor changes to the exterior, including adding new doors.

Inside the building, it will reconfigure the dining room and kitchen, upgrade the restrooms to make them compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act and make other improvements.

The closure means 105 employees will be out of work for about two months, according to a notice filed with the state as required by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act.

Barclays wants to achieve a cost-to-income ratio in the upper 50s and overall efficiency savings of £2 billion by 2026.","Investment Overview

Barclays has seen a decrease in operating expenses over the past six years, with a negative compound annual growth rate of 2.4%. The company plans to continue cost-saving actions, resulting in gross savings of £1 billion in 2024. By 2026, Barclays aims for total efficiency savings of £2 billion and a cost-to-income ratio in the high 50s. The company has also divested its consumer finance business, acquired Tesco's retail banking business, and sold $1.1 billion in credit card receivables to Blackstone's Credit & Insurance segment.

Bull Case

Barclays' initiatives to improve efficiency over the last few years have been bearing fruit, as evident from a fall in expenses. While total operating expenses increased in 2022 and 2023, the same declined in 2024 alongside a negative compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.4% over the six-year period ended 2021. Overall expenses are expected to remain manageable as business restructuring initiatives continue to provide support. The company intends to undertake further cost-saving actions to improve efficiency. The structural cost actions resulted in gross savings of £1 billion in 2024. The company aims to achieve gross efficiency savings of £0.5 billion in 2025. By 2026-end, management expects total gross efficiency savings of £2 billion and the cost-to-income ratio to be in the high 50s. Barclays has been striving to simplify operations and focus on core businesses. In February 2025, it divested its Germany-based consumer finance business. In November 2024, the company acquired Tesco's retail banking business. The move is expected to complement its existing business and strengthen its position in the market. Further, as part of its business overhaul, the company announced changes to its operating divisions effective first-quarter 2024. In April 2024, it announced the disposal of its Italian mortgage portfolio (completed in the second quarter of 2024). The company has sold $1.1 billion in credit card receivables to Blackstone's Credit & Insurance segment to bolster the lending capacity for Barclays Bank Delaware in the United States. In 2023, Barclays acquired Kensington Mortgage, which bolstered its mortgage business in the United Kingdom. Driven by these initiatives, the company's profitability is expected to improve over time.

Barclays has been rewarding shareholders with enhanced capital distributions. The company has been paying dividends regularly and plans to keep the total dividend payout stable at the 2023 level, with progressive dividend growth. Barclays plans to return at least £10 billion of capital to shareholders between 2024 and 2026 through dividends and share buybacks, with a continued preference for buybacks. Driven by a solid balance sheet position, the company's sustainable capital distributions will likely enhance shareholder value. Shares of Barclays have outperformed the industry over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 has been revised 5% upward over the past week. Moreover, its current price-to-book and price-to-earnings (F1) ratios are lower than the industry averages. Also, it has a Value Score of B. Thus, given the strong fundamentals and positive estimate revisions, the company's impressive price performance is likely to continue in the near term.

Valuations

Based on a DCF Valuation, the fair value of Barclay's stock price is $40.95. Due to a structural hedge, the company expects UK net interest margins to peak in 2026. Additionally, the company expects 2% loan growth and 70 basis point impairment losses over the medium term. In 2026, the midcycle return on tangible equity is 9%, while the cost/income ratio falls from 63% in 2024 to 59%. This is in contrast to an 11% cost of equity assumption.

Bear Case

Barclays' core operating performance remains unsatisfactory. Net interest income (NII) and net fee, commission, and other income have been witnessing a volatile trend over the last several quarters owing to a challenging operating backdrop. Though NII and net fee, commission, and other income rose in 2024 on the back of structural hedges, the uncertainty about the performance of the capital markets might weigh on the company's top line, which makes us apprehensive about its growth prospects. Rising credit impairment charges are another major concern for Barclays. The company witnessed a significant rise in credit impairment charges in 2020 to £4.8 billion, though there was a credit impairment release of £653 million in 2021. Nonetheless, the metric has been on the rise since 2022. Because of the tough operating environment, credit impairment charges are expected to remain elevated in the near term. Barclays' trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) undercuts its growth potential. Its ROE of 7.74% compares unfavorably with the ROE of 12.05% for the industry. This reflects that it is less efficient in using shareholders' funds.

Notable Hedge Fund Bets

Sarah Ketterer (Trades, Portfolio)'s firm has invested in Barclays via their Global Value Equity fund which had net return of 13.8% in 2024. Even though the magnitude of the stake is not significant, however, when a US-based deep value investor taps a foreign company in order to not only diversify but also profit off the undervaluation, it speaks volume of the company. And this is indicative of the lucrative fundamentals Barclays has to offer to investors

Final Thoughts

Over the last six years, Barclays' operational expenses have decreased at a negative compound annual growth rate of 2.4%. The business intends to keep cutting expenses, which will save £1 billion in gross savings by 2024. Barclays wants to achieve a cost-to-income ratio in the upper 50s and overall efficiency savings of £2 billion by 2026. Additionally, the company sold $1.1 billion in credit card receivables to Blackstone's Credit & Insurance division, sold its consumer finance division, and bought Tesco's retail banking division. The fundamental operational performance of Barclays is still inadequate. A difficult operating environment has caused a variable trend in net interest income (NII) as well as net fee, commission, and other income during the past few quarters. Even though structural hedges helped NII and net fee, commission, and other income increase in 2024, we are concerned about the company's growth prospects because the performance of the capital markets could have a negative impact on its top line.",https://static.gurufocus.com/1400567105094438912.jpeg,N,,2025-04-11 15:05:45.908098

The subcutaneous (SC) formulation of the drug has been approved in combination with J&J’s Lazcluze (lazertinib) as a first-line treatment for adults with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations, and as a monotherapy for adults with activating EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations who have failed platinum-based therapy.

NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases, and alterations in EGFR are among the most common driver mutations in patients with this form of the disease.

J&J’s Rybrevant is already approved in the EU to treat certain NSCLC patients as an intravenous (IV) infusion.

It is hoped that the SC formulation, co-formulated with Halozyme’s Enhanze drug delivery technology, will improve the treatment experience for patients by significantly reducing administration time while also lowering rates of infusion-related reactions.

Henar Hevia, senior director, EMEA therapeutic area lead, oncology, J&J Innovative Medicine, said: “The approval of SC [Rybrevant] represents a welcome improvement of the treatment experience for both patients living with EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC and the healthcare professionals who support them.

“This advancement presents an important opportunity to reduce the treatment burden, improve quality of life and give patients more time to focus on what truly matters to them.”",https://pmlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/J_and_J_cottonwood_drive.jpg,N,,2025-04-11 15:05:59.037783
ID8,BNY Mellon,2025-04-11 17:39:20+00:00,American Banker,BNY enjoys record quarter but sees tariff trouble ahead - American Banker,"Nathan Place, www.americanbanker.com, nathan-place",,,,,https://www.americanbanker.com/news/bny-enjoys-record-quarter-but-sees-tariff-trouble-ahead,"In terms of profits, revenue and earnings per share, the first three months of the year marked BNY's best first quarter on record.
""There's clearly been some signs of optimism at the beginning of the year, but we've now seen a reversal of sentiment, which has been driven by uncertainty,"" Vince said.
In the two days after the announcement, BNY's stock dropped by almost 13%, though it has partially recovered since then.
In the first quarter, BNY said it gained $40 million from the sale.
Overall, analysts at Truist called it a ""good but not outstanding"" quarter for BNY.","Bank of New York Mellon enjoyed a record quarter at the start of 2025 but remains watchful as the tumult over President Donald Trump's trade policies continues.

In terms of profits, revenue and earnings per share, the first three months of the year marked BNY's best first quarter on record. Net income was $1.15 billion, up 21% from the same period last year. Earnings per share were $1.58, beating analysts' estimates of $1.51, according to S&P. And revenue was $4.79 billion, surpassing expectations and marking a 6% increase from the year-ago period.

Even so, CEO Robin Vince struck a cautious tone in a call with journalists on Friday.

""There's clearly been some signs of optimism at the beginning of the year, but we've now seen a reversal of sentiment, which has been driven by uncertainty,"" Vince said. ""So we now have quite a few things on the minds of market participants.""

The CEO said a number of factors contributed to this uncertainty, first and foremost the seesawing tariff policies of the Trump administration. Vince said he sees the flux as part of a long-term negotiation strategy, which means businesses will have to wait a while for the ""final picture"" to come into focus.

""Last week's tariff announcements were clearly part of a broader strategy to try to reset relations between the U.S. and the rest of the world,"" he said. ""It's our expectation that these negotiations are going to take some time, and this uncertainty will likely have some length to it.""

Like other banks, BNY saw its stock take a hit after Trump imposed tariffs on almost all U.S. trading partners. In the two days after the announcement, BNY's stock dropped by almost 13%, though it has partially recovered since then.

The combination of uncertainty and stock volatility has created challenges for BNY — but also opportunities, Vince said. ""At times of uncertainty in markets, we're kind of viewed as a port in a storm,"" he said. ""And so the uncertainty actually attracts people to our platform, because they see us as this sort of rock of stability.""

In the first quarter, fee revenue reached $3.4 billion, a 3% increase from last year. Net interest income jumped 11% year over year to $1.16 billion.

BNY's sale of a Toronto-based trust company also boosted first-quarter revenue. BNY sold the business to the Australian stock transfer company Computershare in March. In the first quarter, BNY said it gained $40 million from the sale.

Overall, analysts at Truist called it a ""good but not outstanding"" quarter for BNY.

""We still like BK stock here for its status as one of the most defensive banks combined with the growth and offense made possible by recent investments,"" David Smith, head of consumer lending at Truist, wrote in a research note.

With roots dating back to 1784, BNY is one of the oldest banks in the world. But in recent years, it's been betting big on some of the newest financial technologies. In 2022, BNY launched a product offering direct custody of cryptocurrencies, starting with bitcoin.

That product ran into a regulatory roadblock from the Biden-era Securities and Exchange Commission, which required custodians to list crypto assets as a liability on their balance sheets. Under Trump, however, the SEC quickly dropped that rule.

The reversal, which came less than a week after Trump's inauguration, was so sudden that it caused some whiplash during a recent interview with one of BNY's executives. At a conference hosted by UBS in February, Emily Portney, BNY's head of asset servicing, said the bank was proud to be ""one of the very few institutions"" that can have custody of digital assets.

That prompted a puzzled reaction from the moderator, UBS analyst Brennan Hawken. ""I thought that was against the rules,"" Hawken said.

In the call with reporters on Friday, Vince said crypto regulations are needed to set the ""rules of the game,"" but the particular rule BNY ran up against, SAB 121, ""didn't make any sense."" The fact that it's now been rescinded, he said, is helpful to BNY as it continues to provide platforms for digital assets.

""There have been some impediments to full participation from a regulatory point of view,"" Vince said. ""We haven't let that stop us.""",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/940aee8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x1890+0+14/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Ff3%2F45%2Ff5d264ab4f6d8132078bd62c1656%2Fadobestock-596514919-editorial-use-only.jpeg,N,,2025-04-11 15:05:49.514933

Leading companies such as FrieslandCampina and Kerry Group are investing in innovative dairy blend formulations for non-traditional applications.

MARKET DRIVERS

Growth in the Food Industry

The expanding food and beverage industry is driving the demand for dairy blends, particularly in processed foods, bakery, and confectionery products. Fast-food chains such as McDonald's and Burger King utilize dairy blends in cheese-based products, sauces, and desserts, further fueling market growth. The rising demand for ready-to-eat meals in regions like North America and Europe is prompting manufacturers to incorporate dairy blends for extended shelf life and improved texture. Major food companies, including Nestle and Mondelez, are adopting dairy blends as cost-effective alternatives to whole milk and cream in their products. Meanwhile, emerging economies such as India and Brazil are experiencing a surge in dairy consumption, driven by increasing urbanization and a growing middle-class population.

Rise in Health Consciousness

Consumers are increasingly seeking nutritional benefits from dairy products, driving the growth of high-protein, low-fat dairy blends. Brands like Fairlife and Yoplait are introducing fortified dairy blends enriched with calcium, vitamins, and probiotics to support gut health. Lactose-intolerant consumers are fueling demand for low-lactose and lactose-free dairy blends, boosting the market for specialized dairy formulations. Additionally, the sports and fitness industry is accelerating the demand for protein-enriched dairy blends, with companies like Muscle Milk and Optimum Nutrition leading the segment. Health-conscious trends in the APAC region, particularly in Japan and South Korea, are further driving demand for functional dairy blends in meal replacements and beverages.

INDUSTRY RESTRAINTS

Stringent Regulations

Countries like the U.S. (FDA) and EU (EFSA) impose strict hygiene, safety, and labeling requirements, such as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) making it mandatory for dairy blend manufacturers to undergo extensive testing. In the European Union, dairy blends must meet specific standards for fat content and composition, making it difficult for global brands to introduce uniform products. The Codex Alimentarius standards limit the use of certain stabilizers and emulsifiers in dairy blends, forcing manufacturers to reformulate their products. The Codex Alimentarius sets global food safety standards, limiting certain stabilizers and emulsifiers in dairy blends, and influencing regulations in the EU, U.S., and other major markets.

What about a Taco Bell, or a KFC? If so, you’re in luck: With the launch of a new platform called Franzy, it’s never been easier to shop for a franchise.

Franzy, which just launched with $1 million in pre-seed funding in January, offers a Zillow-like shopping experience, and leverages AI to match prospective franchise owners to existing franchise businesses. A serial entrepreneur, founder and CEO Alex Smereczniak got the idea for Franzy while running his last business, a dry cleaning and laundry pick up and delivery business.

Smereczniak, a Minnesota native, attended college at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. He got into entrepreneurship in college, he says, when he purchased a laundry pickup and delivery business called Wake Wash. He sold in 2014 for $200,000.

After graduation in 2014, Smereczniak went to work at Ernst and Young as a management consultant—a job he says he hated—to appease his parents. “I love the people I worked with and all the stuff I was learning. But after doing something entrepreneurial. I was hooked.”

He lasted in the role for a year and a half, and in December 2015, left Ernst and Young to launch 2ULaundry in january 2016. “I saw all these Uber for X businesses pop up like WAG, Rover Instacart or Shipped, and I thought ‘someone is going to do this for laundry and dry cleaning. Why not me?,’” Smereczniak recalled.

The laundry pickup and dry cleaning business, according to Smereczniak, and Crunchbase, has raised about $30 million, and built 29 storefronts.

Each of those storefronts cost $1 million to $1.4 million when Smerczniak and his team started building in 2018. But then, he says, post COVID costs skyrocketed due to rising interest rates, construction costs, and equipment costs. “Our average store cost went from $1.4 million to $1.9 million. We’ve since gotten it back down to $900,000 to $1.3 million which is phenomenal.”

In 2020, Smereczniak and his co-founder, Dan D’Aquisto partnered on a new venture. With Electrolux as a primary lender, they launched The Laundry Room, “a first-of-its-kind laundromat that [brings] the same level of innovation to laundromats that 2ULaundry did to its on-demand delivery business,” says a press release announcing the venture in February 2021.

Within 18 months, Smereczniak says, they sold 105 locations, and have sold 116 total franchise locations to date, of which more than 30 are up and running.

Once Smereczniak dove into the world of franchising, he discovered franchise brokers. He says these brokers take a 60 percent commission on franchises, and that the rationale for franchising makes sense, but the math doesn’t.

Various franchise broker groups, including the Franchise Broker Association, note that franchise brokers make a commission between 40 percent and 50 percent of the sale, and sometimes more.

“In your head, you’re kind of like, all right, Jimmy John’s is going to use that $100,000 to invest in training and marketing and all sorts of things that are going to benefit me. Unfortunately, if you [use] to a broker, 60,000 of that 100,000 is immediately going out the door to a broker that doesn’t provide any ongoing value to you or the franchisor,” Smereczniak says.

In order to “democratize and open up” the world of franchising Smereczniak started Franzy, a platform like Zillow for franchising. Franzy utilizes information franchise shoppers provide about factors like operational experience, financial readiness, goals, and interests to pair users with one of over 3,000 franchises currently on their platform. Those matches are based on a curated score calculated from the answers provided. Once an entrepreneur finds a franchise they’re interested in pursuing, Franzy will qualify them with lenders. The company also offers resources like coaching calls to entrepreneurs who use their platform.

Franchises available for sale on the platform (at the time of publication) range in price. Inc.’s searches revealed a CruiseOne travel agency requires a minimum investment of $2,000-to-$15,000, while a Holiday Inn is listed for a minimum investment of up to $24 million.

Smereczniak says since soft launch in November 2024, Franzy has earned just under $500,000 in revenue and honed in on three key customer bases. One base is your “corporate warrior“ that is fed up and “doesn’t have their own original idea,” but still wants to be an entrepreneur. The second is a group “always involved in side hustles looking to add something new, while the third category contains seasoned franchisees using the system to “narrow down their next purchase.

Franzy makes money by receiving a flat success fee from franchises, once a client becomes a franchisee, according to Smereczniak. He says, they also make money from lender referrals, and eventually, they will receive revenue from referrals to franchise CPAs and commercial real estate agents, and from franchise resales.

For Smereczniak, who resides in Charlotte, North Carolina, Franzy’s fast success is a result of timing and circumstances.

“Timing is right in the rest of the economy, I think people are starting to get a little scared about is AI going to disrupt more white collar jobs and blue collar jobs, and those individuals I mentioned, the consultants, lawyers, kind of mid level management, a lot of fortune, 500 companies, are worried about being displaced, and they’re looking for other streams of income and ways to have more control.”

Smereczniak believes the reason the franchise broker model is still prevalent is because “nobody has disrupted it yet.” Now, he plans to use Franzy as a tool to“level the playing field “ for fast growing brands like Dave’s Hot Chicken against powerful networks like McDonald’s. To further the disruption, Smereczniak says he and his team of 13 plan to fine tune the matching system and eventually add franchise resales to the platform.","https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/vip/2025/04/franzy-funding-pano-inc.jpg",N,,2025-04-11 14:10:11.535397

By Ernest Bako WUBONTO

South African Airways (SAA), one of Africa’s oldest and most iconic airlines, is looking to deepen its presence in West Africa, with Ghana as the centre of operations linking the sub-region and connecting to Southern America.

However, the airline industry giant has lamented about the bureaucratic barriers hindering the aviation industry’s growth on the continent, calling on governments to reduce airport charges and strengthen industry collaboration to lower air travel costs in an attempt to boost intercontinental travel.

The SAA’s Chief Executive Officer, Prof. John Lamola, speaking at dinner with the ‘travel trade’ people, outlined the airline’s post-restructuring recovery strategy and its vision for enhancing connectivity across the continent.

He stressed that ridiculous airport user-fee charges and Africa’s reliance on imported aviation fuel significantly impact the cost of air travel.

The continent’s low refining capacity means aviation fuel is often imported, making it up to 30 percent more expensive than in other regions. This, combined with protectionist policies, high taxes, air navigation policies, or limited direct flight routes, drives up operational costs for airlines.

“Airlines and governments must work together to address the high cost of air travel in Africa. Lowering airport fees and improving operational efficiencies will make flying more accessible, boosting tourism and intra-African trade,” he said

With SAA’s Accra route success in serving as a critical link between Southern, West, and international markets. The airline aims to solidify its presence in Ghana by increasing the Accra-Johannesburg flight frequencies from three times a week to daily while exploring the Accra-Cape Town route as well to enhance customer experience.

Importance of Collaboration and removal of barriers

Citing the International Air Transport Association (IATA), statistics which indicate that intra-Africa travel only accounts for about two percent of the global air travel market, he stressed the need to stimulate air travel on the continent for a viable aviation industry that will foster economic growth.

The Group CEO highlighted that collaboration is an important feature of the aviation industry as it boosts tourism -promoting travel to Ghana’s cultural sites and South Africa’s attractions and facilitating trade by enhancing cargo and business connectivity among other diaspora linkages.

Prof. Lamola emphasised the visa waiver initiative between Ghana and South Africa as a significant decision-driving market demand, hence the need to deepen that collaboration in other aspects to enhance tourism, cultural integration, and business partnerships.

“The removal of visa restrictions between Ghana and South Africa is a beacon of hope and a testament to how African countries can work together at the governmental level to remove travel barriers are stimulate the airline market, motivate people to explore the continent, and promote commerce,” he said.

The statistics indicate that the number of Ghanaian tourists visiting South Africa has surged by 149 percent since the introduction of a visa waiver in November 2023. He described this as a practical case study of how removing travel restrictions can promote tourism, trade, and culture between countries.

“This initiative stimulated our people to travel, which also stimulated the airline market, commerce and tourism sectors benefited significantly. So, it is a way to let our people know their continent very well,” he said.

SSA’s 90-year Legacy

With a 90-year history, SAA has weathered financial turbulence, including a recent business rescue process that saw the airline emerge leaner and more strategically focused.

Since resuming operations, SAA has carefully selected profitable routes, reinstated key domestic and regional flights, and relaunched intercontinental services. The airline has also regained passenger trust through consistent on-time performance, safety, and improved service quality.

“South African Airways is an airline with a rich, 90-year legacy. We are one of the oldest and most recognizable airline brands on the continent. Our journey, particularly in recent years, has been one of significant transformation. We emerged from a challenging business rescue process leaner, more agile, and intensely focused on efficiency, stability, and sustainable growth,” he said.

Next chapter

With its renewed focus and strategic vision, the SAA is seeking to position itself as a key driver of Africa’s aviation revival.

With Ghana considered as the main hub for the West African sub-region, this could mean better connectivity, more tourism opportunities, and stronger economic ties with the rest of the continent.

“Looking ahead, the future for SAA in Ghana involves strengthening this partnership. We aim to deepen our collaboration with Ghanaian tourism authorities, our travel trade partners, and the business community to create synergistic growth. Our future and Ghana’s aviation future are intertwined through this vital Accra route,” he emphasised.",https://thebftonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-African-Airways-seeks-to-expand-operations-in-West-Africa.jpg,N,,2025-04-11 14:10:42.496123

Conference Operator: Good morning and welcome to the twenty twenty five First Quarter Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY’s consent.

I will now turn the call over to Marius Mertz, BNY Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Marius Mertz, Head of Investor Relations, BNY: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I’m joined by Robin Vince, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Dermot McDonough, our Chief Financial Officer. As always, we will reference our quarterly update presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bny.com. I’ll note that our remarks will contain forward looking statements and non GAAP measures.

Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. Information about these statements and non GAAP measures is available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and quarterly update presentation, all of which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, 04/11/2025, and will not be updated. With that, I will

Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, BNY: turn it over to Robin. Thanks, Marius. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I’d like to start with a few broader comments before Dermot takes you through the financial results for the quarter.

Reflecting on the operating environment, while there were clear signs of optimism at the beginning of the year, we have now seen a rapid and significant reversal of sentiment driven by uncertainty about trade and fiscal policies, which added to existing tail risks including a variety of geopolitical tensions and conflicts. Last week’s tariff announcements were clearly part of a broader strategy and an effort to reset trade relations between The U. S. And the rest of the world. This is an attempt at a very fundamental change.

And while last week’s announcements provided an initial baseline, we should expect that negotiations will time and it is likely that a clear final picture won’t be reached for a while, a view reemphasized by Wednesday’s news on a three month pause and the market volatility we saw again yesterday. The read through of this uncertainty into both capital markets and the real economy creates elevated risks in the near and medium term. In times like this, being positioned conservatively with balance sheet strength and operational resilience allows us to remain focused on serving our clients and continuing to execute on the ongoing transformation of BNY into a more platforms oriented company. Turning to the quarter and referring to Page two of the quarterly update presentation, we delivered a very solid financial performance in the first quarter. Earnings per share of $1.58 were up 26 year over year on a reported basis and up 22% excluding notable items.

Total revenue of $4,800,000,000 was up 6% year over year. Expenses around the company remained well controlled, up 2% year over year. Taken together, we delivered another quarter of meaningful positive operating leverage, three forty six basis points on a reported basis and two sixty one basis points excluding notable items. Our pretax margin improved to 32% and our return on tangible common equity improved to 24%. As I’ve noted before, BNY plays a central role in global markets powering our clients with platforms across custody, security settlement, collateral payments, trading wealth investments and more in over 100 markets around the world.

Notwithstanding the current environment, we continue to see a meaningful opportunity from our work to better align ourselves as an integrated financial services platforms company. Our transformation strategy includes both a new commercial coverage approach and our strategic platforms operating model, which together are designed to enhance the client experience and enable greater agility. The execution of this strategy is a significant exercise in change management, which requires hard work and takes time, but our teams around the world have embraced the opportunity and we are making progress. This past quarter marked the first anniversary since we started the phased transition into our new operating model and just one year in we have more than half of BNY working in this new way. Already, we are starting to see how this transformation can drive top line growth with greater scalability.

For instance, over the past year, our trade finance team is processing trade loans 60% faster. Our enterprise on boarding team is also working faster while seeing a more than 30% increase in on boarding volume. And our payments team has tripled the number of currencies we offer our bank clients to support consumer activity. Complementing our platform work and building on the momentum with which we entered the year, our new commercial coverage model is proving increasingly effective in enabling more integrated client solutions from across the entire company. The first three months of the year represented our strongest sales quarter on record.

The number of clients who bought from three or more lines of business has increased by 40% over the past two years and we continue to see outsized sales growth with those multi line of business clients. In just one example, a large privately held multinational company where BNY has acted as custodian for the pension plan and corporate cash portfolio where we provide corporate trust and debt capital market services and we provide wealth management to the company’s senior executives. We recently expanded our relationship to also include supporting the company’s collateral needs and managing short term cash through our liquidity direct platform. As I have said before, effectively cross selling the breadth of our platforms in this way and at scale represents the single most compelling growth opportunity for our company. As an institution with a long history of innovation, we have not forgotten that delivering new solutions is another important way for us to be more for our clients and to drive top line growth.

We recently welcomed Carolyn Weinberg to the company as a member of the Executive Committee. She is now our Chief Product and Innovation Officer. Many people across our organization are focused on innovating instant payments, digital assets, wealth tech, private markets, collateral, liquidity, all examples of domains where we are innovating. The addition of Carolyn in this new role will increase our leadership bandwidth to drive innovative new commercial opportunities and find new ways to leverage our platforms and data for client solutions. While on the topic of innovation, I also want to take a moment to specifically call out the opportunity we see from AI at BNY.

We’ve been taking a platform based approach to AI capabilities, building and deploying solutions at scale with resilient responsible guardrails throughout. We believe that our AI platform is going to be an important advantage for us as a large language model agnostic design leveraging frontier models from multiple leading providers. To that end, in the first quarter, we announced a multiyear agreement with OpenAI giving BNY access to cutting edge tools and working with OpenAI to advance AI use cases in financial services. Over 80% of our employees have completed the prerequisite training to access Eliza, our AI platform and more than 8,000 of them are already experimenting with personal AI agents honing the skills they need to use AI effectively. To date, we have deployed more than 40 AI solutions into production with a significant additional number at various stages of building and testing.

Collectively, we expect these to drive productivity gains, improved risk management and to provide meaningful leverage to our people in the future. We strongly believe that by empowering our people with AI to do what we do better every day, we will harness great benefits over the coming years. Before I hand the call over to Dermot, I want to close where I began. While the outlook for the operating environment has become more uncertain, we are prepared for a wide range of macroeconomic and market scenarios. Our ongoing work to operate BNY as a more platforms oriented company combined with our highly capitalized liquid and lower credit risk balance sheet positions us to manage dynamically and act as a source of strength as we support our clients in navigating the current environment.

I’d like to thank our people around the world for bringing intensity and excellence to drive us forward as One BNY. And with that, over to you, Don.

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: Thank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. I’m starting with our consolidated financial results for the quarter on page three of the presentation. Total revenue of $4,800,000,000 was up 6% year over year and excluding notable items total revenue was up 5%. Fee revenue was up 3%. That included 6% growth in investment services fees in our Security Services and Marketing Wealth Services segments driven by net new business and higher market values.

Investment management and performance fees were down five percent driven by the mix of AUM flows and an adjustment for certain rebates partially offset by higher market values. While not on the page, I will note that firm wide AUCA of $53,100,000,000,000 were up 9% year over year, reflecting client inflows, higher market values and net new business. And assets under management of $2,000,000,000,000 were flat year over year as higher market values were offset by cumulative net outflows. Foreign exchange revenue was up 3% year over year, driven by higher spreads on the back of higher volatility. Investment and other revenue was $230,000,000 which included a $40,000,000 disposal gain, a notable item in the quarter.

Net interest income was up 11% year over year, driven by the reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields, partially offset by changes in deposit mix. Provision for credit losses was $18,000,000 in the quarter, reflecting reserve increases relating to commercial real estate exposure. Expenses of $3,300,000,000 were up 2% year over year, driven by higher investments and employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency savings. Taken together, we reported earnings per share of $1.58 on both a reported and on an operating basis. Excluding the impact of notable items, earnings per share were up 22% year over year.

Our pretax margin was 32% and our return on tangible common equity was 24% in the quarter. Turning to capital and liquidity on page four. Our Tier one leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.2%. The sequential increase reflects capital generated through earnings, preferred stock issuance and improved accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by capital distributed through common stock repurchases and dividends. Our CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.5%.

The sequential increase reflects the before mentioned increase in capital, partially offset by higher risk weighted assets. Over the course of the first quarter, we returned approximately 1,100,000,000 of capital to our common shareholders representing a 95% total payout ratio year to date. With regards to liquidity, the consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 116% and the consolidated net stable funding ratio was 132%. Next, net interest income and balance sheet trends on page five. Net interest income of $1,200,000,000 was up 11% year over year and down 3% quarter over quarter.

The sequential decrease reflects changes in balance sheet size and mix, partially offset by the continued reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields. Average interest earning assets decreased by 1% sequentially, including lower cash and reverse repo balances, partially offset by higher investment securities and loan balances. Average deposit balances also decreased by 1% sequentially, reflecting lower non interest bearing balances compared to the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Average interest bearing deposit balances remained flat. Turning to our business segments starting on page six.

Security Services reported total revenue of $2,300,000,000 up 8% year over year. Total Investment Services fees were up 4% year over year. In Asset Servicing, Investment Services fees grew by 5% reflecting higher market values and net new business. And in issuer services, investment services fees were up 2% driven by net new business in Corporate Trust. In this segment, foreign exchange revenue was up 10% year over year driven by higher spreads on the back of higher volatility.

Investment and other revenue of $140,000,000 in the quarter included the $40,000,000 disposal gain that I mentioned earlier. Net interest income for the segment was up 8% year over year. Segment expenses of 1,600,000,000 were up 3% year over year driven by higher investments, revenue related expenses and employee merit increases partially offset by efficiency savings. Security Services reported pretax income of $7.00 $8,000,000 up 20% year over year and a pretax margin of 31. Onto Markets and Wealth Services on page seven.

In our Markets and Wealth Services segment, we reported total revenue of $1,700,000,000 up 11% year over year. Total investment services fees were up 8% year over year. In Pershing, services fees were up four percent driven by higher market values and net new business. Net new assets were $11,000,000,000 in the quarter and we started off the year with a meaningful renewal from Cambridge Investment Research, a long time client and a growing independent firm. In Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees were up 10% driven by broad based growth in clearance volumes and collateral balances.

And in Treasury Services, investment services fees were up 14% driven by net new business. Net interest income for the segment overall was up 17% year over year. Segment expenses of $866,000,000 were up 4% year over year driven by higher investments and employee merit increases partially offset by efficiency savings. Taken together, our Marketing and Wealth Services segments reported pretax income of $816,000,000 up 20% year over year and a pretax margin of 48%. Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on page eight.

Our Investment and Wealth Management segment reported total revenue of $779,000,000 down 8% year over year. Investment Management fees were down 4% year over year driven by the mix of AUM flows and the adjustment for certain rebates partially offset by higher market values. Segment expenses of $714,000,000 were down 4% year over year, driven by lower revenue related expenses and efficiency savings, partially offset by higher investments. Investments in wealth management reported pretax income of $63,000,000 down 41% year over year and a pretax margin of 8%. As I described earlier, assets under management of $2,000,000,000,000 were flat year over year.

In the first quarter, we saw $18,000,000,000 of net outflows driven by index cash, equity and multi asset strategies, partially offset by net inflows into fixed income and LDI strategies. Wealth management client assets of $327,000,000,000 increased by 6% year over year, by higher market values and cumulative net inflows. Page nine shows the results of the other segment. I’ll just note that in this segment, the sequential improvement in both revenue and expenses reflects the absence of net losses on sales of securities recorded in the fourth quarter as well as lower severance expense in the first quarter. I’ll close with a few comments on the financial guidance for 2025 that we provided on our earnings call in January.

While it is clear that the outlook for the operating environment has become more uncertain, our financial guidance and with it our determination to drive positive operating leverage in a wide range of scenarios remains unchanged. That means we continue to expect full year 2025 NII to be up mid single digit percentage points year over year. We continue to expect some fee revenue growth, of course, market dependent. And we continue to expect approximately 1% to 2% year over year growth in expenses excluding notable items. We also continue to expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2025 to be in the 22% to 23% range.

Considering our 20% tax rate in the first quarter, that means approximately 23% to 24 for each of the remaining three quarters of the year. And we continue to expect to return approximately 100% plus or minus of 2025 earnings over the course of the year. I’ll repeat what I said in January. We continuously manage the pace of our buybacks considering macroeconomic and interest rate environment, balance sheet growth and many other factors with a conservative bias. To wrap up, BNY posted another set of solid results in the first quarter, which demonstrate our consistent execution and delivery.

On the back of our strong balance sheet, we are focused on supporting our clients in navigating the cross currents of this uncertain operating environment, all the while continuing to drive us unlocking the opportunity embedded in our company. With that operator, can you please open the line for Q and A?

Conference Operator: Thank

Mike Mayo, Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities: you.

Conference Operator: And our first question will come from Ken Usdin with Autonomous Research.

Ken Usdin, Analyst, Autonomous Research: Rob and Dermot. Good morning. Another really good quarter in terms of the NII generation and good deposits. I know you guys have talked about how deposit stability is important to NII generation. I know it’s early in the year and we have all this uncertainty.

Obviously, better start than the run rate guide would imply. But just wondering just what do you think about just the world of deposits? Do you see any benefits in an uncertain world in terms of flows like to safety? And just how we should think about some of the moving parts going forward? Thanks.

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: Thanks for the question. Look, Q1 as it relates to deposits was right in line with our expectations in terms of balance and mix shift. Q4 is seasonally strong quarter for us as it relates to overall balances. So we saw some of that moderate in Q1. Now with the elevated uncertainty and volatility in the markets over the last couple of weeks, we have seen a little pickup in deposits overall, but not in a meaningful way that we would have say so we would have seen two years ago in the regional bank crisis.

So, we haven’t yet seen that kind of porch in the storm flight to quality, But people know the strength of our balance sheet and the strength of our liquidity and capital. So we have seen a little bit of a tick up, but not in a way that we saw two years ago.

Ken Usdin, Analyst, Autonomous Research: So we’ll just see if that holds up and go from there. Just bigger picture about just the environment we’re in. You have a lot of different businesses, and this is the type of environment where we see a lot of activity potential, I guess. And it was notable to see FX a little softer. But I’m just wondering how do you guys see this world in terms of just businesses that either get more active or potentially less active based on how clients act and where you expect to see kind of money flows as you could think about how past cycles would be inference to this one?

Thanks.

Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Yes, Ken. I’ll take that one. So I think it’s fair to see the phases of these types of events sort of split into two. So there’s one which tends to be a little bit more frenzied activity in the marketplace. That’s what we’ve been seeing over the course of the past ten days or so in terms of activity.

And so that does give rise to higher volumes. And we’re seeing that across our platforms for sure. Now, we’re not a huge trading firm like some others out there, but we see it in terms of high counts on clearing volumes, in terms of activity on liquidity platforms, collateral activity, all the places where you’d expect it to be where we’re really capturing the fact that market volumes are up. And to Dermot’s point earlier on about liquidity, the reason why we probably haven’t seen a big flight into us at this point is because a lot of the activity has been delevering by people who’ve been raising cash to pay back lines, not raising cash just to have more dry powder on the sidelines. It hasn’t yet been as much a long only liquidation, which tends to raise cash and that cash often ends up on our balance sheet.

So it’s sort of a little bit of a phasing thing. And then what can happen and we’ll have to see if that does happen, but as things calm down at some point, it causes CEOs and leadership teams to reflect on how do they want to think about the strategic consequences for their business. And that’s where our rentable scale and our platforms and the fact that we have all of these broad capabilities built on this sort of rock solid foundation that’s what allows us to then capture potential follow on opportunities where people say, you know what, there are things I used to do for myself that I’d now rather someone like BNY does for me using their platforms.

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: And so that’s how I think about the world right now. And Ken just to clarify, you mentioned softness in FX is up 3% year over year. We’re kind of the numbers we present there are the firm numbers. When you kind of go underneath the hood on that and talk specifically about our markets business, that was a solid year over year uptick. Whereas on the other side, our corporate treasury department are doing FX placements and the other side of that is reflected in NII.

So you’re seeing a firm wide view there as opposed to a specific markets view and the markets view for us year over year was solid.

Ken Usdin, Analyst, Autonomous Research: Got it. Thank you.

Conference Operator: And the next question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.

Alex Blostein, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Hey, good morning. Thank you for the question as well. Maybe starting with a bit of a strategic question also. Just kind of thinking about the position of the bank, obviously very strong capital base, lots of liquidity at times of uncertainty and dislocation. There might be some interesting inorganic opportunities that may come up time and again.

How are you thinking about that? Maybe it’s too early, but just want to get your sense for appetite for M and A if something compelling comes along and if there are areas of particular interest where inorganic growth might make sense?

Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Yes. Thanks, Alex. Look, we’re carefully looking at the opportunities. That’s not a spot moment in time thing. It’s just a sort of the rhythm as this management team has been driving through things over the course of the past two point five years.

We think we’ve got a lot of things under control in terms of running the company better. You can see us driving now on the sales side. You can see us driving the execution platforms. You can see the innovation. And so we’re always going to be out there thinking about what could be additive to our platform.

We just think it’s the responsible thing to do for shareholders. Now, we’re going to what hasn’t changed is maintaining great discipline. In acquisition, we need to check all of the boxes of like clear alignment with our priorities, strong cultural fit. And I underline that because that is important to us and attractive financial returns obviously. But you’re right, times like this can present opportunities and we’ll be thoughtful about it.

And I feel that we’ve practiced some of this with our Archer acquisition. That wasn’t huge. But nonetheless, it was a sort of a small to medium sized thing. It was a capabilities buy. But we’re going through all of the training processes internally to understand how to look at and then purchase and then integrate something like that in a first class way.

And then the final thing I’ll say is Platform’s operating model is quite additive to our capability over time to be able to I think be a better integrator because it creates the roadmap for us internally on how to take things and plug them in better.

Alex Blostein, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Got you. Thanks. And then my follow-up is actually double clicking into your earlier response to Ken’s question around deposits. So up a little, not a ton so far in April. Can you comment also on the mix between interest bearing and non interest bearing in April?

And then ultimately, as you sort of think about a more normalized percentage of non interest bearing deposits, you guys are at 17%, I think, now even pre COVID. So kind of before the spike in industry wide liquidity, you guys were running north of 20%. How do you think about that sort of run rate mix going forward in more sort of uncertain environment? And if in fact you enter in a recession, what would that likely look like?

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: So I guess there were a lot of questions in that follow-up question, Alex. Think about the NII for a second and the reconfirmation of the guide of 5%, which we feel pretty good about, I think it goes back to something that we discussed on previous calls, which is that very, very strong joined up partnership between the CIO, the treasurer and our deposit desk. And a lot of the work that drives our confidence around NII for this year are the actions that we took last summer over after Jackson Hole where we kind of immunized the firm for 2025 NII. So a lot of work on the asset side. In terms of NIBs, as it relates to like as rates have trended higher, you would expect a reasonable amount of cash sorting to go on and people optimize for yield.

We don’t lead with deposits. Clients come to us to do other activities in the firm and with that comes deposits which then turn into operational deposits. So in terms of the overall guide of like the $281,000,000 number which we have seen tick up a little bit this quarter and it is a seasonal business. Q4 is our strongest quarter for deposits typically. Then Q1 is a little bit less than that.

Q3 is our seasonal low. So there’s nothing that we see kind of changing our view of the overall deposit mix for the balance of the year, which kind of gives us a lot of confidence around the guide that we gave you.

Steven Schuback, Analyst, Wolfe Research: Great. All right. Thank you, guys.

Conference Operator: And our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.

Mike Mayo, Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities: Hey. I guess my first question is no good deed goes unpunished. So I do note your revenues were up 5% year over year and your headcount is down 2%. But so you raised the bar for yourself, but did note that the non comp expenses are growing mid single digits year over year. I’m wondering how much that might continue.

And also the impact on revenues from the decline of non interest bearing deposits, is that seasonal or is that something that’s just a result of the macro environment? Thanks.

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: So look, Mike, I think our ability to deliver positive operating leverage through the cycle is the North Star. And I think this is the fifth quarter that we’ve delivered consistent positive operating leverage. And hopefully you are beginning to give us credit for being a financially disciplined well run company where we have got our expenses under control over the last couple of years, while at the same time making investments in the strategies that are powering our top line growth and our efficiency growth. And so, you’re beginning to see those investments paying off. And I’m pleased that you highlighted the headcount number, which just generally means that we’re able to do more with less in a digitally empowered way.

And as Robin mentioned in his prepared remarks, we still haven’t really unlocked the power of AI. So when you think about where AI is going to be on our platform, as a financial platform company where you see 20% of the world’s investable assets flowing through our pipes, when we kind of get the AI strategy integrated into the strategy of the firm, we see a lot of dividends coming in that.

Mike Mayo, Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities: And then, you didn’t answer the non interest bearing deposit question, which might not be answerable, but just any thoughts there?

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: So look, non interest bearing deposits, think, are roughly in line with where we don’t really expect them to go meaningfully higher or meaningfully lower from where they are now, which reinforces our guide like so NII is made up of what we’ve done on the asset side and what we think the forecast is going to be in terms of the mix and the overall level of the deposits. At the end of the year, we ran about 35 different scenarios. We did the same thing at Q1. We feel we’ve kind of cut the tails off the risk of what we believe the reasonable outcome of NII is going to be. And to give you a little bit of an indication like up down, if the Fed were to cut rates by 50 basis points tomorrow, it wouldn’t really impact how we think about NII for the balance of the year.

Mike Mayo, Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities: That’s great. And my second question is for Robin. I saw you’re on CNBC and you talked about the hard data is good, but the soft data is bad and they’ll converge one way or another. I guess, Mike, it’s unanswerable also, but how long can this go on before things tip? Like the hard data goes to soft data, the soft data goes back to hard data.

Do we have one month as a country and economy, one month, three months, six months, twelve months? Kind of what’s your sense there? And what is the risk of being an international company and being a services company and potential retaliation there? I don’t know how you think or frame that, but I’ll take any thoughts you have. Thanks.

Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Sure. I love that you ask unanswerable questions, but nonetheless, I’ll give them both a whirl. Okay. So first of all, yes, this point about and we saw it again today with the confidence taking a little bit of another beating in the survey data that was released this morning. It is.

It’s going down and it’s not surprising because if you’re a CEO, you’ve got an uncertain environment potentially out over the horizon. It doesn’t help you thinking about longer term commitments including building factories, including making commitments to sort of new initiatives or whatever the case may be. And if you’re a consumer, the fear of our price is going to go up, what’s it going to mean? Obviously, there’s also a jobs angle on all of this as well. Could the economy tip into a recession?

Those are all legit questions that a consumer would have and that’s going to be a little bit of a dampener of confidence. So, think there are plenty of reasons to think that that will continue to be low. And my point when I talked about this before was that the two things at some point just kind of have to converge. And the longer that it goes on, the greater the probability that the facts converge down to the sentiment as opposed to if for some reason we suddenly had clarity and we suddenly had a sense of confidence being able to come back then it would converge back up to the facts and we’d be in a better space. But I think with a ninety day pause on tariffs and then probably a fairly long tail on full emergence of a clear picture, I think you have to be a little bit pessimistic here about how the economy is going to evolve over the course of the next six to nine months.

I’d love to be wrong on that one, but I think as every day goes by, let’s call it this trade has negative carry to be able to hold. So we’ll see. On the second question that you asked internationally, look, we are a global firm. 40% of our revenues come from outside of The U. S.

But we’re also a firm that provides really critical services to our clients. And so clients always have choices, and we have to earn their business every single day with how we behave platforms operate. But it is this combination of having this reputation of being trusted, having this rock solid underpinning, which as you know creates this port in a storm capability, plus the fact that we do things that are really important. Clearing treasuries for most people is not an optional activity. Having access to a global collateral platform that lets your business operate more effectively, maintaining your access to the rails of the financial system.

Those are very, very core significant things. And so, I’d like to think the combination of the trust, the reputation and then the day to day operation will cause our clients to continue to see value with us. But obviously that’s something that we’ll have to see how it evolves.

Mike Mayo, Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities: Great. Thank you.

Conference Operator: And moving on to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.

Ebrahim Poonawala, Analyst, Bank of America: Hey, good morning. Guess maybe Robin, just to that last point, Hiderman and Robin, you mentioned the clearing of treasuries. You have a very deep sort of understanding of the market infrastructure. There’s obviously concerns around the treasury market, what’s happening, whether the Fed needs to intervene. Just give us a sort of a preview into what you’ve seen over the last few days?

Are things working as smoothly as you would expect? And what the risk looks like there or the need for the Fed intervention?

Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Sure. So look, I would separate the treasury market into a couple of different pieces. The rails of the system are working really well. We’re seeing high volumes, yes, for sure. But everything is functioning really well and we have a, as you point out, a very good view into that.

There was a little bit of a tail in the three year auction, of course, as was well publicized earlier in the week, but then we had a very solid ten year auction and long bond auction as well. But what has evolved and this is not unique to treasuries in any way, we’ve seen it in equities as well is that the depth at the top of the order book has reduced. And so bid offer spreads have widened, The amount of risk that can be moved at the top of the book is much smaller. You have to go deeper into the book to be able to move blocks of risk. And that is true in the treasury market as it’s been true in equity markets.

And we’ve seen all the things that you’d There’s a little bit of dislocation with ETF NAVs versus the underlies. Those types of things are all indicative of people trying to move blocks of risk and there’s a bit of a consequence to it in terms of liquidity. The Fed will have to will make their own decisions about how they think about things. But if you look at history, what history suggests is that they intervene when they see markets that become fundamentally dysfunctional or dislocated where it’s not possible to move risk and the markets really aren’t functioning properly.

And that’s absolutely not what we have seen this week. Markets are working fine. We’re just seeing situations where liquidity is reduced and therefore people are having to pay up. And I think that’s the distinction that I’d make for you.

Ebrahim Poonawala, Analyst, Bank of America: That’s helpful. And I guess a separate question, maybe not timely given all the macro concerns, but, your Global Head of Digital Assets testified in front of Congress with regards to the stablecoin legislation. That’s a huge priority for this administration. Just give us a sense of how we should think about what is stablecoin legislation? BNY has had relationships with Circle I think going back a few years ago.

What all of that means in terms of your ability to play in digital assets? Are there meaningful implications on revenue growth, deposits that we should be thinking about?

Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, BNY: We’ve all I think the short answer is we don’t see it as a near term big revenue item on the list, but we’ve always seen digital assets as a long term play, whether it’s the creation of new stuff or new packages of stuff. Look, we’re in the business of looking after things in one of our platforms. That’s our custody business, 53,000,000,000,000 world number one. And so if there’s going be new stuff in the world, we want to be able to look after it. But then more broadly, the tokenization and leveraging the technology to find better ways of being able to move assets through the system more efficiently, less cost, less infrastructure required to do it.

We actually think those will be a net plus net net over time for us. And so our strategy has been pretty simple, which is we’ve been very engaged with all of the participants in the system. You mentioned Congress and the regulators, but it’s true with the clients as well. We provide a lot of our traditional rails to these new players, and that’s been a great way to build relationship. You mentioned one particular client that we do exactly that for.

Now, I think it’s very positive that Congress is looking at this question because stablecoins are or some form of digital currency on chain is necessary in order to be able to make on chain transactions efficient. Bitcoin is a more volatile asset. And so it doesn’t lend itself as well to good DVP behaviors of a settlement system. So we see stablecoins being one way of being able to facilitate that. And so being able to do sort of transitions between the fiat currency world and the chain world seems to be a sensible place for us to play.

It’s great to see that legislation proceeding. But then behind it is also a market structure bill. And that would set really the rules of the road, the terms of engagement for how different participants can participate in digital assets. I think the very helpful thing from this administration has been to sort of create more of this level playing field and say it’s a new technology. We don’t want anybody to be disadvantaged.

We want everybody to be able to participate and let’s do what The U. S. So good at which is innovate and define global standards. And so that’s where we sit today. But I wouldn’t have it as huge revenue item in the 2025 P and L, but that isn’t to undermine its promise over time.

Ebrahim Poonawala, Analyst, Bank of America: Thank you.

Conference Operator: And we’ll take a question from David Smith with Truist Securities.

David Smith, Analyst, Truist Securities: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions on NII. First, it looks like NII from repo and fed funds increased again this quarter. Do you see this sustaining? Is there like expectation for a meaningful drop off?

Just help us frame that. And then secondly, your deposit beta was really high around 90% again this quarter. Obviously, it’s a very fluid rate backdrop. But based on what you’re seeing, when might this start to level off since I think last cycle your beta was around 75% or 80% for the cumulative cycle?

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: So thanks for the question. Look, on the repo side, part of NII higher than expected and we’ve invested quite heavily in that over the last couple of years and we feel it’s an important business for us as it relates to clients and delivering products to them. But it does it’s quite small in the context of our overall NII. It’s only about 5%. So, I think the business held in nicely.

It’s doing well. The balances are higher and spreads are a little bit tighter. So, is kind of a couple of puts and takes there. But in the context of our overall NII, it’s quite small. In terms of the beta question, look, this is a question I guess that’s come up on a lot of calls over the last several quarters in that.

We deal with a sophisticated client base and we kind of pass on the rates as we get them. And so our kind of betas have always been quite high like in the low to mid-80s and that’s kind of where we see the book. And so the marginal beta is around 100%. And if rates were to go down, we’d see the betas to perform in line with the way on the way up. So that’s kind of roughly how we see it.

Marius Mertz, Head of Investor Relations, BNY: Thank you. And then just

David Smith, Analyst, Truist Securities: in terms of how the macro environment is affecting client activity, do you find clients are less willing to move around from one provider to another in a turbulent environment like this? Or custodians with differentiated capabilities become more attractive to a large enough extent that people will still consider moving where they hold funds?

Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, BNY: I think it depends on the platform. I mean this is really where the breadth of our platforms is a real advantage for us David because we have these platforms that are higher frequency, in terms of volumes where things like collateral management, things like treasury clearing, things like global clearing, dollars 1,600,000,000,000.0 ecosystem in terms of liquidity direct. And so there’s absolutely the ability to move around there. But we just have these great platforms and people gravitate to us at these times given what we have. And then there are the longer burn opportunities where people are reflecting on how to run their businesses in the best possible way.

And I don’t think at this point, it’s the environment where you kick off something super big that was going to take a lot of distraction of leadership time. But most of the work and most of the platforms that we provide, they don’t really fit into that category. And so I don’t see a reason why we’re not sort of business as usual in terms of the environment today, but we’ll have to see how it plays out. If we’re to have up 6%, seven

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: eight % in the stock market every day then obviously that creates a chilling effect almost and an exhaustion effect almost by definition. But I don’t think we’re at this point where for our businesses, the uncertainty really cascades through into client choices today. The point I would add on to it is at some level it does create opportunity for us as well as we make our platforms better and as clients look to optimize for their individual environments. It’s going to create opportunities for us to help our clients do run things better for themselves. So like I would feel quite optimistic our ability to serve clients in a better way as a result of our transformation that’s going on.

And also a significant part of our revenue is recurring. Once we have clients on our platform, they tend to stick with us. And at times like this, that is a tremendous thing to have.

Marius Mertz, Head of Investor Relations, BNY: Thank you.

Conference Operator: And we’ll take a question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.

Marius Mertz, Head of Investor Relations, BNY0: Hey, good morning folks. Morning morning. Just the platforms question going back to Robin, I think what you talked about in your earlier remarks, over half of the BNY is now on the platform model. And then you talked about the costs, the efficiencies and you cited some examples. The question would be is, now that you’ve got half of the firm on the model, are you are the efficiencies and the cross sells and if I can throw AI in there as well, are these contributions exceeding your expectations so far?

And if that is so, would that either translate into lower expense growth or would you tend to channel those savings into reinvest them in growth initiatives?

Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Well, Brian, I’m just going to take you back to some comments that I made a few quarters ago, which is just to remind of the fact that we’ve been simultaneously investing in the short, medium and long term. We did this thing, it’s now in the past, but Project Catalyst which was designed to be able to have this 1,500 ideas that we’re going to be able to save us money on a run rate basis. 2025 is actually the first full year where we have the full benefit of Catalyst in the number. So we’re still benefiting from some of those short term actions that we took a little while back. And then simultaneously, we’ve been investing more and Dermot talked about this in answer to Mike’s question earlier on.

Actually the gross numbers in terms of the savings and the investments both of them are meaningfully higher than they’ve been in past years and sometimes it’s a little hard to see that under the hood. But this investment into platforms operating model, it’s a means to an end. We think that actually people working in this model provide some immediate benefits. The agility and the ways of organizing teams create some efficiency and some more sort of pointed ability to get things done quicker with a little bit less bureaucracy and sort of nonsense getting in the way. But it’s really a means to an end because the objective of operating in the platforms has always been, we will be able to do more business and we’ll be able to do it better and quicker, risk management benefits, efficiency benefits.

It’s just got a lot of things that really suit us. And for that, you don’t really see those benefits until you’ve got a platform operating for probably at least six to twelve months to start to see that. And we in fact had a great example ourselves internally where one of our earliest entrants into the platforms operating model is starting now to rethink and reimagine how the infrastructure and systems underlying their platform operate. How do those processes work across the company? And it took a year for them to be in the model before they’ve really been able to set up their store.

So that’s a long way of saying, I think the benefits of this are very much to come. They’re more of a ’26 and a ’27 story, although there’s some benefit in ’25 and probably through into 2028. And then we see AI as the longer term thing to layer on to that not too much benefit in 2025 but we’ve clearly started. But that layers in I would say 2026, ’20 ’20 ’7, ’20 ’20 ’8, ’20 ’20 ’9 through the end of the decade. And so it’s this choreography that we’ve laid out as a leadership team to the different things that we’re doing and how they will benefit us at different periods of time.

But we got going on all of them early and that was the key.

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: Like from the CFO lens, point I’ll give you a little bit of a history lesson. If you kind of go 2022, expenses were up 8%, twenty twenty three they were 2.7%, twenty twenty four flat to slightly up due to the revenue growth outperforming expectations and this year we’re guiding 1% to 2% And all of the projects that Robin referred to are feeding into those numbers. They’re not something distinct and separate. So all of the things that we’re doing gives us a lot of confidence to be able to give you good guidance. And ultimately, the journey never ends because we’re becoming a much better run company.

The flywheel of initiatives is just going to outpace the efficiency and that’s going to lead to more growth opportunities.

Marius Mertz, Head of Investor Relations, BNY0: That’s great color. I think you wanted to convert the entire company by the end of the year on the platform’s model. Is that correct? Or is that into 2026?

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: Yes. So I would think like by this time next year when we do this call, all things kind of going according to plan, we would say the firm is fully operating in the new way of working. But I would double down on what Robin said that we can see real tangible benefits from the people who went first versus the people who are just starting now. And it’s a mindset change which is really people showing up in a different way in the firm and they’re much happier in the new way of working. So culturally it’s very powerful.

Marius Mertz, Head of Investor Relations, BNY0: That’s great color. Thank you.

Conference Operator: And we’ll take a question from Steven Schuback with Wolfe Research.

Steven Schuback, Analyst, Wolfe Research: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions.

Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Good morning, Steven.

Steven Schuback, Analyst, Wolfe Research: So I hope you guys are well. So I have a couple of questions on the Pershing business. There were some press coverage noting recent changes to the sharing of cash economics with some of your RIA and IBD clients. I was hoping you could just speak to what informed the pricing changes, the feedback you’ve gotten from the clients thus far and how we should think about any potential benefit to NII as you retain more of those spread economics?

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: So it’s something that we’re look, it’s something that we’re continuing to do. We’ve opened up our platform. We want to offer our clients a lot of choice at competitive rates. We’ve not really made any significant changes and we kind of keep it under review because the backdrop of the environment is so fluid. But in terms of the overall context of the NII and how it feeds into the 5% guide, it’s de minimis.

Steven Schuback, Analyst, Wolfe Research: That’s helpful context there, Amit. And for my follow-up, just on the NNA outlook in Pershing, the flow rate, it was a touch softer versus some of the recent, call it, mid single digit or better NNA flows that you’ve been seeing in recent quarters. I recognize there’s a lot of volatility and uncertainty in the current backdrop. But I was hoping you could just speak to what drove the moderation in flows, whether you expect that to continue amid the recent volatility? And if you could also clarify the timing and impact of the pending Atria departure, just to make sure we have all the moving pieces accounted for?

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: So as it relates to the purging, so on the positive side, lot of volume on the platform. Robin talked to different platforms and the uptick in volume over the last couple of weeks. So we see a lot of volume in terms of transaction activity flowing through the Pershing pipes which is good for us. As it relates to NNA growth and opportunity, it’s like it’s a choppy environment. I would put it down to timing.

We had some decent sized mandates that could have signed in Q1 slipped to Q2 and that’s like just more about the timing of when stuff comes on. So from quarter to quarter, I expect we’ll see a little bit more choppiness of that. But on the more positive side, I would say, we continue to see kind of strong client uptake in the pipeline for Wove. We gave a guide in January which was for 2025 roughly 60,000,000 to $70,000,000 We still feel very good about that guide. We’ve now got 52 clients on the platform.

We signed 22 contracts in Q1 And so now we’re kind of building up ahead of steam in terms of client migrations onto the platform. And so that the client’s excitement about that product continues to kind of give us confidence about saying mid single digits through the cycle as it relates to That’s right.

Steven Schuback, Analyst, Wolfe Research: And the Atria impact?

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: We don’t necessarily disclose individual transactions, but coming to a store near you this either next quarter or the quarter after.

Steven Schuback, Analyst, Wolfe Research: Understood. Well, thanks so much for taking my questions.

Conference Operator: And we’ll take a question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.

Marius Mertz, Head of Investor Relations, BNY1: Hi, good morning.

Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Good morning, Betsy.

Marius Mertz, Head of Investor Relations, BNY1: A couple of questions. One, just on the TreasuryDirect Express program that’s moving over to your platform. I just want to confirm that already started and wanted to get a sense as to anything you can share on how we should expect that’s going to roll through and impact if at all visible P and L?

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: So I don’t think that Betty, the P and L won’t be visible in terms of size or lumpiness. We’re very excited to have won the business. It was really to be honest with you that was a real strength of the platform operating model in terms of our ability to bring the firm together to win that mandate. So that was a real kind of nice proof point for us that we were on the right track as it relates to the treasury service model. We expect it to ramp up in the latter part of this year.

But in terms of moving the needle for the firm’s revenues, it’s just another happy client wanting to do business with BNY and it’s going to come into the run rate latter part of this year, so it will be in the full year numbers next year.

Marius Mertz, Head of Investor Relations, BNY1: Okay. And then as I’m looking at the deposit and the SKU NIBIB, I thought in the past NIB you were thinking that might move down towards €44,000,000,000 and is that the case still or not? And if that changed, why?

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: So we were a little bit higher than that. And so our current we kind of believe that it’s going to roughly hang into the zip code that it’s currently in, may moderate a little bit from here due to some cash sorting, but we don’t expect any meaningful change on it and that kind of feeds the 5% guide.

Marius Mertz, Head of Investor Relations, BNY1: Okay. And then you mentioned if the Fed cuts 50 bps tomorrow, there’s no NII impact. What should we be keeping an eye out for that would drive an NII impact? Is it flattening of the curve, sharp flattening, anything or you’re good in any situation?

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: I think under a wide range of situations for 2025 with the expect on the rate curve, we’re good. Obviously, if something happens materially with levels of balances and mix shift that would impact it but we’ve done a lot of analysis and so we feel reasonably good under a wide range of scenarios the NII is okay for sure as we really accelerate the year guide.

Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, BNY: And that was a deliberate strategy Betsy because we really wanted to take the risk of 2025 sort of out of things and that was work that the team did last year because NII is obviously a very valuable contribution to our firm and we appreciate it as part of our overall operating leverage. But as Dermot said earlier on, positive operating leverage is the North Star and we have other levers around of course fees. Now market is a variable, but it’s remember our fees aren’t only about market because they’re also about volumes, activity levels, wovers of software sale as well. And then we have the all important lever of expenses, which is as Dermot and I both said, we’ve been spending a considerable amount of money on investments. We see nothing in the environment today to suggest that we should stop that.

But given the fact that the total gross of savings and investments is bigger and is part of the 1% to 2% guide that Dermot gave you, it follows from that that we have choices underneath that if we needed them. So positive operating leverage is the anchor. NII is sure great, but like kind of it’s all about the other stuff.

Marius Mertz, Head of Investor Relations, BNY1: Thank you.

Conference Operator: And we’ll take a question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.

Marius Mertz, Head of Investor Relations, BNY2: Good afternoon. Dermot, can you share with us your thoughts about you talked about the immunization that you guys did and Robin you just touched on it last year following Jackson Hole for this year’s NII. Would you consider doing something like that for 2026 as the year progresses? Or was that kind of a once one and done kind of strategy?

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: No, absolutely. Very much focused on 2026. Active work. And so yes, it’s we’re always looking at the markets. We’re always looking how to optimize our balance sheet.

The partnership between the we call it the tripod internally is just really, really strong. And I think we’ll feel good about the 2026 outlook when we come to talk about it.

Steven Schuback, Analyst, Wolfe Research: Very good.

Marius Mertz, Head of Investor Relations, BNY2: I don’t think you guys touched on this. I apologize if you did, if I missed it. There’s a lot of talk about regulatory change on the horizon, specifically when it comes to the supplementary leverage ratio, which I think you guys in the past have pointed out to all of us that you’re binding capital constraint. Assuming there is a relief where they exclude those treasury securities and possibly mortgage backed securities from of the SLR. Can you share with us how that would impact the way you manage your balance sheet and the outlook, for revenue should that change?

Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Sure. Let me split the question into the two pieces. So first, the impact on us and it can get a little weedy here because there is actually three different leverage ratios. There’s an ESLR, which is the Fed’s gift to take away. There is an SLR, which is a three agency rule across the FDIC, the OCC and the Fed.

And then there’s a Tier one leverage ratio, which there’s some legal debate about whether or not the Fed has the ability to make changes to that, but it’s really in Dodd Frank. And so that’s the one that applies to all banks. We have a little bit of a different treatment on us just given the nature of the businesses that we’re in. But we are bound by Tier one leverage ratio and we’ve said that before. And so SLR can have some change but maybe not quite as much on us.

But now let me take the other part of the question and just sort of respond to what’s going on in the space. We’ve had a point of view for a long time that we actually think that leverage ratio was ill advised and it’s not really about banks. It kind of came about to some extent out of the financial crisis is almost like in a moment of anger towards banks that existed at that point. But the problem is the casualty of the situation is markets because we want banks to be able to flex their size particularly in cash on their balance sheet and in treasuries on their balance sheet. Remember the SLR penalizes a one day cash management bill, in terms of the balance sheet.

And so it does not help markets when we take out one of the accordion flexes to be able to absorb treasury supply and we’ve probably been seeing that as a contributor to treasury spreads being wider over the course of the past week. I don’t see this administration or the incoming leaders into the agencies to want to continue to be in this gold plating business which is what some of these rules have been in The U. S. I see them in the business wanting to unleash the power of U. S.

Capital markets and make sure that capital markets are working for The U. S. Economy and the banks are fully able to operate to support capital markets and make them run as efficiently as possible.

Marius Mertz, Head of Investor Relations, BNY2: Robin, thank you. Very insightful.

Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Happy to do it.

Conference Operator: And we’ll take a question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities.

David Smith, Analyst, Truist Securities: Hey, good afternoon. I think maybe a broader question on organic growth. I think Robin you mentioned earlier that you might have had record new business wins. So is there way to kind of frame that in terms of percentage terms, year over year terms? Just trying to think through the progress towards getting that organic growth rate up and where you stand today?

Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Yes. Well, we tried to put one stat in my prepared remarks, but we’ve got a few that sort of relate to this, in terms of the increase. I like as one good indicator and we talked about this in the last earnings call, the number of clients buying from three or more lines of business, our platforms of which as you know we have many increased by 40% over the past two years. And so that’s actually the biggest driver which is having those clients who are doing two or three things with us do an extra thing. And in fact the clients who do more with us and we again we talked about this back in January.

The clients who do more with us tends to understand us better and tend to do even more things with us because they appreciate the breadth of the relationship. They appreciate how our platforms can link together and we can just for them. I’ll give you one example. If you do clearing with BNY and you do collateral with BNY then in treasuries as an example, the ability for us to link up the ecosystem around our liquidity direct platform, our collateral management platform, world number one, our U. S.

Treasury platform, world number one, the world number one in global custody, we can link those things up and those become book entry transfers on our custody ledger. And so that’s just a more efficient way to operate. And we see that linkage as we get better operating as one firm, deploying our commercial model, having clients understand how they can see all of those different platforms, there are actually more and more synergy benefits for them. So, this is the we’ve said this all along. This is the single biggest avenue of growth for us is to have more of our clients do more of what we do.

And then we add to that the innovation. We add to that finding new clients. We add to that the megatrends that we talked about last time. But we are quite optimistic about the amount of runway we have under this heading.

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: And look, if you go back and look at a script from two years ago versus a script today in terms of how we talk to the market, we’re talking about more things with you, more products, Wove, Archer, our growth in ETFs quite strong, which we haven’t talked about today and also building out our infrastructure and alternatives. And Robin mentioned this in his prepared remarks like the appointment of Carolyn Weinberg is a really important strategic step for us in terms of innovating around new products.

David Smith, Analyst, Truist Securities: Yes, absolutely. So I guess versus two years ago, is it fair to assume you seem even more confident in driving this improvement and still kind of early days? Is that a fair

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: way to think about it?

Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, BNY: I would say that we’ve matured in this. We originally, if you were to analyze our language over time, the theme is very much there. But our conviction around it has grown and importantly we’ve moved it along the maturity curve. Originally it was connecting the dots. Then it was one BNY mentality.

Now it’s our commercial model. This is our first full year operating in our new commercial model under the leadership of our Chief Commercial Officer. So we’ve been maturing the concept, but our vision of this is unchanged, but our conviction in it and the maturity, operationalization, repeatability embedding in this company is growing.

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: Great. Thank you.

Conference Operator: And our final question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.

Mike Mayo, Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities: I was just looking for one wrap up number just even if it’s just what you’re conceptually thinking because you’re talking about all these revenue growth initiatives, products, platforms, processes and people and you talk about clients involving more than three lines of business, but then you also say there’s some caveats because markets will do what markets will do. So I’m just trying you can help us out with our earnings models, but not for the next quarter, for the next three to five years. The main question is what should be the core organic growth rate ahead and what has it been in the past? Thanks.

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: So like I think that’s a conversation for offline I would say Mike when you visit. But I kind of when I come in every day I just I care about positive operating leverage consistently through the cycle which is made up of fees, NII and how we manage the firm as it relates to expenses. As it relates to fees, make fees are of a couple of different components, balances, volume and other. And so I feel a lot more confident today than I did two years ago in our ability to drive innovation, drive execution and to do more with our existing client set and also add new clients to the firm. And that’s just a journey we’re going to be on and we’re going to execute to a very high standard.

And so we kind of feel very good about our ability to do positive operating leverage through the cycle in good times and bad. And Mike I’ll add to that just by saying that look if you

Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, BNY: step back and I’m sorry this is a little bit I’ll give you the one number reminder and then I’ll make a bit more of a philosophical comment. So look two thirds of our 6% fee growth in 2024 was market and currency and a third was organic. And that’s good. But and that was a step up versus the prior year. But obviously, we’re determined to see that grind higher.

And so if you take that as our aspiration then the question is do we actually have the right inputs? Are we doing the right things that actually make that legitimate and plausible? So number one, are we actually getting around operationally more with our clients? Are we actually covering them better? Are we actually driving outcomes from them?

That’s important. Where is our trust and reputation? Do people worry about the firm? No, they’re very confident. It’s this point about platforms built on a very solid foundation, making our balance sheet high quality de risked excess capital high amounts of liquidity that gives them confidence to be able to lean in and all indications are that that is what happens when they have that reaction.

And then critically, do we actually have the right products? And so this is where the breadth of the firm really matters. We’re not a two trick or three trick pony. We’re a dozen trick pony. We can do everything from investments and wealth to retail wealth to collateral management to clearing to payments to liquidity ecosystems etcetera, etcetera.

So we have this breadth. And then the question is, can you actually operationalize the joining of these things together? And then do you have innovation? And so we think we’re actually attacking the problem through all of those dimensions. And if we do that, we do it consistently and deliberately and relentlessly, then we think we will win.

And that’s what we’re doing.

Mike Mayo, Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities: Well, that was a comprehensive answer. Thank you very much.

Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Thank you, Mike.

Conference Operator: And with that, that does conclude our question and answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Robin with any additional or closing remarks.

Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Thank you, operator, and thanks everyone for your interest in BNY. Please reach out to Marius and the IR team if you have any follow-up questions. Be well and good luck out there.

Conference Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Investor Relations website at 3PM Eastern Standard Time today. Have a great day.

Since the project began in 2001, Piper Sandler has surveyed more than 274,273 teens and collected approximately 65 million data points on teen spending.","A recent report from Placer.ai denotes that Starbucks and Dunkin’ may be losing market share to emerging beverage concepts such as Dutch Bros, 7 Brew, and Scooters. Piper Sandler’s newly released Taking Stock with Teens Survey indicates, however, that they are very much favorites among younger consumers.

Piper Sandler added the “coffee, tea, and beverage places” category for the first time last year. At the time, Starbucks was the most preferred beverage brand among all teens with 57%, followed by Dunkin’ (11%), McDonald’s (6%), Dutch Bros (6%), and Scooter’s (3%).

For the spring 2025 report, Starbucks remained No. 1, but with 51% — a 6% drop. Dunkin’ was No. 2 at 10%, while Dutch Bros and McDonald’s tied again with 5%, and 7 Brew debuted in the top five, with 4%.

Notably, 7 Brew’s sales jumped by 163% from 2023 to 2024, according to Technomic data, while its unit count jumped by nearly 80% to finish last year with 321 locations. There’s a long way to go for this chain and its emerging competitors to reach Starbucks’ scale of nearly 17,000 locations and Dunkin's nearly 10,000, but their market share loss has been smaller chains’ gain, and teenagers’ changing preferences could have long-term implications.

That said, out of all restaurant brands, their preference for Chick-fil-A is unwavering. The chicken chain remains the favorite, with 17%, followed by McDonald’s (11%), Chipotle (10%), Texas Roadhouse and Raising Cane’s (each with 5%).

The top five has remained the same for the past year with one exception — Raising Cane’s was fourth to Texas Roadhouse’s fifth in the fall, with a one percent difference.

Notably, Olive Garden has fallen out of the top five since spring 2023.

With traffic still muted across most of the restaurant industry, marketers have their hands full trying to figure out what consumers want. Teenagers are among their most coveted targets, as they collectively spend about $63 billion annually, with most of that spending going toward food.

Upper income teenagers spent 23% of their money on food, compared to clothing at No. 2 (22%). Video games are third, at 9%. Teenagers across all income cohorts spent 21% of their money on food, versus 19% on clothing, and 9% on video games.

Teenagers’ ""self-reported"" spending was up 6% year-over-year to $2,388 and up 1% versus the fall. This spring marked the highest amount they spent since spring 2023 and the second highest level since prior to the pandemic. Notably, spending was much higher prior to the pandemic, peaking just above $3,000 in spring 2006.

That said, their optimism levels are falling significantly. Fifty-nine percent believe the economy will take a turn for the worse, while just 19% said it will be better.

McDonald’s workers are spilling the tea on bad manners from customers that they’re tired of putting up with.

The fast-food chain is beloved by people all over the world, but it turns out some employees have beef with the gig.

In the McDonaldsEmployees sub-Reddit group, several staff members shared their most frustrating experiences with customers and their habits while working at the Golden Arches.

“I don’t know what’s so hard for people to grasp. If an employee says they are on break, LEAVE THEM ALONE,” the original poster of the thread wrote.

“There should be no ‘But can you grab this?’ ‘But I need a refill!’ ‘I’ll be quick!’ NO! I’M NOT WORKING! I’M NOT GETTING PAID! I’m not your slave. You can wait for a paid employee,” they added. “You’re not going to die if you have to wait 30 extra seconds to get another free ranch.”

They claimed that there’s less respect for fast food employees when it comes to taking breaks and that “if someone told a doctor or plumber to work on their break, everyone would be horrified. But fast food employees? Nah, they don’t deserve breaks.”

Expecting backlash from people who may question why employees are still wearing their uniforms on break in front of customers, the poster said, “there’s nowhere to change in the back. And it shouldn’t matter. We shouldn’t have to strip or hide in corners to enjoy or breaks. We’re human too.”

Many McDonald’s workers in the comments agreed and shared their own bad customer experiences.

“I’ll be standing in the lobby, hat off, bag/belongings in hand, waiting for my crew meal at the end of my shift, and I’ll still get customers who tell me I need to get back behind the counter and take their order/bag their food,” one shared.

“From my experience, making no eye contact and pretending you can’t hear them usually works for me,” someone quipped with advice.

“I was on break and this guy who is a regular said, ‘Don’t look away from me!’ [because] he needed a refill. We were busy, so I was waiting to order my crew meal. I said I’m on break right now,” the user shared. “Then I heard him and another lady talking about me while I was literally standing right there. ‘Why is she standing there then?’ If he was nice, I woulda done it, but not when you act like that.”

“I hate it when I’m sitting waiting for food and they’re waiting for an employee and keep eyeballing me. Or when I’m about to head out and they get ready to order with me…as my jacket is on and my keys are in my hand,” one shared.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/102381483.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-04-11 14:10:14.798861

After three decades during which China imported 10 Hollywood movies per year, Beijing’s National Film Administration said Trump’s tariff actions would further sour domestic demand for US cinema in China.
Hollywood studios once looked to China, the world’s second-largest film market, to help boost box office performance of movies.
Since 2020, Chinese-made films have consistently accounted for around 80% of annual box office revenue, up from around 60% previously.
On China’s all-time box office list, only one imported film ranks in the top 20 – “Avengers: Endgame,” with revenue of 4.25 billion yuan ($579.83 million).","China said Thursday it would immediately restrict imports of Hollywood films in retaliation for President Trump’s escalation of US tariffs on imported Chinese goods, targeting one of the most high-profile American exports.

Industry analysts said the financial impact was likely to be minimal, however, because Hollywood’s box office returns in China have declined significantly in recent years.

After three decades during which China imported 10 Hollywood movies per year, Beijing’s National Film Administration said Trump’s tariff actions would further sour domestic demand for US cinema in China.

“We will follow market rules, respect the audience’s choices, and moderately reduce the number of American films imported,” the NFA said on its website.

Hollywood studios once looked to China, the world’s second-largest film market, to help boost box office performance of movies. But domestic movies increasingly have outperformed Hollywood’s fare in China, with “Ne Zha 2” this year eclipsing Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time.

Chris Fenton, author of “Feeding the Dragon: Inside the Trillion Dollar Dilemma Facing Hollywood, the NBA, and American Business,” said limiting US-made films was a “super high-profile way to make a statement of retaliation with almost zero downside for China.”

Hollywood films account for only 5% of overall box office receipts in China’s market. And Hollywood studios receive only 25% of ticket sales in China, compared with double that in other markets, Fenton said.

“Such a high-profile punishment of Hollywood is an all-win motion of strength by Beijing that will surely be noticed by Washington,” Fenton added.

Trump did not jump to Hollywood’s defense. “I think I’ve heard of worse things,” the president said when asked about China’s restrictions.

Many Hollywood celebrities supported Trump’s Democratic opponent in last year’s election.

One entertainment industry source predicted that big Hollywood blockbusters, which continue to attract moviegoers in China, may still reach the big screen. Walt Disney’s Marvel superhero movie “Thunderbolts,” which kicks off the summer blockbuster season, recently received permission to debut in China on April 30.

It was not clear if China would approve the entry of other major releases this summer, such as Paramount’s “Mission Impossible — The Final Reckoning,” which may mark Tom Cruise’s last appearance in the long-running franchise, Warner Bros’ new “Superman” movie from “Guardians of the Galaxy” filmmaker James Gunn, and Marvel’s new take on “The Fantastic Four.”

Limited impact

IMAX said it expects the slate for its large-format screens, which includes Hollywood, Chinese and international films, would not be materially impacted by the restrictions.

“We continue to expect a strong year for IMAX in China, coming off our highest-grossing first quarter ever in the country,” an IMAX spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.

Seth Shafer, principal analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence Kagan, predicted the restrictions would have limited impact.

“Only roughly 25% of domestic wide-release films are now released in China and that percentage has dropped steadily over time due to increasing competition from China’s local film production industry,” Shafer said. “For domestic films that do get a release in China, typically less than 10% of the film’s global gross box office revenue comes from China.”

“Captain America: Brave New World,” a Marvel film released in February, took in $14.4 million in China out of its $413 million in global receipts.

In the past, imports including “Titanic” and “Avatar” became box office smashes in the Chinese market, making actors such as Leonardo DiCaprio and directors such as James Cameron household names among Chinese film lovers across generations.

Since 2020, Chinese-made films have consistently accounted for around 80% of annual box office revenue, up from around 60% previously.

On China’s all-time box office list, only one imported film ranks in the top 20 – “Avengers: Endgame,” with revenue of 4.25 billion yuan ($579.83 million). The remaining films in the top 20 are all domestic productions.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/china-tariffs-hollywood.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1744310134&w=1024,N,,2025-04-11 16:11:20.284230

Wells Fargo CEO asks for tariff resolution as stock sinks

In earnings, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) this morning reported earnings per share of $1.39 for the quarter, up from $1.20 per share a year ago and above analyst estimates. However, net interest income, a measure of what a bank makes on loans, fell 6% year over year to $11.50 billion. Wells stock also tipped down Friday about 4.5%. “We support the administration’s willingness to look at barriers to fair trade for the United States, though there are certainly risks associated with such significant actions,” Scharf said in a statement. “Timely resolution which benefits the U.S. would be good for businesses, consumers, and the markets. We expect continued volatility and uncertainty and are prepared for a slower economic environment in 2025, but the actual outcome will be dependent on the results and timing of the policy changes.” Wells stock is down about 10% over the past month.

Real Estate Watch

A new Hillsborough estate with excellent pedigree has just come to market. The Koshland Estate at 130 Reservoir Rd. was built in 1961 and designed by former head of the UC Berkeley School of Architecture Howard Friedman for his father-in-law, the then president of Levi Strauss, Daniel Koshland. Koshland is credited with leading Levi’s through the brand’s rebirth in the 1960s to become a global icon of fashion. “The construction of the house was to far higher standards than perhaps all other houses in Hillsborough,"" said seller John Lockton, who purchased the home in 1988. ""Dan had his Levi Strauss commercial builders construct the house. The result is the underpinnings of the house are more like one would find in a factory than a house, stronger construction throughout and top-quality materials were used everywhere including oak floors in all areas. Remember, it was his son-in-law, Howard Friedman, who was supervising and money was no object.” Money may now be an object, though, as the home is listing for $17.8 million.

The farm-to-table concept is not only on-trend — it fosters a real connection between employees’ well-being and their day-to-day work activities.
“In both the workplace and the garden, no matter how much you plan, unexpected variables always arise,” as he put it.
Nicole Duncalf, an engraver at Tiffany, said the company’s gardening initiative led her to be more relaxed both at work and in her downtime.
“The workplace garden club has brought a healthy distraction at work.” Pike Lane Gardens isn’t alone in the field.","When it comes to employee benefits, a refreshing trend is taking root: the company garden.

Employers like L’Oréal, Tiffany & Co., and Johnson & Johnson are discovering that planting, tending and harvesting a garden offer a unique blend of wellness, sustainability and community that traditional office perks simply can’t catch up to.

Pike Lane Gardens, founded by Adam Weiss, has emerged as a leader in the space, partnering with companies to bring organic vegetable gardening to the workplace through virtual and on-site experiences.

For remote workers, programs typically feature at-home seed kits and webinars. For example, Tiffany recently distributed 150 seed kits to its off-site employees, enabling team members to participate in activities regardless of location. Meanwhile, in-person the programs are more immersive. At J&J’s campus in Raritan, N.J., employees actively participate in planning, planting and harvesting vegetables later used in the company cafeteria. The farm-to-table concept is not only on-trend — it fosters a real connection between employees’ well-being and their day-to-day work activities.

Weiss points to parallels between gardening and the 9-to-5. “In both the workplace and the garden, no matter how much you plan, unexpected variables always arise,” as he put it. “Whether it’s unpredictable weather or stubborn roots in your way, vegetable gardening — like work — requires patience and an acceptance that some things are out of our control.”

Executive coach Mitchell Creasey, who specializes in stress management, notes that in terms of attracting talent, the company garden acts as “a lighthouse of empathy and understanding. It demonstrates that the company knows that work can be stressful … that they care enough to provide a solution, and that they know enough to provide one that goes beyond hype and gets into the biology of the human.”

He points to a Society of Human Resources Management (SHRM) survey finding that three-quarters of those of us with close friends at work are more likely to stay with the company, as well as research indicating that being in nature for as little as 20 minutes a day has measurable benefits to our health.

Employees who have become involved with gardening projects report a massive upside. Nicole Duncalf, an engraver at Tiffany, said the company’s gardening initiative led her to be more relaxed both at work and in her downtime. It has also strengthened her relationships with colleagues. “Working together on more than just ‘work’ has brought us closer,” she said.

Mark Hakim, senior financial analyst at Tiffany, notes the mental health benefits. “Now that we have a rooftop garden, it allows time to step away from work and see how the garden is progressing,” he said. “The workplace garden club has brought a healthy distraction at work.”

Pike Lane Gardens isn’t alone in the field. Other players include StartOrganic, whose clients include eBay and LinkedIn and KraftyLab, which works with Amazon and Spotify. Meanwhile, the nonprofit Project Petals, which manages a number of community gardens throughout New York City, partners with the likes of Airbnb, Estée Lauder and Ashley Furniture on corporate group volunteer days.

As companies search for meaningful ways to enhance the employee experience and bolster return-to-office initiatives, corporate gardening represents a fresh approach to connecting employees to nature, to purpose and to each other, yielding a whole bumper crop of advantages.",https://www.worklife.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/12/digitaldetox.jpg,N,,2025-04-11 16:10:44.065937

Global brewery market set for steady growth, reaching $800 Billion by 2032, driven by craft Beer demand,

and evolving consumer preferences. The global brewery market is poised for consistent expansion, with projections indicating a market size of $800.0 billion by the year 2032, according to a new analysis by Market Research Future. The analysis revealed that this growth represents a compound annual growth rate of 1.88% from the market’s 2023 valuation of $676.57 billion.

It maintained that a significant factor propelling this upward trajectory is the increasing consumer appetite for craft beers, as individuals seek out distinct flavors and unique brewing techniques, thereby boosting the popularity of smaller, artisanal breweries and shifting market dynamics away from solely mass-produced options.

This demand for unique brews is fostering innovation within the industry, with breweries experimenting with diverse ingredients and brewing styles, while also focusing on sustainable and organic practices to appeal to a growing segment of health-conscious consumers.

Furthermore, the enduring demand for alcoholic beverages in social settings continues to be a crucial driver for the brewery market, as beer remains a staple at social gatherings and dining experiences, prompting breweries to forge collaborations with restaurants and diversify their product offerings to include food pairings.

The evolution of marketing strategies, particularly the surge in online marketing, is also playing a vital role in the market’s growth. It indicated a glaring result that showcased that digital platforms and influencer engagement are enabling breweries to connect with consumers in novel ways, enhancing brand visibility and fostering customer loyalty through local events and strategic partnerships.

According to the research platform, online distribution channel is gaining considerable traction, fueled by the increasing preference for digital shopping and convenience, providing consumers with access to a broader range of products and transforming traditional distribution models.

Regionally, Europe currently holds the largest share of the brewery market, followed by North America, while the Asia Pacific region is identified as a high-growth area due to rising consumer demand and a youthful demographic.

It listed some key players in the global brewery landscape, and these include: China Resources Snow Breweries, SABMiller (part of AB InBev), Diageo, Asahi Group Holdings, Kirin Holdings Company, AnheuserBusch InBev (AB InBev), Carlsberg Group, Heineken, and Molson Coors.

The data from the research also affirmed that beverage company, are actively adapting to these evolving consumer preferences through continuous product innovation, strategic acquisitions, and expansions into promising regional markets.

The outage continued until 2 February, and left many customers unable to receive and spend their paychecks.
Last month, Barclays said they expected to pay between £5 million and £7.5 million in compensation to customers hit by this set of outages.
The compensation paid ranges up to £100, though amounts have been determined on a case-by-case basis.
If your banking services were disrupted as a result of an IT outage, you may be able to get compensation.","Barclays customers have started to receive compensation after an IT outage disrupted many of their banking services on 31 January.

The outage continued until 2 February, and left many customers unable to receive and spend their paychecks. The incident coincided with some customers’ paydays as well as the HMRC self-assessment tax return deadline.

Last month, Barclays said they expected to pay between £5 million and £7.5 million in compensation to customers hit by this set of outages.

Most affected customers who are eligible for compensation should have received payment from Barclays yesterday or today, though some will take longer due to the complexity of individual cases.

The compensation paid ranges up to £100, though amounts have been determined on a case-by-case basis.

In a letter to the Treasury Select Committee in February, Barclays said: “We are deeply sorry for the impact this incident has had on our customers who were not able to access some of our services during the incident period.”

Am I entitled to compensation from Barclays?

If you are a Barclays customer and your normal banking activities were disrupted during the January/February IT outage, such as it meant you couldn’t pay a bill and were hit with late payments, you could be in line for compensation.

If you will be receiving a payout in this wave of payments, you can expect to receive a letter in the post telling you that compensation is on its way.

When the compensation is paid, it will appear on your bank statement with the reference “Barclays UK Refu”.

If you believe you are eligible for compensation, but did not receive any, then you can contact Barclays customer service.

What other banking outages have occurred?

There have been at least 158 banking IT failures since January 2023, amounting to least 803 hours of disruption to customers, according to the Treasury Select Committee.

The list of banks and building societies to have suffered outages include HSBC, Santander, Nationwide, NatWest, and Lloyds.

If your banking services were disrupted as a result of an IT outage, you may be able to get compensation.

As well as Barclays, Nationwide has also paid out £77,452 in the last two years, and NatWest has paid £348,000 to customers in the same time period.

Represent’s partnership with LoyaltyLion has transformed its loyalty program into a powerful revenue driver, delivering measurable impact on customer lifetime value, purchase frequency, and total revenue. Since integrating with LoyaltyLion and launching its Prestige program, Represent Clothing has seen:

19.6% of total revenue driven by loyalty program members

4x higher lifetime value (LTV) from members compared to non-members

3.4x more orders from active Prestige program members than non-members

79,000 new loyalty signups in 12 months

313,500 loyalty activities completed by program members in the past year

Driving retention and repeat purchases

Represent’s Prestige Program offers tiered benefits, including early access to limited product drops and 20% discounts for top-tier members, fostering strong customer loyalty. This approach has significantly increased repeat purchase frequency and engagement, with members shopping 3.4 times more often than non-members.

George Heaton, co-founder of Represent, commented: “Our community is at the heart of everything we do, and LoyaltyLion has helped us take our loyalty program to the next level. The Prestige Program not only rewards our most engaged customers but also strengthens our brand’s connection with them. We’re prepared to sacrifice margin for really engaged, loyal customers because we know the lifetime value and frequency of purchase is unmatched.”

Expanding loyalty beyond online shopping

Beyond ecommerce, Represent has extended the Prestige Program to physical stores using LoyaltyLion and Shopify POS, providing members with in-store perks such as queue-jump privileges and reward redemption at checkout. Represent has also integrated loyalty incentives into its mobile app with Venn Apps, leading to a 97% uplift in mobile conversions.

Loyalty-driven omnichannel engagement

Represent leverages LoyaltyLion’s integrations to enhance customer communication and sustainability efforts:

SMS engagement – using LoyaltyLion and Attentive, loyalty data is applied to targeted SMS campaigns, achieving click-through rates of up to 10%.

Resale and sustainability – the Treet integration powers Represent’s recently launched Archive, a resale marketplace where Prestige members can buy and sell pre-loved items while earning loyalty points and redeeming rewards.

Loyalty at the heart of growth

Represent’s Prestige Program is a key driver of the brand’s continued expansion. The US now accounts for 20% of their sales, and they opened their first bricks & mortar store in Los Angeles in March 2024. The combination of exclusive access, seamless omnichannel experiences, and data-driven engagement has resulted in loyalty members contributing nearly one-fifth of total revenue.

Charlie Casey, CEO of LoyaltyLion, added: “Represent is a fantastic example of how a brand can use loyalty to build deeper customer relationships and drive long-term revenue. Their commitment to customer engagement and exclusive rewards has made the Prestige Program a benchmark for success.”

As Represent continues to innovate in loyalty, the Prestige Program remains a crucial pillar of its success. With the ability to adapt, scale, and drive higher customer lifetime value, Represent and LoyaltyLion are setting a new standard for loyalty in the fashion industry.",https://retailtimes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/android-chrome-192x192-1-75x75.png,N,,2025-04-11 16:11:04.719874

These programs, he said, will show payers the true net cost of prescription drugs and the value of pharmacy services.
However, Joe Shields, managing director of Transparency-Rx, a trade group of smaller PBMs, remains skeptical that the programs will do what they say.
“They [the larger PBMs] have discovered that transparency is an important value that the market wants,” says Shields.
And now they are doing drug manufacturing.” Shields is referring to the large PBMs’ efforts to develop private-label biosimilars that compete directly with pharmaceutical companies’ biosimilars for Humira (adalimumab) and Stelara (ustekinumab).","At a time when Congressional efforts to reform pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) seem to be moving forward once again — a hearing by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce was held in February 2025 to address PBM competition — the larger PBMs are fending off their critics with changes that they say improve transparency into pricing and other PBM practices and give new options to their payer clients.

In recent investor calls, the leaders of the large, publicly traded healthcare companies that own large PBMs spoke in glowing terms about their new programs for payers. For example, David Joyner, CEO of CVS Health, said the company is on a “pharmacy transformation journey” that involves launching two programs that define drug costs, identify markups and provide more insight into costs. These programs, he said, will show payers the true net cost of prescription drugs and the value of pharmacy services.

However, Joe Shields, managing director of Transparency-Rx, a trade group of smaller PBMs, remains skeptical that the programs will do what they say. “They [the larger PBMs] have discovered that transparency is an important value that the market wants,” says Shields. “From a branding and a marketing standpoint, they have to say they’ve embraced transparency. But the truth is, they largely remain as opaque and secretive in terms of their approaches.”

Shields pointed to CVS Caremark’s settlement in July 2024 with the state of Illinois, where the company agreed to pay the state $45 million for failing to pass along rebates. He also pointed to the Federal Trade Commission’s report, which was published that same month, that said PBM business practices allow the companies to profit at the expense of patients and independent pharmacies. The FTC also released an interim report in January 2025 on specialty drug management that said the large PBMs steer patients to their affiliated pharmacies and that they were reimbursed at higher rates.

Payers are increasingly dissatisfied with PBMs and want some degree of change, according to the results of a survey conducted by Pharmaceutical Strategies Group (PSG) last year. Customers of the “big 3 PBMs reported lower satisfaction across most measures, including overall satisfaction, and they are less likely to recommend their PBM, PSG found. The big 3 PBMs are CVS Caremark, which is owned by CVS Health; Optum Rx, which is owned by UnitedHealth Group; and Express Scripts, which is owned by the Cigna Group.

Shields said true transparency starts with the willingness to share data and information. He referred to a witness at the February 2025 hearing who said his members had asked for basic information from PBMs and were not able to get that data.

Pharma pushback

Both Joyner and Andrew Witty, CEO of UnitedHealth Group, defended PBMs in their calls with investors, saying that they were the entities within the U.S. healthcare system to push back on the power that pharmaceutical companies have to set the prices on their patent-protected products.

“For more than three decades, PBMs have been a proven, unequivocal mechanism to negotiate down the price of drugs for payers and consumers while promoting better adherence and better health in drugs that have no rebates,” Joyner said in an investor call in February 2025.

He echoed comments made a month earlier by Witty, who acknowledged the need for better healthcare outcomes and how the U.S. healthcare system as a whole needs to be less confusing and less complex.

The PBM, Witty said, acts on behalf of the ultimate payers, which are employers, unions, and state and federal governments. “It acts on their behalf because they’re ultimately the ones who are typically underwriting the cost of the medicine for the patients, the consumers who are beneficiaries of their plans that are supported by those organizations,” he said. “That is often lost in terms of how this mechanism works, and it’s critical to understand this.”

Shields, however, called this another talking point. “When you look at the pharmacy supply chain, the number of places where megainsurers and PBMs control market access — and control is far more influential at this point than the drugmaker,” he says. “It’s not only at the point of drug acquisition or drug negotiation that would dictate things like price. They’ve set up group purchasing organizations and rebate aggregators. They control the delivery of specialty drugs and the reimbursement to pharmacies. And now they are doing drug manufacturing.”

Shields is referring to the large PBMs’ efforts to develop private-label biosimilars that compete directly with pharmaceutical companies’ biosimilars for Humira (adalimumab) and Stelara (ustekinumab).",https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/mhe/d62c51f904fce217a1a8a326a0455f61115e87a4-5616x2912.jpg?fit=crop&auto=format,N,,2025-04-11 12:19:24.016199

Small brands have found a niche for refillable packaging by selling direct to consumers.

Unilever is paying an undisclosed sum to buy Wild, which sells deodorant in refillable containers.

Clean Cult’s refill model relies on aluminum bottles and paper cartons lined with aluminum to prevent leaks.

Two upstart consumer products brands that shun single-use plastic in their packaging, Clean Cult and Wild, are in the spotlight after striking deals with Costco and Unilever.

Clean Cult, a New York company that sells plant-based cleaner, soap and detergent in 20-ounce aluminum bottles refilled from paper cartons that are curbside recyclable, is now being stocked in more than 300 Costco stores and on the wholesale club’s website.

The relationship, disclosed April 9, marks the first time Costco has picked up a brand that uses refillable aluminum packaging. It applies specifically to Clean Cult’s multi-surface cleaner. The bottle is $4.99 and the refill cartons (which handle about three refills) sell for $7.99 — competitive with other products.

Clean Cult is already sold by pharmacy chain CVS, the world’s biggest retailer Walmart and regional grocery stores such as Albertsons and Harris Teeter, among others.

There are hundreds of small brands leaning into refillable containers, but most sell directly to consumers, said Paul Foulkes-Arellano, founder and principal at consulting firm Circuthon. “Big retailers have struggled with refill,” he said, “so whoever gets it right will get political backing and take an advantage over their competitors.”

Clean Cult’s relationship with Costco could help normalize how consumers think about refillable containers in an affordable way, said Anita Schwartz, founder and principal of Circularity Consulting.

“Seeing it on shelf also helps people see plastic prevention in action — not just through ‘forever aluminum bottles’ but also with the paper carton refill bottles,” she said. “There are some refill systems at other retailers, but this is plastic free and a differentiator.”

Clean Cult experimented with many different materials and formats before landing on the combination of aluminum and paper, said Ryan Lupberger, CEO of the company he co-founded in 2019.

For example, when Clean Cult inked its deal with Walmart, the paper cartons were accompanied by glass bottles. It has also tried distributing its product as a dilutable concentrate, which didn’t work for mass market sellers. “Our goal is to slot into existing shelf space in a way that is easy for retailers,” Lupberger said.

Clean Cult has raised more than $45 million in investment capital. It doesn’t disclose sales or employee numbers, but generates more than eight figures in revenue annually, he said. The company sells its products across the U.S. but sees the greatest regional adoption in California, Oregon and Washington state.

Details of Unilever’s Wild acquisition

Big brands are struggling with how to embrace reusable packaging, although many have plastics-reduction goals that include the format. Some created refillable containers as part of a pilot project such as TerraCycle’s Loop program, but that initiative is now limited to two markets: France and Japan. That hasn’t deterred Unilever, which is buying reusable packaging expertise with its acquisition in early April of Wild, a U.K. personal care company that makes deodorant, body wash and lip balm that is sold in refillable containers.

Although Unilever isn’t revealing the terms of its acquisition, reports in recent weeks valued the transaction at approximately $300 million.

This week, discount retailer Variety Wholesalers Inc. revealed the first wave of openings for its newly acquired Big Lots! locations, which started on April 10 with nine stores across six states, including Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia.

Big Lots! filed for bankruptcy in September 2024, and a few months later agreed to a sale transaction with Gordon Brothers Retail Partners that enabled the transfer of Big Lots assets — including stores, distribution centers and intellectual property — to other retailers and companies, including Variety Wholesalers, which acquired 219 stores.

""We're thrilled to bring the Big Lots! brand back to life by offering more deals than ever, lots of famous brands and a new apparel department for the entire family,” said Lisa Seigies, president and CEO of Variety Wholesalers. “We’re opening stores quickly so we can serve the community. We know the stores won’t be perfect to start, but each week we’ll add more new products as we build towards the grand-opening celebration in the fall. Every time a customer visits Big Lots! we want them to find something new and exciting!""

In addition to the initial nine locations, Variety Wholesalers plans to reopen Big Lots! stores in North Carolina, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and West Virginia, among other states.

2. Southeastern Grocers Conducts Layoffs Amid Restructuring

Readers were interested this week in the news that Southeastern Grocers (SEG) is restructuring its store support center in Jacksonville, Fla., and field support teams across the Southeast, both of which have resulted in employee layoffs. The move comes a few months after a consortium of private investors, led by current SEG CEO and President Anthony Hucker and C&S Wholesale Grocers, acquired Southeastern Grocers and its Winn-Dixie and Harveys Supermarket banners back from ALDI U.S.

SEG did not disclose how many employees are part of the layoffs, but did recognize the difficult but necessary decision to restructure its business.

“Taking action now is the most prudent thing to do for the long-term health of the business, as we know that we will progressively operate a smaller fleet of stores following previously agreed conversions through 2027,” a company statement sent to Progressive Grocer noted. “Aligning our structure with the direction of our business is essential to strengthening our operations, ensuring we can continue to serve our customers, support our stores and position our company for long-term success.”

3. Ahold Delhaize USA Brings on New Tech Talent

A high-profile hire at Ahold Delhaize USA made news this week, with the company bringing on Ann Dozier, a seasoned IT executive in the food industry, to serve as its new chief information officer. Dozier officially joined the company in February and now oversees all aspects of IT for its U.S. businesses.

Before joining Ahold Delhaize USA, Dozier was SVP, chief information and technology officer for Miramar, Fla.-based distributor Southern Glazer’s Wine and Spirits.

4. Kroger’s Big Gamble on Failed Albertsons Merger

It recently came to light that The Kroger Co. spent more than $1 billion throughout its failed journey toward merging with Albertsons Cos. In its annual report regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, Kroger reported that it spent $684 million in 2024 on “merger related costs,” which included “third-party professional fees (outside experts, such as lawyers) and credit facility fees (borrowing costs).”

The failed merger, which was originally announced in October 2022, cost Kroger $316 million in 2023 and $44 million in 2022, according to a Cincinnati Enquirer report.

Kroger remains wrapped up in legal battles with both Albertsons and C&S Wholesale Grocers, and last month filed a legal response to Albertsons’ earlier lawsuit against it, which claimed that Kroger failed to exercise “best efforts” and to take “any and all actions” to obtain regulatory approval of the companies’ proposed merger deal. Kroger is now claiming that while it was working to seek regulatory approval and close the merger, Albertsons was engaging in a secret campaign alongside C&S Wholesale Grocers to pursue its own regulatory strategy, which ultimately undermined Kroger's efforts.

In an announcement this week, PCH said it was using the bankruptcy process to “finalize a shift away” from its legacy business of direct-mail, retail merchandise and magazine subscriptions. The company is hoping to instead transition to a “pure digital advertising"" model, where it will continue to offer free-to-play entertainment and prizes.

The Chapter 11 proceedings, filed in New York on Wednesday, arrive amid growing financial strain for PCH – which has struggled with rising operational costs and changing consumer habits in recent years.

Pivoting from its old way of doing business will help the company break free from past constraints and “establish a strong foundation for our future,"" CEO Andy Goldberg said in a statement.

But that doesn't mean the famous sweepstakes are going away. PCH says it plans to operate in a ""business-as-usual manner"" throughout the bankruptcy process – noting that the “Prize Patrol” team will continuing to deliver awards across the U.S. The company says it's lined up debtor-in-possession financing from Prestige Capital to fund operations through its restructuring.

PCH's roots date back to 1953 – when Harold and LuEsther Mertz and their daughter, Joyce Mertz-Gilmore, formed a business out of their Long Island, New York home to send direct-to-consumer mailings that solicited subscribers for a number of magazines through one single offering.

The company later grew with chances for consumers to win money – first launching a direct mail sweepstakes in 1967 – and expanded its offerings to a wide variety of merchandise, from collectible figurines to houseware and “As Seen on TV” accessories, in the years that followed. Its in-person “Prize Patrol” team was formed in 1989.

PCH became known for surprising prize winners with oversized checks, which was often filmed and featured in TV commercials. In Wednesday court documents, the company said it has awarded over half a billion dollars in prizes and continues to attract millions of contestants today.

But its operations haven't been without financial strain – particularly in recent years.

“While PCH’s direct mail and e-commerce programs were profitable for decades, changing patterns of consumer behavior, costs and competition, along with a declining pool of new prospecting names, negatively impacted the business, resulted in losses beginning in 2022,” William H. Henrich, co-chief restructuring officer for PCH, wrote in a court declaration Wednesday.

Henrich pointed to a handful of cost pressures – including rising shipping and postal rates, inventory and supply chain challenges that have continued since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and rising competition from major retailers today, like Walmart and Amazon, that have dominated the e-commerce space.

PCH also faced some scrutiny from regulators who previously raised concerns about consumers mistakenly believing that making purchases from the company would improve their chances at winning its sweepstakes. As a result, PCH has racked up several costly legal settlements over the years – most recently, Wednesday's court documents note, paying $18.5 million to resolve allegations from the Federal Trade Commission in 2018.

As of the end of March, PCH had total assets of nearly $11.7 million and total liabilities of about $65.7 million, court documents show. The company currently has 105 employees and an annual gross revenue of about $38 million.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/10/PDTN/83034702007-ap-25100693894689.jpg?crop=2697,1516,x3,y23&width=2697&height=1516&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-04-11 11:10:57.842746

The Applied Science & Technology Research Organization of America, or ASTRO America, is spearheading the Guam Advanced Material & Manufacturing Accelerator project, or GAMMA.

The group received $5 million from the Navy in fiscal year 2024 and expects an additional $12 million in the coming months to begin the first phase, according to Neal Orringer, the group’s president.

The facility, expected to cost about $40 million and be fully operational within three years, would enable Guam-based submarines to produce parts at the point of need, reducing downtime and reliance on distant supply chains.

“By advancing cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities, this project will not only strengthen U.S. national security but also position Guam as a leader in the Indo-Pacific for innovation, education, and economic development,” Orringer said in an April 3 email to Stars and Stripes.

Five nuclear-powered, fast-attack submarines from Submarine Squadron 15 are based at Polaris Point on Naval Base Guam, a key hub for U.S. military operations in the Western Pacific.

In February 2024, Vice Adm. Scott Pappano, then the program executive officer for Strategic Submarines, described the project as a “national imperative for advanced manufacturing capability” for ships and submarines in a strategic location, according to an ASTRO news release.

The new manufacturing complex will feature a lab, classrooms, a conference room and office space, and is expected to create between 85 and 100 jobs. Temporary facilities for classroom and tech work are scheduled to come online within six to eight months, Orringer said.

He did not disclose an anticipated location for the project, but said specifics will be announced in the coming months.

While GAMMA’s primary mission is to support the Navy, its capabilities are expected to reach other sectors. A satellite campus from a mainland U.S. engineering university will partner with the University of Guam and Guam Community College to offer degrees and certifications focused on advanced manufacturing.

The technology developed at GAMMA may eventually expand to aerospace, automotive, construction and other industries, according to a June 2024 implementation plan.

The project aligns with Guam Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero’s broader goal of diversifying the island’s economy. She announced on March 27 that the Maritime Industrial Base Program had signed a $40 million contract with ASTRO America after a meeting with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, according to the Pacific Island Times.

“This means economic improvement, more jobs for our people, more training for our people,” Leon Guerrero said at a March 27 news conference posted online by KUAM-TV, adding that the benefits could reach beyond the military into the broader civilian community.",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/z3ohw4-140425subs-3dphoto01.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/140425SUBS-3Dphoto01.jpg,N,,2025-04-11 11:11:09.988427

Albertsons Keeps It Consistent Albertsons is making the best of a challenging economic environment, keeping visits close to previous levels and maintaining its share of the grocery visit pie.","Visits Slow Relative to 2023, But Still on Upward Trajectory

Traffic to Albertsons banners has increased steadily over the past couple of years, with visits still significantly higher (10.5%) than in pre-pandemic 2019. So while visits did dip slightly relative to 2023 (-1.1%) – likely due to stabilization following the robust growth of recent years – the minimal decline highlights Albertsons’ capacity to maintain strong foot traffic despite a challenging economic environment.

Albertsons Closes Visit Gap in 2025

Zooming into quarterly-level data also highlights Albertsons’ strength. After narrowing its year-over-year (YoY) visit gap from -2.5% in Q2 2024 to -0.9% in Q3 and Q4 2024, Q1 2025 visits are now level with Q1 2024 traffic – suggesting that Albertsons’ visits have indeed stabilized, with the company holding on the gains of the past couple of years.

Stable Visit Share Over The Years

The company’s resilience in the face of the growing competition from discount & dollar stores is likely contributing to Albertsons’ strength.

Inflation and high prices have had a major impact on grocery shopping behavior in recent years, with discount stores emerging as significant players in the grocery market. Indeed, between 2019 and 2024, the share of visits to the discount & dollar category out of total grocery and discount & dollar store visits increased from 23.4% to 25.5% – likely due to some shoppers favoring more affordable grocery channels over traditional supermarkets. Meanwhile, grocery’s relative visit share decreased, with traffic to the grocery category (excluding Albertsons banners) falling from 67.8% in 2019 to 66.0% in 2024. But Albertsons’ relative visit share remained largely stable during this period – suggesting that, even as budget-conscious consumers gravitate towards discount stores, Albertsons has managed to retain its customer base.

Shorter, Mission-Driven Visits

Albertsons, like other grocery stores, has seen an increase in short visits in recent years, leading to shorter average dwell time. Between 2019 and 2024, the average length of stay across Albertsons brands dropped from 22.7 minutes to 21.6 minutes.

The drop in visit duration may be partially attributed to the growing segment of consumers who prefer the convenience of picking up their groceries via lockers or curbside, or who are supplementing their online orders with quick trips in-store. And as Albertsons has invested in curbside pickup, delivery, and online shopping options across a number of its banners, the company is well positioned to meet the demand for flexibility and efficiency in the grocery space.

Albertsons Brands Stay the Course

Diving into some of Albertsons’ biggest brands reveals that visits to most banners stayed relatively close to 2023 levels, with YoY traffic trends ranging from -2.7% to +2.9%. While banners like Albertsons, Safeway, and VONS saw slightly fewer visits in 2024 compared to 2023, Jewel-Osco and Shaw's Supermarket enjoyed YoY visit growth.

Albertsons Keeps It Consistent

Albertsons is making the best of a challenging economic environment, keeping visits close to previous levels and maintaining its share of the grocery visit pie.

This collaboration between Brembo and Michelin will affect more than just how a car stops.","Supergroups are always cause for excitement. When legends join forces, the possibilities seem endless. And so it is with Brembo and Michelin, leaders in their field, teaming up to make cars stop better, and possibly a bit more.

The collaboration revolves around Brembo’s new Sensify braking system, which in itself is particularly interesting. We’ve had brake-by-wire systems before, where the brake pedal essentially sends a signal to an electronic booster that distributes the hydraulic fluid to the calipers as in an otherwise-conventional (purely hydraulic) system, but Sensify is a bit different.

This article was available exclusively to our newsletter subscribers before it hit the website. Want early access? Sign up below.

For more information, read our

Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.

The system uses the brake pedal to send a signal to a control unit, but from there, the braking force at each corner of the car is fully variable. There are two methods of achieving this. First is with hydraulics, where each individual brake has its own master cylinder, actuated by an electric motor receiving signals from the brake control unit; second is with electric motors in the calipers, which actuate the pads without fluid whatsoever. In theory, you can combine both types, for instance, having hydraulic braking for the front wheels and ""dry"" braking for the rears.

Michelin is helping take it to the next level. Data from its software integrates with the information Sensify collects to create highly accurate real-time estimates of tire grip.

""What we do is in real time, we can identify based on data provided by Sensify… four critical parameters of the tires,” says Serge Lafon, head of Michelin’s OE tire business. ""The tire load, wear level, pressure, and temperature. With those four parameters, we can identify and calculate the adherence coefficient of the tire, which is critical for any braking system.""

In essence, Sensify can optimize the brake pressure at each corner of the car, getting much closer to the limit of grip just before lock-up.

'What’s essential to the system is how this precise knowledge of physics is provided to the Sensify brain almost instantaneously.'

""What’s essential to the system is how this precise knowledge of physics is provided to the Sensify brain almost instantaneously,"" says Ignacio Alvarez Troncoso, head of R&D at Brembo. ""It makes a huge difference with how Sensify makes decisions.""

The two companies started with simulation work. Real-world testing began at Michelin’s proving ground last fall. So far, the only figure the pair has provided is a reduction of ABS braking distances of up to 13 feet compared to a car with a ""standard"" ABS system. The tests were carried out in cars with both summer and winter tires, new and worn tires, correctly and underinflated tires, and in dry and wet conditions. The tests included full stops from speeds of 31 mph to 86 mph.

Photo by: Michelin

""At all times, you apply the maximum pressure without locking the tire,"" says Lafon. The system can compensate for any factor—environmental, wear, etc.—because it’s always calculating the exact grip coefficient for each tire.

Sensify distributes braking force by assessing everything that affects tire and braking performance, then makes adjustments on the fly. Troncoso didn’t get into specifics, but he did say the speed and accuracy of the data that it has, thanks to Michelin, has changed the way Brembo is developing the system.

What’s even more intriguing is what this sort of real-time tire data means for the rest of a car’s systems. The term “software-defined vehicle” is new and buzzy, and while arguably vehicles have been at least somewhat software-defined since the first computer-controlled engine management systems of the 1970s and 1980s, the term is useful to understand a more recent trend in cars.

Photo by: Brembo

So much of a car’s hardware is controlled by software, and increasingly, we see vehicle systems that talk to each other in a more sophisticated way. Not just multiple ECUs working away in parallel. Sensify fits in with this world.

""When we conceived Sensify, we were obviously thinking of the megatrend of the software-defined vehicle and making sure that our electronic architecture was compatible with the different evolutions we’re seeing,"" Troncoso says.

From a vehicle dynamics perspective, the goal is to maximize tire grip in all scenarios. Sensify, with the aid of Michelin, does so in braking events, but the data it generates on tire-grip levels has huge implications for other vehicle systems.

All these systems rely on virtual models, and tires are one of the hardest things to recreate in the digital world. Michelin, as you might expect, is one of the best at this, and adding real-time information from a clever braking system only enhances this.

Photo by: Michelin

Think about how that data will affect adaptive or active suspension, electronically controlled differentials, active aerodynamics, and powertrain systems. This collaboration between Brembo and Michelin will affect more than just how a car stops. It’ll also influence the direction of Michelin and Brembo’s (and likely everyone else’s) hardware, too.

But this partnership and the systems it has produced are still in their early days.

""We are at the beginning of this collaboration,"" Troncoso says. Sensify is set to hit the market in a production car in 2026, but neither Brembo nor Michelin is saying if the results of this collaboration will influence the earliest iterations of Sensify. However, both are clear that the aim is to put this on the road.

For a certain type of car nerd, the promise that this collaboration holds is huge. Let’s hope that, unlike so many other supergroups, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/g4k2NE/s1/brembo-braking-technology.jpg,N,,2025-04-11 12:20:23.293857

Lopez Dorada, who has a rich history rooted in the meatpacking industry, produces 100% USDA-inspected beef patties with no additives or preservatives for McDonald’s. Under Chairman Ed Sanchez’s leadership, the company has grown into a leader in the food industry. Ed attributes this success to a commitment to food safety, innovation, and quality, as well as showing up in the communities they serve to make an impact.

As a former McDonald’s crew member, Ed has a unique perspective into the McDonald’s System and how suppliers like Lopez Dorada power our restaurants. Like 1 in 8 Americans, Ed learned valuable skills at the Golden Arches - from collaboration to dependability to leadership. We sat down with Ed to learn more about how he’s applied these skills in his current role and what his experience has been like as a McDonald’s supplier.

What trends are you seeing right now across the food supply chain or within the meatpacking industry?

These days, sustainability and climate change are more important than ever. That’s why Lopez Dorada is an active part of McDonald’s Beef Council - working together to tackle key challenges in our supply chain and focus on reducing emissions, minimizing water impact, enhancing biodiversity and building a more resilient future. It’s all about making a real impact and driving meaningful change across the beef industry.

Can you tell us about the importance of guiding and uplifting fellow Hispanic business leaders like yourself?

When you help educate someone, you give them a chance to break a cycle, one where perhaps education was not the top priority. Lopez Dorada will be starting a scholarship program at Oklahoma City University in 2026. My wife and I personally sponsor scholarship funds at Lewis University in Romeoville, IL, who has about 35% Hispanic students, but the scholarships are for anyone in need.

You’re part of McDonald’s 1 in 8 (in other words, part of the 1 in 8 Americans that have worked at a McDonald’s). How did working at the restaurant help you grow into the leader you’ve become today?

Working at a McDonald’s restaurant teaches you a ton of skills, everything from time management and teamwork to economics and budgeting labor/food costs. I still recommend to anyone just joining the workforce and looking to make a change to consider working at a McDonald’s to learn the business and life skills that can help you grow in the business world.",https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/logo/mcd_corp_social_feed_default.jpg,N,,2025-04-11 11:10:22.827335

Morgan Stanley posted net earnings of $4.3 billion ($2.6 per share), up $1 billion year-on-year ($2.02 per share in 2024), thanks to the performance of its securities trading business.

Wells Fargo is also doing well, boosted by wealth management. Higher commissions and volumes enabled it to post net earnings of 4.89 billion dollars (1.39 dollars per share vs. 1.23 expected), and a 6% rise in revenues to 4.62 billion.

De son côté, JPMorgan, America's leading bank by assets, also exceeded expectations with net earnings up 9% to $14.64 billion ($5.07 per share).

BlackRock, on the other hand, posted more mixed results: sales up 12%, but net income down 4% to $1.5 billion, due to lower performance fees. Good news for shareholders, however: earnings per share climbed 15% year-on-year to $11.3.

Banks call for vigilance

Executives remain on guard for the rest of the year. ""Uncertainty and anxiety about the future of the markets and the economy dominate customer conversations,"" sums up Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock.

Jamie Dimon, head of JPMorgan, refers to ""considerable turbulence"", pointing to stubborn inflation, high deficits, still buoyant asset prices and high volatility. He also regrets that pricing policies have held back many strategic operations.

The CFO of Morgan Stanley cites further potential revisions to GDP growth to be reflected in subsequent quarters.

Analysts are concerned about the weakness of the IPO market, the lack of momentum on major deals, and the gloomy climate linked to a possible prolonged trade war. All of these factors are likely to dampen advisory and investment activity in the second quarter.

When the Starbucks Card Mobile app launched in 2009, it included pretty basic features, such as an interactive drink builder, store locators, and specific information about food/beverage items on the Starbucks menu.
Just two years later, the Starbucks mobile app went through a revamp that introduced mobile payments, a revolutionary concept that was unrivaled by competitors at the time.
Turning payments digital through the Starbucks mobile app meant that customers could monitor transactions, check balances, reload gift cards, and easily pay at registers.
Not to mention engaging in challenges and games through the mobile app that allow members to earn more Rewards.","The year is 2025, and, with the explosion of modern technology, we have almost everything we could ever need right on the little devices in our pockets. No need to carry cash or even a debit card, since you can load it on a digital wallet. Your insurance card that used to sit in the glove box of your car? Obsolete, now that you can view it on an app. Ordering food on a phone is also easier than ever, but it was Starbucks' mobile app that was among the first to change the game.

When the Starbucks Card Mobile app launched in 2009, it included pretty basic features, such as an interactive drink builder, store locators, and specific information about food/beverage items on the Starbucks menu. The app was created to increase customer satisfaction, giving people an easy way to check their Reward balances (here's what you should know before redeeming Starbucks Rewards at different locations) and find a Starbucks closest to them. Just two years later, the Starbucks mobile app went through a revamp that introduced mobile payments, a revolutionary concept that was unrivaled by competitors at the time.

In 2011, when Starbucks officially launched its mobile payment option, the company was eons ahead of the technology that powers modern touch payments. Starbucks didn't wait years for the technology to develop. Instead, the company employed Benjamin Vigier (the same guy who invented PayPal Mobile) to create a 2D barcode that could be scanned in stores in lieu of an actual debit card or Starbucks gift card. Turning payments digital through the Starbucks mobile app meant that customers could monitor transactions, check balances, reload gift cards, and easily pay at registers.

The Starbucks mobile app went through another major change in 2015 when it rolled out the Mobile Order & Pay option, which allowed customers to place an order and pay through the app ahead of time, no stop at the register required. Although the app still utilizes many of its original features, there are plenty of new gimmicks that keep customers coming back, including these 10 simple Starbucks app-ordering hacks.

Now, you can pay with your Starbucks mobile app through your smartwatch, order by voice command on your mobile device, and even check what song is being played in your local store. Not to mention engaging in challenges and games through the mobile app that allow members to earn more Rewards. And the app is still constantly changing; just a few years ago, Starbucks planned to improve its ordering system and amp up service with a big investment, but all of the modern benefits can be traced back to that simplistic 2009 app launch.",https://www.tastingtable.com/img/gallery/starbucks-mobile-app-launched-15-years-ago-heres-what-the-first-version-did/l-intro-1742917501.jpg,N,,2025-04-11 10:07:58.066368

This is why tech giants are adding solar + storage in droves.
The strategic partnership between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank Group will rely on massive solar + storage projects built by the SoftBank-backed company, SB Energy.
Meta has inked a 200 MW solar deal with Engie, a 505 MW solar project with Cypress Creek Renewables, and another 200 MW solar deal with RWE — all three located in the Lone Star State.
Amazon Amazon maintains the largest pipeline of new solar projects of any company in the United States, with 13.6 GW of solar currently under development.","Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an indispensable tool in our global economic system. From transportation and cybersecurity to healthcare and finance, America’s economic and technological competitiveness now depends on how efficiently companies can build AI capacity through data centers. Technology companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, and others are racing to build the computing power for American AI dominance.

However, the primary constraint on how much AI we can build is how much AI we can power.

The Department of Energy predicts that power demand from data centers could triple by 2028, creating unique challenges for America’s electric grid. The data centers sprouting up across the country need an electricity source that is reliable, consistent, easy to build, quick to market, and low-cost.

Here, solar + storage is the obvious choice. Solar is the most affordable electricity generating source in America. It is easily scalable and distributable to any location. It is, by far, the quickest to build and it has more projects already in development than every other power source combined.

This is why tech giants are adding solar + storage in droves. Seven of the top 10 corporate solar buyers are tech and data companies. These organizations recognize that cost and speed to market are the two most important factors in the AI race, and that no other generation source can match solar + storage on these criteria. Solar and storage projects are ready now and will keep our grid reliable, our energy bills low, and our innovative engine running.

OpenAI

In January, President Trump and OpenAI announced a $100 billion venture, called Stargate, to develop a data center infrastructure in the United States. The strategic partnership between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank Group will rely on massive solar + storage projects built by the SoftBank-backed company, SB Energy.

Microsoft

Microsoft is tapping into solar power to satisfy its data center energy demand in dozens of locations around the U.S. In February alone, they contracted 389 megawatts (MW) from three separate solar instillations in Illinois and Texas. In March, Microsoft added additional solar generation facilities Illinois, Michigan, and Missouri in partnership with developer by AES. These projects will add 475 MW of capacity, adding to Microsoft’s already-considerable 34-gigawatt (GW) solar portfolio.

Meta

Meta operates one of the largest corporate clean energy portfolios in the world. Just this year, the tech giant has dramatically expanded its solar portfolio in Texas. Meta has inked a 200 MW solar deal with Engie, a 505 MW solar project with Cypress Creek Renewables, and another 200 MW solar deal with RWE — all three located in the Lone Star State.

Amazon

Amazon maintains the largest pipeline of new solar projects of any company in the United States, with 13.6 GW of solar currently under development. To put that in perspective, only three states (CA, TX, and FL) have more than 13 GW of total solar capacity in operation. Amazon is also heavily investing in Texas with more than 20 projects in the state, including a 500 MW solar farm in Webb County, Texas.

Google

Google is making investments across clean energy sources, especially in energy storage. Google has an industry-leading 312 MW of storage capacity in operation. To power their data centers, Google has entered into a $20 billion partnership Intersect Power to develop co-located energy parks where data centers will share land with clean energy generation and storage.

Innovation put the United States at the forefront of the information age. Now, as new tools change the race for technological dominance, America must invest in affordable, reliable, homegrown energy sources — like solar and energy storage — to power our advanced computing capacity and lead the technologies of the future.

There is no American AI dominance without American energy dominance.",https://seia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AdobeStock_564630146-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-04-11 10:07:26.640657

The reading indicates spare capacity in global supply networks at levels not seen since the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
The GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index is built from responses gathered from 27,000 businesses.
""Now, organisations are aggressively exploring every possible way to eliminate costs, push suppliers to absorb tariffs, and de-risk their global supply chains.""
Regional shifts in supply chain capacity Regional results show distinct contrasts across global supply networks.","As the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index dips again in March, supply chains worldwide continue to show high levels of unused capacity. This marks the third consecutive month of decline, with the index falling to -0.51 — its lowest point in nearly five years.

The reading indicates spare capacity in global supply networks at levels not seen since the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

The GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index is built from responses gathered from 27,000 businesses. It serves as an early signal for changing demand and supply conditions, tracking shortages, transportation costs, inventory stockpiles and production backlogs.

The index is structured around a baseline of 50 and any figure above that reflects growth, while any figure below suggests a contraction. The further a reading sits from 50, the more pronounced the shift.

Manufacturers hold back on stockpiles

One of the clearest signals in March’s data is the sharp drop in stockpiling activity by manufacturers.

According to GEP, this behaviour - often used to buffer supply chains from disruption - is now at its lowest point in nine years. It signals widespread caution among procurement teams, who are holding off on buying in anticipation of unpredictable future demand.

John Piatek, Vice President of Consulting at GEP, notes that this retreat is especially evident in North America: ""March's sharp decline in supplier activity was due to the stifling effect of tariffs and tariff-related uncertainty, which had its strongest impact in North America, where manufacturers reported cutbacks to purchasing activity and inventories.""

""Until just last week, most companies had taken a wait-and-see approach,"" he adds. ""Now, organisations are aggressively exploring every possible way to eliminate costs, push suppliers to absorb tariffs, and de-risk their global supply chains.""

This trend points to a change in procurement behaviour, where the focus has shifted from resilience to cost control. Many organisations are now seeking ways to limit exposure to geopolitical pressures and tariffs while avoiding the financial burden of holding excess stock.

Regional shifts in supply chain capacity

Regional results show distinct contrasts across global supply networks. In North America, the index plunged to -0.63 from -0.18, the steepest monthly drop among all regions.

Manufacturers across the US, Canada and Mexico are scaling back both production and inventory levels, highlighting their growing uncertainty around costs and trade policy.

The United Kingdom posted an even sharper contraction. The index there fell to -1.23, its lowest since mid-2020. UK factories are actively cutting stock and spend, signalling preparations for a potential downturn in the country's industrial activity.

Spare capacity in the UK has now increased for four months running, with current levels only exceeded during the global financial crisis and the pandemic.

Across mainland Europe, there are tentative signs of stabilisation. The regional index nudged up to -0.63 from -0.72. This still reflects substantial underutilisation but suggests the worst may be over for European industry. Demand for input materials, though still down, fell by the narrowest margin seen in nearly three years.

In Asia, the picture is more upbeat. The region's index stands at -0.12, slipping slightly from February’s neutral 0.00, but still reflecting a supply chain system close to full utilisation. China and India, in particular, saw small increases in procurement activity during March, offsetting dips elsewhere.

What the numbers say about supply chains in March

In terms of demand, the index shows global appetite for raw materials, parts and commodities remains steady. Activity sits close to its long-term average, though geographical gaps are clear: North America shows a weakening trend, while parts of Europe and Asia pick up the slack.

Stockpiling behaviour continues to weaken. March saw the lowest reports of safety stockpiles since July 2016. This reinforces the idea that procurement managers remain hesitant, preferring to avoid adding to inventories while trade outlooks remain uncertain.

Material shortages are no longer a dominant concern. GEP’s indicator on item availability shows strong supply across critical goods, with vendors holding enough stock to meet client demand. Labour shortages also appear to be under control, with no major backlogs reported due to staffing limitations.

Transport costs globally dropped to their lowest level so far this year, aligning with longer-term averages. This stability in logistics is another indication that supply chains, while underused, are not experiencing capacity stress.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/661eb340b959a374d0fb41fa31336454:a29230bf68f414cc09b965e008bd7409/containers-railways-aerial-views.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-04-11 10:07:35.182257

Liberation Day tariffs

President Donald Trump launched a sweeping “reciprocal tariffs” policy aimed at matching the import duties that other countries place on US goods. On April 2, 2025 — a day he called “Liberation Day” — Trump signed an executive order imposing a minimum 10 per cent tariff on all imports to the US, effective April 5.

Higher tariffs, between 11 per cent and 50 per cent, were planned for goods from 57 countries starting April 9.

Trump’s U-turn

However, in an unexpected move, the US paused the tariff hike for 90 days for all countries except China. Chinese imports still face the steepest duties, with some products hit with tariffs as high as 145 per cent.","https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2025/04/images-6-1-2025-04-9c0abbc693f1e835770f68368b0885dc-1200x675.jpeg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)",N,,2025-04-11 10:07:39.131367

After testing in select local markets, the Big Arches announced a new premium lemonade on the menu this week. Starting this week, Lemonade is now a ""permanent menu fixture"" at restaurants nationwide.

""Squeeze a little bit of summer in every sip with this refreshing, ice-cold classic,"" it writes in the product description, adding that there are 120 calories in a small Lemonade drink. It is also dispensed out of the orange juice machine, instead of mixed alongside soft drinks.

The new lemonade has only five ingredients: water, cane sugar, lemon juice from concentrate, lemon pulp, and natural flavors. Minute Maid ingredients include water and high fructose corn syrup, and additives like citric acid and glycerol ester of wood rosin.

The Oklahoma Corporation Commission says it has at least 20,000 abandoned wells across the state in need of plugging.

""The number just changes all the time since I've been up here. But one thing that hasn't changed, it's growing,"" Senate author Grant Green (R-Wellston) said.

1031 is now headed to the senate floor.

Workers at a Starbucks shop in Norman voted to unionize this week. It’s the second location in Norman and the sixth location in the state to do so.

Oklahoma Starbucks workers joined the growing national unionization effort in 2022 when workers at the Starbucks location on 23rd Street and Robinson Avenue in Oklahoma City became the first location in the state to join Starbucks Workers United.

In a press release, Starbucks Workers United said this action comes as the union has filed over 90 unfair labor practice charges against the company since the beginning of the year, claiming the company has backtracked on previous commitments to support workers’ rights to collective bargaining.

Compacting dispute

Governor Kevin Stitt and Muscogee Nation Principal Chief David Hill are at odds over compacting.

Governor Kevin Stitt is lobbing accusations at the Muscogee Nation. He says the tribe and others worked together to kill Senate Bill 675, which died in committee. That measure would have given Oklahoma’s Turnpike Authority access to a confidential law enforcement network to collect tolls.

“The fact that you've got the Muscogee Creeks that have killed this bill…because they want to drive on the turnpikes for free. I think Oklahomans find that disgusting,” Stitt said.

Muscogee Nation Principal Chief David Hill said Stitt is trying to mix multiple issues into one tobacco compact.

“He has a compact sitting on his desk, but he will not sign it until we include motor vehicle and turnpikes. Those are two separate things,” Hill said.

The Muscogee Nation’s tobacco compact expired last month.

McDonald’s guests can now enjoy a cup of lemonade in a fresh way. On April 8, the chain announced that its previous offering, Minute Maid Lemonade, would be replaced with a permanent alternative. The new 5-ingredient lemonade was introduced to test markets in 2023 as Premium Lemonade, and fans immediately fell in love. It’s now coming to markets nationwide as just Lemonade.

In a Reddit thread from last year, one person asked, “What's the difference between Premium Lemonade and regular Lemonade?” Commenters were quick to share their thoughts. One Reddit user simply said “the price,” while others guessed the only real difference was the name. “About seven letters and a space,” wrote one skeptical user.

But those who have tried the new drink are already giving it glowing reviews. “Wendy’s wants to be the lemonade destination, but they taste like pop machine syrup.

Consumer and community banking revenue rose 4% from the same period last year, to $18.3 billion.","NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan’s net income rose 9% to $14.6 billion in the first quarter and the New York bank beat Wall Street’s profit and revenue targets, but its chief executive warned of global economic uncertainties ahead due to President Donald Trump’s ongoing trade war and other geopolitical tensions.

CEO Jamie Dimon said a strong performance by the bank’s markets division helped lift it to another strong quarter, but he added trade tensions to his list of potential negatives facing the bank and broader economy.

JPMorgan’s earnings per share rose to $5.07 per share from $4.44 a year ago. The result beat Wall Street profit projections of $4.63 a share, according to the data firm FactSet. Total managed revenue hit $46 billion, up from the $41.9 billion a year ago. Wall Street was expecting revenue of $44 billion.

Trump’s herky-jerky tariff increases — currently bumped up by 10% for most U.S. trading partners and 145% for China — have sent financial markets into dizzying fluctuations for weeks and created an enormous amount of uncertainty about where the global economy is headed. That’s bad for banks, which thrive on stability and healthy consumers and businesses borrowing money.

JPMorgan’s trading desk thrived in the first three months of 2025, helped by the market's volatility, which began well before Trump rolled out his massive “Liberation Day” tariffs on April 2.

The bank’s markets revenue rose 21% in the period, with equities revenue up 48% from a year ago.

Consumer and community banking revenue rose 4% from the same period last year, to $18.3 billion.

With regard to China, which further escalated its tariffs on imports from the U.S. to 125%, JPMorgan (JPM) executives said it was too early to make any long-term projections or statements about the impact of the ongoing trade war on its business there.

“We really have to see how things play out,"" said Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum. ”In the near term, that business is performing fine and we are not seeing any effect.""

JPMorgan set aside $3.3 billion to cover bad loans, up from $1.9 billion a year ago, while repurchasing $7 billion of common stock and boosting its dividend 12%.

JPMorgan shares rose 2% in morning trading, while broader Wall Street indexes shifted between small losses and gains and were, so far, absent of the wild swings they've seen in recent weeks.

Investment bank Morgan Stanley also beat Wall Street’s first-quarter projections. The New York bank also cited a strong performance from its equities trading division, helping boost its net income to $4.3 billion and revenue to a record $17.7 billion. Its shares were down 1.6%.

Wells Fargo also reported early Friday, with the San Francisco bank posting first-quarter net income of $4.89 billion, or $1.39 per share. That topped analysts’ forecast for earnings of $1.23 per share.

In a statement, CEO Charles Scharf said: ”We support the administration’s willingness to look at barriers to fair trade for the United States, though there are certainly risks associated with such significant actions,” adding that the bank is “prepared for a slower economic environment in 2025.”

Wells shares fell 4% in the morning.

Americans certainly love their Quarter Pounders with Cheese -- and cold brewed, extra triple shot, vanilla sweet cream, extra foam coffees.

Consumer behavior advisory Circana’s recent 2025 Definitive U.S. Restaurant Ranking Report looked at consumer spending trends, key growth drivers and category performance for restaurants across the country for 2024.

McDonald’s, Starbucks and Chick-fil-A expectedly topped the list. The top three restaurant behemoths collectively generated over $100 billion per year, comprising a whopping 32% of the top 50’s overall sales. Taco Bell and Dunkin’ were fourth and fifth, respectively. Rounding out the top 10 were Wendy’s, Burger King, Chipotle, Subway and lastly, Domino’s.

Olive Garden was the largest fast casual at 18th on the list, while IHOP, considered a mid-scale chain in the report, was 30th.

“As the industry moves forward, value will remain a crucial strategy, although the most effective approaches will extend beyond mere pricing,” said David Portalatin, senior vice president and food industry advisor for Circana, in the announcement. “For instance, nostalgia has emerged as a compelling tactic that consistently drives traffic gains for restaurants and will be a trend that we continue to watch.”

Overall, thirty-four of the top 50 restaurants are QSRs, with 11 fast casuals, and the remaining five midscale chains. The top 50 may only account for 24% of all restaurant locations, per the report, but they make up 61% of the entire restaurant industry’s spending. Twenty-eight of the top 50 grew in overall sales, and 31 brands increased locations.

Drive-thru coffee chain Dutch Bros. which has grown to over 900 locations across the country to date, made its first appearance on the annual report, coming in at 43.

Consumers spent $1 million at restaurants every second of 2024, which was an increase of 2% over 2023, and continued what is now a four year growth trajectory.

Consumers must have spent more than $1.35 billion in a chain for it to be considered for the top 50.

The Indonesian Iron and Steel Industry Association (IISIA) on Friday warned of a possible influx of Chinese steel products into the domestic market, as China seeks alternative export destinations following the United States’ recent decision to impose a steep 145 percent tariff.

IISIA Chairman Muhammad Akbar Djohan noted that China, the world’s largest iron and steel producer, currently manufactures around 1.2 billion tons annually.

“The tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump may not directly affect Indonesia, but we must anticipate China's move to redirect its steel exports to other countries,” Akbar said in Jakarta. “Indonesia remains an attractive destination for Chinese goods, so proactive steps are needed.”

With its large market size and growing purchasing power, Indonesia presents a lucrative opportunity for foreign steel producers, he added.

“It’s crucial that the government implements effective policies to safeguard the domestic iron and steel industry,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has also slapped a 34 percent tariff on Indonesia, potentially affecting exports to the US. According to IISIA data, Indonesia exported 429,300 tons of steel to the United States in 2024, consisting of 359,500 tons of semi-finished slabs and 7,800 tons of hot-dip galvanized steel. In contrast, Indonesia imported 27,500 tons of steel products from the US, including 12,700 tons of scrap and 12,100 tons of seamless pipes.

Trade Ministry data shows that Indonesia’s overall iron and steel exports surged by 261 percent in 2023, reaching $26.7 billion -- up from $7.39 billion in the previous year. Steel imports during the same period were valued at $11.38 billion.

The Kroger Marketplace will be located on 11.7 acres of currently vacant land in what the city of Hamilton calls the Hamilton West Shopping Center, about two miles northwest of downtown Hamilton.

The 11.7-acre site was previously occupied by buildings attached to the shopping center. Today, the land is in significant disrepair, with cracks, potholes and damage prevalent, according to the city of Hamilton’s Planning Department.

Hamilton City Council at its April 9 meeting unanimously approved a development plan for the project site as well as an array of specific uses and zoning variances.

Kroger has a purchase option on the property, according to city planning documents.

The Marketplace store will be 118,337 square feet in size. It will offer produce, a bakery, deli and meat departments and feature a Starbucks, Murray’s Cheeses, home goods and a double-lane pharmacy.

A 485-space surface parking lot will offer two electric vehicle stations and 16 pick-up spaces for online shoppers.

The city’s staff report described it as a $35 million economic development project.

The Marketplace store is expected to employ 325 associates and furnish goods and services not currently available at the existing Kroger on Main Street in Hamilton, the staff report reads.

The Planning Department noted other businesses opening the shopping center’s outlots, including a Gold Star and a Valvoline.

A Kroger spokesperson declined to comment.

Kroger used McBride Dale Clarion, a Cincinnati-based consulting firm, to navigate the planning and zoning process. The project required city approval for the fuel center and drive-thru pharmacy uses as well as variances for loading areas, landscaping, signs and accessory buildings.

The public engagement process for the project began just three months ago, with a Feb. 20 public hearing. Kroger, through McBride Dale Clarion, opted to pursue city council approval for a preliminary and final development in tandem to accommodate the project’s construction timeline.

The consulting firm, in a document responding to questions from the Planning Department staff, offered the following statement:

“The proposed Kroger development will be a significant improvement to the adjacent area over the current vacant paved lots. It will offer a new, convenient way for shoppers and residents to obtain fuel and use their Kroger reward points. Kroger hopes to be a catalyst for future development and improvements in the area.”",https://media.bizj.us/view/img/12959008/y*1200xx1442-812-297-114.png,N,,2025-04-11 12:21:10.582609

Advice for Leaders Integrating Emerging Technologies

Integrating emerging technologies while keeping up with regulatory compliance is quite the balancing act for leaders in the pharma industry. Here’s my take: First off, stay in the loop. It’s essential to keep up with both the latest tech trends and the changing regulatory landscape. This knowledge is crucial for successful integration. Fostering a culture of innovation is key. Encourage creativity and openmindedness, so your team feels free to explore new tech without fearing failure. You also need to invest in talent and training.

A good afternoon to you both. As if tariffs weren't enough, anti-American sentiment against US brands is something that has Wall Street concerned as well, particularly looking within retail. Some that have the highest sales exposure in China include Nike, Skechers, Tapestry, and Ralph Lauren. Now, analysts have told me that this could see a small percentage in other regions like Europe and Canada, but they are most concerned about their exposure to China, particularly because US brands have already been struggling in China amid aggressive local competition. You also have a slowing economy there where consumers are also hyper-focused on value and innovation. That's really driving consumer behavior there. If you take a closer look at what Nike saw in the region last quarter, we did see a 17% drop in their net sales. Uh they came in at 1.73 billion, that was compared to 2.08 in the year prior. The CEO said that they see the long-term opportunity there. Of course, this was prior to this coming week. They also said they made significant investments in China. Taking a closer look at Skechers, they also saw a drop in their sales there last quarter. The Skechers CFO, John Vandemar, told investors that China was a drag on international markets there. And so really what we're looking to see here is how much of an impact in the coming months and the coming quarters, will we see from these US brands like Tapestry, Ralph Lauren, but also thinking about fast food, and also other American companies like say Apple and Tesla, how they'll perform in these coming quarters because of this tariff and these negotiations at 125% staying in place right now.

I mean, it's interesting as you say, obviously this is probably most acute in China, but what we've been hearing about also is what's happening in Canada, perhaps because it's more transparent. We're hearing a lot of rhetoric, we've heard things about, you know, that in Canadian grocery stores, for example,

grown in Canada locally produced.

Well, just, well, just like here, when you go to the grocery store, it usually tells you where something is from, right? Produce especially, but other products as well, and in Canada, it does, and people are sort of, there's a backlash against, against American products.

Yeah, absolutely. And, and when you're uncovering this story, of course Lululemon is a Canadian company. And when you think about Lululemon as an American consumer, maybe the fact that it is Canadian doesn't come first to mind. But when I spoke to people, they were saying, you know, Lululemon really also emphasizing that they are a Canadian company. Something to keep in mind there, just something I've been hearing as I spoke to people as well.

Interesting. So maybe the perception of them in a place like China is different. I guess we'll find out.

We'll wait and see.

Yes. Brook, thank you very much.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/idGJ3YXqmpM61cZY.MVXgg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-04/8f5cd670-1656-11f0-beef-2036ec5a9fe9,N,,2025-04-11 12:21:04.097917

The violations contravened the Department’s money transmission and virtual currency rules.

Block has held a licence from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to carry out money transmission within the state since 2013. In 2018, the firm was allowed to conduct virtual currency business through Cash App.

An investigation by the Department revealed “critical gaps” in Block’s Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)/AML programme.

These included inadequate procedures for customer due diligence, a lack of effective risk-based controls, and failure to adequately monitor transactions.

Specifically, the company allowed high-risk Bitcoin transactions to occur without sufficient oversight, raising concerns about its anti-money laundering practices.

The company’s rapid expansion between 2019 and 2020 aggravated the situation. Block neglected to address a backlog of transaction alerts, leaving them unresolved for an extended period.

As a result, the Department concluded that Block’s monitoring processes were insufficient to detect and prevent potential illicit transactions.

Block is also required to appoint an independent monitor.

The independent monitor will assess the company’s adherence to the Department’s regulations, evaluate its corrective actions, and ensure the firm remedies the identified compliance deficiencies.

Superintendent of Financial Services Adrienne Harris said: “All financial institutions, whether traditional financial services companies or emerging cryptocurrency platforms, must adhere to rigorous standards that protect consumers and the integrity of the financial system.

“Compliance functions must keep pace with company growth or expansion. The rapid growth of Block’s Cash App absent a robust compliance function created risk and vulnerabilities that violated the rules financial services companies operating in New York must adhere to.

The question is no longer if AI will transform pharma R&D—it already is.","The convergence of biology and technology has unlocked unprecedented scientific breakthroughs. Fueled by data science and artificial intelligence, bio-innovation is reaching new heights. And Generative AI is poised to be a catalyst of this bio-revolution – a transformative force that promises to accelerate discovery, enhance precision, and optimize operations across the pharmaceutical value chain.

For decades, the challenges of drug development have seemed to be set in stone: it takes well over a decade and costs upwards of $1 billion to bring a new drug to market. Even then, 90% of potential treatments fail somewhere along the way. But what if we could rewrite this equation?

Reimagining Drug Discovery: AI as the Co-scientist

At the heart of every breakthrough medicine is a molecule—a tiny structure with the power to change lives. Finding the right molecule, however, has traditionally been a laborious process of trial and error, relying on time-consuming screening, costly experiments, and unpredictable outcomes.

GenAI is redefining drug discovery with deep learning models trained on vast chemical and biological datasets that predict promising candidates as well as identifying drug targets with unprecedented accuracy. These AI-driven systems don’t just analyze known compounds; they can design entirely new molecules, simulate their interactions, and flag potential failures before they reach the lab.

For pharmaceutical innovators, this means not only shortening R&D timelines but also expanding the pipeline of high-quality drug candidates, reducing the risks associated with late-stage failures. In an industry where speed and accuracy are everything, AI is shifting the balance from guesswork to data-driven certainty.

Revolutionizing Clinical Trials: Smarter, Faster, More Predictive

Clinical trials remain a bottleneck in drug development. Recruiting the right patients, ensuring trial adherence, and managing vast amounts of regulatory data all contribute to delays and rising costs. Here, too, AI is proving to be a game-changer.

AI-powered models can now identify ideal patient subpopulations by analyzing real-world data, ensuring trials enroll individuals who are most likely to respond positively. This not only improves success rates but also lays the groundwork for precision medicine, where treatments are tailored to specific genetic or biomarker profiles.

Meanwhile, AI-generated synthetic data is reducing dependence on traditional control groups, allowing trials to run faster and with greater statistical power. GenAI-assisted automation is also transforming the regulatory process—drafting protocols, ensuring compliance, and streamlining interactions with health authorities.

For pharma executives, this means fewer trial failures, faster regulatory approvals, and a clearer path to market success.

”The promise of AI in the life-sciences is to transform it from an industry focused on hunting for ever-smaller needles in ever-larger haystacks, to one where new therapies are purposely designed and engineered with precision” – Dr Mark Roberts, CTO Applied Sciences, Capgemini Engineering”

Beyond the Lab: AI-Optimized Manufacturing and Digital Therapeutics

While much of AI’s promise lies in discovery and trials, its impact extends into pharmaceutical manufacturing and patient engagement.

AI-driven predictive analytics are optimizing production processes, reducing waste, and improving scalability, making drug manufacturing leaner and more sustainable. Given the growing emphasis on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives, AI-driven efficiency gains are not just about cost savings—they’re also about meeting global sustainability targets.

At the same time, the rise of digital therapeutics (DTx) is redefining how we think about patient care. AI-powered applications are enabling personalized health interventions, from managing chronic diseases to real-time medication adjustments. As pharma companies explore hybrid models that combine traditional therapeutics with AI-driven digital health solutions, new revenue streams and business models are beginning to emerge.

The AI-Powered Pharma Enterprise: What Comes Next?

Despite the promise of GenAI, pharma organizations must take strategic steps to unlock its full potential. Investing in AI-first R&D strategies, curating high-quality data ecosystems, and fostering AI-literate teams will be critical to long-term success. Regulatory frameworks must evolve alongside AI capabilities, ensuring ethical AI adoption and transparent validation of AI-driven discoveries.

The question is no longer if AI will transform pharma R&D—it already is. The real challenge is how quickly organizations can adapt. In the life-sciences, and other complex industries, autonomous and agentic systems will soon start to challenge existing norms and shorten value chains. Those who act now will define the future of medicine, setting new standards for speed, precision, and impact.

AI isn’t just changing the way we develop drugs—it’s reshaping the very fabric of healthcare. Are we ready to embrace this transformation?

The loss is a stark contrast to the profit before tax of £16.9m seen by the company for the previous year across its UK stores.

In its latest financial update for the year ending 29 September 2024, Starbucks reported total revenue of £525.6m in the UK, a decrease of four per cent from the previous year’s £547.7m in revenue.

Starbucks’ UK operations also saw a nine per cent fall in gross profit for the financial year.

Despite a tough trading environment, the chain opened 100 new stores during the year, with an additional 80 stores planned for FY25 in the UK.

New store openings were targeted in key drive-thru and city locations in the UK with high traffic and footfall counts.

The company ended the year with a total of 1,240 stores in the UK. Of these, 378 were company-operated stores and 862 were run by licensees – a 30/70 split approximately, which is flat on last year.

In stores, a trial of freshly baked food products has proved promising and will continue to be rolled out across more stores into FY25 to support consumer convenience.

In October last year, Starbucks Corporation acquired 23.5 Degrees Limited, the brand’s largest local licensing operator in the UK, bringing an additional 113 stores under company-operated ownership in the UK.

Duncan Moir, president of Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa, said: “It has been a difficult period for the sector. We navigated significant macro-economic pressures including inflationary headwinds which have also had an impact on consumer confidence. Despite this, we achieved our goal of opening 100 new stores in the UK.

“We remain committed to further expanding our presence and are today announcing that we will open an additional 80 stores in the UK this year.

“We are focused on regaining momentum by strengthening and scaling how we integrate technology across the business, building on the popularity of our Starbucks Rewards program, and further optimising our menu to ensure we continue delivering on our core offering every time.

And while earnings season typically includes a fair share of reflection on banks' performance during the prior three-month period, this time things are different. The market chaos caused by tariffs that Trump announced last week and then partially put on hold Wednesday will surely dominate earnings-call discussions as executives and analysts ponder a big question:

Will the tariffs push the U.S. economy into a recession?

, Morgan Stanley and Bank of New York Mellon are set to report first, followed next week by the remaining big banks and nearly 20 large and midsize regionals.

Analysts and investors will be watching to see if banks tweak their 2025 earnings forecasts.

The magnitude of the tariffs announcement on April 2 ""seems to have caught many off guard,"" Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays, wrote in a recent research note. ""While it occurred after 1Q25 was in the books, it could reverberate through the tone of management discussions on their earnings calls, as well as on their annual outlooks that were provided in January.""

Given the recent chaos, tariffs and the economic outlook ""now take center stage,"" Scott Siefers, an analyst at Piper Sandler, wrote this week in a research note. ""We doubt we'll get all the answers we want with earnings, but at least banks will have the chance to respond to the emerging backdrop and to shape expectations about how they will perform within it.""

Trump had vowed to stick with his tariffs plan even as market volatility unfolded. The banking sector was hard-hit, with the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index sinking 15% between April 2, when the tariffs were announced, and April 7. Two days later, Trump abruptly changed his mind and said he would pause tariffs on most countries for 90 days. The index rose 9% that day.

Bankers have had to digest a lot since the beginning of the year. Following Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, the administration has issued a barrage of orders, such as threatening (and then implementing) steep tariffs on Mexico and Canada; telling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a bank regulator, to stop work; and calling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives ""illegal,"" which caused several banks to eliminate DEI-related language in their annual reports.

Banks have also had to account for interest rates and how the higher-for-longer environment might shake out this year. In March, the Federal Reserve held benchmark interest rates steady, opting to leave the federal funds rate between 4.25% and 4.5% for the third month in a row.

After Trump announced 10% baseline levies on imports, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said it's too soon to know what the best monetary policy response to the tariffs might be.

Banks have been eager for the Fed to lower rates after hiking them in recent years. Lower rates would mean reduced deposit costs and potentially more commercial loan growth. And some banks could get some relief in their commercial real estate portfolios, which have been stressed.

Analysts and investors will be looking for any signs of loan growth during the first quarter and the lending outlook for the rest of the year amid the tariff uncertainty.

Siefers, in his note, said large-bank loan growth and fee income are at risk, but net interest income outlooks ""should hold in OK for now"" and capital levels remain strong.",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ed9089c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1346x707+0+22/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fc6%2F69%2Fba79397c46cb8c7d16c5e348fcf4%2Ffourbanks2.jpg,N,,2025-04-11 07:01:06.671137

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE: BK) has reported impressive financial results for the first quarter of 2025, showcasing strong revenue growth and profitability. This article delves into their current performance, compares it with expectations, and outlines future guidance.

BNY Mellon Reports Strong Start to 2025, with Q1 Revenue Hitting $4.8 Billion

BNY Mellon reported a strong start to 2025, with total revenue reaching $4.8 billion, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. The company’s financial performance was bolstered by a new commercial coverage strategy and a strategic shift towards integrated client solutions. These initiatives have contributed to a pre-tax margin of 32% and a return on tangible common equity of 24.2%.

CEO Robin Vince highlighted the company’s progress in its transformation journey, emphasizing the importance of operating as a more platform-oriented entity. This strategic shift, coupled with a robust balance sheet, positions BNY Mellon to navigate an uncertain economic landscape effectively.

The first quarter results also included a diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.58, a 26% increase compared to the same period last year. This performance reflects BNY Mellon’s ability to leverage its operational strengths and capitalize on market opportunities.

BNY Beats EPS, Revenue Expectations with Q1 Results

BNY Mellon’s first quarter results surpassed market expectations, which had anticipated an EPS of $1.51 and revenue of $4.76 billion. The reported EPS of $1.58 and revenue of $4.8 billion demonstrate the company’s ability to outperform forecasts and deliver value to shareholders.

The company’s fee revenue increased by 3%, driven by new business and favorable market conditions. Investment and other revenue also saw a significant boost, primarily due to a disposal gain recorded during the quarter. Net interest income rose by 11%, benefiting from the reinvestment of maturing securities at higher yields.

Noninterest expenses increased by 2%, reflecting investments in strategic initiatives and employee merit increases. Despite these expenses, BNY Mellon achieved positive operating leverage, underscoring its operational efficiency and cost management capabilities.

BNY Mellon Prepared to Adapt in a Changing Macro Environment

Looking ahead, BNY Mellon remains cautiously optimistic about its future prospects. The company is prepared to adapt to various macroeconomic scenarios, given the current uncertain operating environment. The strategic focus on platform-oriented operations and a strong capital position will enable BNY Mellon to support clients effectively and maintain financial stability.

BNY Mellon plans to continue its capital distribution strategy, having returned $1.1 billion to common shareholders in the first quarter alone. This included $343 million in dividends and $746 million in share repurchases, reflecting a total payout ratio of 95% year-to-date.

The company’s commitment to maintaining a strong capital base is evident in its capital ratios, with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.2% and a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.5%. These metrics highlight BNY Mellon’s focus on sustaining a healthy financial position while pursuing growth opportunities.

As part of its latest developments, Google Cloud announced partnerships with Deloitte, Capgemini, Intuit, KPMG, and Accenture, aiming to accelerate the adoption of agentic AI, simplify tax preparations, provide multi-agent AI solutions, and support advanced capabilities. The news comes just after Lloyds Banking Group started utilising Google Cloud’s AI and data science capabilities to optimise customer and employee experience.

Developing agentic AI

In a bid to further grow their agentic AI capabilities, Deloitte, Capgemini, and Accenture expanded their partnerships with Google Cloud, with the three companies seeking to work with the firm on several initiatives. For example, Deloitte, which has also extended its collaboration with ServiceNow, aims to allow its clients to expand their agentic AI capabilities, with the company looking to roll out a suite of over 100 ready-to-deploy agents. This is set to be facilitated by Google’s Gemini models and Agentspace and focuses on optimising customer interactions and improving employee experiences. Additionally, Deloitte is working with Google Cloud and ServiceNow on Agent2Agent (A2A), Google Cloud’s open interoperability protocol, to allow communication between agents across platforms and services.

When it comes to Capgemini, the company entered a strategic agentic AI deal with Google Cloud to augment customer experiences and increase value for clients. Following a pre-existing alliance between the two, the move is set to enable Capgemini to develop industry-specific agentic AI solutions focused on managing customer requests across communication channels across the web, social media, and mobile to scale employee productivity. At the same time, through Google Cloud’s technology, Capgemini seeks to develop solutions that optimise customer services through intelligent automation and customer insights.

Furthermore, Accenture expanded its relationship with Google Cloud to introduce additional capabilities to assist organisations in scaling cloud and AI technologies. The new services, which centre on agentic AI, networking, and mainframe modernisation, are set to facilitate intelligence, increase enterprise efficiency, and enable growth for worldwide organisations across industries.

Offering multi-agent AI solutions

By extending its partnership with Google Cloud, KPMG seeks to deliver modular, scalable AI solutions that focus on augmenting business operations for its clients in legal services, banking, and other industries. Becoming a deployment partner for Google Agentspace is set to enable KPMG to assist users in developing integrated and scalable AI platforms that can optimise decision-making and the handling of AI agents. Additionally, these services are set to utilise Agentspace, Vertex AI Agent Builder, and Agent Development Kit, with KPMG planning to work with Google Cloud to design new AI features and systems for joint clients via the latter’s A2A interoperability protocol.

Whilst President Donald Trump launched his tariff onslaught at the beginning of April – narrowly missing the first reporting period of the year – lenders are expected to factor the fallout into their future outlook.

Jason Napier, head of banks at UBS, said: “We expect the first quarter UK bank earnings season to be characterised by solid numbers and investors who are entirely focused on the outlook for post tariff trading.

“We see the UK as relatively insulated against policy rate downsides (higher rates, hedges, lower tariffs), and with lenders possessing good cost control and credit quality, and some potential for a more constructive policy backdrop.”

FTSE 100 lenders have suffered some of the biggest blows as the tariff saga unfolded.

The FTSE 350 bank index plunged to a low of 4,700.07 as the global trade war ramped up. This marked a near 1,000 point drop from 5,645.28 ahead of Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ levies.

HSBC, Barclays and Standard Chartered stock dropped ‘too far’

Losses saw lenders reverse their year-to-date gains.

Despite soaring over ten per cent on Thursday after Trump rolled back tariffs, Barclays returned broadly in line to where it began the year – near 270p.

HSBC made gains of nearly six per cent Thursday morning, but was down nearly four per cent from the start of the year.

However, UBS analysis said stock declines in Barclays, Standard Chartered and HSBC had fallen 13-18 per cent “too far”.

The three lenders have been the most exposed to the impact of tariffs.

HSBC and Standard Chartered have significant operations in Asia, which have been hit with the steepest levies. Barclays’ investment bank is tied to market activity and investor volatility resulted in the shares taking a hit.

However, Napier said Barclays was the “top capital market play in Europe” due to its stronger balance between trading and advisory than its European peers.

He added: “How low policy rates go and how long they stay there are the key questions”.",https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1500530340-e1744284648122.jpg,N,,2025-04-11 07:00:32.844593

The HVAC giant is expected to release its Q1 2025 earnings on Thursday, Apr.
Ahead of this event, analysts expect Carrier Global to post adjusted earnings of $0.57 per share, down 8.1% from $0.62 per share in the same quarter last year.
Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings surged nearly 50% year-over-year to $0.54 per share, which surpassed analysts' projections by 5.9%.

Based in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, the company operates through Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC), and Refrigeration segments.

The HVAC giant is expected to release its Q1 2025 earnings on Thursday, Apr. 24. Ahead of this event, analysts expect Carrier Global to post adjusted earnings of $0.57 per share, down 8.1% from $0.62 per share in the same quarter last year. On a positive note, the company has surpassed Wall Street's bottom-line estimates in each of the past four quarters.

Meanwhile, for fiscal 2025, analysts expect CARR to report an adjusted EPS of $2.99, up a staggering 16.8% from $2.56 in fiscal 2024. Moreover, its earnings are expected to further grow 13.7% year-over-year to $3.40 in fiscal 2026.

Shares of CARR have gained 3.8% over the past 52 weeks, slightly outpacing the S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 2.1% uptick and the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLI) marginal dip during the same time frame.

CARR posted mixed Q4 2024 results on Feb. 11, sending the stock down by 1.6%. Driven by a solid 11% organic increase in the HVAC segment's sales and an impressive 21.6% year-over-year growth in product sales to $4.5 billion, the company's overall topline soared 19.3% to $5.1 billion. However, this figure fell short of Street's expectations by a notable margin. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings surged nearly 50% year-over-year to $0.54 per share, which surpassed analysts' projections by 5.9%.

Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, while the company projects its sales to range between $22.5 billion to $23 billion representing a modest increase from $22.5 billion of revenues reported in fiscal 2024, CARR expects its adjusted EPS to range between $2.95 and $3.05 significantly up from $2.56 reported in fiscal 2024.

Furthermore, analysts' consensus view on Carrier Global is moderately optimistic, with a ""Moderate Buy"" rating overall. Among 22 analysts covering the stock, 13 suggest a ""Strong Buy,"" one gives a ""Moderate Buy,"" and eight recommend a ""Hold” rating. Its mean price target of $78.74 represents a 33.3% premium to current price levels.

Newman will take over the role on April 21 and Compton-Phillips starts on May 19, CVS announced on April 8.
In addition to the executive changes, CVS said in a news release that it now expects to “meet or exceed” its full-year guidance of $5.75 to $6 per share.
Newman spent five years as EVP and CFO at UPS after 26 years in numerous leadership roles at PepsiCo.
She’s taking over from former EVP and chief medical officer Sreekanth Chaguturu, who was named EVP and president of healthcare delivery in November.","CVS named two new executives to its leadership team as the company tries to bounce back from a year that saw its net income cut nearly in half.

The retail pharmacy giant named UPS veteran Brian Newman as its new EVP and CFO and Press Ganey expert Amy Compton-Phillips as its new EVP and chief medical officer. Newman will take over the role on April 21 and Compton-Phillips starts on May 19, CVS announced on April 8.

“As I continue to build out my leadership team, I am confident that Brian and Amy will help us continue the momentum we have built over the past several months,” CVS Health President and CEO David Joyner said in a statement.

Some background. Joyner took the reins from former CEO Karen Lynch in October 2024, and the company has since made several changes in attempts to boost the company’s financial performance, including appointing a new head of insurer arm Aetna and implementing a $2 billion cost-savings plan.

Following the news of the executive changes, CVS shares rose about 9% from $63.84 to $69.97, also buoyed by the announcement of higher-than-expected reimbursement rates for 2026 Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, according to Reuters.

In addition to the executive changes, CVS said in a news release that it now expects to “meet or exceed” its full-year guidance of $5.75 to $6 per share. The company had warned in November that its 2025 earnings would fall short of expectations.

A look at their résumés. Both of the newly appointed executives have extensive experience in various leadership roles.

Newman spent five years as EVP and CFO at UPS after 26 years in numerous leadership roles at PepsiCo. He’s taking over from Thomas Cowhey, who has been CVS Health’s CFO for the past year and a half and will move into a temporary strategic advisory role from May 12 to a yet-to-be determined end date, according to an SEC filing.

In his new role, Newman is expected to get a hefty paycheck of $1 million annually, with a potential bonus of up to 150% of his salary depending on his performance, per the filing.

Compton-Phillips served as president and chief physician executive of Press Ganey, a healthcare performance improvement firm, for the past two years after spending seven years as president of clinical operations at Providence Health. She also spent 22 years in multiple roles at Oakland, California-based health system Kaiser Permanente. She’s taking over from former EVP and chief medical officer Sreekanth Chaguturu, who was named EVP and president of healthcare delivery in November.

The SEC filing didn’t disclose Compton-Phillip’s compensation.

What analysts think. James Harlow, SVP at Novare Capital Management, an investment management firm that invests in CVS, told Reuters that a “major piece” of CVS’s recovery depends on restoring the executive team’s credibility, and that bringing in someone with CFO experience at another major company is a good step.

Investment firm Leerink Partners’s senior managing director and analyst Michael Cherny seemed to agree, writing in a note that the executive change was “a bit surprising,” but Newman’s experience leading a large public company is “helpful to address the complexity of CVS’s broad enterprise.”

“The commentary on guidance is equally important, with the company’s expectations to be at/above its previous guidance an important starting point to build momentum in what for CVS is a rebuild year,” Cherny continued. “All-in we think the most important factor here is building momentum, which today’s comments and last night’s positive MA rates would seem to suggest is happening.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/4835f69aeadb1a69100302ef22eac8fa6a6a612d-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-04-11 12:19:34.784634

About Apply Digital We are a global digital transformation partner for change agents.","A new study from Apply Digital, the digital transformation partner for global brands, reveals the extent to which businesses in North America and the UK are embracing artificial intelligence to personalize customer experience at scale.

Based on a survey of 400 senior business leaders across both markets, the report finds that AI is rapidly becoming a foundation for real-time personalization. The most used application is personalized email messaging, which is already employed by 61% of brands, with a further 22% planning to introduce it within 12 months.

Seasonal promotional offers and discounts are another high growth area, which are currently employed by 52% of respondents with a further third (32%) planning to introduce it. Location-based recommendations are another key area of investment for marketers, half (52%) have deployed AI to enhance their offer to date, and 33% intend to do so in the next 12 months.

The report’s author, Brian Browning, VP of Enterprise Solutions at Apply Digital, comments: “Personalization is being rapidly upgraded with AI as marketers move from the experimentation stages to making this a strategic priority. Brands on both sides of the Atlantic, no matter their size or sector, are increasingly embedding this transformative technology to create smarter, more relevant experiences.”

While all sectors — including B2B, retail, media and entertainment, CPG, and sports — are all investing heavily in AI, there is a clear regional difference, with the US leading on current adoption overall. However, British businesses show stronger short-term intent as they look to close the gap.

The report, 2025 Leadership Priorities in Personalization, also highlights how this wave of AI adoption is being driven by shifting consumer expectations. Nearly seven in ten consumers — and 80% of those aged 18 to 24 — say they value personalized experiences. But with that comes rising demand for transparency: nearly 40% want more control over how their data is collected and used.

Browning adds: “AI technology now means brands can offer true one-to-one experiences at scale, and it seems almost everyone is looking to leverage this capability. But the winners will be those who personalize with empathy, transparency and trust. AI is an amazing tool, but it must be used wisely.”

With further investment planned — over half of all leaders surveyed expect to spend more than $1 million on personalization in 2025 — the report suggests that it is becoming a defining capability for modern businesses.

As agentic AI tools such as digital assistants become more widely used – notably, 30% of brands intend to introduce AI-powered chatbots in the next 12 months – the customer experience will be shaped not just by people, but by the intelligent systems that act on their behalf.

Across payments, trade finance and servicing, the bank remains focused on delivering infrastructure that supports FIs' ability to scale without having to replicate global capabilities internally.","BNY’s treasury services business was one of the first in the organisation to implement the new platforms operating model, aimed at grouping like-activities together into platforms that create scale in adaptable and reusable ways across the company.

Fabian Khoshbakht, head of treasury services for Asia Pacific (APAC) and global head of client insight and innovation for treasury services explained that under the new model, treasury services is less siloed. “By simplifying, streamlining and collaborating through cross-functional teams, we create more intuitive client journeys and improve our ability to anticipate unmet needs.”

He acknowledged that the transformation is still in progress but said it has already led to greater agility and a new culture of commerciality. “We are going to market much faster, because of how the platform’s operating model has enabled teams to deliver goals using agile ways.”

Khoshbakht explained that the change is more than operational. “We are an enabler,” he said. “Leveraging our infrastructure, data and insights—we are empowering our clients to solve their business challenges.”

This is particularly significant in Asia Pacific, where financial institutions (FIs) operate in diverse markets with varying regulatory, technological and competitive landscapes. BNY’s ability to deliver global consistency while adapting to local client needs will be critical to supporting APAC clients in the long run.

Expanding payments and liquidity access for FIs in APAC

BNY’s institutional payments business in APAC is evolving alongside client demand for faster, more reliable and more transparent cross-border infrastructure. The bank supports over 2,000 FIs globally and processes $2.5 trillion in payments value each day, and over 100 currencies served in foreign exchange (FX) payments. This infrastructure enables regional and local FIs to access dollar clearing, improve operational predictability and broaden corridor coverage.

Jonathan Hickey, market manager for payments product, described BNY’s payment franchise as one of scale and neutrality. “We do not serve retail or corporate clients for transaction banking in APAC, and that is important,” he said. “We do not compete with our clients for their end customers; we enable our clients to support their customers.” He positioned BNY’s payments infrastructure as a platform that enables other FIs to scale globally and optimise performance without conflict. “We enable our clients to scale and adapt without having to build everything themselves.”

Hickey also detailed how this strategy plays out across APAC corridors. He highlighted a collaboration with Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) to deliver near real-time inbound payments into Australia. “The solution allows BNY’s global clients to have funds received in under 60 seconds by Australian beneficiaries, regardless of the bank in which the beneficiary uses domestically,” he said. “We handle the inbound transaction and connect to the real-time payment rails in Australia.”

Hickey also pointed to BNY’s use of smart routing to ensure that cross-border payments are processed through the most efficient corridors, depending on currency, counterparty and destination market.

Junyi Kuah, head of international cash management solutions highlighted the introduction of virtual accounts for FI clients in 2024. “Our implementation supports both collections and payments.” He noted that BNY’s virtual accounts also allow FIs to open sub-ledger accounts under their clients’ names. “This is especially useful for our Asia-based clients that want to offer US-based collection services to their end customers but do not have domestic capabilities,” he said.

Embedding data and AI to enhance delivery and client enablement

Khoshbakht presented BNY’s progressive use of data and artificial intelligence (AI) as part of a broader effort to modernise service delivery, drive internal productivity and create better client outcomes. He explained that the goal is to transform the client experience by embedding data directly into the infrastructure and servicing model, moving beyond static reporting or post-event analysis.

Khoshbakht said, “Data is part of how we deliver. It helps us pre-empt issues, support our clients more intelligently and run more resilient operations.”

He illustrated the shift with specific internal initiatives. “We have reduced exceptions in our payments business by applying machine learning,” he noted. “We use predictive models to help identify when a payment might fail, and we can intervene before it breaks.” He said that the improvement in straight-through processing (STP) rate has been enabled increasingly by AI to reduce the remaining friction.

Beyond automation, the focus is on visibility and enablement. “We are using data to surface insights that our frontline teams can act on,” he said. “That includes operational performance, risk triggers and relationship context. We want to give our people the tools to help our clients.”

Khoshbakht stressed that AI deployment is measured and targeted. “We are focused on where it solves a problem—whether that is exception management, client escalation, or internal process improvement.”

He noted that while data and AI are often marketed as futuristic or transformational, BNY’s application is grounded in operational discipline. “We are solving very real problems—manual workarounds, fragmented processes, inconsistent visibility—and we are doing it at scale,” he said.

Khoshbakht acknowledged that expectations from clients are rising. “We are investing our technology to meet those expectations, and we do that with accountability.”

Strengthening implementation and service delivery with an integrated client model

Amy Tong, international head of client implementation and service for APAC as well as Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), outlined how BNY has evolved its approach to client onboarding and servicing to support the growing client needs internationally.

“The business is becoming more complex, and expectations are rising; hence the capability to enable our client experience seamlessly is key,” she said. “We are seeing clients launch products quickly and expect infrastructure and providers like us to move just as fast.” She noted that clients expect a trusted institution like BNY to provide real-time, on-demand access to onboarding progress and servicing updates, particularly when operating across markets and time zones.

To meet this challenge, BNY has developed a more integrated client servicing framework that bridges the end-to-end client journey powered by data and proactive engagement with clients. “We’re building greater alignment across the entire value chain with a client-focused mindset.”

Building scalable trade finance infrastructure through digital connectivity

Angelia Toh, trade finance structurer for treasury services in Asia Pacific, introduced TNAS as a response to the challenges posed by the shrinking network of active relationship management application (RMA) in the documentary trade space. “There is a cost to maintaining the monitoring, the know-your-customer (KYC) and the documentation required,” said Toh.

She explained that TNAS helps financial institutions bridge this gap by enabling them to route letters of credit (LCs) and trade messages through BNY’s active correspondent network. “We act as the first advising bank, stepping in to advise and forward the LC, while facilitating the compliance, workability and documentation checks,” Toh said. “This allows banks that may not have direct RMA (relationship management application) coverage to continue supporting their clients without operational disruption.”

The service was formally launched in early 2024, following two years of piloting. “Mizuho in Japan and Golomt Bank in Mongolia were among the early adopters,” she said. “And since its launch, we have seen strong interest from banks across different parts of the region.”

Toh stressed that TNAS is not just about message routing. “We are adding value by performing compliance checks before the message is sent,” she said. This pre-validation step, she noted, helps reduce disputes and rejections, especially when dealing with less familiar counterparties or complex LC structures.

The platform is accessed through a secure, self-service portal that allows banks to view where BNY has active RMAs, submit requests for new coverage and track the status of transactions. “We have built it to be intuitive and flexible,” Toh said. “You can see in real time whether we can advise or confirm a transaction for a given counterparty.”

One additional feature of TNAS is its support for LC confirmation and discounting, providing risk mitigation for banks that are unable or unwilling to take on exposure to certain issuers.

Toh emphasised that “We are not competing with our FI clients. Our role is to make trade connectivity simpler, more reliable and more scalable.”

The adoption of TNAS, particularly in APAC, reflects the broader trend of financial institutions seeking to preserve trade capabilities while reducing overhead and compliance complexity. “It is not always economical for FIs to maintain bilateral RMAs for every possible counterparty,” she said. “But through TNAS, we can extend that access on their behalf.”

Extending infrastructure to underserved markets and FIs

BNY’s treasury services strategy in APAC includes a deliberate focus on FIs and markets that have traditionally lacked access to reliable correspondent infrastructure. This includes new digital banks, niche regional players and institutions operating in emerging markets with limited USD clearing options or access to global networks.

Yew Fei Yeow, head of treasury services for South and Southeast Asia, outlined BNY’s engagement with these underserved segments. “Many of these institutions are at an early stage of growth,” he said. “We see long-term value in supporting their growth and providing access to global clearing and payment infrastructure.”

He highlighted how BNY has worked with newly licensed digital banks in Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea. “These banks have limited or no presence outside their home markets, and they look to us to provide capabilities that they don’t have,” Yeow said. “We can offer them access to USD clearing, liquidity and payment rails that they would otherwise need to build from scratch.” BNY’s ability to support these clients rests on its neutral position as a non-competing infrastructure provider. “That makes us a more acceptable provider for institutions that might otherwise be wary of working with providers that also have retail ambitions,” said Yeow.

In Cambodia, BNY is supporting local FIs by collaborating with them in their digital transformation journey. “The Cambodian banks show strong interest in familiarising with the evolving regulatory environment while improving their compliance standards,” he said. “We are a trusted advisor who regularly engages the local regulator and commercial banks, and can exchange viewpoints to help them, as they navigate their management of compliance and operational risk.”

Yeow acknowledged that onboarding and compliance remain critical hurdles in some of these markets. “We believe in investing in long-term relationships. Once the infrastructure is in place, it opens up many more possibilities for the client.”

Aligning global infrastructure with regional execution

BNY’s execution in APAC demonstrates a methodical extension of its global platform strategy—bringing together infrastructure, technology and institutional servicing in a model that emphasises enablement. The region’s complexity, shaped by regulatory diversity and varying levels of digital maturity, has made it a proving ground for the bank’s unified operating approach.

Across payments, trade finance and servicing, the bank remains focused on delivering infrastructure that supports FIs' ability to scale without having to replicate global capabilities internally. Whether through its role as a USD clearing service provider, an intermediary for documentary trade, or a provider of integrated onboarding and servicing, BNY consistently positions itself as a neutral and reliable counterparty.

BNY’s investments in data and AI, while targeted, are enabling it to move toward more predictive and transparent operations—supporting both its internal teams and clients in managing complexity and exceptions. Meanwhile, its outreach to underserved segments, including digital banks and institutions in emerging markets, reflects a long-term strategy to embed itself into the foundational infrastructure of developing financial ecosystems.

What remains is the challenge of continuing to meet rising expectations in transparency, configurability and time-to-value, particularly as fintechs and digital-native institutions reshape service benchmarks. BNY’s platform model provides a scalable foundation—but its regional success will ultimately depend on how well it continues to adapt that foundation to the specific demands of its APAC clients.",https://www.theasianbanker.com/uploads/tabmanila/20250409 TAB-BNY-MainBanner-855x480.webp,N,,2025-04-11 05:01:44.941726

""Of particular concern is the potential fragmentation of global trade along geopolitical lines,"" she wrote in a statement late Wednesday.","President Donald Trump delivered another jarring reversal in American trade policy Wednesday, suspending for 90 days import taxes he'd imposed barely 13 hours earlier on dozens of countries while escalating his trade war with China.

The moves triggered a powerful stock market rally on Wall Street but left businesses, investors and America's trading partners bewildered about what the president is attempting to achieve.

The U-turn came after the sweeping global tariffs Trump announced last week set off a four-day rout in global financial markets, paralyzed businesses and raised fears the U.S. and world economies would tumble into recession.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tried to characterize the sudden change in policy as part of a grand negotiating strategy. But to those outside the Trump administration, it looked like a cave-in to market pressure and to growing fears that the president's impetuous use of import taxes — tariffs — would cause massive collateral economic damage.

""Other countries will welcome the 90-day stay of execution — if it lasts — but the whiplash from constant zig-zags creates more of the uncertainty that businesses and governments hate,"" said Daniel Russel, vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. ""The Administration's blunt-force tactics have rattled allies, who see the sudden reversal as damage control following the market meltdown, rather than a pivot to respectful, balanced negotiations.''

MORE | Eye On Your Money:

Trump's turnaround Wednesday capped a wild week in U.S. trade policy. On Wednesday April 2 — which Trump labeled ""Liberation Day'' — the president announced plans to impose tariffs on almost every country on earth, upending the world trading system. The first of his new tariffs — a 10% ""baseline'' tax on imports from most countries — went into effect Saturday.

At midnight Wednesday, he upped the ante by slapping what he called ""reciprocal'' taxes on countries he accused of unfair trading practices and adding to U.S. trade deficits. Those are the tariffs he suspended for 90 days, saying the pause would give countries time to negotiate with him and his trade team.

There was one exception to the reprieve: He raised the tariff on Chinese imports to a staggering 125%, punishing Beijing for announcing retaliatory tariffs on the United States. That number was adjusted even higher on Thursday — to 145% — after the White House accounted for Trump's previous 20% fentanyl tariffs. Meanwhile, the 10% baseline tariffs on most countries – a substantial act of protectionism in their own right – remain in place.

Companies cut back, delay plans

Trump's ever-changing trade war tactics — which include earlier levies on cars, steel and aluminum, and Mexico and Canada — have already done damage, forcing dazed companies to delay or cancel plans as they tried to figure out what Trump was doing and how they should respond.

Some companies temporarily laid off workers after Trump's widespread tariffs were announced, while there were signs that many firms held off on hiring amid the widespread uncertainty the tariffs created.

Carmaker Stellantis temporarily cut 900 jobs at factories in Michigan and Indiana after production was halted at two plants in Canada and Mexico in the wake of Trump's 25% duties on imported cars.

And Cleveland-Cliffs laid off 1,200 workers at a factory in Michigan and an iron ore mine in Minnesota in response to a drop in demand from auto companies. Cleveland-Cliffs said it would resume production at the two facilities once auto production returned to the U.S.

Minutes from the Federal Reserve's March 18-19 meeting, released Wednesday, showed that many of its policymakers said that their business contacts ""reported pausing hiring decisions because of elevated policy uncertainty.""

And Delta Air Lines said earlier Wednesday that demand for domestic leisure trips and corporate travel has stalled because of the uncertainty around global trade. In a conference call with investors, the company said it was cutting capacity. It also declined to provide a full-year financial forecast.

""Right now, it's hard to know how this is going to play out, given that this is somewhat self-imposed,"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian said. ""I'm hopeful that sanity will prevail and we'll move through this period of time on the global trade front relatively quickly.""

Desperately seeking clarity on Trump's tariffs

Businesses have sought greater clarity around Trump's ultimate tariff policies for weeks. It's not clear that the 90-day pause has reduced their uncertainty.

Jeff Jaisli, CEO of the New Jersey-based importer/exporter Jagro, said Trump's Truth Social post on Wednesday had made things ""even worse'' and more confusing. He was trying to figure out which tariffs applied to which countries.

""We're scrambling to find correct information and procedures for entries we're processing NOW in real time,'' he said by email. He could find no guidance on the websites of the White House or the Customs and Border Protection agency, which collects tariffs. Earlier, Jaisli called Trump's tariffs ""a grenade that was thrown into the room that's going to cause chaos.''

Trump's trade war with China escalates

Trump's tariffs have set off a tit-for-tat trade war with China, the world's second-biggest economy. Even before Trump upped his taxes on China to 145%, the Chinese had set their own tariffs on the United States at 84%.

The World Trade Organization's director-general, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, warned that the rising tension could reduce U.S.-China merchandise trade by 80% and ""severely damage the global economic outlook.""

""Of particular concern is the potential fragmentation of global trade along geopolitical lines,"" she wrote in a statement late Wednesday. ""A division of the global economy into two blocs could lead to a long-term reduction in global real GDP by nearly 7%.""

Citing WTO projections, she warned the negative effects could ripple through to other economies, especially developing ones. She urged countries to ensure an open global trading system and resolve differences through cooperation.

Meanwhile, U.S. companies struggled to figure out how to respond to huge levies on Chinese products they'd come to rely on.

Jessica Bettencourt is CEO of Klem's, a third-generation store in Spencer, Massachusetts that sells everything from lawn and garden items to workwear and gifts. She said that the escalation of tariffs from China have made her stop ordering any new fourth-quarter product that is holiday, gifts or toys. She is also reconsidering any fall apparel and footwear orders that aren't already placed.

""The worst thing is uncertainty and we have massive uncertainty,"" said Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe, a global marketing and communications company. ""No one can make any moves. Everybody is trying to save as much cash and defer any unnecessary expense. People are getting laid off. Orders are getting cancelled. Expansion plans are being put on hold.""

According to S&P Global, from January to March, 188 bankruptcy applications were filed by large US companies, a notable increase from 139 in the same period last year, which had already marked a 14-year high.

The 188 bankruptcy filings were also the highest since the same period in 2010, when 254 filings were recorded due to the economic downturn following the global financial crisis.

S&P Global wrote that as a large amount of debt matures, companies now need to refinance at higher interest rates than when they issued the debt, posing ongoing challenges for many firms, especially those with weaker balance sheets.

The report pointed out that for companies with non-investment-grade ratings, financial metrics based on Market Intelligence data indicate that they are grappling with rising debt pressures, and their ability to pay interest with available cash has also become slightly insufficient.

In Q1 of this year, the industrial sector saw the highest number of bankruptcies at 32, followed by non-essential consumer goods companies with 24. These industries together accounted for nearly 30% of the total bankruptcies in Q1.

Meanwhile, the industrial and non-essential consumer goods sectors of the S&P 500 index also fell by 0.53% and 13.97%, respectively, in Q1.

The report showed that among the notable companies filing for bankruptcy in Q1 with liabilities exceeding $1 billion were F21 OpCo LLC, the owner of the Forever 21 clothing chain, EV manufacturer Nikola, and craft retailer Joann.

Other well-known companies entering bankruptcy proceedings included the Hooters restaurant chain and genetic testing company 23andMe.

Of course, although the number of large company bankruptcies in Q1 rose YoY, it remained far below the levels during the financial crisis—peaking at 1,836 in Q1 2009. Since 2020, the highest monthly total of bankruptcy filings was in July 2020, with 74 applications.

However, as the unpopular tariff policies of the Trump administration continue to cause turmoil in financial markets, some industry insiders are now concerned that more companies may face bankruptcy in the face of potential US economic recession risks. Cailian Press previously mentioned that the CDS (credit default swaps) for US high-yield bonds have surged recently, and junk bonds are becoming increasingly precarious.

Boaz Weinstein, founder of Saba Capital Management, recently warned that tariff tensions have accelerated the sell-off of corporate bonds and could trigger a wave of bankruptcies at a faster pace than previous market crises.

All eyes, then, are on Vietnam – Nike’s most important production base.
Betting on Vietnam Nike entered Vietnam in 1995 with five contract footwear factories, part of a long-term bet by co-founder Phil Knight.
In 1998, he pledged to root out child labour from Nike’s supply chain in a speech in Washington DC.
Since then, Nike’s footprint in Vietnam has only increased, adding more factories as the industry gained infrastructure and manufacturing experience.","NEW YORK: At Nike Inc headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, executives are trying to figure out how to best spread the pain of new tariffs.

Nike, the factories that produce its goods, the wholesalers that sell the goods and ultimately shoppers will all likely share portions of the cost, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named discussing private conversations.

The backbone of Nike’s supply chain is being threatened by President Donald Trump’s global tariff campaign, straining a decades-long investment just as the world’s largest sneaker company tries to rebound under a new chief executive officer.

Over the past 30 years, Nike has funnelled billions of dollars of production into Vietnam, helping turn the southeast Asian nation into a powerhouse for footwear and apparel production.

On Wednesday, Trump imposed a 46% tariff on goods from Vietnam – among the steepest of the countries he targeted – that threatens to devastate its manufacturing industries.

The announcement was then thrown into limbo hours later when Trump said he would pause higher tariffs on dozens of non-retaliating countries for 90 days. Nike shares rose 7.2% at 1:30 pm in New York after Trump posted about the pause on social media.

Nike has become a symbol of corporate fallout from Trump’s tariff blitz: a famed US brand entangled in an economic calamity that’s wiped trillions from stocks and pushed global supply chains into disarray.

Executives have been left with a costly conundrum across Asia, where nearly all Nike sneakers are made.

The timing couldn’t be worse. New CEO Elliott Hill, a longtime Nike executive who came out of retirement in October, is attempting to revive a company weighed down by slumping sales and corporate layoffs.

Nike expects further declines in revenue and profitability, and shares have fallen 30% so far this year.

Hill must now navigate rising costs across his supply chain, with the possibility of passing price hikes on to consumers.

In March, he told investors that he visited factory partners in Asia “to see how we’re executing,” but has yet to outline a plan to manage tariff fallout. A representative for Nike didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Management’s options are limited, and analysts say it’s impossible for Nike to quickly reorient its supply chain.

Vietnam, China and Indonesia – all hard-hit by Trump tariffs – account for 95% of Nike footwear production. The total workforce that manufactures Nike products in those three countries is roughly 850,000 – slightly larger than Apple Inc supplier Foxconn, according to company disclosures.

TD Cowen analyst John Kernan said there’s simply nowhere else with the comparable capacity or labour costs to absorb that volume.

All eyes, then, are on Vietnam – Nike’s most important production base.

Betting on Vietnam

Nike entered Vietnam in 1995 with five contract footwear factories, part of a long-term bet by co-founder Phil Knight.

It was a gamble because the industry was still developing and its workforce lacked experience and oversight, but Knight saw opportunity.

“I always vowed that someday Nike would have a factory in or near Saigon,” which is now known as Ho Chi Minh City, Knight said in his memoir.

Nike’s presence was immediately scrutinised. After a labour scandal erupted, Knight flew to Vietnam to confront the crisis. In 1998, he pledged to root out child labour from Nike’s supply chain in a speech in Washington DC.

Since then, Nike’s footprint in Vietnam has only increased, adding more factories as the industry gained infrastructure and manufacturing experience.

Rivals like Adidas AG and Puma SE followed, as did newer brands such as Lululemon Athletica Inc, Skechers USA Inc and Allbirds Inc. Half of all Nike brand sneakers are made in Vietnam now, according to filings.

Vietnam’s footwear and apparel industries were big winners during Trump’s first term. Geopolitical tensions pushed Western brands out of China and they flocked to Vietnam, with its established manufacturing history and infrastructure.

Vietnam now ranks among the world’s top exporters of both apparel and footwear, according to the World Bank.

Vietnam’s government has lauded Nike’s investments as vital to their economy’s growth.

The nation has been among Asia’s fastest-growing economies in recent years, with gross domestic product up 7.1% last year, surpassing both government projections and estimates from analysts.

That mutual dependence has led to a close relationship between Nike and Vietnam’s government. Officials in Hanoi have hosted Nike executives, including a chief operating officer, in recent years.

In 2022, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh asked the company for policy recommendations to deepen Vietnam’s integration into global supply chains.

Limited options

These days, Nike works with over 100 apparel factories, footwear plants and equipment makers in Vietnam, the company has disclosed.

Most are clustered around Ho Chi Minh City, where major contractors each employ over 10,000 workers.

Nike could pressure vendors to take on more of the new costs, streamline operations or coordinate with retail partners to raise prices, said Anna Andreeva, an analyst at Piper Sandler. But she warned there’s a ceiling.

“That’s the number one question: How much price increase can the consumer realistically absorb?” Andreeva said.

Executives at Foot Locker, Nike’s biggest retail partner, said last week that they’re in “constant communications” with brands on pricing strategy as they mull how much of these tariff costs will end up being placed on US shoppers.

“We’re going to work through brand by brand,” Foot Locker chief executive officer Mary Dillon said at a JPMorgan event last week.

“It’s a combination of ‘What do they take? What does the consumer take?’”

Meanwhile, Vietnam’s government has been working to placate Trump. Last Saturday, Vietnam’s leader To Lam asked Trump to delay his tariffs for at least 45 days to allow for negotiations.

He offered to cut tariffs on US goods to zero and encouraged Trump to do the same.

Trump said the call was “very productive.” But White House adviser Peter Navarro said Vietnam’s offer wasn’t enough.

Vietnam upped the offer on Tuesday, promising to buy more US defence and security products. — Bloomberg",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/04/11/3258655.jpg,N,,2025-04-11 04:02:56.410455

U.S.-based construction tools manufacturer DEWALT, a subsidiary of Stanley Black & Decker, has officially expanded its operations into Kenya, marking a significant move that underscores the company’s commitment to Africa’s fast-growing construction market.

The globally renowned brand made a strong impression during its recent participation at The Big 5 Construct Kenya 2024, where it unveiled a range of innovative power tools and construction technologies tailored for the African market.

The event served as a strategic platform to introduce DEWALT’s advanced solutions to local industry professionals and stakeholders.

“Our expansion into Kenya is more than a business move—it’s a long-term commitment to contribute to the development of Africa’s infrastructure through cutting-edge technology and durable, high-performance tools,” said Umair Shahzad, Commercial Director at DEWALT, during an exclusive briefing at the exhibition.

Supporting Kenya’s Construction Boom

Kenya’s booming infrastructure and housing development sectors present an attractive opportunity for global construction brands.

With rapid urbanization and increased government spending on mega-projects, demand for reliable and efficient construction equipment has surged.

DEWALT’s entry into the Kenyan market aims to support this growth by offering professional-grade tools that enhance productivity, safety, and efficiency on job sites.

From cordless drills to heavy-duty saws and the revolutionary FlexVolt battery system, the brand is introducing solutions designed to meet the rigorous demands of African construction professionals.

Local Distribution and Accessibility

While DEWALT products have been available in Kenya through independent retailers such as Shopit and PowerTools Kenya, the latest move marks a shift toward direct market engagement.

The company has ramped up local support, training programs, and after-sales service infrastructure, signaling a more entrenched presence in East Africa.

“We’re not just selling tools—we’re empowering Kenyan professionals with technology that meets international standards,” said Ezhl Erkeslm, Trade Marketing Manager for DEWALT Middle East and Africa.

A Strategic Foothold in Africa

The Kenyan expansion forms part of DEWALT’s broader strategy to tap into Africa’s construction growth corridors, with Kenya serving as a key gateway to East and Central Africa.

With this move, DEWALT joins a growing list of international firms positioning themselves to serve Africa’s urban transformation.

About DEWALT

Founded in 1924, DEWALT is a leading manufacturer of professional-grade power tools, hand tools, and accessories used in construction, woodworking, and manufacturing industries.

With a legacy of innovation and rugged performance, DEWALT products are trusted by millions of professionals around the world.

Under this directive, all rail infrastructure is to transition to open, regulated access by 2030.
However, the Ivanhoe team was turned away twice at the Tokadeh Mines gate in Nimba County.
On March 21 and again on March 22, AML's security personnel denied access to the ESIA team, despite them presenting a formal government letter authorizing their entry.
ESIAs are a legal and technical prerequisite under Liberian law for any infrastructure project with potential environmental and community impact.","The Observer has obtained documents from Government sources indicating that efforts by the Government of Liberia to advance its multiuser rail policy was temporarily obstructed this past month, when ArcelorMittal Liberia (AML) refused Ivanhoe Liberia's Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) team access to non-operational areas under its current concession, where Ivanhoe Atlantic and the GOL are negotiating for investment purposes.

The incident, which occurred between March 20 and 23, highlights growing tension between AML and the Government over the future of Liberia's critical rail and iron ore port infrastructure.

The ESIA mission ordered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and further sanctioned by both the Ministries of Mines and Energy (MME) and Transport (MoT), was intended to enable Ivanhoe to conduct environmental baseline studies as part of its preparatory steps toward using the Yekepa-to-Buchanan rail.

The exercise mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and supported by letters from Mines Minister Wilmot Paye, and Transport Minister Sirleaf Tyler requesting AML's ""full cooperation and support"" to allow the Ivanhoe ESIA team to carry out the assessment within AML's concession area was prevented by AML, despite requests from three GOL entities that Ivanhoe Atlantic should proceed.

The communication from Transport Minister Tyler not only reiterated the government's directive but also assigned a Ministry official to accompany the team to ensure coordination and compliance.

But AML, in a letter signed by CEO Michiel van der Merwe, rebuffed the request, describing it as lacking legal basis. ""There appears to be no basis under the MDA that would permit such third-party access to our Concession Area,"" AML stated, referring to its Mineral Development Agreement (MDA) signed with the Government of Liberia in 2005.

The company further argued that the request arrived ""after the commencement"" of the ESIA schedule, making it ""impossible"" to accommodate. That claim is however debunked by the Ministry of Transport letter which according to MOT officials arrived even before commencement of the ESIA.

More pointedly, AML suggested that allowing the ESIA to proceed could interfere with ongoing negotiations over its Third Amendment to the MDA, which it says includes discussions about its continued rights as rail operator. The letter also referenced concerns about the ""proposed Ivanhoe Arrangement,"" implying that the ESIA could be linked to an agreement that would, in their view, conflict with AML's existing rights.

Sources in the GOL have confirmed that the Government intends to transition to an Independent Operator only after the current AML MDA expires in 2030, and there is nothing in the current MDA that requires AML operates the rail under a multi user system.

Furthermore, the Government of Liberia's own communications reflect an explicit policy shift toward a multiuser rail model, as articulated in Executive Order No. 136, issued by President Joseph Boakai. Under this directive, all rail infrastructure is to transition to open, regulated access by 2030. Ivanhoe, one of the intended primary users, has been in negotiations with the government for a rail access agreement and has previously committed over US$1.6 billion in projected revenue to the state through haulage fees over the life of its mining project, hundreds of millions more in taxes and infrastructure investment.

The Ministry of Transport's field report, which was submitted days after the incomplete ESIA mission and obtained by the Observer from sources in Government, lays bare the sequence of events. However, the Ivanhoe team was turned away twice at the Tokadeh Mines gate in Nimba County. On March 21 and again on March 22, AML's security personnel denied access to the ESIA team, despite them presenting a formal government letter authorizing their entry.

The security team cited a lack of direct instruction from AML's headquarters. Whereas the team was able to complete its work in the Port of Buchanan, and other areas from the Guinean border to villages and towns along the rail corridor, it was unable to access the potential loading area in Tokadeh, Nimba County under AML""s concession.

Efforts to reach AML officials on the ground and in Monrovia were unsuccessful, the report said. Calls and messages to senior staff, including the company's Special Assistant to the CEO and Head of Sustainability, reportedly went unanswered or resulted in vague non-committal responses. One official admitted over the phone that AML's Monrovia office ""was not informed"" about the ESIA. Another fact debunked by GOL officials who reportedly have proofs of delivery of correspondences.

The blocked assessment disrupted critical environmental data collection efforts led by a multidisciplinary team, which included biodiversity experts, air and water quality technicians, and social scientists. The team had planned to sample soil, monitor noise levels, and engage local communities on potential environmental and social risks associated with future mining and rail activities.

ESIAs are a legal and technical prerequisite under Liberian law for any infrastructure project with potential environmental and community impact. In the context of rail and mining operations, an ESIA ensures that stakeholders understand and mitigate risks ranging from ecosystem disturbance to displacement and safety hazards.

For the government, this process is foundational to its long-term infrastructure planning and regulatory enforcement.

AML's refusal to grant access raises significant questions about its willingness to support the multiuser framework it publicly claims to endorse. The company's letter to the government states that AML ""remains fully committed"" to a multiuser system, but only one that is ""consistent with our MDA rights."" However, in practice, its actions--such as blocking government-sanctioned environmental assessments--demonstrate resistance to ceding any operational control or accommodating other users on the rail.

This isn't the first time AML has been accused of obstructing government initiatives tied to multiuser access. In 2022, the Ministry of Mines and Energy wrote to the company, citing its ""continued lack of collaboration with regulatory authorities"" and its failure to fulfill specific obligations under the MDA. These included delays in infrastructure rehabilitation and non-compliance with certain social and environmental commitments.

More recently, AML's own 2023 annual report revealed financial losses due in part to ""operational inefficiencies and rail logistics setbacks,"" including several derailments along the Yekepa-Buchanan route. Some of these incidents resulted in fatalities, further raising concerns about AML's operational fitness to continue as the sole rail operator in the corridor.

In light of these developments, sources close to the Inter-Ministerial Concessions Committee (IMCC) say the government is determined by 2030 when the AML current MDA ends, to move forward with an independent rail operator model. This would remove operational control from any one mining company, including AML, and place it in the hands of a neutral, regulated entity overseen by the National Rail Authority.

With an estimated 11 billion tons of untapped iron ore in the rail corridor, Liberia stands to unlock billions in revenue if the infrastructure is shared equitably. But that vision depends on cooperation from all stakeholders--including AML, which continues to wield de facto control over the nation's only active heavy-haul rail line.

Whether that cooperation will be forthcoming remains to be seen. For now, AML's posture suggests a company digging in to maintain and protect a monopoly that the general sentiments of the public is against, even as the government signals its intent to open the tracks for all.

In the words of one Government official, ""they will eventually get the point that the days of behaving like they are a State within a State will soon be over. The policy arena is shifting right under them as directed by the President himself, and they are desperately trying to maintain a monopolistic posture that is no longer good for Liberia.

In the meantime, negotiations with Ivanhoe Atlantic and other potential rail operators for the sector continue and there is no turning back.""",https://cdn.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,N,,2025-04-11 06:00:01.605487

As of the end of March, PCH had total assets of nearly $11.7 million and total liabilities of about $65.7 million, court documents show.","NEW YORK — (AP) — Publishers Clearing House, a decades-old marketing and sweepstakes company known for doling out large ""Prize Patrol"" checks, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

In an announcement this week, PCH said it was using the bankruptcy process to “finalize a shift away” from its legacy business of direct-mail, retail merchandise and magazine subscriptions. The company is hoping to instead transition to a “pure digital advertising"" model, where it will continue to offer free-to-play entertainment and prizes.

The Chapter 11 proceedings, filed in New York on Wednesday, arrive amid growing financial strain for PCH — which has struggled with rising operational costs and changing consumer habits in recent years.

Pivoting from its old way of doing business will help the company break free from past constraints and “establish a strong foundation for our future,"" CEO Andy Goldberg said in a statement.

But that doesn't mean the famous sweepstakes are going away. PCH says it plans to operate in a ""business-as-usual manner"" throughout the bankruptcy process — noting that the “Prize Patrol” team will continuing to deliver awards across the U.S. The company says it's lined up debtor-in-possession financing from Prestige Capital to fund operations through its restructuring.

PCH's roots date back to 1953 — when Harold and LuEsther Mertz and their daughter, Joyce Mertz-Gilmore, formed a business out of their Long Island, New York home to send direct-to-consumer mailings that solicited subscribers for a number of magazines through one single offering.

The company later grew with chances for consumers to win money — first launching a direct mail sweepstakes in 1967 — and expanded its offerings to a wide variety of merchandise, from collectible figurines to houseware and “As Seen on TV” accessories, in the years that followed. Its in-person “Prize Patrol” team was formed in 1989.

PCH became known for surprising prize winners with oversized checks, which was often filmed and featured in TV commercials. In Wednesday court documents, the company said it has awarded over half a billion dollars in prizes and continues to attract millions of contestants today.

But its operations haven't been without financial strain — particularly in recent years.

“While PCH’s direct mail and e-commerce programs were profitable for decades, changing patterns of consumer behavior, costs and competition, along with a declining pool of new prospecting names, negatively impacted the business, resulted in losses beginning in 2022,” William H. Henrich, co-chief restructuring officer for PCH, wrote in a court declaration Wednesday.

Henrich pointed to a handful of cost pressures — including rising shipping and postal rates, inventory and supply chain challenges that have continued since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and rising competition from major retailers today, like Walmart and Amazon, that have dominated the e-commerce space.

PCH also faced some scrutiny from regulators who previously raised concerns about consumers mistakenly believing that making purchases from the company would improve their chances at winning its sweepstakes. As a result, PCH has racked up several costly legal settlements over the years — most recently, Wednesday's court documents note, paying $18.5 million to resolve allegations from the Federal Trade Commission in 2018.

As of the end of March, PCH had total assets of nearly $11.7 million and total liabilities of about $65.7 million, court documents show. The company currently has 105 employees and an annual gross revenue of about $38 million.

""The approval of Dexcom G7 15 Day marks another major innovation for Dexcom,"" said Jake Leach, executive vice president and COO at Dexcom. ""By listening to the needs of our users, we’re proud to offer the longest-lasting wearable and most accurate CGM, giving people the knowledge to better control their diabetes with our best-in-class technology.

We look forward to bringing it to market in the second half of this year, but in the meantime, we encourage our users to upgrade to our current G7 system to gain the benefits of the most connected CGM brand in the world.""

Prada is seeking to expand, having defied a slowdown in luxury demand, while Versace has been operating at a loss in the last few quarters. The merger strengthens Italy's hand in a luxury industry led by French conglomerates, the biggest being Louis Vuitton owner LVMH .

The deal follows the announcement on March 13 that Donatella Versace was stepping down as the chief creative officer of the brand founded by her late brother Gianni.

""We aim to continue Versace's legacy celebrating and re-interpreting its bold and timeless aesthetic,"" said Prada Chairman Patrizio Bertelli

""At the same time, we will provide it with a strong platform, reinforced by years of ongoing investments and rooted in longstanding relationships,"" added Bertelli, husband of Prada designer Miuccia Prada. The couple are leading shareholders in the company.

Donatella Versace, whose family sold the business seven years ago, praised the new partnership.

""Gianni and I have always had a huge admiration for Miuccia, Patrizio and their family,"" she said.

""I am honoured to have the brand in the hands of such a trusted Italian family business and I am ready to support this new era for the brand in any way that I can,"" she added.

The price Prada has agreed to pay is a big discount to the roughly $2.15 billion including debt that U.S. based Capri, then known as Michael Kors, paid for Versace in 2018 when it was sold by the Versace family and Blackstone.

Previous media reports had suggested a valuation of around 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) but that was before recent market turmoil over tariffs.

""This transaction reflects our commitment to increase shareholder value, strengthen our balance sheet and power the future growth of Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo,"" said Capri CEO John Idol.

Capri shares were 3% lower in early trading in New York and are down some 24% over the year so far.

Owning Versace, with its bold, baroque-style prints, will bring new customers to Prada, known for its minimalist style.

""Versace has huge potential. The journey will be long and will require disciplined execution and patience,"" said Andrea Guerra, the CEO of Prada.

Prada said it had committed to 1.5 billion euros of new debt to fund the deal.

The move comes at a time when several acquisitions and IPOs have been scuttled in the wake of a global equity sell-off and fears of recession triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's new tariffs this month.

Since Prada's acquisitions at the end of the 1990s of Helmut Lang and Jil Sander, which leading Prada shareholder Bertelli called ""strategic mistakes"", the group has largely steered clear of major dealmaking.

Prada traces its roots back to a leather goods shop founded in Milan by designer Miuccia Prada's grandfather in 1913.

Known for its Medusa head logo, the label was founded by Gianni Versace in Milan in 1978. Donatella became its creative force following the killing of Gianni in Miami in 1997.

In the US, Uber Eats works with grocers like Albertsons, Sprouts, Costco, Home Depot, and Lowe’s. Last year, Uber struck up a partnership with its rival Instacart to drive more shoppers to Uber Eats. On its most recent earnings call, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said Instacart is boosting “suburban” demand for Uber Eats: “We do think that the incrementality of the volume from Instacart is quite strong.”

Uber’s food delivery service rolled out in 2014 as UberFresh was later rebranded to Uber Eats in 2015. Over the years, consumer appetite for grocery delivery has become table stakes. EMarketer reports that online grocery has become the second-highest sales category in US e-commerce.

In a recent chat with Retail Brew, Uber’s global VP for grocery and retail, Susan Anderson, said she will focus on making sure Uber Eats remains an affordable marketplace in these inflationary times. “The cheapest way of getting your groceries will always be to go to the store to shop yourself and drive it home yourself,” she said. “But for people who are time poor or needing things urgently, we need to make sure that [it] continues to be something that’s affordable and value for money.”

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

How crucial is Uber Eats for merchants?

Uber Eats is proving to be a great channel for merchants across both grocery and rest of retail to access new customer bases in order to get this on-demand use case. What Uber Eats is enabling, from a food side, what we’re seeing is customers use retail and grocery on Uber Eats to get access to fresh top-up food, small baskets, and helping them to eat fresh every day.

Our top-selling items are all fresh produce. We sell a lot of bananas, avocados, tomato—all of these pieces. And we see customers buying food for their children’s lunch boxes; they’re buying dinner for that evening. If they don’t necessarily want to go to a restaurant, they are buying the ingredients and being able to order that food. They’re also buying alcohol. They’re buying ice cream. They’re buying chocolates or the candy that kind of goes with that.

And we see it’s really incremental. So, for merchants, if they’re looking for incremental growth that complements a full-basket shop that they get with their customers directly, through their 1P websites, that we can help with that last mile delivery. They can also be on our marketplace and get access to on-demand and new customers in a use case and a time that they would not otherwise be able to get.

Can you quantify that incrementality?

It’s very substantial. It’s high-double-digits incrementality, when we’ve looked at this. When we’re working with merchants, we’re able to use their loyalty programs in order to be able to track the customer behavior: what somebody is buying in store, what somebody is buying from merchants directly through their own website or their own digital channels, and what somebody’s buying through Uber Eats. And we can therefore show the different use cases in incrementality. And when we’ve done that work with merchants, we’re seeing very high-double-digit incrementality.

What is Uber’s strategy to tackle competition?

It’s about the power of the platform. So customers are using Uber both for its mobility uses as well as being able to get anything, whether that’s restaurant delivery as well as grocery. We see that our membership program is the only one that goes across both.

And then from a brand perspective, again, what Uber brings…is that ability to be able to not only have the brand advertising that converts directly—-for instance, a consumer goods product advertising in the app, being able to convert directly for an on-demand delivery—but also to be able to have brand campaigns running through our mobile app that can directly convert into the delivery app and then translate into sales.

What are you most focused on and most excited about for 2025 in this role?

We have a lot of penetration of our customers using grocery and retail, but we have a long way to go. There’s a lot of growth upside. We know, once customers try this, they come back and they use it time and time again.

And so for me, I’m really excited about having our consumers discover these new ways to access their favorite merchants and favorite retailers and understand that it’s possible for them to get items delivered to them within 30 minutes, enabling them to always eat fresh at a price that’s really affordable.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/63f2d346164adc8bf223d00a679b1ecece22dcd1-6000x4000.jpg?rect=0,425,6000,3150&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-04-10 22:02:34.798491

Surplus to requirements

Having already shuttered Elysian’s production brewery in Seattle at the end of 2024, AB-InBev’s decision to also wind down operations in Portsmouth reflects a broader trend of operational consolidation. The Portsmouth facility, originally built by Redhook in 1996 to look like Redhook’s west coast brewery in Seattle, was renamed Cisco Brewers in 2018, when under the ownership of Craft Brew Alliance (CBA). AB-InBev bought the rest of CBA it did not own yet in 2020.

In 2023, the Portsmouth brewery was expanded with a USD 6 million investment in a new canning line. However, shifting priorities – possibly driven by market demand, cost efficiencies, or a reallocation of resources – appear to have led AB-InBev to scale back in Portsmouth.

In 2023, cannabis firm Tilray bought eight craft beer brands from AB-InBev for USD 83 million, Redhook among them. The following year, Tilray acquired another four craft breweries from Molson Coors for USD 23 million, each time paying a fire sale price, it seems.",https://brauwelt.com/images/BWI_Schmuckbilder_Slider/brauwelt-cars-in-front-of-asheville-mural-pj-frederick-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-04-11 13:18:52.982673

The combined market capitalisation of the world’s top 25 insurers rose 17% year-on-year to $3.5t in the first quarter of 2025, according to GlobalData.

The sector benefited from higher premium pricing amidst inflation, improved investment income due to elevated interest rates, and fewer large-scale catastrophic events during the period.

PICC Property and Casualty led gains with a 40.5% rise in market value, driven by strong 2024 results.

The company reported improved performance in motor and non-motor vehicle insurance segments and greater operational efficiency through technology-based cost controls.

PICC held a 38.8% share of China’s household motor vehicle insurance market.

Assicurazioni Generali’s valuation increased 39.5% to $55.1b by the end of March 2025.

Berkshire Hathaway saw a 25.7% increase in market value, supported by strong returns from energy and infrastructure investment.

In contrast, Elevance Health and The Cigna Group posted year-on-year declines of 18.6% and 17.0%, respectively, due to reduced enrollment, higher medical loss ratios, and regulatory scrutiny.

Life Insurance Corporation of India fell 15.4% as it faced weak policy growth, poor equity market performance in India, and limited foreign investment.

Looking ahead to the second quarter, GlobalData noted that the US Federal Reserve’s potential pause in rate hikes may help stabilise yields and support life insurers’ investment portfolios, according to Murthy Grandhi, Company Profiles analyst at GlobalData.

However, trade tensions between the US and China could weigh on global trade insurance demand.

The $61 billion two-year budget heads next to the Senate. A balanced budget must be in place by June 30.

The program had been set to expire after the awards made in late January.

Four Central Ohio projects accounted for half – a combined $50.7 million – of that fourth and final round. The local total included $33 million, the largest single award, for Columbus-based Edwards Cos.' five-building ""Capitol Square Renaissance Project"" just east of Capitol Square.

But applications for five other projects by Central Ohio developers did not make it.

If the provision stands in the final budget, they'll get another shot.

Gov. Mike DeWine's executive budget proposal did not include renewing TMUD.

The Ohio Chamber of Commerce advocated renewing the program among several issues in budget testimony.

""The awards often contained a housing element, and this program should be allowed to offer local areas transformational development and increase housing supply,"" said the written testimony by Justin Barnes, the chamber's top lobbyist.

Under the program, the Ohio Department of Development accepts applications and chooses projects for funding. Construction must begin within 12 months of certification by the Ohio Tax Credit Authority; the authority awards the money only after the certified project is completed.

Because of construction timelines for huge projects, state coffers might not be impacted by the reduced tax revenue under the renewal until fiscal 2028, according to a legislative analysis.

The House version of the budget also includes a single $600 million state bond issue for the proposal to build a domed stadium for the Cleveland Browns in the suburb of Brook Park, moving Huntington Bank Field out of downtown.

More about Sam McCracken:

Sam McCracken is a member of the Sioux and Assiniboine tribes in northeastern Montana on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, and the general manager and visionary of Nike’s N7 programs and the N7 Fund. He also serves as the chairman of the board for the Center for Native American Youth.

McCracken began his Nike career in 1997 at Nike’s Wilsonville, Ore., distribution center. He was quickly asked to use his experience and passion to revitalize the Native American Employee Network, one of Nike’s employee diversity groups. Shortly thereafter, McCracken proposed a business development strategy focused on Native American communities, with the goal of increasing health and wellness through physical activity.

He became the manager of Nike’s Native American Business in 2000 and led the development of the Nike Air Native N7 shoe, the N7 retail collection and the N7 Fund, which supports access to sport, economic empowerment, education innovation and social justice for Native American and Indigenous communities in the United States and Canada. McCracken has also driven more than 25 unique product collections and brand stories for the N7 product line.

In addition to ongoing N7 product collection and Fund oversight, McCracken’s leadership with Nike’s Native American Network fuels ongoing education, visibility and representation for Nike’s Indigenous community, including a recruitment and retention strategy.

He was also instrumental in Nike signing a Memorandum of Understanding with Indian Health Services in 2003 and again in 2009, as well as with the Bureau of Indian Education in 2010 – all signifying the company’s commitment to bringing inspiration and innovation to Native American communities in the spirit of health, wellness and access to sport.

McCracken has been recognized through multiple awards for his passion and work:

Nike’s Bowerman Award in 2004, named after Nike co-founder and revered track and field coach Bill Bowerman.

George Washington Honor Medal in 2004, by the Freedom Foundation at Valley Forge for his commitment to Native communities’ health promotion programs.

“We understand the concerns of our client partners regarding the possible cost increases from these tariffs,” Brian Holland, president and CEO of Fleet Advantage, said.","New tariffs were announced on multiple U.S. trading partners, including Canada and Mexico. These duties follow tariff increases earlier this year on imported goods from mainland China as well as increased tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from sources worldwide. With almost half of U.S. Class 8 heavy truck sales produced in Mexico, all else equal, the proposed 25% tariffs on Mexico would influence truck imports and exports as well as manufacturing, pricing, profitability, and volume. In a survey polled this week, 41% of industry professionals said they believe the tariffs will go into effect this year, and only 11% believe we will not see any tariffs this year (47% unsure).

To help organizations with transportation fleets plan for any price adjustments on heavy-duty trucks from OEM partners, Fleet Advantage recently launched a tariff-readiness program designed to provide relief and support for these organizations.

Key highlights of Fleet Advantage’s tariff-readiness program include:

Protection from tariff-related fees: All trucks currently scheduled for production on or before May 16, 2025 (depending on OEM), are protected from any tariff-related fees.

Optimal ordering period: Based on feedback from all OEMs, to avoid high-cost increases and inefficiencies, it is recommended to place orders and build between now and May 30, 2025.

Cost savings: Fleet Advantage can help organizations save over $4 million on 100 trucks, considering the full timeline from June to July 2025.

Additional custom program options and savings are available through a consultative session with Fleet Advantage.

Each of the major truck OEMs has announced slightly varying schedules, imposing a cascade of leveled or tiered price increases between May and July. Ordering trucks in these time periods could greatly impact the per-truck price.

In the same survey referenced above, nearly half of the executives polled (47%) said they are aware of the OEM schedule of tariff-related price adjustments planned for the phased approach over the next few months. The majority (53%) believe the tariffs will be in effect for the next one to two years, and only 29% of respondents said they have a tariff plan in place to address price adjustments on truck costs.

Kennedy Jr. said in a new interview that he has given food company executives two years to remove Red 40 and other artificial dyes from their products.
The Consumer Brands Association, a trade group representing PepsiCo and other food companies, also participated.
The association said after the meeting that Kennedy told makers the government wants companies to remove artificial dyes from foods.
Kennedy on March 10 directed the FDA to explore eliminating the rule, which lets companies include additives in foods without Food and Drug Administration review.
“Because in Europe, before you add something, a chemical, to a food, you got to prove that it’s safe.","Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a new interview that he has given food company executives two years to remove Red 40 and other artificial dyes from their products.

“They said it’s going to take us a while. For example, the CEO of Pepsi, which owns Doritos, said … ‘The consumers like them to be very red, and we have not yet found a vegetable dye that we can match, but we’re going to do it.’ And I said they all have to be out within two years,” Kennedy said in the interview with CBS, which was released on April 9, disclosing details about the meeting for the first time.

The March 10 meeting involved executives from Kraft Heinz, General Mills, Tyson Foods, Kellogg’s, Smucker’s, and PepsiCo.

The Consumer Brands Association, a trade group representing PepsiCo and other food companies, also participated.

The association said after the meeting that Kennedy told makers the government wants companies to remove artificial dyes from foods.

“It went very well,” Kennedy said in the new interview. “I think they’re at the point where they see the writing on the wall.”

He said that the dyes are “clearly associated with a variety a grim inventory of diseases, including cancers and behavioral disease and neurological disease like ADHD, and it’s very, very well-documented and they’re making, in many cases, the same products in this country have those dyes, and then they use vegetable dyes in Canada, Mexico and Europe.”

Studies have linked artificial dyes with various neurobehavioral problems, the California Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment said in a 2021 report analyzing the research.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January banned Red No. 3, one of the dyes, from food products, noting studies that found rats exposed to high levels developed cancer, but said, “claims that the use of [the dye] in food and in ingested drugs puts people at risk are not supported by the available scientific information.”

After Kennedy became health secretary, West Virginia banned seven artificial dyes from food and drink products.

Kennedy said in the new interview that he held another meeting recently with Tyson Foods and that the company is down to one dye and is working on removing that.

A PepsiCo spokesperson previously told The Epoch Times in an email: “We appreciate the Secretary taking the time to sit down with us and view the meeting as a productive first step in working with the Administration. Together, we share a commitment to ensuring that America’s food system is the best in the world. We remain focused on providing consumers with convenient, affordable, and safe foods and drinks—including more options with natural ingredients, no synthetic colors and reductions in sugar, fat, and sodium.”

Tyson has not responded to requests for comment.

The discussion went over the “Make America Healthy Again agenda and working together to maintain consumer access to safe, affordable and convenient product choices,” Melissa Hockstad, president and CEO of the Consumer Brands Association, told The Epoch Times previously.

Kennedy also said in the new interview that the “biggest villain” for food safety, the Generally Recognized as Safe standard, is going to be eliminated, another way he’s carrying out the Make America Healthy Again vision.

Kennedy on March 10 directed the FDA to explore eliminating the rule, which lets companies include additives in foods without Food and Drug Administration review.

The rule was initially for traditional ingredients such as yeast but expanded to cover other ingredients.

“The FDA became captured by the food industry, and they enlarged the GRAS standard to apply to everything, and that’s why we have 10,000 ingredients in our food and the Europeans only have 400 in theirs,” Kennedy said. “Because in Europe, before you add something, a chemical, to a food, you got to prove that it’s safe. In our country, it is rubber-stamped.”",https://i.ntd.com/assets/uploads/2025/04/id1059770-GettyImages-2204721131-Robert-F.-Kennedy-Jr.-.jpg-1200x630.webp,N,,2025-04-10 20:05:46.162483

Join UND President Andy Armacost as he sits down for a conversation with business leader Sam McCracken, general manager and visionary of Nike N7 programs. The fireside Q&A-style chat is set for 2 p.m. on Tuesday, April 22, in the Barry Auditorium of UND’s Nistler College of Business & Public Administration.

This event is sponsored by the UND Indigenous Student Center and the Nistler College of Business & Public Administration.

More about Sam McCracken:

Sam McCracken is a member of the Sioux and Assiniboine tribes in northeastern Montana on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, and the general manager and visionary of Nike’s N7 programs and the N7 Fund. He also serves as the chairman of the board for the Center for Native American Youth.

McCracken began his Nike career in 1997 at Nike’s Wilsonville, Ore., distribution center. He was quickly asked to use his experience and passion to revitalize the Native American Employee Network, one of Nike’s employee diversity groups. Shortly thereafter, McCracken proposed a business development strategy focused on Native American communities, with the goal of increasing health and wellness through physical activity.

He became the manager of Nike’s Native American Business in 2000 and led the development of the Nike Air Native N7 shoe, the N7 retail collection and the N7 Fund, which supports access to sport, economic empowerment, education innovation and social justice for Native American and Indigenous communities in the United States and Canada. McCracken has also driven more than 25 unique product collections and brand stories for the N7 product line.

In addition to ongoing N7 product collection and Fund oversight, McCracken’s leadership with Nike’s Native American Network fuels ongoing education, visibility and representation for Nike’s Indigenous community, including a recruitment and retention strategy.

He was also instrumental in Nike signing a Memorandum of Understanding with Indian Health Services in 2003 and again in 2009, as well as with the Bureau of Indian Education in 2010 – all signifying the company’s commitment to bringing inspiration and innovation to Native American communities in the spirit of health, wellness and access to sport.

McCracken has been recognized through multiple awards for his passion and work:",https://blogs.und.edu/und-today/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/04/sam-mccrackenWEB.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 20:05:50.325185

Footwear

Nike remains the top brand in all footwear but continues to see mindshare erosion (49% share this spring vs. 60% on average in 2022-2023). The decline was most notable among females, where share dipped to under 40%, first time since 2020. Male share also declined but is more stable at 57%.

Despite only emerging in 2020, Blank Street stores have quickly become a staple in cities across both the United States and Britain. It's become increasingly normal to see young people walking around with sage green Blank Street cups, instead of the iconic white and green Starbucks cups.

So why has Blank Street sky-rocketed in popularity?

1. More Affordable Prices

Blank Street is by no means the cheapest coffee shop on the high street. However, its prices are better than Starbucks's—something its owners are keenly aware of. Vinay Menda, one of the company's co-founders, noted that ""we're about 25% to 35% cheaper than Starbucks on espresso."" He added that the company wants ""to be Starbucks for the next generation"" but with ""better quality, lower prices.""

Part of the reason Blank Street is able to lower its prices is that its stores are small and therefore cheaper to rent. While this means there's no room for customers to sit around with their drinks, it does mean they're walking away with drinks that are cheaper than those found in Starbucks.

Take the Quiz: What Aesthetic Are You?

Let us find out your aesthetic for this summer!

2. Convenience

While Blank Street's queues are often long, the drinks themselves are swiftly concocted. This is down to the automatic machines Blank Street uses. Amongst their menu, matcha is produced from a pre-made formula instead of whisked in front of you, and their cold brew is made at a central facility, rather than in-store as the norm in coffee shops like Starbucks.

While some coffee fans argue that this leads to lower-quality drinks, it's undeniably convenient for people in a rush who want a dose of caffeine before heading into a long day of work or school.

3. Trendiness

In recent years, drinking Starbucks has become increasingly less fashionable. It's widely associated with people's cringy pre-teen phase when, alongside a unicorn onesie, they'd clutch a bright Starbucks frappuccino.

In contrast, Blank Street is seen as Gen Z's cool girl coffee brand. It's no coincidence that the brand has risen in popularity at the same time as matcha. Unsurprisingly, matcha is one of their best-selling drinks. The company plays to its popularity and releases new, creative flavours seasonally.

For example, UK Blank Street is currently offering two spring drinks: strawberry shortcake and rhubarb and custard. These drinks are doing the rounds on social media, with influencers conducting reviews that are getting thousands of views and creating hype.

4. Aesthetic

Alongside the launch of these seasonal drinks, Blank Street released ads carefully designed to appeal to their Gen Z audience. Their strawberry shortcake ad played on nostalgic girlhood spring days. It featured girls sitting around a picnic mat at the park. A Brittney Spears song played in the background, while pink jewelled phones and lip glosses were scattered around the drinks.

Unsurprisingly, the ad was well-received. Comments included 'oh, your marketing needs a raise' and 'they know their target audience'.

Aside from seasonal campaigns, the stores themselves are designed to attract young people. Their logo is a trendy sage green featuring the words Blank Street in white block letters. The stores are likewise minimalistic and fit the 'clean girl' aesthetic that is highly popular amongst Gen Z.

Which Company is Worth it?

Of course, just because Blank Street appears more popular amongst young people, doesn't mean it's necessarily better.

The company has its controversies. As mentioned, some take issue with the fact the company does not handmake its drinks. Also, while the drinks are cheaper than those found at Starbucks, this isn't to say that they're cheap. Likely, if you visited a handful of independent coffee shops, you'd find at least one offering cheaper drinks than Blank Street.

Still, Blank Street is undeniably popular among young people. While it has nowhere near as many stores as Starbucks does worldwide, this may not always be the case. It's fair to assume that while Gen Z's favorite coffee shop still sports a green logo, it may be fading from Starbucks's emerald to Blank Street's sage green.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.theteenmagazine.com/2l64kpjeabfgztkp8w97gxc19tww?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D%22photo-1475552113915-6fcb52652ba2.jpeg%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27photo-1475552113915-6fcb52652ba2.jpeg&response-content-type=image%2Fjpeg&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJXZEYHYWOL7J3OTA%2F20250410%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250410T230726Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=4ae99faa6eaf7e3ac1709da919adfd8826a30ae504ff1c73368eb1ff04a7e807,N,,2025-04-10 19:07:29.217947

Today, the average age of workers at Apparel Production is 50, and filling those jobs when they retire is likely to prove challenging.","New York City's famed Garment District is bracing for impact as President Trump's barrage of tariffs begin to ripple through the apparel industry.

For Lyn and Lisa Alessi, co-founders and co-CEOs of Alessi International, a local fabric importer representing mills in Asia and Europe, the tariffs could pose significant challenges to their business, which works with international partners to produce fabrics for high-end clothing companies.

""I have all my customers putting on the brakes, asking, 'What are we going to do? How are we going to handle this? Where can we move production to?'"" said Lyn Alessi, who began selling luxury fabrics in 1989.

According to the American Apparel and Footwear Association, 97% of the clothes and shoes sold in the U.S. are imported. Most of these items come from China, India and Vietnam, according to the World Bank.

The Trump administration confirmed Thursday that some Chinese goods will be subject to so-called ""reciprocal tariffs"" reaching as high as 145%, while imports from Vietnam and India face tariffs of 46% and 27%, respectively. Mr. Trump suspended the tariffs on most countries for 90 days to allow more time for trade talks, but the levies on China remain in place.

The onslaught of new U.S. tariffs has ratcheted up import taxes to their highest level in more than a century, with Mr. Trump touting the policies as a way to revitalize domestic manufacturers.

For the Alessi sisters, this additional tax on imports will impact nearly every aspect of garment production, resulting in higher costs for the business and for consumers. They predict this will lead to shoppers seeking out alternative clothing options.

""A Veronica Beard jacket was $800. Now it's going to be $1,000. And that just takes it out of the market. The secondhand market is going to thrive,"" Alessi said.

Down the block from Alessi International is Apparel Production, a manufacturing group that has survived the industry's ups and downs since its founding in 1948. The company, co-owned by Karen Sadaka and Teddy Sadaka, works with brands including Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Kenneth Cole, but most of its plants have shut down as garment jobs were shipped overseas.

""We had factories in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, and Kentucky,"" Karen Sadaka said. ""It wasn't a problem. Today, they're all out of business.""

Today, the average age of workers at Apparel Production is 50, and filling those jobs when they retire is likely to prove challenging. Sadaka said it is too son to tell if Mr. Trump's tariffs will spur domestic production, but she fears the shift ""is too much, too fast.""

And whatever the merits of the independent pharmacies’ argument, that likely means a blow to consumers who rely on them.
It’s possible some CVS stores in Arkansas were already on the chopping block, regardless of whether the Arkansas law stands.","One of the largest health care companies in the U.S. has launched an aggressive public relations campaign against a bill passed by the Arkansas Legislature this week, pushing ads in media across the state and urging Gov. Sarah Sanders to veto the measure.

House Bill 1150 targets pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs — middlemen companies that negotiate drug prices on behalf of insurers. PBMs help negotiate prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers and suppliers. They also determine how much pharmacies get paid by insurance plans for filling prescriptions.

Arkansas’s independent pharmacies have complained for years about the low reimbursement rates they receive from PBMs, which can sometimes be less than the cost of the drugs or services provided. They’ve found a sympathetic ear in the Legislature, which has passed multiple laws in the past decade aimed at helping smaller pharmacies and reining in alleged misbehavior by PBMs.

Arkansas pharmacists are especially unhappy that the three largest PBMs — corporate behemoths that collectively process about 60% of all pharmacy claims in the U.S. — are owned by health care conglomerates that also run their own in-house pharmacies. The most prominent is CVS Caremark, the PBM arm of the company better known to the public for its national chain of retail drugstores.

The other two biggest PBMs, OptumRX and Express Scripts, are owned by insurance giants UnitedHealth Group and Cigna, which both have pharmacies as well. (CVS Health acquired its own insurance arm with its 2018 purchase of Aetna.)

HB1150, which was pushed by independent pharmacies, takes direct aim at this arrangement. The bill would ban PBMs from holding a pharmacy license in Arkansas, including online pharmacies that send prescriptions through the mail. When the bill was in committee last week, a spokesperson for a PBM (not one of the big three) told lawmakers that 23 CVS pharmacies and 26 Kroger pharmacies would be at risk of closing if the bill becomes law, according to reporting by the Arkansas Advocate.

The bill passed the House by a vote of 89-4 last week and passed the Senate 26-9 on Wednesday. CVS has asked Sanders to veto the measure.

“This bill rips medicine away from sick patients and makes it harder for people to achieve better health,” CVS Health said in a statement Wednesday. “A veto will protect communities, improve care, and help hundreds of thousands of Arkansans get the medicines they need. Governor Sanders should choose people over misguided policy that will lead to serious consequences.”

The independent pharmacies dispute the notion that the bill would force CVS stores to close. The Arkansas Advocate reported that Arkansas Pharmacists Association CEO John Vinson said in committee that it simply forces pharmacies to choose “whether they want to be a PBM or a pharmacy.”

Realistically, though, it seems unlikely an Arkansas law would lead CVS Health to spin off its pharmacies from its PBM; it’s the sixth-largest company in the U.S. by revenue, earning $373 billion in 2024. Closing its two dozen Arkansas stores seems much more likely. And whatever the merits of the independent pharmacies’ argument, that likely means a blow to consumers who rely on them.

There’s also the fact that CVS retail stores, like those of fellow pharmacy giant Walgreens, have been doing poorly in recent years. The company has said it already plans to close 270 stores nationwide in 2025. It’s possible some CVS stores in Arkansas were already on the chopping block, regardless of whether the Arkansas law stands.",https://arktimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CVS_Pharmacy_at_Target_Dadeland_Miami_Florida_2022.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 19:06:02.383721

This expansion is expected to create 158 new jobs over the next four years in Plymouth.

Philips, which has a global headquarters in the Netherlands, moved into its Plymouth facility in 2019. There are currently close to 300 employees there.

A Leader in Medical Technology

Philips is known for light bulbs — but these days, it’s also a leader in medical technology.

“The only entity that produced more light than Philips was the sun,” Gov. Walz said, retelling something a Philips employee told him. “Which was true fact!”

The Plymouth facility focuses on image-guided therapy technology, which can be used for minimally invasive heart procedures.

“We are proud to contribute to the thriving device industry, and to collaborate to harness the full value of innovation in health care,” said Stacy Beske, senior vice president at Philips in Plymouth.

The Plymouth location will undergo a $31 million expansion. The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) awarded Philips Image Guided Therapy Corp. $3.5 million to assist with that.

“I’m happy to say that even though there are a number of question marks, of course, around the economic future, Minnesota enters into this moment with a lot of momentum,” said Matt Varilek, commissioner of DEED.

That money will help Philips fund an expansion of manufacturing, as well as its research and development. A med-tech training center will also be constructed, which leaders say could bring in thousands of visitors.

Gov. Walz touted Philips’ pivot to medical technology.

“A 130-year old company that is now at the forefront of making someone’s life easier. Instead of open heart surgery, and not having all the data, you have a one-day procedure with the products that are being produced here in Plymouth, Minnesota,” Walz said.

After securing $230 million during its latest financing round, Tailscale, a Toronto-based virtual private network (VPN) technology provider, is planning to expand its 150-person workforce.

According to news outlets, including The Globe and Mail, CEO Avery Pennarun said the company is looking to grow its engineering, product, and sales teams.

“Our sales team never has to do cold outreach to new customers,” Pennarun claimed.

Founded in 2019, Tailscale recently surpassed 10,000 paying business customers — which includes Telus, Motorola, Instacart, and SAP AG.

If you’re thinking about working for Tailscale in Canada, here are a few things that non-unionized employees need to keep in mind.

Review your employment contract carefully

If you’re offered a job at Tailscale, don’t sign your employment contract before seeking legal advice.

These agreements often reduce the legal protections of non-unionized employees in Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia — especially when it comes to severance pay or workplace changes.

WATCH: Employment lawyer Lior Samfiru explains what you should know about employment contracts on an episode of the Employment Law Show.

Common clauses to watch for:

A termination clause limiting severance to just a few weeks’ pay.

A provision allowing your employer to make significant job changes without your consent.

A “probation clause” that could affect your job security.

You don’t have to accept an agreement immediately. An experienced employment lawyer at Samfiru Tumarkin LLP can review the contract and ensure that your workplace rights are properly protected.

You might have complete a probationary period

Most employment contracts require staff to complete a “probationary period” — often lasting three to six months.

If you’re fired or let go during this time, and the requirement isn’t clearly stated in your agreement (i.e. no probation clause), you might be owed severance pay.

Our firm can assess your legal options and advise you of potential next steps.

Think about severance before changing jobs

Before leaving your current role for a new one, consider the severance implications.

Non-unionized employees in Canada, including those at Tailscale, can receive up to 24 months of pay when they’re let go without cause. If you quit your job voluntarily, you’re likely not entitled to a severance package.

However, if you were forced to resign due to unwanted changes to your job, contact an experienced employment lawyer at Samfiru Tumarkin LLP.

We can help you determine if you have grounds for a constructive dismissal claim.

Length of service matters

The amount of severance pay you’re owed is heavily influenced by how long you’ve worked for your employer.

Example: If you leave a job you’ve held in the Greater Toronto Area for 15 years to join a new company, and you’re let go a few months after your start date, your severance package might be minimal — unless you were induced to leave your previous employer (see “Inducement” below).

A short amount of service at a business doesn’t automatically mean meager compensation. Many short-service employees are entitled to significant severance packages.

🔍 Real case example: Our firm secured six months of severance pay for a B.C. sales representative who was only with her employer for six months. Read the full story.

If you’re let go after a short time with a company, don’t sign anything before speaking with our team. You could be owed much more than your employer offers.

🕒 IMPORTANT: You have up to two years from the date of your termination to pursue full severance pay — as long as you haven’t accepted the offer in writing.

Lost your job after being recruited?

In some cases, non-unionized workers in Canada leave their current job after being actively recruited by another company.

If your new employer took documented steps to entice you to take up employment with them, this will likely be considered inducement.

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

• What workers in Alberta need to know about inducement

• Inducement in B.C.: What employees need to know

In the event that the company decides to terminate you shortly after pulling you away from your previous employer, the inducement should be taken into consideration when determining your severance entitlements.

Example: Tailscale entices you to leave your current job in Ottawa to come work at its office in Toronto. If you’re terminated shortly after making the switch, the company may be on the hook for enhanced severance pay because of the pressure it placed on you to leave your previous employer.

If this situation applies to you, don’t sign your severance offer until it’s been reviewed by a member of our team.

We can confirm that the inducement has been properly factored into your severance package and help you secure the compensation you deserve if it isn’t.

""We haven't heard of any backlash yet for the companies we follow, but this is something we are watching closely given rising geopolitical tensions,"" particularly between the US and China, Bank of America analyst Lorraine Hutchinson wrote in a note.

That spells bad news for US brands with the most Chinese sales exposure, including Nike (NKE), Skechers (SKX), Coach owner Tapestry (TPR), and Ralph Lauren (RL).

On Wednesday afternoon, President Trump authorized a 90-day pause on most reciprocal tariffs while keeping the 10% across-the-board duty. But China now faces a 145% tariff because of ""the lack of respect that China has shown,"" Trump said on Truth Social.

Forrester retail industry analyst Sucharita Kodali told Yahoo Finance that consumer pushback in other regions will likely be limited in impact, but China remains the big question mark.

""It's less like Europe or Canada,"" she said. ""I do think [China is] a permanent rupture that I'm not sure is going to be fixed anytime soon ... I don't know the future of American companies in China,"" she said. The country has instituted an 84% tariff on American goods in response.

US brands have already been struggling in China amid aggressive local competition and flagging domestic economy.

As of the latest quarter, Nike sold $1.73 billion of goods in Greater China, a 17% drop from the previous year. It sold $4.86 billion in North America.

""Nike is in a really, really tough spot. They're in a turnaround for a whole host of reasons. China is just one of their problems,"" Kodali said.

CEO Elliott Hill told investors it remains ""committed to China.""

""We see the long-term opportunity there. There's 1.3 billion consumers ... We've also made some significant investments in China, whether it's around some of the big teams like the national basketball team, the track and field team, and the football team,"" he said.

Per Hutchinson, ""Nike saw the most pronounced impact in China from right-sizing inventory to reflect a challenging macro and promo environment. Localized product and innovation are cutting through this tough backdrop but aren't enough to offset the pressure.""

Skechers reported $333.5 million of revenue in China last quarter, down 11% year over year.

Skechers CFO John Vandemore told investors ""China was the drag"" on its international business.

""China continues to be the challenge that, in its size and scale, gives it a disproportionate impact, particularly in the Asia Pacific region."" Vandemore said the team is ""working very diligently to address what they can in the market.""

The company plans to stay the course, saying its business “ultimately will be a very good fit with that market.""

Tapestry reported growth in its Greater China business last quarter. Its revenue of $272.8 million is up 3% compared to last year.

""We delivered low-single-digit growth in the quarter, significantly outpacing the industry,"" CEO Joanne Crevoiserat told Yahoo Finance, citing that innovation and value led shoppers to the brand.

While it might have been a slight uptick, CFRA analyst Zach Warring said in a note, ""We now see very little upside potential in China as one of the world’s largest economies continues to struggle."" The country makes up 15% of Tapestry’s total sales, compared to North America‘s 65%.

Ralph Lauren recently saw its China revenue grow 20% year over year, driven by same-store sales growth, new customers, and ""key marketing moments,"" CFO Justin Picicci told investors.

As these retailers look to hold down their business in China, they also face a changing consumer environment in the US and an ever-changing backdrop of how much these tariffs actually are.

""Companies are hesitant to take price really quickly ... I haven't seen any brand take price yet, and I think it's because they don't want to walk back,"" William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia told Yahoo Finance.

Tariffs have already caused US consumers to be more pessimistic about the economy, which could prompt them to pull back on spending. According to the Conference Board's consumer confidence index out in late March, US consumers' expectations about the economy dropped to a 12-year low.

PwC US consumer markets adviser Ali Furman told Yahoo Finance last week, ""Lower-end consumers who are already under a lot of pressure, they're probably getting more anxious and even more cost-conscious, because they're afraid that prices are going to go up and they're already struggling to afford necessities.""

""Forget about discretionary,"" she added, as average consumers become more discerning, making choices between purchasing apparel, consumer electronics, home decor, or dining out.

As of the end of March, PCH had total assets of nearly $11.7 million and total liabilities of about $65.7 million, court documents show.","NEW YORK — (AP) — Publishers Clearing House, a decades-old marketing and sweepstakes company known for doling out large ""Prize Patrol"" checks, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

In an announcement this week, PCH said it was using the bankruptcy process to “finalize a shift away” from its legacy business of direct-mail, retail merchandise and magazine subscriptions. The company is hoping to instead transition to a “pure digital advertising"" model, where it will continue to offer free-to-play entertainment and prizes.

The Chapter 11 proceedings, filed in New York on Wednesday, arrive amid growing financial strain for PCH — which has struggled with rising operational costs and changing consumer habits in recent years.

Pivoting from its old way of doing business will help the company break free from past constraints and “establish a strong foundation for our future,"" CEO Andy Goldberg said in a statement.

But that doesn't mean the famous sweepstakes are going away. PCH says it plans to operate in a ""business-as-usual manner"" throughout the bankruptcy process — noting that the “Prize Patrol” team will continuing to deliver awards across the U.S. The company says it's lined up debtor-in-possession financing from Prestige Capital to fund operations through its restructuring.

PCH's roots date back to 1953 — when Harold and LuEsther Mertz and their daughter, Joyce Mertz-Gilmore, formed a business out of their Long Island, New York home to send direct-to-consumer mailings that solicited subscribers for a number of magazines through one single offering.

The company later grew with chances for consumers to win money — first launching a direct mail sweepstakes in 1967 — and expanded its offerings to a wide variety of merchandise, from collectible figurines to houseware and “As Seen on TV” accessories, in the years that followed. Its in-person “Prize Patrol” team was formed in 1989.

PCH became known for surprising prize winners with oversized checks, which was often filmed and featured in TV commercials. In Wednesday court documents, the company said it has awarded over half a billion dollars in prizes and continues to attract millions of contestants today.

But its operations haven't been without financial strain — particularly in recent years.

“While PCH’s direct mail and e-commerce programs were profitable for decades, changing patterns of consumer behavior, costs and competition, along with a declining pool of new prospecting names, negatively impacted the business, resulted in losses beginning in 2022,” William H. Henrich, co-chief restructuring officer for PCH, wrote in a court declaration Wednesday.

Henrich pointed to a handful of cost pressures — including rising shipping and postal rates, inventory and supply chain challenges that have continued since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and rising competition from major retailers today, like Walmart and Amazon, that have dominated the e-commerce space.

PCH also faced some scrutiny from regulators who previously raised concerns about consumers mistakenly believing that making purchases from the company would improve their chances at winning its sweepstakes. As a result, PCH has racked up several costly legal settlements over the years — most recently, Wednesday's court documents note, paying $18.5 million to resolve allegations from the Federal Trade Commission in 2018.

As of the end of March, PCH had total assets of nearly $11.7 million and total liabilities of about $65.7 million, court documents show. The company currently has 105 employees and an annual gross revenue of about $38 million.

1. A New York federal judge dismissed an antitrust lawsuit against UnitedHealthcare and MultiPlan that alleged the companies conspired to reduce reimbursement rates for an anesthesia services provider.

2. Martins Ferry-based East Ohio Regional Hospital and its owner and CEO, John Johnson, MD, have been hit with a lawsuit following the hospital’s March 14 layoffs and March 21 closure. The lawsuit alleges that the hospital violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by not paying employees their final paycheck and conducted mass layoffs and closure without the required legal notice under the WARN Act.

3. A Texas federal judge vacated a yet-to-be-imposed nursing home staffing level mandate approved during the Biden administration.

4. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit against major pharmacy benefit managers, including UnitedHealth Group’s Optum, CVS Health’s Caremark and Cigna’s Express Scripts, over insulin pricing practices is set to move forward after being paused. FTC chair Andrew Ferguson said April 3 that he would no longer recuse himself from the case, clearing the way for the lawsuit to resume.

5. A federal judge in Massachusetts issued a permanent injunction to block the Trump administration’s proposal to limit medical research funding. The federal government plans to appeal the decision, setting up a longer legal battle over the future of research grant policy.

6. Miami-based Nicklaus Children’s Hospital paused its effort to evict Fort Meyers, Fla.-based Lee Health from the Golisano Children’s Health Center in Naples, Fla., providing a temporary reprieve in a high-stakes dispute that threatened access to pediatric care for tens of thousands of families in Collier County.

7. The Justice Department is urging a federal court to allow a decade-old lawsuit against UnitedHealth Group to continue. Justice Department attorneys argued that a court-appointed special master was incorrect in her recommendation to throw out the lawsuit, alleging UnitedHealth Group overcharged the federal government through Medicare Advantage claims.

8. A federal judge ordered Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen unit to pay $1.64 billion for illegally promoting HIV drugs Prezista and Intelence.

9. A federal judge dismissed Amgen’s lawsuit against Colorado’s Prescription Drug Affordability Board, allowing the state to move forward with setting price ceilings on prescription drugs.",https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/BeckersHospitalReview.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 21:01:28.263595

Philips Image Guided Therapy, a division of Philips, will use the funds to expand its Plymouth facility that opened in 2019.
Philips had been considering other locations outside Minnesota for the expansion, CCX Media reported in fall.
That funding also originated from the same two pots of state money.
“I think this team and this collaboration under the vision of Philips, that’s how you bring manufacturing back.","Minnesota officials on Thursday confirmed plans to provide $3.5 million in state money to help Dutch health tech giant Philips expand its operations in Plymouth.

Philips Image Guided Therapy, a division of Philips, will use the funds to expand its Plymouth facility that opened in 2019. Company representatives said the move is expected to add 158 new jobs at the plant, which employs about 300 people today.

The $3.5 million originates from two separate pools of state money: $1,540,500 comes from the Job Creation Fund and the remainder from the Minnesota Investment Fund. The former is a loan program that focuses on industrial, manufacturing, and technology-related industries, while the latter is a grant program.

Philips had been considering other locations outside Minnesota for the expansion, CCX Media reported in fall.

“This is centered in Plymouth for a reason,” said Gov. Tim Walz, who held a press briefing on Thursday morning to tout the expansion. “If a company settles, they need to have housing for their employees, quality public schools, infrastructure. That’s something that this community has invested in.”

Philips representatives said the average salary for workers at the plant is expected to top $100,000. The expanion is expected to cost $31 million in total, and it will include a new medical technology training center, which Philips said could see 2,000 visitors annually.

Philips isn’t the only out-of-state entity to take in state dollars to expand in Plymouth: Back in 2021, California-based med-tech firm Silk Road Medical was given $675,000 to open a new office in the city. That funding also originated from the same two pots of state money.

Greater MSP Partnership CEO Peter Frosch said that Philips plans to teach employees how to incorporate artificial intelligence tools into their work at the plant. “There is a lot of talk everywhere about AI and whether it’s going to create any jobs,” he said. “That’s what’s happening here, and AI is being put to productive use solving problems that really matter to people and communities.”

Walz added that Philips will help boost domestic manufacturing.

“You hear a lot about bringing manufacturing back to America; we couldn’t agree more with that,” the governor said. “I think this team and this collaboration under the vision of Philips, that’s how you bring manufacturing back. Those are the jobs you want to see.”",https://d5c1j5k5drfk7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Philips-announcement-Gov-Tim-Walz-041025.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 19:07:13.639822

Adjusted for the additional week in FY24 that accounted for C$2.2m, sales saw a more noticeable increase of 0.9%.

The company’s direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales edged up to C$223.26m in FY24, a 0.4% climb from C$222.48m in the previous fiscal year.

Roots’ selling, general and administrative expenses reached C$143.5m in FY24, a 2.3% increase from C$140.33m in FY23.

The company reported net loss of C$33.44m during the fiscal year against net income of C$1.84m in FY23.

This translates to loss per share of C$0.83 against earnings per share of C$0.05 in the previous year. The downturn was attributed to a non-cash impairment charge on intangible assets and subsequent deferred tax impacts.

In the fourth quarter (Q4) of FY24, Roots posted total sales of C$110.81m, up 2.4% from C$108.23m in Q4 FY23.

The gross profit for the quarter rose by 7.2% to C$67.59m with the gross margin reaching 61.3%, an improvement of 270 basis points over Q4 FY23’s figure of 58.6%.

Net loss for Q4 2024 stood at C$21.70m versus the previous year’s income of C$14.62m. Its loss per share for the quarter was C$0.54 from earnings per share of C$0.36 in Q4 2023, again due to non-cash impairment charges and associated deferred tax impacts.

As of 1 February 2025, Roots’ net debt was reported at C$7.4m – a 56.7% decline from C$17m in FY23.

Oklahoma receives hundreds of millions of dollars from the federal government to improve mental health resources in the state. What would be at stake if funds disappear?

In the last five years, Oklahoma has received nearly $750 million from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA

A report from Healthy Minds tracked where those dollars are being spent.

It found children, rural communities and Native American nations have the most to lose if funding decreases or goes away.

Healthy Minds Executive Director Zack Stoycoff said changes to the federal agency could threaten vulnerable populations.

“SAMHSA’s work is pretty much the only single source of really well vetted and trusted information about how you perform behavioral health services,"" Stoycoff said.

The agency’s future is uncertain as the Trump administration consolidates federal health service providers.

Norman Starbucks Workers Vote To Join Union

Workers at a Starbucks shop in Norman voted to unionize this week.

It’s the second location in Norman and the sixth in the state to do so.

Workers at the Starbucks on Mt. Williams Drive and 24th Avenue Northwest in Norman voted 15-2 to join Starbucks Workers United, which represents workers at more than 570 stores across 45 states and the District of Columbia.

Oklahoma Starbucks workers joined the growing national unionization effort in 2022 when workers at the Starbucks location on 23rd Street and Robinson Avenue in Oklahoma City became the first location in the state to join Starbucks Workers United.

In a news release, Starbucks Workers United said this action comes as the union has filed more than 90 unfair labor practice charges against the company since the beginning of the year, claiming the company has backtracked on previous commitments to support workers’ rights to collective bargaining.

Most Oklahomans Don’t Have the Real ID Yet

Less than a month remains before the Real ID requirements go into effect.

Service Oklahoma reports a majority of Oklahomans do not have the credentials.

As of May 7, a Real ID will be required to board domestic flights and enter certain federal buildings.

Oklahoma began issuing Real IDs in 2020, but many residents still use standard licenses, which won’t meet the new requirements.

To upgrade, residents need documents verifying their identity, Social Security number and Oklahoma residency.

Service Oklahoma is expanding appointment hours at select locations, now offering Monday and Wednesday evenings, plus Saturdays.

Officials say residents should start the process early to avoid last-minute delays, as appointments are expected to fill up closer to the deadline. Without the upgrade, travelers will need a valid passport for domestic flights.

Service Oklahoma said it has issued more than two million Real IDs since 2020.

“Boys From Oklahoma” Concerts Take Over Stillwater This Week

A massive crowd of Red Dirt music fans is descending upon Stillwater for the sold-out “Boys From Oklahoma” concerts at Boone Pickens Stadium starting Thursday through Sunday.

The sold-out concerts are co-headlined by Cross Canadian Ragweed, who are reuniting after 15 years apart.

They’re joined at the top of the bill by co-headliners The Turnpike Troubadours, as well as The Great Divide, Jason Boland & the Stragglers and Stoney LaRue.

At Monday’s city council meeting, Stillwater Mayor Will Joyce proclaimed April 7-13, 2025 as “Red Dirt Music Week.”

John Cooper of the band Red Dirt Rangers spoke at the meeting, recalling how the Red Dirt brand of music started innocently on the outskirts of Stillwater.

“We started at a little old place out here out west of town called The Farm, with no aspirations of anything other than creating good music for us and our friends to enjoy and have a good time,” Cooper said.

From its humble beginnings of songwriters swapping songs in the 1970s to a dominant form of country music that has spread worldwide, Cooper reflected on the significance of this week’s events.

“This is the biggest moment for our scene,” Cooper said.

More than 170,000 fans are expected at the series of stadium concerts over a four day span, with dozens of other shows happening throughout the city before and after each concert.

The event has the City of Stillwater and Oklahoma State University bracing for the equivalent of four football gamedays.

Cody Canada, the frontman for the reunited band Cross Canadian Ragweed, acknowledged the economic impact the event is expected to have.

“The very first thing I told everybody when we signed up for this was ‘We’re going to do our best to bring a lot of money to local businesses in Stillwater,’” Canada said.

Despite the large influx of people to Stillwater, OSU still plans to hold classes Thursday and Friday. Several roads and two dozen staff, residential life and commuter parking lots will be closed due to the concerts.

The weekend will become even more special as four of the featured acts — Cross Canadian Ragweed, Jason Boland and The Stragglers, The Great Divide and Stoney LaRue — will be inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame during the concert series.

Not to be outdone, Turnpike Troubadours – who were previously inducted into the hall in 2022 – are releasing a new album called The Price of Admission on Friday.

Nonresidential construction planning activity fell in March, reversing recent gains made to start the year, according to Dodge Construction Network.

The Dodge Momentum Index, a benchmark that tracks nonresidential construction planning, tumbled 6.9% in March, as the threat of tariffs and broader uncertainty stymied project projections.

Commercial planning dropped 7.8% due to slower activity in warehouse, data centers and retail projects. Institutional planning, such as education, life sciences and healthcare projects, fell 5%, according to the report.

Hesitancy around how material prices would trend ahead of President Donald Trump’s April 2 tariffs likely contributed to the slowdown in future planning. The Trump administration tariffs have fueled concerns in the construction industry about rising materials costs and potential project cancellations.

“Increased uncertainty around material prices and fiscal policies may have begun to factor into planning decisions throughout March,” said Sarah Martin, associate director of forecasting at Dodge Construction Network. “While planning data has weakened across most nonresidential sectors this month, activity remains considerably higher than year-ago levels and still suggests steady construction activity in mid-2026.”

Momentum around data center planning, one of the most significant drivers of growth in recent months, slowed over the month. For example, Microsoft, one of the largest data center builders, recently announced it is slowing or pausing some early-stage data center projects, including a $1 billion build in Ohio, according to The Associated Press.

Trump’s tariffs could also further strain future data center investment if prices continue to rise and supply chain constraints worsen. That could potentially lead to further delays in projects.

But data center planning still sits at historically high levels, according to Dodge. Even with the month’s slowdown, this single building type continues to significantly prop up overall planning figures.

The Dodge Momentum Index jumped 30% year over year, with commercial planning up 32% and institutional planning up 27%, according to the data.

Without data center projects, however, commercial planning would have increased just 4% compared to March 2024, while the overall DMI would have climbed only 12%, according to Dodge.

A total of 25 projects valued at $100 million or more entered planning throughout March. Major commercial projects included:

The $400 million Logistics Land Investments data center in Bessemer, Alabama.

The $340 million expansion to the Ontario Convention Center and Hotel in Ontario, California.

The $300 million Project Cinco data center in Natalia, Texas.

That’s the conclusion of a report on Thursday from ShipMatrix Inc., a parcel management, consulting and analytics firm with a strong history assessing industry trends.

In 2024, parcel volumes reached an all-time high of 23.8 billion, up 4% from the prior year and 50% since 2019. Parcel delivery revenues grew 4.1% to $188 billion, with an average revenue of $8 per parcel.

ShipMatrix estimates U.S. parcel volume will grow at a compound annual rate of 4% over the next three years to 26.8 billion in 2027. “However, most of that growth will be handled by private networks of Amazon, Walmart and other retailers, resulting in a flat to negative growth for UPS, FedEx and USPS,” the report said.

FedEx (NYSE: FDX) and UPS (NYSE: UPS) face keen competition in parcel shipping from Amazon Logistics (NASDAQ: AMZN), Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Target, as well as smaller, independent carriers such as OnTrac, Better Trucks, Jitsu, Veho, SpeedX and UniUni.

The growth of volume among companies that are, or were, the largest customers of FedEx, UPS and the U.S. Postal Service is the most dramatic market development in recent years and poses an ongoing risk to the legacy carriers, ShipMatrix said. Amazon dropped FedEx as a carrier five years ago. UPS said in January it will slash volumes it handles for Amazon by 50% over the next 18 months as it focuses on higher-yield freight.

Amazon delivered 6.1 billion packages in 2024 compared to 1.7 billion in 2019. Other carriers, led by Walmart, saw growth jump 44% year over year to 2.3 billion packages. The number of shipments for this cohort has nearly quadrupled from 600 million in 2019. UPS parcel volume of 4.8 billion was flat year over year, while FedEx recorded a marginal decrease to 3.4 billion packages.

Parcel industry revenue growth has normalized after spiking in 2021 and 2022 when consumers were reluctant to shop in person because of COVID and heavily relied on ordering goods from their computers or mobile devices. UPS led the way in revenue last year at $59.8 billion. Other carriers, excluding Amazon, FedEx and the Postal Service, experienced 48% revenue growth to $13 billion.

Walmart’s ability to fulfill orders from its stores and clubs has been a key driver of its e-commerce growth, CEO Doug McMillon said during an investor town hall on Wednesday. The retailer’s coverage of U.S. households with same-day delivery has grown by 22% during the past two years.

Conclusion Global AI regulation is coalescing around shared principles, but implementation approaches remain fragmented.
The profound implications of AI regulation are aptly summarized as “it is like teaching your toddler how to walk.” The AI toddler may soon by sprinting.","Regulatory Approaches and Core Objectives

In her opening remarks, Fiona Schaeffer of Milbank LLP delineated three predominant categories of regulatory approaches that have emerged across jurisdictions:

Market-driven: The market-driven approach taken by the United States emphasizes reliance on existing legislation and frameworks. Courts are tasked with interpreting how existing antitrust, consumer protection, and intellectual property laws apply to AI, rather than introducing new statutory regimes.

State-driven: In contrast, China has taken a more centralized, top-down approach. This approach is characterized by powerful regulatory instruments applicable to privacy, data governance, as well as AI deployment.

Rights-driven: The European Union’s approach derives regulation bottom-up from the perspectives of consumer rights and human rights. As exemplified by the developments with the EU AI act, the regulation tends be prescriptive and imposes a gradual schedule of obligations based on the level potential risks.

Despite the differences in implementation approaches, a loose norm of international collaboration has also emerged, typified by non-binding guidelines. While lacking enforceability, these efforts are shaping consensus and fostering regulatory convergence in some areas. Examples include the G7 AI agreements, the OECD AI principles, and other multilateral dialogues among competition agencies.,

In broad terms, the global regulatory efforts share four common objectives:

Safety and Accountability: Preventing AI from facilitating harm, whether through misinformation, fraud, or physical threats. This underscores the need for AI systems to be both safe and subject to clear accountability mechanisms.

Human Rights Protections: Ensuring AI does not entrench bias, infringe privacy, or curtail freedom of expression. This includes scrutiny of algorithmic decision-making in areas like healthcare and employment, where automated systems have already demonstrated the capacity for algorithmic biases.

Transparency: Regulators and stakeholders are increasingly demanding visibility into how AI models function—including inputs, training data, and decision-making logic. Explainability, auditability, and documentation could be key issues for potential future compliance frameworks.

Ethical Innovation: Examples like Japan’s human-centric AI principles highlight a desire to align AI deployment with societal values. Policymakers are calling for responsible innovation that supports both economic growth and democratic norms.

Schaeffer also drew attention to the elephant in the room. As predicted by technologists such as Bill Gates, the constant advancements in AI will inevitably raise fundamental questions about the role of work, the role of minimum wage, and division of economic surplus from AI driven productivity. She argued that the current debate about AI should not shy away from these societal issues.

U.S.: Enabling Innovation, Guarding Against Entrenchment

Haidee Schwarz of OpenAI emphasized the nuanced stance taken by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In the joint statement with the CMA and EC in July 2024, the U.S. antitrust agencies identified fair dealing, interoperability, and choice as key factors that would generally enable competitiveness and foster innovation. In January 2025, the FTC released a staff report on AI partnerships and investments that highlights three areas to watch regarding potential competition implications, including access to key inputs, contractual and technical switching costs, and access to sensitive information.

The new FTC and DOJ leadership have also made clear statements that they will aggressively enforce against big tech companies to ensure competitiveness and innovation, including in relation to AI. The emphasis on robust antitrust enforcement is underscored by a particularly active month of April in Washington, D.C., where multiple high-profile tech-related trials are taking center stage. These include the DOJ’s cases against Google regarding both Search and Ad Tech, the DOJ’s case against Apple regarding smartphone markets, the FTC case against Amazon regarding its online market place services, and the FTC case against Meta regarding its social networking services.

On the other hand, there is also a strong focus on avoiding overregulation that may deter innovation or entrenche market dominance. In his statement on the FTC AI staff report, Chair Ferguson Ferguson of the FTC noted the duality of AI, as both a productivity engine and a potential entrenchment tool. Striking the right balance—avoiding stifling regulation while remaining vigilant against monopolistic practices will likely remain the main theme of U.S. AI policy for the foreseeable future.

EU and UK: From Alarm to Nuance

Tone Oeyen of Freshfields observed a tonal shift in European regulators. Just like the AI industry itself, the antitrust and regulatory approaches towards the AI value chain in Europe are rapidly evolving. Initially, bodies like the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and European Commission (EC) both raised alarms about concentration risks in the AI value chain, particularly at the infrastructure level, with concerns centered on: concentration of computing power and cloud services, barriers to entry for smaller AI developers, and exclusive partnerships that could limit competition.

However, recent remarks by senior Commission officials suggest a growing recognition of the dynamic nature of AI markets. The rapid rise of new entrants like DeepSeek has challenged assumptions about the inevitability of dominance by incumbent players. The CMA has updated its AI foundational model report to reflect changes in the ecosystem, including increased open-source activity and wider diffusion of AI capabilities. Meanwhile, the EU has launched consultations and policy briefs exploring vertical integration risks, algorithmic gatekeeping, and market access conditions.

The evolving view is expected to shape existing merger control and conduct investigation. For example, both the CMA and the EC have been stretching the traditional merger control toolkit to fit the AI playbook, reflecting the fact that transactions in the space are being conducted through new form of partnerships. There has been rise in conduct investigations, from the French competition authority’s investigation into Nvidia’s unilateral conduct in 2023 to the EC’s investigation into the alleged tying of the Azure Cloud Services to Windows server software for corporate customers.

Brazil: A Regional Leader in AI Regulation

Victor Oliveira Fernandes of the Administrative Council for Economic Defense of Brazil (CADE) described Brazil’s proactive efforts to lead in Latin America. The country’s AI bill, heavily influenced by the EU AI Act, also adopts a risk-based framework. Unique to Brazil is the creation of a national AI regulator and government network sharing the responsibilities instead of a single regulator.

CADE’s inputs in the Brazilian AI Bill included:

Mandating that regulatory bodies share information with CADE when competition issues arise.

Securing investigative access to high-risk AI training and test data.

Calling for differentiated compliance obligations for small and median enterprises to avoid stifling innovation.

Brazil has also launched investigations into major AI partnerships, including Microsoft/OpenAI and Amazon/Anthropic, to determine whether they should have been subject to merger review. These cases reflect CADE's broad interpretation of joint ventures and data-sharing arrangements under its competition law. Another active investigation by CADE concerns Meta’s alleged leveraging of its dominant position in social media to gain unfair advantage in the development of AI models. While some of the AI-related conducts are novel, it is still up for debate whether novel theories of harm are needed to address these cases.

Limits of Ex-Ante Regulations

When asked about ex-ante regulation, Schaeffer offered a skeptical view of its viability, arguing that traditional legislative cycles will have difficulty keeping pace with exponential AI advancement. Historically, the treatment of privacy and protection of privacy, especially the approach in the EU with GDPR serves as a good analogy to assess potential ex-ante AI regulation. The jury is still out on whether the economic costs and impact on innovation and entry can be justified by the protection demanded by the general population.

Instead, she advocated for global consensus on narrow, high-impact issues such as:

Deepfakes, which threaten democratic discourse and consumer safety.

Algorithmic bias in critical areas that could impact fundamental human rights, such as healthcare.

While some layers of the AI stack remain competitive, others like cloud infrastructure and behavioral data aggregation, exhibit oligopolistic traits that may warrant closer scrutiny. Similarly, enforcers may need to be innovative in their approach to measuring the impact of AI-related initiatives and collaborations that do not trigger traditional merger-control thresholds. For example, content aggregation and behavioral data collectors may have an enduring competitive advantage that can impact both technological evolution and downstream market structure.

Algorithmic Collusion

The panelists expressed a shared concern about algorithmic collusion, particularly in the context of third-party pricing software. Schaeffer observed that when firms delegate pricing decisions to shared AI models, they risk engaging in conduct that resembles hub-and-spoke cartels. Conversely, if such software relies solely on public data and its recommendations are not consistently followed, the users are more likely to remain on safer legal ground.

Another emerging risk is not just intentional collusion, but the inadvertent alignment of pricing strategies by independent algorithms that learn from repeated interactions with one another. Under current legal frameworks, compliance exposure may depend heavily on the level of human oversight and the nature of the data inputs involved. As theoretical and empirical research into autonomous algorithmic collusion evolves, regulators are likely to adopt more nuanced positions. One thing is certain: the widespread use of pricing algorithms and the legal challenges they raise will remain a recurring theme in the broader AI policy debate.

As enforcement ramps up, practitioners in the AI space would be advised to consider the following:

Review third-party AI tools carefully, especially pricing software. Understand how they are marketed and whether they require or encourage data sharing with competitors.

Document independent decision-making when using AI inputs. Ensure that human judgment plays a central role and that AI outputs are not blindly accepted.

Stay ahead of regulatory trends, particularly in jurisdictions where AI-specific guidance is rapidly evolving.

Engage with regulators proactively. Smaller firms in particular may need to clarify their capabilities and limitations in response to inquiries.

Firms should also anticipate greater use of AI tools by regulators themselves. From predictive models that flag unusual pricing patterns to analytics dashboards that map partnership structures, enforcement agencies are becoming more sophisticated. For example, CADE is investing in AI tools to assist investigations. Its use of machine learning tools to detect collusive patterns in public procurement is now being adapted for AI-related probes.

Conclusion

Global AI regulation is coalescing around shared principles, but implementation approaches remain fragmented. For antitrust practitioners, this moment offers both challenge and opportunity. The profound implications of AI regulation are aptly summarized as “it is like teaching your toddler how to walk.” The AI toddler may soon by sprinting. The need for agility and informed advocacy has never been greater, regulators and antitrust practitioners worldwide will also be racing address tackle the persistent timing disconnect between industry innovation and the regulatory process.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-mom-baby-touchscreen-1781282256.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 22:02:06.293319

ARKANSAS (KHBS, KHOG) — Wednesday, Arkansas senators passed a bill that would essentially eliminate a popular pharmacy chain in the Natural State.

The Senate voted 26 to 9 to approve the bill, which was passed by the house earlier this month.

The Arkansas Senate Insurance and Commerce Committee heard House Bill 1150 in Little Rock on Tuesday. The bill’s sponsors say it aims to prohibit a pharmacy benefits manager, also known as a PBM, from obtaining certain pharmacy permits. CVS Caremark is a pharmacy benefits manager, owned by CVS Health, which owns and operates CVS Pharmacies.

“I want to be clear,” Rep. Jeremiah Moore said. “House Bill 1150 does not force pharmacy closures. It forces companies that are a PBM to either choose between being a pharmacy and a drug provider or choosing to be a pharmacy benefits manager.”

Sponsors say the bill simply prevents a company from being both a provider and a benefits manager. Supporters also say it would make prescriptions less expensive. After hearing from both sides, the Senate Insurance and Commerce Committee passed the bill.

“And I fully expect that we’ll be put our best foot forward in the Senate tomorrow and Lord willing, we’ll pass House Bill 150 and the governor will sign it,” Moore said.

CVS Health is pushing back against the bill and sent a statement to 40/29 News.

“House Bill 1150 would cripple pharmacy care access and affordability in Arkansas. It endangers Arkansans by eliminating access to vital community pharmacies, eroding patient safety, and making prescription drugs more expensive. It will cost hundreds of jobs and raise health care costs by millions of dollars per year. A vote for HB 1150 is a vote to create health care chaos for working families, seniors, and people with disabilities.”

A CVS staffer spoke to state lawmakers on Tuesday.

“We’re deeply embedded in the fabric of the communities we serve,” district leader for CVS Pharmacy Ashley Ellis said. “Providing care and guidance to 340,000 Arkansans who rely on us every year. This bill doesn’t just threaten our livelihoods, it threatens the health and well-being of our patients.”

The bill would take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, if it receives the full support of state lawmakers.

Postal Service.","Changes are coming to how mail is delivered across the United States as the U.S. Postal Service continues to find itself in the crosshairs of a Trump administration determined to slash federal spending and increase efficiency.

President Donald Trump's federal cost-cutting efforts, led by billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, have not spared an agency that otherwise operates and funds itself independently.

The changes hitting USPS this month, which took effect April 1, are part of a 10-year plan, dubbed “Delivering for America."" Ultimately, the plan includes cutting jobs, adding a new fleet of electric delivery trucks to replace existing trucks that keep breaking down and slowing delivery for many rural customers.

The changes also come amid growing protests from postal workers and supporters opposed to service reductions, which USPS says will help save the organization $36 billion over a decade.

Here's what to know:

What is the USPS?

The United States Postal Service, older than the U.S. itself, delivers to 165 million addresses six times a week.

Although the postal service is technically an independent agency, Congress maintains close control.

But some critics who have long wanted to see the agency overhauled have pointed to the significant challenges the USPS has faced as Americans send fewer letters, Christmas cards and wedding invitations. Last year, the service handled more than 116 billion pieces of mail, with most of that being presorted mailers, solicitations, or other items that many people would consider ""junk"" mail.

Last year, the postal service lost $9.5 billion as private companies like FedEx and UPS outcompete it for some parcel deliveries.

10,000 jobs to be cut; postmaster strikes deal with DOGE

Postmaster General Louis DeJoy stepped down after inking a deal in March with billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency.

DeJoy said the deal with DOGE, which has torn through the federal government to slash spending in the name of reducing waste, will ""assist us in identifying and achieving further efficiencies.""

The deal came after the USPS announced in January a voluntary early retirement initiative expected to result in about 10,000 jobs being cut. More than 75% of the postal service's budget goes to paying its roughly 635,000 workers, and those 10,000 job cuts reflect only a 1.5% staffing reduction.

According to a news release from the American Postal Workers Union, workers who opt to retire early are eligible for a one-time $15,000 incentive paid in two parts.

Appointed during the first Trump presidency, DeJoy said in a letter to Congress that DOGE would help usher a “historic level of transformational change"" by reducing costs.

How will mail delivery be different?

The changes that went into effect this month will affect millions of customers across the country. While the moves are designed to improve efficiency and cut costs, some people may notice slower delivery.

According to the USPS, service standards will be ""refined"" for:

First-class mail.

Periodicals.

Marketing mail.

Package services (bound printed matter, media mail, and library mail).

USPS Ground Advantage.

Priority mail.

Priority mail express.

Delivery of first-class mail is expected to take no more than five days, while the 2-5 day range for USPS Ground Advantage will also stay the same, the postal service said. Certain postage like marketing materials, periodicals and other packages may even be delivered faster, according to the USPS news release.

The majority of first-class mail, 75%, should notice no change to their first-class mail delivery services, the postal service said. However, 14% will be upgraded to a faster standard, while another 11% of first-class mail will be delivered slower, though still within the 1-5 day deliver window.

For more precise expectations, the USPS is now using 5-Digit ZIP code pairs, rather than current standards that are based on 3-Digit ZIP code pairs.

USPS already has a map online that will let customers see how long it will take to deliver mail from one ZIP code to another.

More changes coming

The next changes are set to take effect July 1. More information will be released closer to that date.

Trump suggests merging USPS with Commerce; Musk wants it privatized

Trump, who has long been critical of the USPS and its declining deliveries, has in the past floated the idea that it be merged into the Commerce Department. Such a move would bring the now-independent postal service under Trump's authority.

“It’ll remain the Postal Service, and I think it'll operate a lot better than it has been over the years,” Trump said on Feb. 24. “It's been just a tremendous loser for this country.""

Musk has also suggested privatizing the agency, as many other countries have done. Such a move would likely require congressional approval.

Rural communities could be unequally impacted

Unlike the postal service, private companies do not have the same service obligations requiring delivery to rural or sparsely-populated areas – even at a loss. Companies like FedEx and UPS can charge higher prices for harder deliveries in such area, or simply not deliver to them at all.

Instead, those companies are more likely to focus services on areas with more people, more places and more profit.

In contrast, the postal service is required to deliver to virtually every address in the country, regardless of how much it costs. Some mail carriers even still use mules or horses to deliver to Supai, Arizona, a remote Havasupai tribal village in the Grand Canyon of Arizona, or float planes to serve fishing villages off the Alaskan coast.

Under a privatized system, mail outgoing and incoming to rural regions would likely be delayed. Service could become much more expensive or be cut off entirely.

Postal workers rally after DOGE threatens to dismantle USPS

News that Musk's DOGE team would be scouring the service for savings sparked recent protests across the U.S.

Thousands of unionized postal workers and their supporters rallied across the nation in late March to protest proposals to dismantle the U.S. Postal Service.

Philips North America, a division of the Dutch Philips, purchased the Plymouth facility from Boston Scientific in 2019 for $11 million.
The company hopes to bring more jobs to the city and solidify both Plymouth and Minnesota’s status as a hub of medical innovation, according to Philips and state leaders.
Philips said it will add 158 jobs, which would more double the company’s current workforce in Plymouth over the next four years.

The company made the announcement at a news conference attended by Gov. Tim Walz and various other government and business leaders.

The expansion by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Phillips includes new spaces for manufacturing, research and development, and a center for medical technology training. Stacy Beske, senior vice president and business leader of Phillip’s image guided therapy devices, hosted the conference and said she expected the training center will draw in up to 2,000 visitors a year.

Philips North America, a division of the Dutch Philips, purchased the Plymouth facility from Boston Scientific in 2019 for $11 million. Located at 5905 Nathan Lane N., the building occupies 25.2 acres and over 220,000-square-feet.

The company hopes to bring more jobs to the city and solidify both Plymouth and Minnesota’s status as a hub of medical innovation, according to Philips and state leaders. Philips said it will add 158 jobs, which would more double the company’s current workforce in Plymouth over the next four years.

A starting date for the expansion's construction or details about the project's square footage were not announced.

Besides Walz, the press conference also included state leaders such as Commissioner Matt Varilek of the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED), CEO and President of Greater MSP Peter Frosch and CEO and President of Medical Alley Roberta Dressen.

In December, the state of Minnesota announced its support of the Phillipsproject with $3.5 million in grants; $1.5 million from the Job Creation Fund and $2 million from the Minnesota Investment Fund.

“I think this team and this collaboration under the vision of Philips — that’s how you bring manufacturing back,” Governor Walz said during the press conference. “Those are the jobs you want to see. And Minnesota once again establishes itself as the hub of biotech innovation because of it.”

According to Varilek, the idea for the expansion came from a business-development trip to the Netherlands back in 2023 that both he and Walz attended. This trip also resulted in a partnership between Minnesota MedTech 3.0 and Dutch investor NLC Health Ventures.",https://media.bizj.us/view/img/12959366/img2932*1200xx4032-2268-0-378.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 16:09:37.634025

Novartis will spend $23 billion to build and expand 10 U.S. facilities over the next five years, the company said in a Thursday press release. Reuters first reported the news following an interview with Novartis’ CEO Vas Narasimhan.

The outlay is the latest in a series of moves seemingly spurred on by the threat of import tariffs on pharmaceuticals under the second Trump administration.

On the production front, Novartis will build four new manufacturing facilities in “soon-to-be-determined states,” plus establish new radioligand therapy plants in Florida and Texas. The company will also expand existing radioligand manufacturing facilities in Indiana, New Jersey and California.

Beyond the radioligand plants—which will likely support Novartis’ commercial radiopharmaceuticals Lutathera and Pluvicto—the new sites in the drugmaker’s production network will tackle manufacturing for biologic drug substances, final drug products, chemical drug substances and oral solids. The plants will also be equipped to handle device assembly and packaging duties, Novartis said.

When all is said and done, Novartis expects the added capacity will position the company to produce all its key medicines for U.S. patients entirely within the U.S.

Novartis already manufactures many of its key drugs—including cell and gene therapies and radiopharmaceuticals—in the U.S. for both domestic patients and those in other countries, the company pointed out. With the new investments, the drugmaker says it will bring its small interfering RNA (siRNA) production muscle to the U.S. for the first time and bolster its existing manufacturing firepower in areas like oncology, immunology and neuroscience.

With regards to domestic drug discovery, Novartis’ U.S. cash infusion also includes a $1.1 billion investment in a new R&D hub in San Diego, which the company says will serve as the “epicenter” of Novartis’ West Coast research presence once the facility opens in 2028 or 2029.

All told, the U.S. investment spree is expected to create 1,000 new jobs at Novartis.

Novartis is rolling out its investment plan a little more than a week after President Donald Trump unveiled his much-anticipated “Liberation Day” tariffs, which imposed base duties of 10% on nearly all U.S. imports and set varying reciprocal trade penalties for numerous other countries with high trade deficits.

Trump subsequently announced a 90-day pause on most of those reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday while continuing to pile on to China, the tariff rate for which now stands at a whopping 145%.

While pharmaceuticals were exempted from this latest round of tariffs, renewed threats from the president around sector-specific duties targeting pharmaceuticals have caused industry share prices to drop in recent days. Trump has previously suggested pharmaceutical tariffs could climb to “25% or higher.”

Novartis helmsman Narasimhan did not address Trump’s tariffs in his company’s release, noting instead that the investment strategy supports the drugmaker’s “strong U.S. growth outlook.” The CEO also praised the “pro-innovation policy and regulatory environment in the U.S.” that helps Novartis chase medical innovations.

""We are prepared for shifts in the external environment and fully confident in our 2025 guidance, mid- to long-term sales growth outlook and 2027 core margin guidance,” Narasimhan said.

Tariffs have long been part of the agenda for Trump 2.0, and several other large drugmakers already appear to have read the writing on the wall.

Back in February, Eli Lilly said at an event dubbed “Lilly in America” that it will spend $27 billion to build four new U.S. production facilities, more than doubling the sum it had earmarked for domestic manufacturing since 2020.

Roughly a month after that, Johnson & Johnson telegraphed a $55 billion investment in the U.S. over the next four years, which will include the build-out of three new manufacturing sites, plus expansions of others already in the pharma behemoth’s medicines and medtech network. J&J's planned investment represents a 25% increase over the prior four-year period.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/Novartis_1.jpg?VersionId=Gt7d1TxlRUMNUgeNbmUMjzzQ210pl3Ly,N,,2025-04-10 18:06:59.323578

""Explore our global bestselling lineup and step into a world powered by solar energy, sustained by batteries, and driven by electric vehicles,"" a statement announcing the launch on Tesla's website read.
In 2023, Lucid opened its first car manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia.
The expansion into Saudi Arabia also suggests a recovery of the previously fraught relationship between Musk and the kingdom, which led to Tesla expanding into nearly every Gulf country except for the Saudi kingdom until now.
""We assume that in the coming years there will be some good demand for the Tesla vehicles,"" she said.","Tesla, Inc. is debuting sales in Saudi Arabia, the oil-rich kingdom whose long desert highways are home to gas-guzzling SUVs — and where there are no chargers to be found for hundreds of miles.

The American electric vehicle maker is hoping that success in neighboring countries like the United Arab Emirates and a small but growing pool of buyers of electric vehicles (EV) in the region are a positive sign of future demand.

The timing is also notable — Tesla will hold its launch event in Riyadh on April 10, then open pop-up stores in Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam on the April 11. That is ahead of a widely anticipated visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar expected to take place in April, although it has not yet been officially confirmed.

It also comes as the carmaker faces plummeting sales, particularly in Europe, amid backlash against Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk's controversial role in the Trump administration.

""Explore our global bestselling lineup and step into a world powered by solar energy, sustained by batteries, and driven by electric vehicles,"" a statement announcing the launch on Tesla's website read. ""Experience the future of autonomous driving with Cybercab, and meet Optimus, our humanoid robot, as we showcase what's next in AI and robotics.""

Despite its reputation as a bastion of oil wealth, Saudi Arabia is no stranger to EVs — its sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, has been a majority stakeholder in U.S.-based luxury EV company Lucid Motors since 2019. In 2023, Lucid opened its first car manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia.

Chinese EV maker BYD is also already in the Saudi market, meaning Tesla faces competition from both BYD and Lucid Motors in an arena that is still small — EVs accounted for just 1% of all car sales in the kingdom in 2024, according to a report from consulting firm PwC.

""Tesla won't be a pioneer in the market. In other countries, it was very often the first one — in Saudi Arabia, not anymore,"" Tatiana Hristova, director of CEE and MEA vehicle sales forecasting at S&P Global Mobility, told CNBC's Access Middle East on Wednesday.

""BYD vehicles are known on the market, even if they are not the only EVs on the market ... so it will be a hard start,"" she said. S&P expects 10,000 to 15,000 Tesla units will be sold in the country in the first two years after the company's Saudi debut, including during this year.

""After that, it will definitely face very strong competition from the side of locally manufactured competitors, and also Chinese vehicles,"" Hristova added.

The expansion into Saudi Arabia also suggests a recovery of the previously fraught relationship between Musk and the kingdom, which led to Tesla expanding into nearly every Gulf country except for the Saudi kingdom until now.

According to PwC Middle East consumer survey data from last year, ""more than 40% of consumers in KSA are considering purchasing an EV in the next three years.""

Charging points are few and far between in the kingdom, but its newly launched Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Company plans to build 5,000 fast chargers across the country by 2030, the report said.

Hristova pointed to an ""accumulated pool of customers who have waited for Tesla"" in the kingdom as another positive sign for the automaker's debut locally.

""We assume that in the coming years there will be some good demand for the Tesla vehicles,"" she said.

CNBC talked to several Amazon sellers to find out how the new tariffs are having an impact on their decisions about prices and where to manufacture.
That's a strategy many Amazon sellers are also trying.
Su set up a factory for his Teamson brand in Vietnam in reaction to China tariffs during Trump's first term.
Some Amazon sellers were benefiting from de minimis, particularly on its separate direct-from-China site Amazon Haul, which launched in November to compete with Temu.","President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policy on April 2 didn't just cause mayhem in the stock market. It sent Amazon sellers into a panic.

Many sellers on Amazon count on China for manufacturing and assembly due to lower costs and established infrastructure – up to 70% of goods on Amazon come from China, according to Wedbush Securities. With nearly all imports from China being taxed a staggering 145% under the latest tariffs, Amazon sellers are having to decide whether to raise prices or absorb the vastly increased cost of importing their goods.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on Thursday told CNBC that its vast network of third-party sellers will likely ""pass the cost on"" to consumers. He added that Amazon has done some ""strategic forward inventory buys"" and looked to renegotiate terms on some purchase orders to keep prices low.

Although Trump temporarily lowered tariffs on most countries to 10% on Wednesday, he doubled down on the huge tariffs on goods from China. Before the pause, average tariff rates under Trump were at the highest level since the Great Depression. The ""reciprocal tariffs"" were far steeper in regions like Southeast Asia. Tariffs also hit U.S. allies at unusual rates, including 20% on the European Union and previously announced 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada.

Josianne Boisvert of Canadian-based Portable Winch Co. said she ""was in a state of shock"" when the tariffs were announced. For 20 years, the company has driven its products an hour to the U.S. border for duty-free shipping to American customers.

""We are questioning ourselves if we just move our focus to Europe,"" Boisvert said.

CNBC talked to several Amazon sellers to find out how the new tariffs are having an impact on their decisions about prices and where to manufacture.

Price hikes

In a small warehouse in San Rafael, California, Dusty Kenney showed CNBC hundreds of boxes filled with her PrimaStella brand baby spoons, bento boxes and other kids products. Most of them arrived by sea from China before tariffs went into effect. Paying the added tariffs could put her out of business if they continue, she said.

""I will hold my prices for as long as I can and just absorb those tariffs because I'm already competing against those Chinese sellers that are undercutting me,"" Kenney said. Although tariffs will also impact her Chinese-based competitors, the cost of doing business in the U.S. is far higher than in China.

""The administration would like people to think that this is a China problem, and that this is only hurting Chinese-based businesses and helping U.S.-based businesses. But I am a U.S.-based business, let's be clear,"" Kenney said. ""Everything's warehoused here, designed here, photographed here. All the income that comes from that stays here.""

Several sellers said they are considering raising prices if Trump's tariffs stick around.

The vast majority of products on Amazon are sold by third-parties, but tariffs will also impact the company's first-party brands.

That includes Amazon Basics-branded batteries, which compete against the likes of Duracell and Energizer by retailing at lower prices, said Jason Goldberg of the Publicis Groupe.

If Amazon has to raise the price of its own batteries, he said, ""consumers are likely to have a preference for that well-known, familiar brand.""

The Seattle-based tech company is likely to wait at least six months before passing the tariff costs on to consumers, said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.

""The last thing they want to do is right away just pass it to the consumer, because you don't know how transitory this is,"" said Ives, adding that Amazon likely got ""well ahead of this"" by diversifying its supply chain outside of China.

That's a strategy many Amazon sellers are also trying.

Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Reviving U.S. manufacturing?

Some categories, like toys, have a long history of being manufactured in China and have thus far been exempt from tariffs. Jay Foreman started his career at a toy factory in Brooklyn, New York, about 40 years ago.

Manufacturing migrated to China more than 30 years ago because of, ""not only a tremendous workforce, but they've invested in the infrastructure to create a toy manufacturing supply chain,"" said Foreman, CEO of Basic Fun, which makes popular toys like Tonka Trucks, Care Bears, Lincoln Logs, Tinker Toys, and Lite-Brite.

""Whether you're making a Tonka Truck in China or an Apple iPhone, they figured it out. They're making quality product there and it's tough to replicate elsewhere,"" Foreman said.

CNBC

A lot of toy manufacturing moved to Vietnam, Mexico and India in the last five years because of China tariffs during Trump's first term, Foreman said. But many of the toy factories there are also owned by Chinese companies, he said.

""So you're sort of not escaping doing business with the Chinese,"" Foreman said.

Other product categories, like teas, can't easily be grown in the U.S. because of the climate.

""You need high humidity. Usually you need to be at a very high altitude. And those things only come together in certain parts of the world, "" said James Fayal, who runs high-energy tea brand Zest. With its green tea grown in coastal China and black tea in India, Fayal said he'll have to pass the cost on to consumers because he doesn't have a U.S. option.

For the brands that do manufacture in the U.S., the tariffs are creating a competitive advantage, those companies said.

""Put our products side by side to a competitor's that is getting it overseas and it's a night and day difference,"" said Dayne Rusch of Vyper Industrial.

Vyper's American-made stools and other shop equipment range in price from $350 to $650 while foreign-made alternatives can sell for less than $40, Rusch said.

At the National Hardware Show in March, Rusch said he was approached by many vendors asking if Vyper would consider manufacturing their products.

""There's a huge opportunity for OEM manufacturers to start taking on more work from these people that were purchasing overseas and start making it here in the United States,"" Rusch said.

The other sells that spoke to CNBC said it's not financially feasible to relocate manufacturing to the U.S., even though it would allow them to avoid tariffs.

Some, like William Su, are moving manufacturing completely out of China, but staying overseas. Su set up a factory for his Teamson brand in Vietnam in reaction to China tariffs during Trump's first term. He's now in talks to manufacture in India. Trump hit both countries with significant tariffs last week, although they're temporarily on hold.

Surrounded by her colorful baby products in California, Kenney told CNBC she considered opening her own manufacturing site.

""But that's way over my head and out of my budget,"" she said. ""I would love to be able to manufacture in the U.S., but the truth is that the infrastructure is not there.""

With fewer factories in the U.S. than in China, Kenney said the cost to make her products domestically would be double or triple what she pays now.

""The people in China are hungry for the work,"" she said. ""They'll get back to you right away. They make sure you get your shipments right away. They're on it.""

Ending 'de minimis'

There is one tariff announcement Trump made that's a boon for U.S-based sellers like Kenney: closing the loophole known as ""de minimis.""

This exemption allowed orders under $800 to avoid paying duties and taxes, and it's what made absurdly low prices possible on direct-from-China sites like Temu, Alibaba and Shein. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it processed more than 1.3 billion de minimis shipments in 2024, up from over 1 billion shipments in 2023.

Chinese sellers send small orders directly to U.S. customers to keep shipments under the $800 limit. U.S. sellers like Kenney don't often qualify for de minimis because they ship in large quantities by the pallet, bringing products to their warehouses for quality checks instead of shipping straight to customers from Chinese factories.

Kenney used to sell her most popular product, a set of six silicone baby spoons, for $9.99 on Amazon. She's reduced the price to $7.99 to compete with knockoffs that sell for as low as $3 on Temu.

""I've even had them rip off all of my photos and content that I've created and use it to sell their knockoff products,"" Kenney said.

Katie tarasov

Trump briefly put de minimis on hold in February. Days later, he temporarily reinstated the loophole because huge numbers of Chinese packages started piling up at U.S. post offices and customs offices ill-equipped to collect duties at such a fast pace.

The president on April 2 again announced that he was ending de minimis, effective May 2.

The White House said ""adequate systems"" are now in place to collect tariffs. It added that the loophole is being closed to target ""deceptive"" Chinese-based shippers who ""hide illicit substances, including synthetic opioids, in low-value packages to exploit the de minimis exemption.""

Foreman of Basic Fun said his Tonka Truck goes through many layers of inspection before landing on Amazon.

""Anything that comes in on de minimis is not going through that safety scrutiny at all,"" Foreman said. ""Small packets that might have included a dress or some kind of tchotchke might have been stuffed with illegal drugs or things like that, might be counterfeit, might be bootlegs or knockoffs.""

Some Amazon sellers were benefiting from de minimis, particularly on its separate direct-from-China site Amazon Haul, which launched in November to compete with Temu. But killing de minimis will be a net positive for Amazon because it will hurt competitors like Temu, said Ives at Wedbush Securities.

De minimis is a ""loophole that's been tugging at Amazon really for the last 18 months,"" Ives said.

What remains to be seen is how Trump's tariffs will shift in coming weeks and what tariffs other countries will impose on U.S. goods. Those pose a risk for Amazon and its U.S. merchants that sell to foreign customers.

""It just has a cascading impact across the entire economy,"" Goldberg of Publicis Groupe said. ""Uncertainty is really bad for business, regardless of who wins or loses on any specific tariff.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108127219-1743964808556-Dusty_kneeling.jpg?v=1743965069&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-04-10 16:09:42.411335

“All of our X15 GHG 2027 engines are connected,” said Kerry-Leigh Goodier, director of digital market strategy and management, Cummins.
“With an Acumen module on their Cummins engine, they will use Virtual Vehicle.
Every insight pulled from the X15 engine also feeds back into the company’s development teams.
Watch the video for full details on the Cummins X15 GHG 27 engine platform connectivity.","The connected engine is no longer a futuristic concept—it’s the new standard. With the launch of the X15 GHG 27, Cummins engine connectivity has marked a turning point in the evolution of heavy-duty powertrains. What once required separate telematics systems and aftermarket hardware, in many cases, is now fully integrated at the engine level. This delivers real-time data, predictive maintenance insights, and over-the-air updates straight from the factory. It also represents more than just a tech upgrade. It’s a shift in how uptime, diagnostics, and operational efficiency are managed across an entire fleet.

“All of our X15 GHG 2027 engines are connected,” said Kerry-Leigh Goodier, director of digital market strategy and management, Cummins. “It’s either going to be through an OEM first-fit device or our own Acumen device, which is a smart hardware component that enables things like real-time monitoring, over-the-air capabilities, [and] predictive insights.”

That baked-in connectivity isn’t optional or aftermarket—it comes standard. Every X15 GHG 27 rolling off the line connects directly to a data ecosystem designed to reduce downtime and improve maintenance planning. This is true even if a fleet specs its trucks with an OEM-integrated solution or chooses Cummins’ own Acumen module.

From Unplanned to Proactive: Predictive Maintenance in Action

At the core of Cummins’ connectivity push is a move away from reactive service events. Instead of waiting for a fault code and dispatching a truck to a shop, fleets now have tools that forecast trouble before it causes a breakdown.

“Fleets with access to that real-time data and insights are going to be able to manage their maintenance events better,” Goodier explained. “Moving from that unplanned event to a planned event thanks to notifications they’ll get through the portals.”

This shift has direct implications for operations. Rather than pulling a truck from service unexpectedly, managers receive prioritized alerts that forecast component issues such as failing NOx sensors. The system provides mileage estimates to help schedule service in advance, minimizing disruption.

“We’re able to predict in mileage terms how soon you should bring the truck in,” Goodier said. “We alert customers through the portal, and we prioritize the notifications for them so they know what they need to address when. That way, they can bundle that service.”

The result is a more strategic approach to truck maintenance. This aims to reduce cost, avoid towing and emergency service calls and extend vehicle availability.

Engine Connectivity with Real-Time Data, Real Operational Impact

While predictive insights are the long game, the X15’s real-time data delivery offers immediate value. Live engine diagnostics allow managers to monitor asset health as it happens, rather than waiting for telematics to deliver updates hours—or even days—later.

“It adds huge benefit to the fleets in terms of just their downtime and what it costs them to take those vehicles out of service,” Goodier said. “We can get parts there before they even get into the service bay.”

Live data also plays a role in performance calibration. Over-the-air (OTA) updates now perform certain software fixes and calibrations remotely. This helps eliminate the need to plug into the engine at a service location.

“It’ll come through to the portal and tell you that there is a calibration available,” Goodier explained. “Fleet manager can approve it, it’ll buffer to the engine, and the driver then interacts to say, ‘Yes, we can successfully do the port over now,’ and it’s done—five minutes.”

For fleets where time is money, OTA capabilities represent a critical edge. The system pushes updates directly to the truck and prompts drivers only when it’s safe to complete them, preventing disruptions and eliminating unnecessary shop visits.

Seamless Integration with Fleet Systems

Cummins understands that fleets already rely on multiple systems and platforms to manage their operations. That’s why users can access data from the X15 in a variety of ways. Either from Cummins’ own Virtual Vehicle platform to OEM portals and custom-built fleet management systems.

“If they’re using an OEM portal, we have our data directly integrated into those,” Goodier said. “With an Acumen module on their Cummins engine, they will use Virtual Vehicle. If customers have their own fleet management systems, as some have homegrown solutions, we can integrate with those as well.”

The flexibility ensures that the data lives where managers need it most—alongside dispatch information, routing tools, and operational dashboards. That accessibility accelerates decision-making and enhances productivity.

Simplifying Complex Data into Actionable Insights

Of course, data is only useful if it’s understandable. Cummins is investing in visualization tools and dashboards that convert complex diagnostics and performance signals into intuitive alerts and recommendations.

“We use the platforms that really take this complex data and make it something that customers can use, and they can manage through,” Goodier said.

Just as important is the feedback loop between Cummins and its fleet partners. Every insight pulled from the X15 engine also feeds back into the company’s development teams. This helps refine future algorithms and prognostic capabilities.

“We work very closely with our fleets, our rental companies, and our end customers to understand their operations,” Goodier noted. “Their feedback is really important, feeding back into our development teams, and we’re coming up and improving our models and our digital capabilities.”

As engine intelligence grows, the relationship between fleets and technology continues to evolve—but not at the expense of the human element. If anything, Goodier said, it’s strengthening collaboration. For heavy duty truck equipment managers, that means better control over their assets, more predictable maintenance cycles, and less time lost in the bay.

What Factors Are Fueling Savory Snack Products Market Progress?

The escalating popularity of convenience food products is significantly influencing the expansion of the savory snack products market. Convenient food items such as pre-prepared restaurant meals and ready-to-eat groceries not only save time but also the effort involved in procurement, preparation, and tidying up. Such items are particularly beneficial for those who lack culinary skills or do not have the time to delve into finding and creating meals from the ground up, subsequently serving them as ready-to-consume meals. Hence, the surge in the use of convenience food products enhances the demand for savory snacks. For example, in July 2022, The Hindu Business Line, a recognized business newspaper in India, reported that due to time restrictions, 79% of Indian families preferred instant food. Consequently, the growing preference for convenience food products is propelling the advancement of the convenience food products market.

What Are the New Fees and Benefits for United Airlines' Credit Cards and Lounge Memberships?

United Airlines announced an increase in fees for its credit cards and lounge memberships last month, which the company said would make its cards more valuable to its customers. Here are the changes in fees that United implemented alongside its banking partner JPMorgan Chase:

The United Explorer Card annual fee has increased from $95 to $150.

The United Quest Card annual fee has increased from $250 to $350.

The United Club Card annual fee has increased from $525 to $695.

A United credit card provides benefits for holders such as complimentary Instacart memberships and rideshare credits. And regarding its United Club lounge network, passengers without elite status now pay $750 for individual memberships.

How is Consumer Confidence Influencing U.S. Travel Bookings?

Data from a survey released in March 2025 by The Conference Board indicated, despite a fourth consecutive month of declining consumer confidence, an increase in consumers planning to spend more on travel and vacations.

Skift reported in April that travel tech executives have seen early signs of weakening demand in U.S. travel, which is closely related to fluctuations in consumer confidence and economic uncertainty.

Lighthouse, a company tracking hotel market data, recently reported a 3-5% decrease in average hotel prices across major U.S. destinations over a 30-day period, with CEO Sean Fitzpatrick noting that it's tracking continued downward revisions for summer bookings. Mews founder Richard Valtr also said he's seen early signs of weakened summer bookings.

Executives at Hostaway and Guesty, two companies that both provide operations tech to short-term rental managers, believe that an economic strain may encourage Americans to choose less expensive domestic trips instead of international travel.

Note: The Bank of America Institute said that spending on travel and tourism was down in February and March.

How Is Google Using AI in Travel Search and Planning?

Google unveiled two AI-powered travel tools last month: hotel price alerts and a feature for turning screenshots into trip plans.

The alerts are an expansion of a tool on Google Flights, and they enable users to track hotel prices across specific areas and receive notifications when prices drop. The feature also allows users to set preferences based on criteria such as dates and hotel brands.

Meanwhile, Google Maps — using AI from Gemini — automatically saves places mentioned in screenshots to help users plan trips. The user can approve those items and view them later.

Google also recently rolled out features on Gemini that it said could help travelers during trip planning. Updates to Gemini include features that allow the AI to connect with Google apps. For example, Gemini can now use photos from a recent trip to develop a travel itinerary based on places visited, or offer restaurant recommendations based on previous food-related searches.

The Gems tool allows users to store personalized chatbots within the Gemini chat library. The user can instruct the chatbot to focus on a specific topic — like a trip to Bermuda — as the user asks questions.

Aside from the Gemini AI search engine, Google has been experimenting with integrating generative AI into traditional search. Since 2024, an AI-generated summary called AI Overviews has appeared at the top of some search results. The company earlier this month began publicly testing AI Mode as an expansion of that tool. AI Mode is shown as a tab in search results alongside the other tabs, like Images.",https://skift.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/UAL-DEN-B-East-Club-Fireplace-e1744314191137.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 16:09:29.266372

So, I’m encouraged by Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies in Manufacturing list, which includes not only startups, but also long-standing firms who are innovating. Where they’ve concentrated their efforts provides a glimpse into the industry’s future, from supply chain tech to 3D printing, sustainability, and more. Here are five takeaways from the winners.

1. Technology will reshape the supply chain.

Case in point: Kraft Heinz, the massive food and beverage company, which received a wake-up call during the pandemic. Faced with the reality that its supply chain was vulnerable, Kraft Heinz began work to automate its management system. The result, five years since the pandemic began, is three-fold. The company’s Lighthouse software keeps an eye on key supply chain metrics. Its digital platform, Connected Worker, brings together insights from across the company’s global factory footprint. And Kraft Heinz also uses digital twin, which helps the company recreate its physical operations in digital form so it can monitor efficiency and pinpoint areas of need.

The transformation has rapidly paid off. Supply chain waste is down 40%, sales forecasting is 20% more accurate, and inventory forecasting is 35% more accurate, all adding up to an estimated $1.1 billion in gross efficiencies over a less than two-year period.

2. 3D printing can significantly speed up manufacturing.

Case in point: Ursa Major, which is tackling the problem that, “rockets take much longer to build than they do to fly,” as FastCo puts it. Using additive manufacturing, Ursa Major’s Lynx production system can quickly print parts for solid rocket motors and efficiently switch from producing one type of motor to another. That’s an important development in the country’s ability to restore defense stocks that, most recently, dwindled as the U.S. provided aid to Ukraine. “One Lynx cell can print 1,600 solid-rocket motor casings for anti-tank weapons a year, more than three-quarters of the DOD’s surge-production rate for the Javelin anti-tank missile,” FastCo writes.

That’s good enough for the U.S. Navy, which gave Ursa Major a $12.5 million contract in 2024.

3. There’s a market for sustainability.

Case in point: P2 Science and HT Materials Science, a couple of green companies who’ve found a willing market. P2 works in the historically fossil fuel-reliant cosmetics industry, developing more sustainable options that aim to replace problematic polymers. Business is good: P2 projected 175% revenue growth in 2024 versus 2023.

Meanwhile, HT is tapping into its own sizable market, helping companies hit their sustainability and energy efficiency goals without tearing down facilities and rebuilding. HT’s additive, called Maxwell, works to improve heat transfer inside existing HVAC hardware—resulting in efficiency improvements of up to 20%.

4. Listening to your customers is a fast-track to product breakthroughs.

Case in point: Window and door-maker Pella, which sent representatives out to job sites to talk to the actual installers of its products and quickly noticed a common refrain. About 85% of window installers wanted a version they could put in from the inside, while standing on a floor, rather than the outside, while standing on a ladder.

The resulting Steady Set windows that Pella developed has helped crews cut down on time spent outdoors, extended several feet up off the ground, which comes with inherent dangers. Since its 2024 debut, already 15% of new-construction wood window projects have used the new design, Pella says.

5. AI will reach every manufacturer through software.

Case in point: Keychain, an AI-powered platform that helps companies in consumer goods packaging find and vet manufacturing partners that fit their needs. That has been a traditionally troublesome process that can take months or years depending on complexity—which is on the rise as new food rules keep greater tabs on what we consume.

Keychain’s technology uses AI to provide data in real time on production availability, schedules, and cost. Increasingly, this will be the way of the world for manufacturers—they’ll need to work with software providers that have figured out how factories can put AI to use.

The manufacturers that thrive over the next decade will be the ones that seize whatever technology opportunities emerge and figure out how to use them to improve competitiveness and profitability. These examples of the most innovative companies in manufacturing show just how powerful tech can be to any company eyeing growth. And with lingering global uncertainty, this may be the only sure bet for manufacturing.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/675c9246b8278d95278d23c8/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-04-10 15:11:55.246254

In 2023, the network revamped its Friday night primetime slate to create a weekly doubleheader, WNBA Friday Night Spotlight.
WNBA Friday Night Spotlight pulled in 670,000 viewers, more than doubling 2023 numbers.
Teams have not been announced for 2025, but Lawlor expects top programs will continue to play in the event.
Lawlor said the new events will attract more first-time advertisers to Ion, following the pattern of the WNBA and NWSL.","Prior to Scripps’ upfront presentation at the Barclays Center on Wednesday night, Scripps Sports president Brian Lawlor said the company remains in discussion with the WNBA to extend the league’s broadcasting deal with Ion Television, a sign of how important women’s sports have become to the media company.

The initial three-year deal, in which Ion pays the league $13 million annually, expires at the end of the 2025 season.

“When the NBA did all of their big deals, they bundled in a lot of the WNBA rights to NBC and to Disney and [Amazon],” Lawlor said in an interview. “The one thing you didn’t see bundled in was Friday night. They really value what Ion brings with that national distribution, the new audience, the incredible visibility, so they protected Friday nights. I fully expect that—not just this season, but for many years down the road—we’ll be long-term partners with them.”

Ion has traditionally held a mostly female audience thanks to being a long-time syndication home for procedural crime dramas such as Law & Order: SVU, Criminal Minds and Blue Bloods. In 2023, the network revamped its Friday night primetime slate to create a weekly doubleheader, WNBA Friday Night Spotlight.

After a solid first season, the Caitlin Clark phenomenon in 2024 gave the network seven telecasts with over 1 million viewers, lifting the primetime daypart by 133%. WNBA Friday Night Spotlight pulled in 670,000 viewers, more than doubling 2023 numbers.

Ion also signed a broadcasting deal with the NWSL in 2024, creating a second “franchise” programming block with a Saturday doubleheader for most of its telecasts. The network averaged 145,000 viewers across 50 matches, with its top-rated showing of 234,000 viewers on July 6 when the eventual league champion Orlando Pride snapped the Kansas City Current’s 17-game unbeaten streak.

“Our sports audience in the WNBA and NWSL is younger, it’s more diverse, and it’s more balanced male/female than our normal Ion programming,” Lawlor said. “So we’re bringing the league new viewers because of our platform, and their loyal fans are finding Ion for the first time and then sticking around watching other stuff.”

Scripps remains open to working with any league on distribution, but the two “franchises” have been building blocks for other women’s competitions to come on board.

Ion will be the exclusive home to a new biannual event from Sports Illustrated, the SI Women’s Games, that’s set to debut in late October. The weeklong “Team Americas vs. Team World” event will feature elite athletes competing for prize money in flag football, basketball, volleyball, tennis, gymnastics and combat sports.

Lawlor said some athletes have already been signed, with “the opportunity to have Olympic gold and silver medalists, finalists, competing against each other in this event. I think it will get a lot of attention at the point when we start announcing who is going to participate.”

Ion will also be the home of the Elevance Health Women’s Fort Myers Tip-Off for the next five years. The Thanksgiving basketball showcase has previously featured collegiate powers South Carolina, Tennessee, Maryland and Purdue. Teams have not been announced for 2025, but Lawlor expects top programs will continue to play in the event.

Lawlor said the new events will attract more first-time advertisers to Ion, following the pattern of the WNBA and NWSL. For the SI Women’s Games in particular, Ion will have daytime shows where athletes will tell stories about their professional careers and the importance of supporting girls in sports.

“We’re going to be doing a lot of programming that won’t be visible on TV,” he said, adding, “there’ll be a lot of connections and activations with clients there that will be really unique for the space.”",https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2169149746-e1744302322232.jpg?w=1024,N,,2025-04-10 15:11:42.111375

DoorDash, a leading local commerce platform globally and Coco Robotics, a leading food delivery robotics company, announced an expansion of their partnership to offer sidewalk robot delivery for DoorDash customers in select U.S. markets. This builds on an existing pilot program with Wolt—DoorDash’s international arm—where Coco robots have been making deliveries in Helsinki since earlier this year. The U.S. rollout is now live in Los Angeles and Chicago, where eligible customers can see the availability of Coco’s fleet of emissions-free sidewalk robots and may have one assigned to their order from nearly 600 participating merchants through the DoorDash app.

During the initial pilot phase, Coco completed over 100,000 deliveries for DoorDash customers. This expanded partnership reinforces DoorDash’s ongoing commitment to advancing last-mile logistics by building the most efficient, sustainable, and scalable multi-modal delivery platform.

“Not every delivery needs a 2-ton car just to deliver two chicken sandwiches,” said Harrison Shih, Senior Director of DoorDash Labs. “We believe the future of delivery will be multi-modal, and we’re thrilled to partner with Coco to expand sidewalk robot deliveries that complement the Dasher network as we continue to enhance the DoorDash experience for customers and merchants.”

Robot delivery is part of DoorDash’s broader global multi-modal delivery platform strategy — integrating Dashers, drones, and autonomous robots to meet increasing demand while lowering costs and emissions.

“We’re excited to expand our partnership with DoorDash, combining Coco’s AI robocourier platform with DoorDash’s national scale and reach,” said Zach Rash, co-founder and CEO of Coco Robotics. “This collaboration marks an important step forward in reshaping urban delivery in the US, starting with Los Angeles and Chicago, to offer merchants and customers a reliable, sustainable, and delightful delivery experience.”

“Partnering with Coco and DoorDash has allowed us to consistently deliver fresh food to our customers on time,” said Eric Dela Cruz, owner of Main Chick Hot Chicken in Los Angeles. “We worked with Coco to establish a ‘taxi line’ of robots so we can get food out to our customers faster, even during our busiest hours. The improved operational efficiency translates directly into happier guests and stronger repeat business. We’re excited about what this partnership means for our growth.”

Coco has been operating in Los Angeles since 2020 and recently launched in Chicago, Miami and Helsinki, Finland. Coco has a fleet of over 1,000 emissions-free delivery robots.

Building on nearly a decade of investment and development in its autonomy platform, alongside its world-class logistics infrastructure, DoorDash is uniquely positioned to enable commercialized autonomous delivery. The partnership with Coco was developed through DoorDash Labs, DoorDash’s robotics and automation arm. DoorDash Labs expanded its investment in autonomous delivery through its partnership with Wing, which introduced drone deliveries to the U.S. after an initial pilot in Australia. By leveraging a multi-modal approach that integrates Dashers, robots, and drones into DoorDash’s logistics network, the goal is to ensure the most effective fulfillment method for every order while driving increased demand for local merchants and creating more earning opportunities for Dashers.",https://cdn.perishablenews.com/2025/04/FS_DoorDash.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 16:09:34.700984

“Gig workers demonstrate the same dedication, hard work, and competence as traditional employees, and it’s time they have access to the protection they deserve.
However, despite their increasing economic contributions, many gig workers remain vulnerable due to the lack of employment security, health benefits, and insurance coverage—a gap AXA Philippines is now working to address.
Recognizing this urgent need, AXA Philippines—one of the country’s leading life insurance providers—is spearheading efforts to empower gig workers with affordable and sustainable protection.
AXA’s program offers not just protection but recognition—validating gig workers as vital contributors to the economy who deserve financial safeguards, Kandil said.","CEBU, Philippines — Insurance firm AXA Philippines has strengthened its support for the country’s growing gig economy by providing gig workers with easier access to health benefits and insurance coverage.

“Ensuring inclusive protection has always been a core part of our mission,” said Ayman Kandil, President and CEO of AXA Philippines.

“Gig workers demonstrate the same dedication, hard work, and competence as traditional employees, and it’s time they have access to the protection they deserve. Through this partnership, we are taking concrete steps to close the protection gap and provide peace of mind to those constantly on the move,” Kandil added.

As the gig economy in the Philippines continues to expand, a growing number of freelancers, ride-hailing drivers, and delivery riders are emerging as key contributors to the country’s evolving labor market.

However, despite their increasing economic contributions, many gig workers remain vulnerable due to the lack of employment security, health benefits, and insurance coverage—a gap AXA Philippines is now working to address.

According to the Philippine Institute for Development Studies, freelance earnings surged by an impressive 208 percent between 2019 and 2020. Yet, for many in this sector, financial protection remains out of reach.

Recognizing this urgent need, AXA Philippines—one of the country’s leading life insurance providers—is spearheading efforts to empower gig workers with affordable and sustainable protection.

Through its global inclusive insurance unit, “AXA EssentiALL,” the company is redefining financial security for the underserved.

Operating across 14 markets and serving more than 14 million customers as of 2023, AXA EssentiALL delivers tailored insurance products designed for individuals often excluded from traditional coverage.

In the Philippines, this global initiative has taken root through a strategic partnership between AXA Philippines, PhilPacific Insurance Brokers & Managers, Inc. (Philinsure), Grab, and MOVE IT.

The collaboration aims to extend up to PHP 1 million in insurance coverage to thousands of ride-hailing and delivery partners—offering critical protection for individuals who risk their safety every day to serve an increasingly digital consumer base.

Philinsure brings its microinsurance expertise to the initiative, supporting AXA’s vision of delivering innovative and accessible insurance solutions that align with the realities of informal and evolving employment models.

For companies like Grab Philippines, the initiative represents more than just corporate support—it’s a commitment to the long-term well-being of their partners.

“Our partners are the backbone of our platform. Supporting their well-being means protecting their future, not just their present livelihoods,” a Grab representative shared.

As work structures continue to shift and the gig economy becomes a permanent fixture in the Philippine labor landscape, initiatives like this mark a pivotal step in promoting welfare and resilience among non-traditional workers.

“Viewers will be in store for another hilarious topsy-turvy journey in season two.” Scripps Sports, meanwhile, expanded its portfolio of women’s sports.

“This is another milestone for Scripps Sports and ION as a premier destination for the best in women’s sports.”","Scripps Networks has expanded its offering with the renewal of two original series, and Scripps Sports has added several women’s sports to its portfolio.

Among the series renewed for Scripps Networks is Court TV’s Interview with a Killer, which sees investigative reporter and journalist David Scott sit down face-to-face with convicted murderers around the U.S.

A two-hour second season premiere is set for April 13. The premiere will include “Psycho Killer,” in which Scott interviews Gary Michael Hilton, who calls himself the oldest serial killer in America. It will also include “National Forest Serial Killer,” in which the titular murderer confesses for the first time to the killing of a Florida woman and reveals new information about three other homicides.

“David is incredible—truly one of the best journalists and interviewers in the business,” said Ethan Nelson, executive producer of the series and head of Court TV. “He has the rare ability to delve into the mindset of murderers and dispassionately challenge the claims they make. It captured the attention of millions of viewers in season one,” said Nelson. “Season two takes it up a notch. David, who is unparalleled in his prep work, not only draws out never-before-heard confessions but also catalyzes actual remorse in a couple of the killers. It is remarkable to watch.”

“There is no experience in true-crime television like coming face-to-face with convicted killers,” Scott commented. “And there is no greater challenge for an interviewer than to peel open a window into the mindset and motivations behind their murders. This show serves up justice for the court of public opinion using the unique power of the good old-fashioned hardball interview, and results are compelling, chilling and unforgettable.”

Scripps Networks also renewed Bounce TV’s comedy Mind Your Business, which will return for a second season on June 7. The series tells the story of the Williams family, who are in the business of celebrating some of life’s most significant occasions with its event and party space in Chicago. The series stars Caryn Ward Ross (Fame, Monogamy, Patterns of Attraction), Brely Evans (Ambitions, Being Mary Jane, The Man in 3B), Bryce Xavier (A Bennett Song Holiday, Stay Tuned: The Movie, Total Eclipse) and Chloe Elise Ellis (Borrasca, Footprints, Three Stories Up). It is produced by Harvest Studios.

“The Williams family entertained millions in its debut season, and now the family is back for more,” said Adam Harman, senior VP of programming at Scripps Networks. “Viewers will be in store for another hilarious topsy-turvy journey in season two.”

Scripps Sports, meanwhile, expanded its portfolio of women’s sports. ION has become the exclusive TV home of the Elevance Health Women’s Fort Myers Tip-Off, an early-season college basketball tournament, for the next five years as part of a multiyear agreement with Intersport. The agreement begins with this year’s edition of the Thanksgiving weekend tournament, held from November 28 to 29. ION will air every matchup live both days, with distribution on cable, satellite, major streaming platforms and over-the-air. The tournament marks the first national women’s college basketball rights deal for Scripps Sports.

“As the popularity of women’s sports among audiences and advertisers continues to explode, the Elevance Health Women’s Fort Myers Tip-Off will immediately become another major sports property for ION,” said Brian Lawlor, president of Scripps Sports. “We’re proud that women’s sports have found a home on ION, and we look forward to bringing fans the action-packed world of women’s college basketball this fall.”

“Scripps Sports and ION are now a top destination for women’s sports, and we’re thrilled to partner with them for the Elevance Health Women’s Fort Myers Tip-Off,” added Mark Starsiak, senior VP of Intersport. “This tournament has proven to be an exciting one for college basketball fans everywhere, and the Scripps Sports team will elevate this event even further.”

In addition, ION will be the exclusive U.S. broadcast home of the new Sports Illustrated (SI) Women’s Games, a new biennial all-star competition featuring elite athletes across six sports. The participating athletes will have the opportunity to earn prize money based on competition results, while competing for the title of SI Women’s Games Champion.

“The SI Women’s Games are a groundbreaking opportunity to do what we have always done at Sports Illustrated,” commented Steve Cannella, Sports Illustrated’s editor-in-chief. “This is an exciting new way for us to tell the best stories in sports. We can’t wait to watch these incredible athletes compete in California and celebrate everything they do, both on and off the field.”

The most recognized chain in the sector has launched a new restaurant format in Los Angeles, California, that breaks with the traditional model. No tables, no chairs, and no dining area.

This new concept, known as ""McDonald's On the Go,"" was revealed in December and quickly captured the public's attention. All thanks to it being shared on social media by the X account @McFranchisee. What makes this establishment special is its total focus on efficiency, speed, and a contactless experience.

Instead of the classic dine-in experience, this McDonald's is designed exclusively for mobile orders and deliveries. The location features a window for picking up orders made through the app, and special lockers for McDelivery orders. These lockers allow customers to pick up their food without needing to interact with employees.

McDonald's Debuts in the United States with This Innovation

Something that had already been implemented in other countries, but debuts for the first time in the United States. The rise of this type of solution dates back to the habit changes left by the pandemic. It was then that social distancing and the need for speed became a priority.

Since then, the industry has evolved rapidly, adopting technologies that allow for process optimization. McDonald's is not the only company betting on these changes. Starbucks, Taco Bell, and Chick-fil-A are also prioritizing service through drive-thru and digital orders.

Currently, 70% of the more than 40,000 McDonald's restaurants worldwide already have drive-thru service. Therefore, the company considers that these speed-focused models are key to future growth. The elimination of the dining area, in addition to reducing operating costs, can allow restaurants to be located in smaller spaces.

A Project in the Testing Phase

Although this initiative is still in the testing phase, its implementation could mark a turning point. The big question now is whether this model will end up completely replacing the traditional restaurant. Are we at the beginning of the end for dining areas in McDonald's?

For now, McDonald's is ahead of its direct competitors, like Burger King, by strongly betting on automation and digital convenience. The truth is that the future of fast food is already underway. It comes without a tray.",https://edatv.news/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-restaurante-externo-mcdonalds-burger-king-chico-sorprendido_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-04-10 14:11:23.598110

And I think this team and this collaboration under the vision of Philips, that's how you bring manufacturing back.","Philips company leaders and Gov. Walz celebrated on Thursday as the company moved forward with a new expansion in Plymouth, Minn.

Philips expansion

The backstory:

Back in December, the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development announced it was sending more than $3.5 million to support the expansion, while Philips announced it would invest $31 million into the project. DEED said the expansion was expected to create 158 new jobs.

Dig deeper:

Philips, a Dutch conglomerate, is expanding its image-guided therapies division, which makes medical scanning equipment. The company plans to add more manufacturing and research and development capabilities with the expansion.

The expansion will also bring a new training center to the Philips campus that the state says will bring in 2,000 visitors annually.

Walz celebrates expansion

What they're saying:

Gov. Walz lauded the expansion at a Thursday news conference. He pointed out that, while Philips is mostly known for its household goods, it has a large product line, like its medical products.

""Philips is a household name, but I think many people don't understand how broad they are and how deeply they are into some of these,"" said Walz. ""And they use a statistic… They said, ‘At one point in time, the only entity that produced more light than Phillips was the sun – which was a true fact. But reinventing themselves, reinventing what that technology looks like, a hundred-and-thirty-year-old company that’s now at the forefront of making someone's life easier.""

Walz also touted the state adding new manufacturing jobs.

""I think for Minnesotans, you hear a lot about bringing manufacturing back to America,"" said Walz. ""We couldn't agree more with that. And I think this team and this collaboration under the vision of Philips, that's how you bring manufacturing back. Those are the jobs you want to see.

Prada said the 47-year-old Versace brand offered “significant untapped growth potential.’’ “This is exactly the strength for our group.
The final value of the deal will be adjusted at closing, which is expected in the second half of the year, the Prada Group said.
An analyst presentation for the Prada deal said that Versace would represent 13% of the Prada Group's pro-forma revenues, with Miu Miu coming in at 22% and Prada at 64%.
The Prada Group, which also includes Church’s footwear, reported a 17% boost in revenues to 5.4 billion euros last year.","ROME (AP) — The Prada Group announced a deal Thursday to buy crosstown Milan fashion rival Versace from the U.S. luxury group Capri Holdings (CPRI) under terms that values one of the most recognizable names in Italian fashion at 1.25 billion euros ($1.4 billion).

The deal will put Versace, known for sexy silhouettes and bold Greco and Medusa motifs, under the same roof as Prada’s “ugly chic” aesthetic and the youth-driven Miu Miu whose stunning growth in recent years has far outpaced the market. Prada said the 47-year-old Versace brand offered “significant untapped growth potential.’’

“This is exactly the strength for our group. There are no overlaps in terms of creativity, in terms of customer,″ said Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s chief marketing officer, who is being groomed to one day take over the business that his parents — Miuccia Prada, the group's creative force and largest shareholder, and Patrizio Bertelli, its chairman and executive director — have turned into a global fashion juggernaut.

“We are buying a brand with huge potential, with a very recognizable aesthetic,"" Lorenzo Bertelli said, underlining that the Versace brand name recognition, putting it among the top 10 in the world, far outweighs its business performance.

The final value of the deal will be adjusted at closing, which is expected in the second half of the year, the Prada Group said. It will be funded by 1.5 billion euros in new debt and has been approved by the Prada and Capri Holdings board of directors.

Prada Chief Executive Andrea Guerra said the deal was aimed at building a “sustainable revenue growth” and boosting the brand's identity, and was not about squeezing synergies. Prada's statement underlined that Versace will “maintain its creative DNA and cultural authenticity, ” while benefitting from its “industrial capabilities, retail execution and operations expertise. ”

There are no plans to change the CEO and Miuccia Prada will not be involved in the creative side of Versace, the executives said. Guerra added that the recent creative shakeup at Versace, with Miu Miu head of design Dario Vitale replacing Donatella Versace as creative director effective April 1, had nothing to do with the deal. He called it “an independent, very personal” decision by Vitale.

Lorenzo Bertelli said the experience of Miu Miu's growth had shown that small changes can make all the difference. ”We don't need to change the brand, revolutionize it. We need to just evolve it, make the right things happen, and all together they are hopefully going to bring a huge spark and bring back Versace to be a huge success,'' he said.

Capri Holdings, which owns Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo, paid $2 billion for Versace in 2018, but had been struggling to position Versace’s bold profile in the recent era of “quiet luxury.″

Versace represented 20% of Capri Holdings 2024 revenue of 5.2 billion euros. An analyst presentation for the Prada deal said that Versace would represent 13% of the Prada Group's pro-forma revenues, with Miu Miu coming in at 22% and Prada at 64%. The Prada Group, which also includes Church’s footwear, reported a 17% boost in revenues to 5.4 billion euros last year.

Donatella Versace, who took over as creative director at the fashion house founded by her brother, Gianni Versace, after his 1997 murder, continues with the fashion house in the new role of chief brand ambassador.

“I am absolutely delighted to become part of the Prada family,'' she wrote in a post on Instagram beneath a photograph of herself and Miuccia Prada. ”I am honored to have the brand in the hands of such a trusted Italian family business, and I am ready to support this new era for the brand in any way I can.”

The Italian government welcomed a deal that appears to secure Versace's longer term future as other family-owned fashion brands have faltered or even disappeared after opening up to outside investors.

""An historic ‘Made in Italy’ brand is Italian again,'' Industry Minister Adolfo Urso said.

Our proven track record of integrating acquisitions and driving profitable growth gives us the confidence to deliver incredible value for our shareholders.""

When Tilray began buying up formerly independent craft breweries from Anheuser-Busch/InBev in 2023 the news was greeted with great optimism. Those breweries 10 Barrel Brewing, Widmer Brothers, Redhook Brewery, Square Mile Cider, Shock Top, Breckenridge Brewery, Blue Point Brewing, and HiBall Energy were promised big things like reinvestment into the brands, new resources, and reinstatement by the Brewers Association into official “craft brewery” status. All that optimism quickly faded when Tilray slashed the entire innovation brewing team at 10 Barrel Brewing, and laid off sales and admin positions across multiple brands as the corporation moved to cut costs and consolidate operations. Then in February 2025 Tilray ordered production at Revolver Brewing in Fort Worth, Texas to move brewing operations out of their facility.

On Monday, April 7th employees of Hop Valley Brewing were informed that all brewing operations will be ceasing at their Eugene headquarters and primary brewing production facility by this July. The Hop Valley beers aren’t going anywhere, all of their beers will now be brewed at either 10 Barrel Brewing in Bend or Widmer Brothers Brewing in Portland. The entire operations team at the Eugene brewery will be let go and some of the administrative and marketing staff have already been laid off.

Tilray Brands will most likely continue to cut back on operations across all of their brands to make production cheaper. However they seem to still have interest in taprooms as both Hop Valley’s original brewpub in Springfield, and their taproom next to the brewery in Eugene, will both remain open and in operation along with their new Hop Valley “Hop Box” satellite taproom inside the MODA Center in Portland. Tilray is also currently working to reopen the Widmer Brothers Brewing taproom in Portland which was closed in 2019.

Leger, a Canadian market research and analytics company, has just published the results of its 28th Reputation study, which unveils the list of the country's top reputable companies. The company surveyed over 38,000 Canadians to find their perspective on 326 companies across 30 sectors.

""Conducted annually, it is based on Leger's exclusive model of six recognized pillars of reputation — financial success, social responsibility, honesty, transparency, quality, attachment, and innovation,"" reads the statement. Companies are scored based on these factors, with 100 being the maximum a company can score.

Costco Canada and other reputable companies of 2025

According to Canadians, Google was the most reputable company in 2024 with a reputation score of 75, followed by Sony.

This year, Google (72) fell several spots after being dethroned by Costco Canada (74), while Sony retained second place (74).

Here are 2025's most reputable companies, and their reputation scores:

Costco (74)

Sony (74)

Samsung (73)

Google (72)

Canadian Tire (71)

YouTube (71)

Interac (69)

Dollarama (68)

Home Depot (68)

Toyota (67)

Canadians' perception of these companies fluctuates and reflects how they see the world around them, according to Lisa Covens, senior vice-president of public affairs and communications at Leger.

""In today's marketplace, brands that understand the evolving expectations of Canadians and actively work to meet them are the ones that will earn and keep their trust,"" she stated.

The Trump effect

The ranking reflects issues on Canadians' minds, with 10 per cent saying they're worried about housing affordability and healthcare. Concerns about inflation (21 per cent) have been surpassed by worries about tariffs, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. aggression (32 per cent).

According to Leger, the day Trump was sworn in for his second term marked ""a turning point"" as he announced tariffs that strained Canada-U.S. relations.

According to Leger's list of the 10 most admired companies in Canada, several U.S. companies' reputations have taken a hit.

McDonald's and Starbucks lost 22 points, while Netflix lost 27 points after price hikes and growing anti-American sentiment.

Coca-Cola (-24) and Google (-16) publicly supported Trump and saw some big reputational hits.

Canadians didn't take kindly to companies' affiliations with Trump, as Amazon's (-29) and Meta's (-28) reputations have tanked. However, Tesla was the biggest loser this year, losing -42 points.

The redemption arc

Out of all the Canadians who participated in the survey, 85 per cent are proud to be Canadian.

So, it's unsurprising that rising anti-American sentiment has led Canadians to choose Canadian companies.

Here are the top 10 Canadian companies, according to participants:

Canadian Tire

Interact

Dollarama

Shoppers Drug Mart

McCain

Maple Leaf

Winners

Mark's

A&W

Cineplex

Canadian Tire saw a steady increase of four points as its alignment with national values ""continues to reinforce consumer trust."" Air Canada (+8) and Sunwing (+6) have rebounded from previous lows, but Canada Post appears to have had the most significant resurgence.

Last year's biggest loser due to strikes and service issues, Canada Post's reputation surged 24 points as ""Canadians rallied behind homegrown brands.""

But Leger warns that top companies can't rest on their laurels yet.

""Reputation 2025 shows that Canadians are watching closely — and acting accordingly,"" reads the survey.

""In an era of political polarization, economic strain, and global uncertainty, brand perception is being shaped by more than price and performance. Companies must not only deliver value but align with consumer values.""",https://display.blogto.com/articles/20250410-most-reputable-companies-canada.jpg?w=1200&cmd=resize_then_crop&height=630&quality=70,N,,2025-04-10 13:14:29.486064

New product evolution enables direct accessibility in the operating room

Innovation is a direct result of collaborative efforts with surgeons, helping to ensure that customer needs are met and promoting enhanced patient care

VIENNA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Baxter International Inc. (BAX), a global leader in advancing surgical innovation, today announced the introduction of Hemopatch Sealing Hemostat with room temperature storage at a symposium in Austria. The evolution of the product optimizes accessibility in the operating room, delivering an immediate solution for surgeons to control bleeding or prevent leakage. The product is now available to order throughout Europe.

“For over a decade, Hemopatch Sealing Hemostat has offered surgeons a reliable solution for tissue sealing, dura sealing, and hemostasis,” said Steve Wallace, president, Advanced Surgery at Baxter. “The product evolution to include room temperature storage is a result of close collaboration between surgeons and Baxter. Removing the need for refrigeration addresses the needs of our customers to have the product on hand in critical situations. We are proud to continue Baxter's legacy of innovation in sealing and hemostasis.”

Hemopatch Sealing Hemostat is a ready-to-use absorbable collagen pad intended for tissue sealing, dura sealing and hemostasis, and is effective and safe to use in open surgery and minimally invasive surgery. In a registry of real-world data across Europe, the product has been shown to achieve rapid and sustainable hemostasis in many surgical specialties.1

General Surgeon, Prof. Dr. med. Selman Uranüs said, “More than 10 years ago, I first used Hemopatch Sealing Hemostat for experimental testing. Since then, I have been using it in my daily practice because of its unique characteristics as a sealing hemostatic patch, especially in laparoscopic surgery. In my opinion, eliminating the need for refrigeration and increasing product shelf life are crucial improvements because it enables surgeons to have the product available in the operating room when it matters most. After application, the product shows an enhanced adhesive strength supporting us surgeons to achieve better surgical outcomes.”2

INDICATIONS

Hemopatch Sealing Hemostat is indicated as a hemostatic device and surgical sealant across various soft tissues (cardiovascular, connective tissue, parenchyma, serosa, viscera), and dura for procedures in which control of mild or moderate bleeding or leakage of other body fluids or air by conventional surgical techniques is either ineffective or impractical. Hemopatch Sealing Hemostat may be used to augment dura closure techniques to close small dural defects (≤3mm) following traumatic injury, excision, retraction or shrinkage of the dura mater.

IMPORTANT RISK INFORMATION

Hemopatch Sealing Hemostat is not recommended to be used in pulsatile, severe bleedings.

The use of Hemopatch Sealing Hemostat is not recommended in the presence of an active infection.

When used in, around, or in proximity to foramina in bone, areas of bony confine, the spinal cord, the brain and/or cranial nerves, care should be exercised to avoid overpacking as Hemopatch Sealing Hemostat may expand upon absorption of liquid, creating the potential for neural damage.

Hemopatch Sealing Hemostat is not intended as a substitute for meticulous surgical technique and the proper application of ligatures or other conventional procedures for hemostasis and sealing.

Do not compress Hemopatch Sealing Hemostat into blood vessels or use intravascularly.

All three sectors that make up business activity, slowed in Dublin in Q1 2025.
The Rest of Ireland (52.7) saw a quicker expansion in new business than Dublin.
The Rest of Ireland (51.4) posted a broadly similar rate of job creation to that seen in Dublin.","The latest PMI survey from S&P Global, shows that business activity in Dublin’s private sector increased in the first quarter of 2025, albeit at a softer rate than Q4 2024. The headline rate stood at 52.6, down from 54.7 in the previous quarter. Crucially this remains above the 50 point mark that denotes expansion but uncertainty around the implementation of US trade tariffs will likely weigh on business activity in the coming quarters. At 52.4, output across the Rest of Ireland remained marginally slower than Dublin.

All three sectors that make up business activity, slowed in Dublin in Q1 2025. The Manufacturing sector (48.9) experienced a contraction in activity for the first time in 3 quarters. Both the Construction (57.8) and Service (53.4) sectors posted increases in activity but at slower rates than seen in Q4 2024 when they were at 59.6 and 55.1 respectively. The Rest of Ireland saw increases in activity in both the Manufacturing (52.2) and Service (55.6) sectors but a decline in Construction (48.8).

New orders (52.0) continued to rise in the Capital extending the current sequence of growth to five successive quarters. However, the rate of expansion declined to its joint-slowest of the past year, resulting in only a modestly positive reading. The Rest of Ireland (52.7) saw a quicker expansion in new business than Dublin.

The pace of job creation in Dublin (51.2) increased QoQ, as companies continued to take on extra staff. However, the expansion was only modest and the rate of new employment decreased YoY from the 53.9 level seen in Q1 2024. The Rest of Ireland (51.4) posted a broadly similar rate of job creation to that seen in Dublin.

Commenting on the PMI, Andrew Harker, Economics Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence said:

“The Dublin private sector made a positive start to 2025, with business activity rising on the back of higher new orders. There was good news for the labour market as well, with the pace of job creation picking up. The picture in the capital was broadly similar to across the Rest of Ireland in the early part of the year. One slight area of concern was a reduction in manufacturing output which limited the overall pace of growth. This will hopefully be a temporary blip and we’ll see growth return in the second quarter, with the fall perhaps representing some caution in the sector amid uncertainty around US trade policy.”",https://www.dublincity.ie/themes/custom/weatherlab/components/images/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-04-10 15:12:36.023712

Foundever appoints a new President for France: Claire Calméjane

Foundever, formerly Sitel and Acticall, the world's number 3 in customer experience, announces the arrival of Claire Calméjane as President for France. Claire Calméjane took up her post on 1 April 2025, succeeding Olivier Blanchard, who will take on the role of coordinating operations in Africa alongside Benedita Miranda, General Manager of on-shore/off-shore operations.

Claire Calméjane said, ‘At Foundever, alongside Chris Halbard, CEO of the EMEA Market, I come to develop and accelerate the deployment of our multimodal AI and data offering, serving both our advisers, who will be augmented by AI, and our customers, to improve service quality and create value. ’

With twenty years' experience in the tech and financial services sector, she has led structuring transformation programmes within organisations such as Société Générale, Lloyds Banking Group and Capgemini. Claire Calméjane is an expert in artificial intelligence, fintech, IT transformation and digital P&L. She is also an investor and board member. So it's a new woman at the helm of the French subsidiary of the former Sitel, following in the footsteps of Chloé Beauvallet. The question to be asked, in a BPO market in the throes of consolidation and turned upside down by conversational agents, for example, is what impact a new subsidiary CEO can have in this type of group.

‘It's no longer clear how much autonomy the heads of the FSM (French speaking market) subsidiaries of the major global players have’, says a good market observer: ’they are all indicating that they are moving in the direction of tech, of AI combined with people. In fact, the first significant experiments with conversational agents or improving contactability in prospecting, two key issues, are being carried out by brands or small and medium-sized businesses’, adds the observer. Ici Miami, allô la France?

Accenture is creating or reactivating a BPO/Customer Relations subsidiary, with one of its call centres based in Marcq-en-Baroeul in the north of France, and operations headed up by Jean-Marc Penelaud, ex-DRC of La Redoute. Already present in the Trust and Safety business, the global consulting giant is now officially offering a BPO, IT and digital transformation supermarket : consulting, moderation, BPO. Accenture Post Trade Processing is the name of this entity, which has existed in France for twelve years and whose turnover varies massively each year. Philippe Guyonnet is its CEO. The company is recruiting.

Edouard Layeillon, ex-Foundever, has left Tersea, two years after taking up his post, without the reasons for this rapid departure being known. He was DG Commerce. It is not known who left whom.

A Hy-Vee spokesperson confirmed the pub closures, which take effect May 1, but declined to say how many in-store bars are currently operating or how many will remain.
Additionally, some Market Grille locations were full service, but now all will be limited service, with all orders placed at the counter, Potthoff said.
Hy-Vee currently has about 220 Market Grille and Market Grille Express locations in its more than 285 supermarkets across Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.

A Hy-Vee spokesperson confirmed the pub closures, which take effect May 1, but declined to say how many in-store bars are currently operating or how many will remain.

“We remain committed to providing a family-friendly atmosphere that prioritizes an exceptional experience for everyone,” Spokesperson Tina Potthoff said in an emailed statement.

Additionally, some Market Grille locations were full service, but now all will be limited service, with all orders placed at the counter, Potthoff said.

The changes come about three months after the Midwestern grocery chain said it would close all 79 Wahlburgers locations in its stores, replacing them with its Market Grille concept.

Hy-Vee currently has about 220 Market Grille and Market Grille Express locations in its more than 285 supermarkets across Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.

The changes are designed to ensure consistency across the brand, Potthoff said.

“We had some stores that had bars and some that didn’t. We also had some stores that only had counter service and some that had full service,” she said. “Now a customer will know what kind of experience they can expect to have at our in-store Market Grille locations no matter what store they dine in.”

Going forward, made-to-order breakfast and lunch orders can be placed at the counter from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. daily, Hy-Vee said, with dinner options like pizza, fried chicken, sushi, and Chinese food available until 8 p.m., all of which can be consumed inside Market Grille locations.

In 2020, Hy-Vee announced it would replace some of its Market Grille locations with outposts of the Hingham, Massachusetts-based Wahlburgers burger chain, which was founded in 2011 by celebrity brothers Mark, Donnie, and Paul Wahlberg.

In January, Wahlburgers CEO Randy Sharpe told Restaurant Business the chain was not happy with the performance of its restaurants inside Hy-Vee stores, saying they only made up a small portion of the concept’s total sales and that the brand intends to focus on traditional restaurants, not grocery stores.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt58a1f8f560a1ab0e/blt25fa4d3ee16fb39a/67f6bfb8239d8489ac6597ff/Hy-Vee_exterior.png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-04-10 15:11:38.398969

The new dining space, led by Chef Ritu Dalmia, integrates India’s diverse culinary traditions with the evolving dining preferences of urban consumers.","Delhi’s restaurant landscape has seen the addition of Hikki, a modern dining and bar concept focused on Nikkei cuisine—a blend of Japanese culinary precision and Peruvian flavors. Launched by Ninecamp Ventures, Hikki operates as a premium hospitality offering targeting fine-dining consumers and cocktail enthusiasts.

Founder and CEO Chaitanya Mathur of Ninecamp Ventures said, “The Indian consumer today is globally aware, well-travelled, and open to experimentation. At Ninecamp, we believe there’s a void in the premium dining space — one that blends focused, high-quality cuisine with an elevated bar experience. That’s how Hikki was born: a modern Japanese-Peruvian restaurant, crafted to bring an international standard of dining and cocktails to India. At Hikki, we’ve built a team that’s passionate, meticulous, and deeply committed to delivering exceptional hospitality.”

Positioned within the upscale segment, Hikki’s core culinary identity is rooted in Nikkei cuisine, a food tradition originating from Japanese immigrant communities in Peru. Chef Vaibhav Bhargava, who leads the culinary direction said, “At Hikki, I’ve aspired to create an oasis where dining transcends the plate and becomes a form of art—where dishes are a dialogue between Japanese precision and Peruvian vibrance. We honor tradition while embracing the unexpected, crafting flavors that feel both familiar and thrillingly new.”

The restaurant’s signature menu items include Black Cod Robata, Pickled Vegetables and Brie Sushi, Pork Belly Donburi, Seafood Ozisushi, and Nikkei Gyozas. The food program is supported by a cocktail-led bar concept that incorporates Japanese mixology standards with influences from Peruvian spirits and techniques. The beverage menu also features an extensive sake selection, offering variations from Junmai to Honjozo.

Designed by Renesa Architects, the interiors integrate elements representing both Japanese and Peruvian cultures. Architect Sanchit Arora noted, “Hikki is an immersive paradox—hidden yet alive, a dialogue between Japan and Peru, told through space, material, and memory.” The space is centered around an olive tree, symbolic of Peruvian heritage, and incorporates red tiles, fluted wood, and mirrored surfaces. The lighting has been tailored to transition from daytime dining to a nighttime bar ambiance, enhancing customer flow and engagement across service hours.

The operating model includes lunch service from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm and two dinner seatings at 8:00 pm and 10:30 pm, catering to a clientele seeking varied dining experiences across the day. Hikki aims to serve discerning consumers in Delhi seeking a multi-sensory, globally inspired food and beverage offering.

THE Park Navi Mumbai has introduced a refreshed experience at its nightlife venue, Dusk, presenting a redesigned concept aimed at enhancing the guest experience through a blend of design, cuisine, and entertainment.

The reimagined venue features a distinctive ceiling installation with flexible strip lights and reflective ripples, designed to replicate the visual rhythm of water. This architectural focal point contributes to the overall atmosphere of the space and supports the brand’s ongoing focus on evolving social experiences within hospitality.

On the menu, Dusk offers a combination of local and international dishes, including the Khao Galli Toastie, Chakundar and Dill Seekh, and Agri Mutton Masala served with Bhakri Pita.

Dusk is also integrated with Aqua, the property’s poolside venue, allowing the space to host entertainment events such as live bands and karaoke throughout the week. This programming is aimed at building a consistent nightlife offering that appeals to a wide demographic of guests.

Cajetan Dsouza, Food and Beverage Manager at Dusk stated, “Dusk is more than just a bar; it’s an experience where the city’s vibrant energy meets the tranquillity of a tropical escape. We’ve reimagined the space to be immersive, effortlessly luxurious, and full of character—whether you're here for an intimate gathering or a lively celebration. At its heart, Dusk offers a distinctive culinary journey—fusing local Indian and global inspirations—paired with a playful Concoctions menu of signature cocktails crafted to reflect the spirit of the venue.”

Starbucks India has opened its first Drive-Thru in Electronic City, Bengaluru, marking a significant expansion in one of the country’s fastest-growing residential and technology hubs. This milestone also brings the company’s presence in Bengaluru to 50 stores, reinforcing India’s position as a key market for the brand’s global growth.

MOAI, a 24,000-square-foot restobar, is set to open in Hyderabad on March 28, 2025. Inspired by the Moai statues of Easter Island, the venue integrates heritage with contemporary dining.

MOAI introduces a menu centered on straightforward flavors, emphasizing ingredient integrity. The bar program aligns with this approach, incorporating ferments, smoke, and local botanicals.

""MOAI is built on the idea that great dining is not just about food and drink—it’s about an experience that stays with you. We wanted to create a space that feels timeless yet fresh, where guests can gather, explore, and immerse themselves in something truly special,"" said Co-Founders and managing partners Ramaraju Kallepalli, Shashidhar Kasi, and Sai Surepally.

The menu is curated by Michelin-trained Chef Mohib Farooqui, who has worked in Michelin-starred restaurants in Australia and Denmark. His dishes incorporate global techniques with locally inspired flavors. Signature items include Char-grilled Baby Chicken, Dum Ka Kheema 2.0, and Muhamarra and Feta. The dessert menu features Gajar Halwa 2.0, Maamoul Cheesecake, and Deep Scarlet, made with Idukki dark chocolate and beetroot.

""We’ve stripped away the excess to focus on what really matters—flavour, texture, and a deep respect for ingredients. Every dish at MOAI is crafted to evoke familiarity while sparking curiosity, making the experience both personal and unexpected,"" said Farooqui.

Chef Parampreet Luthra has also contributed to the menu, balancing regional influences with modern interpretations.

MOAI’s cocktail menu, designed by mixologists Claudio Caprio (Barcelona) and Saurav Samanta (India), features locally inspired ingredients combined with global techniques. The offerings include the Moai Old Fashioned, infused with smoked jaggery and barrel-aged bitters, and the Tropical Stone Sour, which incorporates house-fermented pineapple and local spices.

""Forget the ordinary. We take classic cocktails and infuse them with the wild, untamed essence of our home. This menu is a love letter to our region—written in bold flavours, unexpected twists, and a touch of the extraordinary,"" said Head Mixologist Claudio Caprio.

MOAI is designed as a 400-seater venue that integrates indoor and outdoor spaces. The restobar features quarry-cut stone walls, natural granite flooring, greenery, and water bodies. The space is anchored by 15-foot Moai sculptures and a 360-degree stone bar.

Piccadily Agro Industries Limited has introduced the Indri Experience Centre, a facility designed to offer visitors an in-depth look at the whisky-making process. Located in Indri, Haryana, the centre provides guided distillery tours, exclusive tastings, and insights into the production of Indri single malt whisky.

The facility features an interactive layout that allows visitors to explore whisky-making techniques, from copper pot still distillation to cask selection and maturation. In addition to whisky-focused experiences, the centre includes a Putting and Chipping Golf Greens area, offering a recreational element for guests.

Shalini Sharma, Head of Marketing at Piccadily Agro Industries Limited said, “Our vision for the Indri Experience Centre was to create an experience that is both immersive and enlightening. Every element of this space has been designed to reflect the passion, precision, and heritage that go into crafting each bottle of Indri single malt. This centre is not just about showcasing our single malt whiskies—it’s about inviting consumers to be part of our story.”

The architecture of the centre draws inspiration from Northern India’s havelis, integrating sustainable design elements. “The Indri Experience Centre blends India’s rich cultural heritage with sustainable design, drawing inspiration from the havelis of Northern India. Centered around a grand courtyard, its compact form features a 20-foot-high Porte-cochère leading to a bar, tasting room, merchandise shop, museum room, offices, and a laboratory,” said Anshuman Khanna, Chief Architect. The structure incorporates reclaimed 19th-century Nanakshahi bricks, double-glazed windows, and solar-reflective tiles to enhance energy efficiency.

Priyanka Singh, Founder and Studio Head at Chalk Studio added, “Exposed brick, blackened steel, and raw concrete reflect the artisanal process of whisky-making, while warm wood, leather seating, and brass accents pay homage to its rich heritage. The centrepiece is a moody whisky lounge, accompanied by an interactive exhibit space and a cigar-inspired relaxation area, all designed to provide an immersive and luxurious journey into the world of Indri single malt whiskies.”

Indri emphasizes transparency in its whisky production, ensuring high-quality ingredients and adherence to traditional distillation techniques. Visitors can observe the whisky-making process firsthand, gaining insight into the craftsmanship behind each bottle.

The Indri Experience Centre aligns with Piccadily Agro Industries' efforts to position India’s whisky industry on a global platform. By combining education, interactive experiences, and traditional production methods, the facility aims to engage both whisky enthusiasts and new consumers, reinforcing Indri’s presence in the single malt segment.

Red Rhino, a key player in India's craft beer industry, has launched a new commercial brewery in Malur, expanding its presence in the kegging segment. This move strengthens Red Rhino’s craft beer distribution, making its brews available across Bangalore’s top outlets.

The facility will initially distribute Red Rhino’s Signature Lager and Hefeweizen, along with seasonal varieties. Ashwin Nawani, Head of Business Strategy said, “Our new facility is built to set industry benchmarks. With a cutting-edge cold chain and logistics infrastructure, we’re ensuring that every pint maintains its optimal temperature and quality from brewing to final delivery. This investment is all about precision, efficiency, and elevating the craft beer experience across Bangalore and beyond.”

With this expansion, Red Rhino aims to increase availability beyond its flagship locations, making high-quality craft beer accessible to a wider consumer base. Starting April, its products will be available on tap at multiple venues in Bangalore.

Master Brewer Dan Satterthwaite added, “Our infrastructure rivals international brewing facilities. We’ve integrated advanced fermentation technologies with sophisticated logistics to ensure each beer batch preserves its unique flavor profile and exceptional quality throughout distribution.”

The Malur facility features dedicated kegging lines, larger fermentation tanks, and automated quality control systems, allowing Red Rhino to scale production while maintaining consistency.

India’s craft beer market has been expanding rapidly, with a 22 percent annual growth since 2022. Premium craft beer has experienced an even higher growth rate of 27 percent CAGR, reflecting evolving consumer demand for sophisticated brewing techniques. The craft beer segment in India is projected to maintain this growth rate over the next eight years.

Central to this expansion is BEVERA, Red Rhino’s new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which automates the entire brewing process—from order management to final delivery. This technology enhances operational efficiency and optimizes logistics.

Founder Kishore Pallamreddy, a global tech entrepreneur stated, “This facility is more than just business expansion. We’re committed to elevating India’s craft beer culture through innovative technology, consistent quality, and strategic market engagement.”

BANG, the rooftop lounge at The Ritz-Carlton, Bangalore, has introduced a refreshed ambiance, an updated cocktail menu, and weekend events, marking a new phase for the venue. Known for its city views and social atmosphere, BANG has been a key part of Bangalore’s nightlife. The latest changes aim to balance heritage with contemporary experiences while maintaining its role as a popular rooftop destination.

The lounge has updated its cocktail program with a mix of classic and modern influences. Nitin Goyal, Bar Manager at The Ritz-Carlton, Bangalore, highlighted the approach: “Our latest menu is a bold reimagination of timeless classics—familiar yet intriguing, refined yet daring. Every cocktail is an homage to both BANG and Bangalore’s shared journey—a city and a bar steeped in heritage, now embracing a spirited new chapter brimming with innovation, energy, and exquisite craftsmanship.”

The menu includes The Revolver, a bourbon-based cocktail with coffee and orange bitters, The Jasmine, a variation of the Negroni with citrus notes, and The Breakfast Martini, which combines orange marmalade and lemon juice. The bar also features a selection of premium spirits, Indian and international wines, and non-alcoholic beverages.

The revamped venue also introduces three weekend events, designed to appeal to different audiences. Retro Rendezvous Fridays focus on classic hits, while Commercial Saturdays bring a mix of global chart-toppers with performances by DJs. The Sunset Sha-BANG, a Sunday Sundowner, offers a relaxed setting with music and views of the city skyline.

Reuben Kataria, General Manager of The Ritz-Carlton, Bangalore said, “From the very moment BANG opened its doors, it resonated deeply with the people of Bangalore. It became more than just a venue; it became a destination for celebration, a place where stories were written in the language of music, laughter, and unforgettable nights. Named in honor of our beloved city, BANG has always been a reflection of Bangalore’s ever-evolving rhythm. With this reinvention, we fortify its legacy—introducing a curated cocktail experience, immersive weekend engagements, and an air of refined indulgence. We eagerly anticipate welcoming both familiar faces and new guests to rekindle old traditions and craft new memories.”

The changes at BANG focus on maintaining its connection with Bangalore’s hospitality scene while offering new experiences for guests.

Tim Hortons India, the iconic coffee brand has opened its sixth location in Mumbai at the First International Financial Centre (FIFC) in the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC). This most recent addition brings the brand's well-loved brews to the center of the city's busy financial and lifestyle district, marking an important milestone in its growth.

Visitors can now savor the original Tim Hortons menu, including the famous Iced Capp, the rich and creamy French Vanilla, and the irresistible Timbits. A wide variety of savory sandwiches, wraps, and other delectable treats are also available on the menu, along with a selection of freshly baked donuts.

As BKC develops into a premier business zone, Tim Hortons wants to offer both locals and tourists a comfortable place to unwind. The store’s interiors feature stunning Copper Enameling wall art, an ancient technique that fuses glass onto copper for vibrant color. This unique craft blends tradition with modern aesthetics.

“We are thrilled to open our sixth store in Mumbai. The love and support we have received from our customers have been incredible, and we are excited to continue expanding into more communities. Mumbaikars appreciate a great cup of coffee and a delicious treat, and this new store reaffirms our commitment to serving the city and enhancing access to the Tim Hortons experience,” said Tarun Jain, CEO of Tim Hortons India.

Mumbai’s hospitality landscape sees a new addition as Nostalgia, a well-known café in Bandra, opens its new takeaway outlet at Pali Naka. Unlike its existing location, which is known for its homely atmosphere in a heritage bungalow, the new space emphasizes Mumbai’s hyperlocal food culture, integrating railway canteen traditions and community collaborations with local fruit vendors.

The new outlet will serve fresh beverages, ice creams, and savory snacks from Kerala and Mangalore. A key highlight is the Iced Filter Coffee and Filter Coffee Affogato, offering a chilled take on the classic South Indian beverage. The outlet introduces a ‘Bring Your Own Fruit’ concept, where customers can purchase fresh fruits from vendors outside and have them added to their soft-serve ice creams. The initiative aims to support local fruit sellers while offering seasonal customizations, such as strawberries or mangoes on frozen desserts.

This expansion is more than just a new location; it continues the legacy of founder Sinan Khader’s grandfather, who started his journey in the 1950s at a tea stall in Dadar Central railway station. Over time, he managed eight railway canteen stalls, leaving behind a business tradition that now reflects in Nostalgia’s offerings, such as bun maska and regional snacks from Kerala and Mangalore.

By blending family heritage with community-driven initiatives, Nostalgia’s new outlet honors its roots while creating a space that connects with Mumbai’s local flavors. Customers looking for a quick ice cream stop can also engage with the neighborhood’s street vendors, adding a local touch to their experience.

Berlin Brew, a newly launched taproom in Times Square, Andheri, brings a mid-century-inspired setting to Mumbai’s hospitality scene. Designed to cater to corporate professionals and social gatherings, the space offers freshly brewed craft beers alongside a curated food menu.

Located in an industrial complex, Berlin Brew provides a setting for professionals looking to unwind after work or meet colleagues for an informal gathering. The taproom’s signature offering is the Gluten-Free Hoppy Bliss, a pale ale made from jowar to reduce bloating. Other craft beer selections include Honey Drip Lager, Tropical Twist IPA (Melon and Tangerine Zest), Bavarian Bloom Hefeweizen (German Wheat Beer), Alphonso Mead, Cocoa Orange, Berlin Dunkelweizen (Dark German Wheat Beer), and Basmati Blonde (Rice Lager).

The food menu includes a mix of flavors designed to complement the brews. Some of the options include Mini Blue Cheese Kulcha, Enoki Mushroom Pockets, English Cheddar Chicken Kebab, and Pan Glazed Barbeque Chorizo. Desserts like Berliner Mini Donuts and German Apple Cake round off the offerings.

The taproom's design integrates handcrafted elements, vintage sketches, and portraits that reflect a blend of post-WWII Berlin and Bombay. Grey mosaic tiles, wooden panels, distressed mirrors, and stained-glass accents contribute to an industrial aesthetic. The main bar section, crafted by artisans, serves as a focal point.

With couches, dining booths, and a central community table, Berlin Brew provides a versatile setting for both small and large gatherings, catering to Mumbai’s growing hospitality and nightlife sector.",https://restaurantindia.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2025-04/rtnhte.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 12:29:24.887225

The effort, which brought up to 1.5 million of Apple’s flagship smartphones into the country, came after the company ceased productions in India to overcome President Donald Trump’s tariffs, Reuters reported Thursday (April 10), citing sources familiar with Apple’s plans.
According to the report, analysts warn that iPhone prices could rocket up in the U.S. due to Apple’s dependence on Chinese imports.

The effort, which brought up to 1.5 million of Apple’s flagship smartphones into the country, came after the company ceased productions in India to overcome President Donald Trump’s tariffs, Reuters reported Thursday (April 10), citing sources familiar with Apple’s plans.

According to the report, analysts warn that iPhone prices could rocket up in the U.S. due to Apple’s dependence on Chinese imports. China is the company’s chief manufacturing hub, and is facing a 125% tariff rate.

India, meanwhile, has a much lower rate — 26% — which is now on hold after Trump instituted a 90-day tariff pause on all countries aside from China.

Apple “wanted to beat the tariff,” one of the sources told Reuters.

That source said the company had campaigned to get Indian airport authorities to cut the time needed to make it through customs at the Chennai airport in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, from 30 hours down to just six hours.

Apple sells upwards of 220 million iPhones worldwide each year, the report said, citing data from Counterpoint Research showing that 20% of those phone imports to the U.S. are from India, with the remainder coming from China.

The Reuters report suggests that Apple’s plans were in place long before the tariffs, or even before Trump’s election victory, with a senior Indian official saying that the company had spent about eight months arranging its fast-tracked customs clearance.

As noted here earlier in the week — in a previous report on Apple’s plans to use India to offset the tariff costs — the tech giant was among the companies that saw the biggest stock market losses after the new levies were announced.

“The decline in shares of Apple erased $300 billion from the company’s market cap, largely because of the iPhone maker’s overseas production hubs,” PYMNTS wrote.

When Trump announced the pause Thursday, the markets recovered somewhat, with the Dow surging by nearly 2,000 points, bringing temporary relief to many industries and markets, PYMNTS wrote in a separate report Thursday.

“However, companies and economists remain cautious about its long-term implications,” that report added. “The freeze does not eliminate tariffs entirely, leaving uncertainty about future trade policies but also pulling the covers on what companies may do if the temporary freeze is lifted for an appreciable amount of time.",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Apple-iPhones-imports-India-China-tariffs.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 12:26:40.130619

The U.S. began collecting tariffs of 25% on foreign auto imports from April 3, which Trump says will boost U.S. manufacturing and jobs.

But the measure, which remains in place even after Trump paused reciprocal tariffs on trade partners on Wednesday, is expected to raise car prices by thousands of dollars, reducing demand and hurting job growth.

Suppliers, already under pressure from recent years' switch to electric vehicles with fewer parts, say they are in no position to absorb any of the cost.

Pierre Boulet, chairman of France's Novares, which supplies plastic parts to one in three vehicles produced worldwide said ""for us, it's simple,"" either payment in advance ""or no customs clearance.""

The privately owned company has five factories in Mexico, with some of its products now subject to the new U.S. duties.

Valeo, a specialist in driver assistance and lighting systems, is also asking customers to pay the full tariff cost, including both automakers assembling cars in the U.S. and American spare parts distributors.

""We are working to obtain full compensation for the new customs duties, passing on 100% of the corresponding costs to our customers, and we have already obtained the agreement of more than 50% of them,"" said Valeo chief executive Christophe Perillat.

""For spare parts, we are taking the same approach,"" he added.

Valeo has 13 factories in Mexico.

Only a portion of imports from Mexico and Canada are currently affected by the duties, as components that comply with the 2020 USMCA free trade agreement are exempt.

But more products could face duties from May 3.

Most goods shipped by tyre maker Michelin from both countries to the U.S. are currently also exempt from the new tariffs, the company told analysts late on Wednesday, according to a transcript of a conference call.

But it added that no definitive conclusions can be made yet on a topic that is ""evolving by the day"". The group produces around 70% of the tyres it sells in the U.S. on American soil, with the remainder imported from Canada and Mexico.

The 90-day suspension of taxes on imports from dozens of countries came as Trump escalated his trade conflict with China. The unexpected move triggered a strong stock market rally on Wall Street but created confusion among businesses, investors, and international trading partners about the administration’s true intentions.

To advertise here,

Trump’s decision followed four days of steep declines in global markets, caused by the sweeping tariffs he had unveiled the previous week. The financial turmoil sparked fears that the US and global economies could slide into recession.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described the policy shift as part of a larger negotiation strategy. However, critics outside the administration viewed it as a retreat driven by market pressure and concerns over the economic damage caused by Trump’s abrupt imposition of import taxes.

“Other countries will welcome the 90-day stay of execution — if it lasts — but the whiplash from constant zig-zags creates more of the uncertainty that businesses and governments hate,” said Daniel Russel, vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

“The Administration’s blunt-force tactics have rattled allies, who see the sudden reversal as damage control following the market meltdown, rather than a pivot to respectful, balanced negotiations.”

‘Liberation Day’ tariffs and the swift reversal

On Wednesday, April 2 — a date Trump referred to as “Liberation Day” — the president declared new tariffs on nearly every country, disrupting the international trade system. A 10 percent baseline tariff on imports from most countries took effect on Saturday.

At midnight on Wednesday, Trump introduced additional “reciprocal” tariffs against countries he accused of unfair trade practices. But later that day, he suspended those tariffs for 90 days, explaining the delay was to give other nations time to negotiate with him and his trade advisers.

One country was excluded from the temporary relief — China. Trump increased tariffs on Chinese goods to a sharp 125 percent in retaliation for Beijing’s own tariffs against the US The 10 percent baseline tariffs on other countries remain in effect.

Economic impact and job losses

The president’s shifting trade tactics — including earlier duties on cars, steel, aluminium, and goods from Mexico and Canada — have already affected several industries. Companies delayed or cancelled investment plans, while some temporarily laid off workers amid uncertainty about the administration’s trade policy.

Carmaker Stellantis suspended operations at two plants in Canada and Mexico after Trump introduced a 25 percent tariff on imported cars, leading to the temporary loss of 900 jobs at factories in Michigan and Indiana.

Cleveland-Cliffs laid off 1,200 workers at a Michigan factory and a Minnesota iron ore mine due to reduced demand from the auto industry. The company stated it would resume production once auto manufacturing returned to the US

Federal reserve and corporate caution

Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s 18–19 March meeting, released Wednesday, revealed that many officials reported that businesses were delaying hiring because of policy uncertainty.

Delta Air Lines also noted a drop in demand for domestic and business travel, citing trade-related uncertainty. In a call with investors, the airline said it would reduce capacity and declined to give a full-year financial outlook.

“Right now, it’s hard to know how this is going to play out, given that this is somewhat self-imposed,” said Delta CEO Ed Bastian.

“I’m hopeful that sanity will prevail and we’ll move through this period of time on the global trade front relatively quickly.”

Confusion among businesses

Despite the temporary suspension, companies continued to seek clarity on the specifics of Trump’s trade plans. Jeff Jaisli, CEO of New Jersey-based importer/exporter Jagro, said the president’s post on Truth Social had made things “even worse” and more confusing.

“We’re scrambling to find correct information and procedures for entries we’re processing NOW in real time,” he said via email. Jaisli added that there was no guidance available on official government websites.

Earlier, Jaisli had described the tariff situation as “a grenade that was thrown into the room that’s going to cause chaos.”

Trade war with China escalates

Trump’s trade war with China has intensified. Even before the increase to 125 percent, China had already imposed retaliatory tariffs of 84 percent on US goods.

The World Trade Organization’s director-general, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, warned that this growing trade conflict could cut US-China merchandise trade by 80 percent and seriously harm the global economy.

“Of particular concern is the potential fragmentation of global trade along geopolitical lines,” she said in a statement on Wednesday. “A division of the global economy into two blocs could lead to a long-term reduction in global real GDP by nearly 7 percent.”

Okonjo-Iweala stressed that the ripple effects would particularly impact developing economies and urged countries to maintain an open trade system and work together to resolve differences.

Businesses hesitate amid rising tariff costs

American companies are now trying to adjust to high tariffs on goods from China. Jessica Bettencourt, CEO of Klem’s, a family-run store in Massachusetts, said the increased costs have made her stop ordering fourth-quarter holiday products and reassess autumn clothing and footwear orders.

“The worst thing is uncertainty and we have massive uncertainty,” said Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe.

“No one can make any moves. Everybody is trying to save as much cash and defer any unnecessary expense. People are getting laid off. Orders are getting cancelled. Expansion plans are being put on hold.”",https://english.mathrubhumi.com/image/contentid/policy:1.10336110:1739355673/trump.jpg?$p=226e5bc&f=16x9&w=1080&q=0.8,N,,2025-04-10 15:12:30.325897

A Smarter Long-Term Strategy Rather than waging a costly and uncertain legal war, Kroger and Albertsons have an opportunity to lead by example.","Collaboration Over Conflict: Why Kroger and Albertsons Should Rethink Their Strategy

As the legal showdown over the blocked merger between Kroger and Albertsons continues, the real winners may not be either of the two supermarket giants—but rather, their competitors. The battle, projected to cost both companies millions in legal fees, time, and public relations efforts, has become more of a distraction than a solution. Instead of pushing forward in a prolonged legal conflict, Kroger and Albertsons should consider an alternative path—one that does not require merging, yet still offers powerful strategic advantages.

A Shared Future Without a Merger

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has made its position clear: the merger is not going to happen. But that doesn’t mean Kroger and Albertsons can’t work together. In fact, if structured correctly, a strategic alliance could provide both companies with the competitive edge they were seeking through the merger—without raising the same regulatory concerns.

From an industry expert’s perspective, collaboration rather than confrontation is the smarter path forward. In today’s retail environment, success depends on efficiency, scale, and adaptability. While the FTC may block corporate consolidation, it cannot restrict partnerships that are rooted in shared sourcing, logistics, and marketing initiatives.

Unifying Buying Power for Cost Efficiency

Both Kroger and Albertsons face pressure from low-cost competitors like Walmart, Aldi, and Costco. By combining their buying power, the two chains could negotiate better deals with suppliers, access lower wholesale prices, and ultimately offer more competitive pricing to shoppers.

A joint sourcing department—acting as a neutral entity serving both retailers—could be a game-changer. Not only would this approach cut procurement costs, it would allow both chains to introduce consistent, high-quality private-label products at scale. With inflation still a major concern for American households, this kind of pricing strategy could boost customer loyalty and drive foot traffic.

Shared Marketing for Greater Reach

A unified marketing budget could also create a strong nationwide presence without either brand sacrificing its identity. By pooling resources, Kroger and Albertsons could deliver more powerful, data-driven campaigns across traditional and digital platforms. The focus could shift to promoting affordability, sustainability, and innovation—values that resonate strongly with today’s shoppers.

Joint seasonal promotions, nationwide loyalty programs, and collaborative community engagement efforts could strengthen both brands, build public goodwill, and reinforce their position in an increasingly fragmented grocery landscape.

Strategic Collaboration Doesn’t Violate Antitrust Law

It’s important to note that strategic partnerships—unlike mergers—do not necessarily raise the same antitrust red flags. The FTC’s primary concern with the Kroger-Albertsons merger was the potential reduction in competition. However, a shared sourcing and marketing strategy doesn’t eliminate competition; rather, it creates operational synergies while preserving consumer choice.

This model is already being explored in other industries, where competitors collaborate on non-competitive aspects like logistics and sustainability goals. By adopting a similar approach, Kroger and Albertsons can demonstrate innovation without inviting regulatory backlash.

A Smarter Long-Term Strategy

Rather than waging a costly and uncertain legal war, Kroger and Albertsons have an opportunity to lead by example. They can pivot toward a more modern retail strategy—one that leverages scale without consolidation, and partnership without merger.

The potential benefits are significant:

Lower prices for consumers through improved supply chain efficiencies

Higher margins for both companies due to reduced procurement and marketing costs

Faster innovation through collaborative product development and digital transformation

Enhanced public image as companies that prioritise customer value over corporate power struggles

The merger may be off the table, but the future is still wide open for Kroger and Albertsons. By choosing cooperation over conflict, they could redefine what it means to be industry leaders in modern retail. In doing so, they may not only outpace their competitors—but also regain the trust and loyalty of the American shopper.

The bankruptcy filing follows Diageo’s recent announcement that it would stop accepting new brands into its Distill Ventures accelerator programme, which had backed Westward since 2018.

Court documents revealed that Westward has been hit by a convergence of industry headwinds, including a post-pandemic shift in consumer behaviour that has dampened demand for premium spirits over the past two years. At the same time, the company significantly expanded its production capacity and warehouse space, leaving it with excess inventory that has not delivered the anticipated revenue.

The average discount shippers received on ground parcel delivery rates increased by 1.9% from Q4 2024 to Q1 2025.
Dive Insight: Q1 ground delivery prices exceeded TD Cowen and AFS Logistics' previous expectations, which had factored in a low-demand and highly competitive parcel shipping environment.
Additional fees from UPS and FedEx are driving increased interest for alternative delivery options, particularly among larger shippers, Bates said.
Shippers will be pushing to negotiate lower rates after seeing the impact rate increases had in Q1, Bates said.","Dive Brief:

Ground delivery costs are forecasted to jump 2.6% year over year in Q2 as parcel shippers continue to grapple with rate increases and added fees from UPS and FedEx, according to the TD Cowen/AFS Freight Index.

Per-package ground delivery rates will reach 29.5% above the index's January 2018 baseline for the quarter, TD Cowen and AFS Logistics project. That marks a decline from the record-high 31.3% average reached in Q1 when more rate hikes and higher fuel surcharges took effect.

Despite pricing pressures, customers have had opportunities to lower their shipping costs, according to the index. The average discount shippers received on ground parcel delivery rates increased by 1.9% from Q4 2024 to Q1 2025.

Dive Insight:

Q1 ground delivery prices exceeded TD Cowen and AFS Logistics' previous expectations, which had factored in a low-demand and highly competitive parcel shipping environment. A bevy of surcharge increases from major carriers outside annual rate increase cycles are driving much of that pricing pressure, Mingshu Bates, AFS’ chief analytics officer and president of parcel, said in an interview.

""The changes are coming more often,"" Bates said. ""You don't have much lead time to prepare for it, and then the changes and not so much that, 'Hey, your rate is going to go up 3%.' No, it's really way more subtle than before.""

One example is frequent adjustments UPS and FedEx have made to their fuel surcharge calculations over the past year. From Q1 2024 to Q1 2025, the ground fuel surcharge at UPS jumped 15% and FedEx's increased 12%, according to a news release announcing the Q1 index. The price of diesel fuel, which influences the surcharge, fell 8.4% over the same period, the release said.

Additional fees from UPS and FedEx are driving increased interest for alternative delivery options, particularly among larger shippers, Bates said. The U.S. Postal Service and smaller carriers could benefit from this trend, but shippers may also switch to lower-cost options within FedEx and UPS' product portfolios, she noted.

With no shortage of delivery options for shippers to choose from, heightened discounting activity could continue in Q2 as FedEx and UPS look to retain customers and attract more volume into their networks. Shippers will be pushing to negotiate lower rates after seeing the impact rate increases had in Q1, Bates said. However, discounts can only increase for so long until carriers determine they are not worth it for their bottom lines, she added.

""We are still seeing aggressive discounting, but I think we're getting closer to a tightening of the pricing discipline,"" Bates said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Px8Yng2AaURIQth0GjKnitqinm0pSEtYwe1GV_JkfmU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMTg5MjE5MzY3LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-04-10 12:29:34.444819

In short, the global fashion supply chain—from factories in Asia to shop shelves in America—is bracing for serious disruption.","The US fashion industry is once again wrestling with President Donald Trump’s tariff strategy. After moving sourcing away from China to nations such as Vietnam and Cambodia during Trump’s first term, brands are now facing yet another surge in costs as the former president rolls out fresh tariffs on those same countries—sending shockwaves through the global fashion supply chain.

While Trump has imposed a baseline 10% tariff on all imported goods, the fashion sector is contending with far more than that. For around two dozen nations where the US records a trade deficit, the tariffs are significantly higher. Vietnam—an essential hub in the global production of athletic footwear—is among those hardest hit. Vietnamese goods bound for the US are now subject to a new 46% tariff, adding to the existing 20% duties already levied on textile-topped trainers.

This development spells major trouble for companies like Nike, which manufactures half of its footwear in Vietnam, and On, the Swiss sportswear firm that produces an astonishing 90% of its shoes there.

The US fashion industry is once again wrestling with President Donald Trump’s tariff strategy. After shifting sourcing from China to countries like Vietnam and Cambodia during Trump’s first term, brands are now facing another surge in costs as the former president rolls out fresh tariffs on those very nations—sending shockwaves through the global fashion supply chain.

While Trump has imposed a baseline 10% tariff on all imported goods, the fashion sector is grappling with far steeper rates for around two dozen countries where the US runs a trade deficit. Vietnam—an essential hub in the global production of athletic footwear—is among the hardest hit. Vietnamese exports to the US are now subject to a new 46% tariff, on top of the existing 20% duties on textile-topped trainers.

Vietnam is the world’s second-largest apparel exporter to the US after China, which now faces a 54% tariff, including previously imposed duties. Cambodia is dealing with a 49% rate, Bangladesh 37%, and the European Union 20%.

The impact is already being felt. In after-hours trading, shares in Lululemon dropped by more than 10%, with Nike and Ralph Lauren falling 7%, and Tapestry, Capri and PVH Corp each slipping around 5%.

Fashion companies have little room to manoeuvre. Shifting production out of Vietnam is no quick fix.

The challenges of production relocation

Trump aims to bring manufacturing back to US soil, but the fashion industry insists it’s not a realistic option.

American factories simply do not have the specialised equipment or skilled workforce required to mass-produce running shoes. Nike, which began manufacturing in Vietnam in 1995, now relies on 130 supplier factories there. Adidas produces 39% of its footwear in the country as well.

This week’s tariff hike has hit brands hard. Nike shares have fallen to their lowest point in nearly eight years, weighed down by rising costs and competitive pressure from brands like On and Hoka.

Though Nike has not responded directly to the tariffs, its most recent quarterly report cited ""several external factors that create uncertainty and volatility in the operating environment including but not limited to geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, tax regulation and fluctuating foreign exchange rates.""

The strain extends well beyond household names. The US Fashion Industry Association put it bluntly: “We are deeply disappointed by the Trump Administration’s decision to impose new tariffs on all imports. This action will particularly affect American fashion brands and retailers.”

From suppliers in Vietnam to textile makers and farmers across the globe, the entire chain is set to feel the pressure. Walmart, among others, has said it plans to negotiate with suppliers to reduce costs, but many factories already run on razor-thin margins. The squeeze is likely to deepen.

Retailers now face a tough choice: absorb the higher costs or pass them on to shoppers already grappling with inflation. With consumer confidence in the US at its lowest since the pandemic, fashion brands are proceeding with caution.

If the added costs are passed on, expect more cautious consumer behaviour and a drop in impulse purchases—putting further pressure on profits.

In short, the global fashion supply chain—from factories in Asia to shop shelves in America—is bracing for serious disruption.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/7691554f78e232c1ff6c2e6cb7a819f7:b72b6e58ed4e8d23b974f0ab4b51890f/danilo-capece-novnxxmdni0-unsplash.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 11:11:46.777956

Their approach hinges on advanced cargo drones crafted using HP’s Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) 3D printing technology, enabling faster and more effective solutions for time-sensitive shipments.

Overcoming Design Obstacles

Creating drones that balance minimal weight with maximum durability posed a major challenge for Blueflite. Early efforts relied on conventional techniques like carbon fiber construction and FDM printing. While carbon fiber offered strength, its production was slow and cumbersome, delaying design adjustments. Initial 3D printing methods also disappointed—FDM left noticeable layer lines unfit for sleek aircraft, SLA produced fragile components, and SLS resulted in parts that weighed too much.

A Game-Changing Technology

The breakthrough came with HP Multi Jet Fusion. This 3D printing method delivered parts with enhanced material strength, finer surface detail, and consistent quality. It marked a turning point for Blueflite’s drone production.

Each drone now features 48 components made via MJF, including outer shells, mounting brackets for electronics, landing supports, and battery enclosures. Blueflite opts for HP’s Nylon 12, prized for its lightweight nature and robust strength-to-weight balance—ideal for efficient UAVs. With HP’s technical guidance, they refined their designs by incorporating elements like reinforcing ribs and intricate lattice patterns.

Clear Advantages in Performance

Switching to HP MJF technology yielded impressive outcomes:

Lighter Structures: The drone fuselage shed 25% of its mass, enhancing flight efficiency and range.

Speedier Development: Design timelines shrank from weeks to mere hours, enabling Blueflite to test 2-10 iterations per component swiftly and perfect their builds.

Polished Finish: The precision of MJF printing produced parts with a smooth, professional look, elevating the drones’ visual appeal.

Flexible Customization: Rapid prototyping capabilities allowed Blueflite to adapt quickly to varying client demands.

Paving the Way Forward

The shift to MJF has resulted in drones that are not only lighter and tougher but also more dependable, raising the bar for the industry. Moving beyond traditional composite methods has cut labor demands and provided the agility to tweak designs effortlessly for customers. The superior quality and refined appearance of the drones have caught the attention of clients.

Blueflite’s adoption of this technology highlights the impact of modern manufacturing on unmanned systems. Their work goes beyond assembling drones—it’s about reshaping how goods reach their destinations. The company aims to push further, using 3D printing for bigger, more intricate drone parts to refine their craft even more. With HP MJF as a cornerstone, Blueflite is poised to dominate the U.S. cargo drone market and drive ongoing advancements in the field.",https://uasweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/HP-Drone-sm.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 12:27:53.895915

“For example, if limes in Mexico are being tariffed and the price goes up because of the tariffs, supply is probably going to go up.
Suddenly they will have too much supply in Mexico, which will drop the price.” His hope is that the anxiety over Trump’s tariffs, launched last Wednesday, is over soon.","A US Senate finance committee has been told that not all of the proposed US Trade Representative multimillion-dollar fees for Chinese-built ships to dock at US ports will be implemented, and they may not be cumulative.

Implementation of the USTR port fee plan could come as late as November as a result of the flood of negative feedback that needs to be considered, news agency Reuters has been told.

US president Donald Trump’s administration is also slowing its consideration of a raft of country-by-country tariffs for incoming goods.

But industry insiders in Bermuda have told The Royal Gazette, that should proposals proceed, it could cause job losses, higher prices and business collapse in Bermuda.

The Oleander, which brings most of Bermuda’s goods and food from Port Elizabeth, New Jersey, was made in China in 2018, and could get caught in the USTR net.

“Everybody is on edge,” conceded Randy Rochester, chief executive officer of Polaris, the holding company of port operator Stevedoring Services.

During an interview this week, he said: “I had my team in the office about an hour ago looking at contingency plans.”

He said it would not be easy to find a replacement for the Oleander.

“It is a challenge, because it is the smaller ships that enter our ports,” he said. “Ships that go to other regions generally carry thousands of containers compared to the hundreds the Oleander brings here.”

After finding the right-size vessel, another hurdle would be finding one not made in China. Seventy to 80 per cent of ships in the world are manufactured there.

Mr Rochester said if Stevedoring Services went from servicing three ships a week to offloading just one, the company would have to reconsider the staff levels of port workers.

“We could not have 32 stevedores sitting around with nothing to do,” he said.

The firm would also have to freeze expenditures on new equipment, because of the unknowns.

Despite what could be an unprecedented situation, he called himself an “eternal optimist”.

“I am hoping that this, too, shall pass,” he said. “We have to weather this storm and get back to business as usual.”

Anthony Pearman, CEO of Atlantic Import and Export thought new levies could result in business failure for some people.

“It would not surprise me, if many businesses closed, because of this,” he said.

His enterprise is an online one, mainly focused on importing construction materials such as rebar and lumber. Much of what he brings in through the United States, originates in China.

“This could cripple our margins,” he said.

He also thought it would push the price of housing construction to untenable levels.

He was looking at bringing items in through other countries, but would then have to pay more for the extra shipping time and distance.

“That option is still untested and uncharted,” he said.

Lindo’s Group of Companies manager Zach Moniz said his grocery store chain was working on a contingency plan.

“Hopefully, we don’t need to use it,” he said. “Bermuda Container Line is working hard to make sure we will be covered, one way or another.”

He said Bermuda will not run out of food, but might have to adapt to something different.

“If Trump’s fee goes through, then certainly the cost of any extra inbound freight or over land freight incurred will have to be passed on,” he said. “However, it will not be as much as you think. The price is not terrible. Some prices might be impacted, but that is all up in the air right now.”

Any price changes would also not happen overnight.

“I have plenty of stock,” Mr Moniz said. “Local suppliers have stock and so do our suppliers in the US.”

He had faith in the laws of supply and demand.

“For example, if limes in Mexico are being tariffed and the price goes up because of the tariffs, supply is probably going to go up. Then demand will drop because the price went up. Suddenly they will have too much supply in Mexico, which will drop the price.”

His hope is that the anxiety over Trump’s tariffs, launched last Wednesday, is over soon.

“The tariffs are punitive in the wrong place,” Mr Moniz said. “I understand the desire to want to do something if he feels China has been manipulating the shipbuilding market all these years, but Trump is penalising everyone else but China. It is pointless.”",https://imengine.public.prod.rgb.navigacloud.com/?uuid=5d2ac100-8136-5292-8fc7-4ffa3c275f95&function=fit&type=preview,N,,2025-04-10 12:29:11.722168

As President Trump maintains tariffs of at least 125 percent on its goods, China has vowed not to back down.
Brazil, not the United States, is now China’s top soybean supplier.
Many high-profile American brands in China, like Nike, won’t have to dramatically raise prices, because many of their products are made outside the United States.
Indeed, the bigger problem for Chinese consumption is not rising prices, but the fact that people aren’t spending much to begin with.","As the United States and China barreled headfirst into full-fledged trade war this week, one of Beijing’s most fashionable shopping districts was still bustling. People browsed a high-end perfumery, lounged outside coffee shops and waited in a wraparound line for a trendy bakery.

That is just the type of scene the Chinese government wants to see as it steels for what could be a total breakdown of trade with the United States. As President Trump maintains tariffs of at least 125 percent on its goods, China has vowed not to back down. Besides hitting back with its own tariffs — 84 percent on all imports from the United States — the government has promised to make up for the blow to exports, on which China’s economy currently relies, by getting its people to spend more.

“In the face of high tariffs continuing to shrink the space for trade with the United States,” read a commentary on Sunday in People’s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, China will “make consumption the main driving force and ballast stone of economic growth, and deliver on the advantages of a super-large market.”

But that is easier said than done.

Domestic consumption in China was anemic even before the tariffs. The post-pandemic economic recovery has been lackluster, factories have shuttered and youth unemployment is high. Home prices, the bedrock of many middle-class Chinese families’ wealth, have plummeted.

The trade war could make people even warier of spending, just as it becomes a higher priority for the government. If exports slow dramatically, it could hurt everyone from garment makers in southern China to kitchen appliance makers on the eastern seaboard. That, in turn, could lead to lower wages or higher unemployment.

“The economy is all integrated, and producers are also consumers. It’s all the same people,” said Zhou Mi, a researcher at an institute affiliated with China’s Ministry of Commerce.

Before the trade tensions began escalating, there had been signs that Chinese people were starting to spend more.

Government incentives to trade in old cars or electronics for new ones lifted sales. A quarterly survey of Chinese consumers released by Deutsche Bank in March found that 54 percent of respondents felt better off financially than a year before, and that 52 percent — the most in a year — were willing to increase their spending.

During a long holiday weekend for China’s Tomb Sweeping Festival this month, travelers crowded into tourist sites and restaurants. They made 126 million domestic trips and spent about $8 billion, according to official data. Both figures represented increases of more than 6 percent from the previous year, and they were above prepandemic levels.

In some ways, Americans are more likely to be directly affected by price increases from the tariff war, because imported goods make up the texture of daily life in the United States. China’s U.S. imports are mostly intermediate products, like soybeans and farm equipment, not consumer goods. And China has worked to diversify its supply chains since Mr. Trump imposed tariffs in his first term. Brazil, not the United States, is now China’s top soybean supplier.

Many high-profile American brands in China, like Nike, won’t have to dramatically raise prices, because many of their products are made outside the United States. Some American electronics or cars, like Chevrolets, would see prices jump, but American automakers have been losing ground in China anyway.

But he said he wasn’t worried about China’s new levies, because nobody was buying such expensive wines anyway. They were once popular with businesspeople throwing banquets, but as customers became more cost-conscious they opted for cheaper wines from Australia or Chile.

Mr. Ye said his business had dropped by 70 to 80 percent since early 2023. He does not plan to order more American wine and is looking for ways to get out of the industry altogether, he said.

“We’re riding a donkey while looking for a horse,” Mr. Ye said, using a Chinese idiom about making do.

Indeed, the bigger problem for Chinese consumption is not rising prices, but the fact that people aren’t spending much to begin with.

“When people feel safe about their retirement life and feel safe about their financials after some major life events like illness, then I think they’re definitely going to be more willing to spend,” said Xu Tianchen, a China analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.

Historically, Chinese leaders have been wary of expanding the safety net, citing, among other things, concern about encouraging laziness.

But Mr. Xu said he was optimistic that Beijing was now serious about reforms, to support consumption. The government said last month that it would work to increase wages, pensions and medical benefits.

The luxury industry has lost its sparkle. A slowdown in the Chinese economy and a cost-of-living crisis in the West have led to a slump in sales of fancy frocks and posh bags. If, after a pause announced on April 9th, the high levels of tariffs threatened by Donald Trump are enacted they could throw the industry into a tailspin. Kering, a French luxury group that owns Gucci, has posted a string of profit warnings in recent quarters. At lvmh, another French luxury giant which owns Louis Vuitton, sales of fashion and leather goods have gone into decline.

Amazon.com Inc. equipped some delivery vans in Europe with defibrillators to see if drivers crisscrossing residential areas could speed up aid to heart attack victims.

The world’s largest online retailer tested a program, called Project Pulse, as a pilot in Amsterdam in November 2023, and expanded it to London and Bologna, Italy, according to documents seen by Bloomberg. A few dozen drivers in each city carried the devices, which are made by Koninklijke Philips NV. The Dutch company partnered with Amazon for the trial.

Amazon confirmed that more than 100 contract drivers took part in the experiment, with several receiving alerts from citizen responder apps and arriving on site, where rescue services were already treating the victims. The pilot program concluded after several months, and the company is “evaluating the feedback and exploring additional opportunities for future programs,” said Amazon spokesperson Anneliese Hellwig-Schuster.

Amazon.com Inc. ranks No. 1 on the Transport Topics Top 100 list of the largest logistics carriers in North America, No. 12 on the TT100 list of the largest private carriers and No. 1 on the Top 50 Global Freight list.

Amazon vans tend to be closer than a professional first responder.

Automated external defibrillators are designed for ease of use. Pads attached to a victim’s chest recommend whether to administer a shock to restart the person’s heart. Nine out of 10 people live if they receive a jolt within a minute of a cardiac event, and chances of survival without CPR decrease by 10% every minute, according to the American Heart Association.

While many offices and public spaces stock AEDs, more than 70% of cardiac arrests occur in residential areas, according to the American Red Cross.

Amazon drivers who volunteer for the program are trained on the devices as part of a basic first-aid course that includes CPR. They enroll in local citizen responder networks, according to the documents, which alert them to suspected cases of nearby cardiac arrest.

In Paris, local first responder app “Staying Alive” trained dozens of Amazon drivers last year, according to its chief doctor, Paul Dardel. He hopes Amazon will fully roll out the program in France soon, but was told that expanding in the U.K. was the priority for now.

“This type of initiative is always a plus. If someone has a cardiac arrest, the more people trained and defibrillators available, the better,” Dardel said. “And for Amazon, it valorizes their image.”

The program’s most immediate objective would be to give everyone — not just Amazon customers — a better chance of surviving cardiac arrest, documents seen by Bloomberg show. Amazon vans tend to be closer than a professional first responder in many residential areas. A study by Philips included in the Amazon documents estimated that a fleet of 50 AED-equipped delivery vans on the roads of a north Seattle neighborhood would be able to respond more than a minute faster, on average, than emergency medical services.

Some within Amazon also saw a public relations upside to the program, according to the documents. The company’s drivers have been blamed for congestion, pollution and causing accidents. The program’s backers also speculated that Project Pulse could improve driver retention.

Amazon’s legal team deemed the risk of drivers being sued low owing to European laws that typically shield bystanders who come to someone’s aid.

One internal document estimated it would cost less than $17 million in the first year of the program to equip 15% of drivers at Amazon’s 1,100-plus last-mile delivery depots around the world. That rollout, initially targeted for 2024, hasn’t moved past the pilots tested in Europe. The company often sets overly ambitious goals in internal documents, some of which fall by the wayside owing to funding or employee constraints.

There’s precedent for the Amazon program. Philips partnered with Volvo in the Netherlands and aimed to deploy at least 25 AEDs, which were used 11 times in 6 months, including at least one life-saving intervention, according to Philips data cited by Amazon. The British Heart Foundation also tried equipping telecommunications field technicians with AEDs in 2021, likely saving one life.

In France, Dardel said he previously tried to partner with a taxi company, but that proved too complicated because cabs carry customers. Putting AED’s in delivery vehicles would be much simpler, he said, although the hardest part could be getting enough drivers to volunteer. Another potential hurdle: Amazon contract drivers have tight delivery schedules and demanding working conditions, fueling significant turnover.

Philips in January sold its emergency care unit, including AED manufacturing, to Bridgefield Capital, subject to regulatory approval, although a licensing agreement will allow the AEDs to retain the Philips brand globally for as long as 15 years. Philips has one plant in Bothell, Wash., not far from Amazon’s Seattle headquarters.

For years, China has served as the backbone of global retail manufacturing, offering an unmatched blend of affordability, scale, efficiency, and speed. From electronics and homewares to packaging and seasonal merchandise, a significant portion of products sold across American shelves traces its origins to Chinese factories. But recent disruptions, from the U.S.-China trade war to COVID-19 shutdowns and growing concerns about overdependence on one nation, have led many retailers to rethink their sourcing strategies.

The Numbers Behind the Concern

While exact figures are closely guarded by companies, industry analysts estimate that Walmart still sources approximately 20 to 25 percent of its goods directly from China. This includes a large volume of electronics, textiles, and household items. Kroger and Albertsons, although less reliant, are not immune. Their private-label products, packaging, and non-food general merchandise are often produced in Chinese facilities, with rough estimates suggesting 10 to 15 percent exposure.

Yet reducing that dependence is no simple task.

The Harsh Reality: Alternatives Are Not Plug-and-Play

Shifting sourcing away from China presents a series of challenges. Nations like Vietnam, India, and Mexico have emerged as potential alternatives, but each has limitations in terms of production capacity, infrastructure, and supply chain maturity.

“China’s competitive advantage lies not only in low costs, but also in an unmatched ecosystem,” says a senior logistics expert based in Los Angeles. “They have the skilled labour, supplier networks, and ports operating at a level that’s hard to replicate overnight.”

Countries such as Turkey, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Eastern Europe are also part of the conversation, particularly for apparel and light manufacturing. However, they struggle with higher costs, regulatory differences, and longer lead times.

In addition, rising energy prices and shipping costs—exacerbated by ongoing conflicts and Red Sea disruptions—make global sourcing more complex than ever.

Nearshoring and the Mexico Advantage

Some U.S. retailers are now exploring nearshoring to Mexico, attracted by shorter lead times and proximity to North American markets. This could be particularly advantageous for grocery chains managing perishable goods and private-label logistics. However, Mexico’s own capacity constraints mean it cannot absorb the full volume currently handled by China.

Could Africa or North Africa Be the Next Frontier?

There’s growing interest in North African countries such as Morocco, Egypt, and even Algeria, which could emerge as future players in the global retail supply chain. Algeria, for instance, is ramping up production of processed foods, textiles, and light industrial goods, with an eye toward exporting to Europe and beyond.

“The question is not if Africa will become a viable sourcing partner, but when,” says a sourcing consultant based in Paris. “The demographics, the proximity to Europe, and improving infrastructure are all there.”

Not Just About Politics—It’s About Practicality

While decoupling from China is a politically attractive notion, retailers are also driven by what makes sense for their margins. With inflation still a concern, switching to higher-cost suppliers could impact retail pricing—something consumers may not welcome in a competitive market.

The Verdict

In the short term, completely ditching China is unrealistic. Instead, what we are likely to see is a measured diversification, with retailers spreading their supply chains across several countries to reduce risk without compromising cost and efficiency.",https://internationalsupermarketnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-cropped-isn_corporation_logo-1-32x32.webp,N,,2025-04-10 11:10:49.454630

The video, which has garnered significant attention on social media, highlights the ongoing issue of racial profiling in retail environments.

H&M employee: ‘We don’t have to have a reason’

The video begins with a security guard escorting the sisters out of the H&M store located in Coronado Center shopping mall in Albuquerque, N.M. The store employee informs the girls that they are being refused service, stating, “There’s no reason, that’s what we’re gonna go ahead and do today.” When the sisters question this decision, they are met with vague responses, further fueling their confusion and frustration.

One of the sisters asks, “So, why do we have to leave the store?” to which the employee replies, “Because we’re just refusing service, we don’t have to have a reason.” This exchange escalates as the sisters attempt to clarify the situation, pointing out that they were merely shopping and had not engaged in any wrongdoing.

Public reaction and calls for boycott

The video quickly went viral, accumulating more than 15,000 comments on TikTok, with many viewers expressing their outrage and calling for a boycott of H&M. Prominent voices, including Sunny Hostin from “The View,” chimed in, stating, “Racial profiling is illegal.” The incident has been perceived as part of a troubling trend where Black shoppers are often unfairly targeted and accused of theft.

Social media users have taken to various platforms to voice their support for the sisters, urging others to contact H&M management and demand accountability. One user claimed to have filed a complaint, stating that H&M had already taken action against the employee involved. The sentiment among many is clear: They believe that such behavior should not be tolerated and that companies must be held accountable for their employees’ actions.

Racial profiling in retail: A broader issue

This incident is not an isolated case. Numerous reports have surfaced in recent years detailing similar experiences faced by Black shoppers. A 2023 report published by the Racial and Identity Profiling Advisory Board in California found that 15 percent of Black shoppers and 42 percent of Hispanic or Latino shoppers reported experiencing racial profiling while shopping.

In September 2024, another viral incident involved a Black man at a Ross Dress for Less store who was accused of stealing shoes, only for the employee to later deny he’d ever made the accusation. Similarly, a Wisconsin woman went viral after alleging that she and her boyfriend were racially profiled at a TJ Maxx store, where they were followed by multiple employees.

Moving forward: The need for change

The recent H&M incident underscores the urgent need for retailers to address racial profiling within their stores. As consumers become more aware and vocal about these injustices, companies must take proactive steps to ensure that all customers are treated fairly and with respect.

Many advocates are calling for enhanced training for retail employees to recognize and combat their biases. Additionally, implementing clear policies against racial profiling and ensuring accountability for employees who engage in such behavior are crucial steps in fostering a more inclusive shopping environment.",https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/HM-shutterstock-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 12:27:32.253355

This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.

ADAM ZAKI: There is so much talk about the “evolving role of the CFO.” In your nearly two decades working as a finance chief, what has stayed the same?

ZANE ROWE: Looking back, the parts of the CFO role that haven’t changed are the simultaneous focus on value preservation and creation, close connection to stakeholders, commitment to integrity and sound decision making based on quality data.

In my experience, CFOs have consistently been key players in fostering collaboration, working across different parts of the company and engaging with the board and fellow executives. While the emphasis might shift and the tools we use are always evolving, the core elements of the role hold true.

So what has changed?

The evolution of the CFO's toolkit and the impact it has on the way business is done. Even before my time at Workday, when I was in the airline industry, we were heavy technology users. But what we’re able to do with technology today has significantly expanded because of data, which in turn, has impacted the nature of business and reshaped our interactions with stakeholders and customers.

Today, we can use tools to better handle larger data sets and utilize those data sets strategically to make more informed and far more accurate decisions. If you asked me this question ten years ago, I don’t think the answer would be much different. But how we navigate these changes has taken a new shape with better technology.

Have you seen the narrative of the “evolving or changing role of the CFO” linger a bit during your career?

Yes, and I think it has a lot to do with conversations around volatility. Every year seems to highlight new sources of unpredictability, and the current market is no exception. As CFOs, I don’t think we will ever have it all figured out. We’re never just going to be able to sit back and execute everything according to plan.

Technology has evolved to where change is happening so much faster than it did in the past– what took years a decade ago now happens in months. No matter what industry you’re in or how long you’ve been there, change is a part of the trajectory. And while there will always be concerns about the unforeseen impacts of newer technologies, such as agentic AI, I believe it’s less about the changing role of technology and more about how you embrace those changes that make all the difference.

You mentioned leveraging data as a key component of successfully navigating change as a CFO. What’s an example of how you’ve done it at Workday?

I'd say there are a number of things. First, within our product, we're doing amazing things with technology, where we've now got tools and capabilities that we didn’t see even three or four years ago. So, for us internally, it's how we’re using data and how we’ve leveraged data to be far better at forecasting than we ever thought we’d be one or two years ago.

And accurate data is helping us become more efficient and make better decisions across the business. For instance, we now have far better insight into what our teams are working on, how our customers are using our product and how we can think about the future — like future demand. And we’re elevating all of those decisions to a level where you can make truly informed, data-based, data-oriented choices rather than just estimating like some CFOs might have done previously.

When you’ve stepped into new roles and wanted to make changes early, how did you balance implementing them without coming off as dismissive of legacy practices?

It’s a challenge, but I think if we take a step back, life is always about learning, no matter where you are. If I go back through my career, I’ve had many, many opportunities — both good and bad — to make changes and learn from them.

Going into anything new — whether it’s a new role or a new CFO position — it’s about thinking: Okay, what are my strengths? How can I learn more? How do I engage with others?

So much of finance is actually about working with people. It’s ironic; people often think finance is all about numbers, that you can put us in a room and we’ll just come up with the answer. But it’s not. It’s about embracing what’s happening in the business. Asking things like who am I working with? How do I establish relationships? And then continuously learning from those connections.

As CFOs, we will always bring something to the table that got us there, but there’s so much to gain from others. There is a lot of power in letting your people help you and you help them. I love collaboration within business and being part of a team.

For those going into a new role, I’d say it’s important to help others understand more about you. Be very open about what you do know and what you don’t. That way, people don’t overestimate or underestimate you; they just understand you. Be transparent about your goals for the organization, as well as your personal goals, and how others can be part of your success, and likewise, how you can support theirs.

People want to help each other, it’s human nature. If you communicate openly and are clear about your strengths and weaknesses, I think you’ll find that others embrace that and are willing to help. That’s always been my approach, whether I’ve taken on new opportunities within a role or stepped into new areas of responsibility, it’s been about being transparent, being open and creating an atmosphere where people want to create value and drive the company forward.

How did your experience as a sales executive at Apple, a position you took in between CFO roles, make you a better leader?

It really highlighted the importance of that customer perspective, but also the importance of messaging within a company. It’s interesting, as a CFO you can come up with a message around things that aren’t always popular, like cost-cutting. But unless the why resonates across the company, you’re just out there talking and people aren’t really hearing what you’re saying.

My experience at Apple helped me understand how important it is for everyone to be on the same page. If your message isn’t being digested across peer groups, then it’s not effective.

So, in the CFO role, if we’re challenged in some way, if we have to cut costs or do something differently, communicating that effectively to the entire organization is incredibly important. Your frontline people need to understand why we’re in business, why we’re doing what we’re doing and why the company may be making certain trade-offs.

You’ve mentioned your interest in health, wellness and longevity. When it comes to work-life balance or maintaining physical health while meeting the demands of a CFO, what role do you think technology plays?

I think nowadays it’s fascinating because with technology, there are tradeoffs of good and bad in our lives as business leaders. The good is that technology is ever-present. It can drive change fast and it allows you to do things quickly. The downside is that you’re always on. I’m reachable almost 24/7 unless I put my phone in sleep mode and make an effort to get some rest.

So I think the importance of balance, wellness and all these other areas is becoming more evident. As much as technology is changing business, it’s also changing our insight into what makes us better managers and better humans and how you can help balance all of that.

It’s especially interesting when you look at what’s happening in the medical field. How we think about what we eat, the amount of sleep we get, how we manage stress and how we think about overall health, including mental health. COVID-19 highlighted how critical it is to focus on a balanced life. You can be great at one thing, but if you’re struggling in everything else, then when you look back on your life, what are you going to remember and how can you change that?

I’m part of a number of CFO communities, and every so often, we’ll have someone come in and speak on topics like health, self-care and wellness. And those sessions are always the most attended. I think there’s a real interest in: Hey, I’m giving it all at work and how can I balance that and still be effective with my time? And then, when I do have time for myself, how do I make sure I’m benefiting from it by doing things like relaxing, managing stress and handling all the elements of life?

Technology has created a heightened demand on our time and capabilities. And as humans, we tend to keep pushing ourselves to do more and more, so we’re making it harder on ourselves. That’s why this is such an important area.

For me, I still feel like it’s early days in trying to balance all these elements. I wear an Oura Ring now, I’m spending time with doctors, paying attention to what’s going on in my body and really thinking about how I manage my work-life balance. How do I think about lifespan and longevity and all that goes into that?",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Mi6hNiEPA0iSy00r51YfdRLaoKC-80z3S11KPfZeC64/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9aYW5lX1Jvd2UuanBn.webp,N,,2025-04-10 12:27:15.512440

Days into the effort, it's meeting only partial success with many countries unwilling to ally with the main target of President Donald Trump's trade war.

Facing the cratering of global markets, Trump on Wednesday backed off his tariffs on most nations for 90 days, saying countries were lining up to negotiate more favorable conditions.

China has refused to seek talks, saying it would ""fight to the end"" in a tariff war, prompting Trump to further jack up the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125%. China has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. goods of 84%, which took effect Thursday.

Trump's move was seemingly an attempt to narrow what had been an unprecedented trade war between the U.S. and most of the world to a showdown between the U.S. and China.

""A just cause receives support from many,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a daily briefing on Thursday. ""The U.S. cannot win the support of the people and will end in failure.""

China has thus far focused on Europe, with a phone call between Premier Li Qiang and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen ""sending a positive message to the outside world.""

""China is willing to work with the EU to jointly implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of China and the EU, strengthen communication and exchanges, and deepen China-EU trade, investment and industrial cooperation,"" the official Xinhua News Agency reported.

That was followed by a video conference between Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and EU Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Šefčović on Tuesday to discuss the U.S. ""reciprocal tariffs.""

Wang said the tariffs ""seriously infringe upon the legitimate interests of all countries, seriously violate WTO rules, seriously damage the rules-based multilateral trading system, and seriously impact the stability of the global economic order,"" Xinhua said.

""It is a typical act of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying,"" Wang said quoted as saying.

""China is willing to resolve differences through consultation and negotiation, but if the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end,"" Wang said.

Wang has also spoken with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, while Li, the premier, has met with business leaders. China has ""already made a full evaluation and is prepared to deal with all kinds of uncertainties, and will introduce incremental policies according to the needs of the situation,"" Xinhua quoted Li as saying.

In Hong Kong, the spokesperson for the local office of China's Foreign Ministry reiterated Beijing's unwillingness to negotiate with the U.S. under current conditions.

""We must solemnly tell the U.S.: a tariff-wielding barbarian who attempts to force countries to call and beg for mercy can never expect that call from China,"" Huang Jingrui wrote in an op-ed appearing in the South China Morning Post.

If the U.S. is truly sincere about starting a dialogue with China, it should ""immediately rectify its wrong practices and adopt the right attitude of equality, respect and mutual benefit,"" Huang wrote.

Despite their unhappiness with Washington, not all countries are interested in linking up with China, especially those with a history of disputes with Beijing.

""We speak for ourselves, and Australia's position is that free and fair trade is a good thing,"" Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters. ""We engage with all countries, but we stand up for Australia's national interest and we stand on our own two feet.""

China imposed a series of official and unofficial trade barriers against Australia in 2020 after the government angered Beijing by calling for an independent inquiry into the COVID-19 pandemic.

India has also reportedly turned down a Chinese call for cooperation, and Russia, typically seen as China's closest geopolitical partner, has been left out of the Trump tariffs altogether. Taiwanese Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung said on Wednesday that his government is preparing for talks on tariffs with the U.S.

The U.S. imposed a 32% tariff on imports from Taiwan, a close trading and security partner. Taiwan produces most of the high-performing computer chips craved by the U.S. and others and has long enjoyed a trade surplus with Washington.

Yet, Southeast Asian nations such as Vietnam and Cambodia find themselves in a particular bind. They benefited when factories moved to their countries from China due to rising costs. They are being hit by punishing tariffs but have few buyers outside the U.S. and are already operating on razor-thin margins.

Trump had previously denied contemplating a pause, but the drama over his tariffs will continue as the administration prepares to engage in country-by-country negotiations. Meanwhile, tariffs will be 10% for the countries where the larger ones were paused.

It's not clear what further steps China will take, but the Foreign Ministry's Lin said China ""will not sit idly by and let the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people be deprived of, nor will we allow the international trade rules and multilateral trading system to be undermined."" Non-tariff options include bans on American movies, American law firms and other trade in services.

World markets soared on Thursday, with Japan's benchmark jumping more than 9%, as investors welcomed Trump's decision Germany's DAX initially gained more than 8%. It was up 7.5% at 21,141.53 a bit later, while the CAC 40 in Paris gained 7.2% to 7,360.23. Britain's FTSE 100 surged 5.4% to 8,090.02.

However, U.S. futures edged lower and oil prices also declined. Chinese shares saw more moderate gains, given yet another jump in the tariffs each side is imposing on each others' exports.

From the rise of AI-enabled PCs to automating password resets and drafting better emails, Gustafson shares firsthand how AI is reshaping internal workflows and external constituent services. Takai and Gustafson also explore what it means for government agencies to embrace a culture of continuous learning, data stewardship and responsible AI adoption.

SHOW NOTES

Here are the top-five takeaways from this episode:

AI Is Already Boosting Productivity

Public sector organizations are using AI tools like Microsoft Copilot to automate note taking, email drafting, meeting scheduling and other everyday tasks. These small efficiencies add up, saving time and enabling government employees to focus on higher-value work.

Government Workforces Must Embrace Continuous Learning

With AI tools evolving rapidly, learning how to use them effectively is not a one-and-done effort. Leaders and staff must commit to ongoing skill development, adapting to new capabilities and approaches as they emerge in real time.

AI Is a Strategic Advantage, Not a Threat

Rather than fearing replacement by technology, government workers should see AI as a way to enhance their performance and job satisfaction. By offloading repetitive tasks, AI can make public service work more fulfilling and engaging.

Data Privacy and Security Must Be Everyone’s Responsibility

AI introduces new questions about data usage, storage and protection — especially for personally identifiable information (PII). Security can no longer be just the CISO’s job; it must become a shared responsibility across the entire workforce.

IT Leaders Are at the Center of Organizational Change

CIOs and CTOs are critical change agents in government, helping to guide digital transformation through technology and workforce innovation. AI presents them with a unique opportunity to lead not only infrastructure modernization but cultural and operational shifts as well.

These observations and more are revealed in the the latest Piper Sandler Taking Stock With Teens survey for spring 2025.

Teen “self-reported” spending was up 6 percent year-over-year (Y/Y) to $2,388 in spring 2025 and up 1 percent vs. the fall 2024 report.

The survey is a semi-annual research project that gathers input from 6,455 teens with an average age of 16.2 years. Discretionary spending patterns, fashion trends, technology, brand and media preferences are assessed through surveying a geographically diverse subset of high schools across the U.S. Since the project began in 2001, Piper Sandler has surveyed more than 274,273 teens and collected approximately 65 million data points on teen spending.​​

Footwear Mindshare

On the footwear front, Nike remains the No. 1 brand in all footwear for the spring 2025 report, but the brand continues to see mindshare erosion (49 percent share this spring vs. 60 percent on average in 2022-2023), driven especially by females, where share dipped to under 40 percent – the first time since 2020. Male share also declined but is more stable at 57 percent.

What brands are gaining in footwear? Piper Sandler said Ugg has moved up the most (two spots with 4-points in share gains Y/Y), followed by On Running (two spots with 1-point in share gains Y/Y).

Ugg has become the No. 1 fashion trend among upper income females, dethroning leggings/Lululemon, which held the top spot since spring 2018.

Apparel Mindshare

Lululemon was ranked No. 3 in apparel mindshare for the second survey in a row, after falling from its No. 1 spot in the fall 2024 survey. The brand as the No. 1 apparel brand for upper income females from fall 2021 to spring 2024. Lululemon lost 4 points of mindshare Y/Y.

Hollister was ranked No. 1 in spring 2025, followed by and Brandy Melville at No. 2.

Accessories Mindshare

Stanley Cups placed as the No. 2 ‘fashion trend on its way out’ among upper-income females for the second consecutive Teen Survey.

Other Key Indicators

The core beauty wallet reached the highest level ever this survey at $374 (+10 percent Y/Y). All categories except for haircare (flat Y/Y) grew Y/Y. Fragrance grew the fastest at +22 percent Y/Y.

e.l.f. maintained its position as the No. 1 cosmetics brand, dropping 3 points of share Y/Y but ~flat sequentially at 35 percent of female teens.

Ulta remained the No. 2 favorite beauty shopping destination and Sephora remained No. 1. Bath & Body Works appeared at No. 3, ranking in the top 10 for the first time since fall 2018.

Lays (PEP) now most preferred snack for the first time since spring 2021, followed by Goldfish (CPB), then Doritos (PEP).

Red Bull is now the top energy drink brand, but Celsius and Alani Nu together (29 percent) are ahead of both Red Bull (28 percent) and Monster (26 percent). Teens prefer energy drinks (45 percent) over coffee (28 percent) and soda (26 percent).

Dr Pepper (10 percent) is teens’ favorite beverage brand, followed by Coca-Cola (9 percent), then Gatorade (7 percent). Soda is teens’ preferred type of beverage, followed by water, then energy drinks.

Eighty-eight percent of teens own an iPhone, with 25 percent of teens expected to upgrade to an iPhone 17 this fall/winter (up from 22 percent in fall 2024).

Among gig economy names, the most dominant providers are Uber in ridesharing (76 percent) and DoorDash in food delivery (73 percent).

Instagram remains the most used social media app, with 87 percent of teens using monthly. TikTok was flat at 79 percent, while Snapchat improved to 72 percent.

Roblox active usage slowed to 42 percent from 46 percent in fall 2024. 17 percent of teens have never played Roblox, in-line with fall 2024.

One interesting note was the percentage of parents who shopped exclusively at Walmart increased from fall 2024 across all income cohorts, while the percent of parents who shop exclusively at Target decreased across all income cohorts. Amazon remains the number one shopping website for upper income teens.

Of the households that have groceries delivered, Walmart maintained status as the No. 1 most popular provider (19 percent of households vs. 18 percent in fall 2024). Within upper income, Walmart was again the No. 3 most popular grocery delivery service.

Introduction and Key Findings

In late February 2025, House Republicans passed a budget resolution that called for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. Senate Republicans recently passed a similar resolution laying the foundation for more than $5 trillion in tax cuts.[1] While these resolutions included few details and are meant to serve as a blueprint for a more detailed bill to follow, Republicans have acknowledged that they plan to at least extend the tax cuts passed by the first Trump administration in 2017,[2] tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefitted the wealthy and profitable corporations.[3]

Republicans have proposed paying in part for the extension of the Trump tax cuts – and any other tax handouts they see fit – by drastically slashing funding to programs that help the most vulnerable Americans, most notably Medicaid and SNAP (sometimes called food stamps).[4] A recent analysis by the Yale Budget Lab found that the net effect of the potential combination of tax giveaways and social safety net cuts proposed by Republicans could result in the poorest Americans actually losing more than $1,000 a year. While the richest Americans – those making $3.2 million or more – could gain more than $180,000.[5]

Some of the business provisions in the Trump tax cuts were made permanent, such as the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Others, however, such as the 2017 law’s new 20 percent deduction available for business owners who “pass-through” their income – where they pay taxes on their business via income tax rather than a separate corporate tax– are set to end this year or are already beginning to phase out.[6] In 2024, more than half of the benefits from the pass-through deduction went to households with incomes of more than $1 million, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP).[7]

In total, CBPP found that in the first year after the first Trump tax cuts were enacted, 2018, more than half of the benefits of the corporate-specific provisions went to households in the top 5 percent income bracket.[8]

Public Citizen investigated one reason why Republicans might propose to shower wealthy individuals and profitable businesses with additional tax cuts funded on the backs of the country’s most vulnerable: immense corporate lobbying power. We analyzed one full year of lobbying disclosures – 2024 – to compile all lobbyists included in lobbying disclosures that indicated lobbying was done on tax issues.

Our investigation concludes that the discussions in Washington, D.C. related to federal tax policy were dominated by those representing corporate and wealthy interests:

More than six thousand lobbyists descended on Capitol Hill in 2024 to lobby on tax policy. The total amounts to nearly half of all federal lobbyists.

For every member of Congress, there were 11 tax lobbyists in 2024.

Many individual lobbyists were hired by multiple clients to lobby on tax issues. More than 85 percent of their work was done representing corporate interests.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent 99 lobbyists to Capitol Hill to influence tax policy, the most of any lobbying entity. The Chamber was followed by Verizon (73), Intuit (71), Blue Cross and Blue Shield (71), and the Business Roundtable (68).

Out of the top 100 entities hiring the most tax lobbyists, all but two represented corporate interests.

Most of the corporations and corporate trade groups with the largest tax lobbyist corps in 2024 lobbied specifically on the Trump tax cuts.

Nearly Half of All Federal Lobbyists Lobbied the Federal Government on Tax Issues in 2024

Public Citizen searched all lobbying disclosures filed in 2024 for lobbying activities that fit two main criteria: those that had the “TAX” lobbying issue code,[9] and / or those that included the word “tax” in the specific lobbying issues field – the field in which the lobbying activities are summarized.[10] We define lobbying done that matches one or both these criteria as lobbying done on “tax issues.”

In 2024, there were 6,107 federal lobbyists that lobbied on tax issues. According to OpenSecrets, there were 13,043 total federal lobbyists last year,[11] meaning nearly half of all lobbyists – 47% – lobbied on tax issues. There are 535 members of Congress. Thus, in 2024, there were 11 tax lobbyists for every member of Congress.

Not every lobbyist on tax issues lobbied on specific tax issues are likely to be included in the bill the Republicans eventually produce. Further, for many lobbyists, taxes are just one of the many issues they lobby on. Due to the vagueness of the disclosures, in some cases we can glean little more than that the fact the lobbyist was paid to lobby on something related to taxes (e.g., they disclosed lobbying on “tax policy” generally).

When it comes to tax policy in 2025, though, the extension of the Trump tax cuts, along with whatever tax plans the majority proposes using their budget reconciliation vehicle, can be passed by simple majority and will undoubtedly be at the center of much – if not most – of the tax policy lobbying done this year.

This analysis highlights not just the sheer number of tax lobbyists that have inundated Capitol Hill but the narrow interests those individuals represent.

More Than 85 Percent of Hired Tax Lobbyists Represented Corporate Interests in 2024

Many of the more than 6,000 lobbyists we found lobbying on tax issues in 2024 often represented more than one client on tax issues, some represented dozens of clients.

When we examine the number of lobbyists on an issue, the number of unique lobbyists (individual people) does not reveal the true scope of lobbying and obscures changes in lobbying activity. For example, if five new corporations started lobbying on taxes but hired a lobbyist that had already been lobbying on taxes, just looking at the lobbyist total would show no uptick in activity. Counting each unique lobbyist client relationship is a better metric to show changes in lobbying activity (e.g. when the same person lobbies on tax issues on behalf of Walmart, Chevron, and the Business Roundtable, that same lobbyist is counted three times).

Looking at the data this way, in 2024, clients hired more than 13,000 lobbyists to lobby on tax issues throughout the year. On average each quarter, clients sent more than 10,500 lobbyists to lobby on tax issues. More than 85 percent of those lobbyists represented corporate interests each quarter. [Figure 1]

Figure 1 – 2024 Tax Lobbyists by Those Representing Corporate Interests vs. All Others

Public Citizen determined which lobbyists represented corporate interests by examining each entity paying for the lobbying. Most of the lobbyists falling into the corporate interest category are those hired by large corporations and powerful corporate trade groups. Lobbying categorized as not done on behalf corporate interests were done by those representing non-profit advocacy organizations, universities, professional associations, government institutions and non-profit hospitals.

It is important to note that many of the fifteen percent of entities categorized as not representing corporate interests are likely not lobbying against such interests. Our methodology is conservative. Many non-profit hospital systems, for example, operate similarly to for-profit entities. [12]

The entities responsible for hiring the most tax lobbyists in 2024 include some of the biggest names in corporate America. The corporate trade group the U.S. Chamber of Commerce leads all lobbying entities with 99 tax issue lobbyists in 2024. Only one organization of the top 20, the AARP, represents non-corporate interests (AARP opposed the Trump tax cuts in 2027).[13] [Table 1]

Table 1 – Corporations and Trade Groups Hiring the Most Tax Lobbyists in 2024 (Top 20)

In total, just two of the top 100 lobbying entities in terms of the number of tax lobbyists hired in 2024 represent non-corporate interests.

While some entities from Table 1 report lobbying more broadly on “tax policy,” or “tax issues” related to their industry, [14] more than half of the companies and trade groups from Table 1 explicitly mention that – in 2024 – they lobbied on the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: the Chamber,[15] Verizon,[16] Altria,[17] the American Bankers Association,[18] the American Chemistry Council,[19] Amgen,[20] the Business Roundtable,[21] the Edison Electric Institute,[22] Exxon,[23] FedEx,[24] International Paper,[25] the NCTA,[26] and the National Automobile Dealers Association.[27]

Conclusion

Shortly after the 2017 Trump tax cuts were passed, some companies publicized anecdotal pay increases and bonuses for their workers to purportedly tout the success of the cuts. The reality is workers ended up seeing a tiny portion of the Trump tax cut promised windfall. [28] The money did not – as it never does – trickle down.

The pending Trump-Republican tax proposal, is tax policy of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich.[29]

The 2017 Trump tax cuts were drafted with an end date due to the cost, and that price tag has only risen in the years since. Rather than additional tax giveaways to the rich, it’s time Republicans in Congress focused on true tax reform that will create additional revenue to invest in communities.

With so much growing competition in this sector, it's hard for restaurants and fast-food chains to develop completely new products. It has become common practice for these businesses to borrow and adapt each other's ideas.

Introducing menu items similar to those of competitors is also a way for businesses to compete more effectively with their rivals. It can aid in meeting market demand by filling gaps that are not being fully addressed.

McDonald's launches premium Lemonade nationwide

Starting Apr. 8, McDonald's (MCD) is rolling out lemonade nationwide, just in time for spring. With this addition to its permanent menu, customers can enjoy it with their meals any time of year.

The fast food chain has served Minute Maid lemonade at all its U.S. locations for years, but the new lemonade is unlike the previous offering. It is handcrafted and contains natural ingredients, featuring real lemon juice, lemon pulp, and cane sugar.

Although this premium lemonade may sound like a new addition to many, the menu item is actually not new. McDonald's tested it in select locations across the U.S. in March 2023.

The lemonade was a total success and quickly became a fan favorite. Due to high demand and positive consumer feedback, McDonald's decided to bring it to all markets nationwide so more people could enjoy it.

The nationwide rollout of this menu item doesn't mean McDonald's has ended its years-long relationship with Minute Maid. The fast food giant still offers and serves Minute Maid orange juice.

McDonald's new nationwide lemonade rollout ups the competition among fast-food chains

Although lemonade is a common beverage offered at fast-food establishments, Chick-fil-A is one of the first restaurant chains to make its own natural version and turn it into a signature menu item.

Chick-fil-A introduced its freshly-squeezed lemonade in 1977, marketing it as a product made with real lemon juice and without preservatives or artificial colors.

Since then, freshly-squeezed lemonade has become the most-ordered drink on Chick-fil-A's menu, which prompted it to launch more varieties. These include the diet version with Splenda and the frosted lemonade. It has even begun selling it by the gallon for super-fans to purchase at any location.

However, with McDonald's nationwide launch of its handcrafted lemonade, Chick-fil-A's reign as the top lemonade maker may be threatened.

McDonald's is one of the largest fast food chains worldwide, with over 43,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries. On the other hand, Chick-fil-A is much smaller, with over 3,000 locations across 48 U.S. states.

Alimentation Couche-Tard’s bid for Seven & i Holdings, the Japanese owner of 7-Eleven, remains hung up on “serious U.S. antitrust challenges,” said Ryuichi Isaka, Seven & i’s outgoing CEO, in a statement on Wednesday.

Isaka added that Seven & i and Couche-Tard — who have been in merger talks for eight months — have made “no meaningful progress on finding a solution” to these issues.

Isaka’s comments come about a month after Seven & i and Couche-Tard revealed they’d begun identifying potential buyers for at least 2,000 overlapping c-stores in North America to appease antitrust concerns in pursuit of their merger. By mid-March, the retailers were having prospective buyers sign non-disclosure agreements.

Although the divestiture plan seems to have stalled, conversations between the two retailers are still ongoing, and they even met before Seven & i shared its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday, according to a Q&A released Wednesday morning.

“At the moment, we are having constructive conversations with ACT to see if we can find a way forward together,” Seven & i said in the Q&A, which does not specify who is speaking.

Seven & i is also developing plans to boost its own operations in case the merger doesn’t materialize. These include a planned IPO of its North American operations, 7-Eleven Inc., as well as selling some non-core businesses and other assets, leadership changes and share buybacks.

Seven & i pointed to the Kroger-Albertsons attempted merger not only as a lesson in how difficult these megadeals can be to pull off in the U.S. due to antitrust concerns, but also the danger of not continuing to develop as a company during that process.

The Kroger-Albertsons merger dragged on for more than two years before it fell apart, and by focusing on the merger instead of its own operations, Seven & i believes Albertsons was weakened as a company.

“We are taking a cautious approach, as we believe that entering into an agreement and then experiencing insolvency within two years does not align with the interests of our shareholders,” said Seven & i in the Q&A.

Michelin has announced a forecast for its first-quarter sales, predicting figures slightly below the market consensus due to unexpected seasonality in the first half of 2025. The full details of this forecast can be read in the original report by Reuters. The French tire manufacturer cited U.S.-imposed tariffs as a factor contributing to market volatility, but expressed confidence that its local-to-local strategy would mitigate these challenges.

Michelin, which operates significant production facilities across North America, including over 23,500 employees in the U.S. and Canada, highlighted that the North American market accounted for 38.6% of its total annual sales in 2024. The company is preparing for a volume decline between 6% and 8% in the first quarter, driven by reduced car demand post-2024. This projection contrasts with the average analyst expectation of a 2.6% volume drop, based on a company-provided consensus dated February 17.

Despite the anticipated challenges, Michelin noted that 70% of its tires sold in the U.S. are manufactured domestically, which could buffer the impact of tariffs. The company also mentioned that natural rubber remains unaffected by recent trade announcements, with the U.S. being largely self-sufficient in synthetic rubber production. Michelin plans to release its first-quarter results on April 24, providing further insights into its performance and strategies moving forward.

Folsom-based PowerSchool, a worldwide provider of software to run schools and school districts, suffered an extensive data breach last year that it acknowledged in January after hackers got access to compromised credentials. PowerSchool software supports over 60 million students through 18,000 school districts worldwide,

Lawsuits were filed almost immediately after the disclosure of the data breach of confidential and personally identifiable information. PowerSchool has now been sued at least 55 times in nine federal court districts across the country, according to the Washington, D.C.-based panel’s transfer order released this week. Some of the suits are class actions.

PowerSchool helps schools keep track of grades, attendance and class schedules, along with multiple other education and management tasks. Its products contain school, student and teacher records going back years.

PowerSchool said in January that it was investigating the incident and that it engaged the FBI and other cybersecurity experts to ensure a thorough response. The company said the compromised account has been shut down, and it's offered to pay for identity protection services and credit monitoring for affected students and educators. PowerSchool didn't respond to requests for interviews about the latest legal action.

The company had requested transfer of the cases to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California in Sacramento or the Northern District of California in San Francisco.

Some plaintiffs had sought to have the suit consolidated into the Western District of Missouri, Northern District of Illinois, Eastern District of New York, Middle District of North Carolina or the District of Minnesota.

Some 29 of the cases filed against PowerSchool were filed in Sacramento. The Eastern District has by far the most PowerSchool data-breach suits of any district.

The panel decided the various suits “involve virtually identical claims,” and the cases will be heard in the U.S. District Court for Southern District of California, which is based in San Diego.

The panel’s transfer order said discovery in all actions will focus on how and when the breach occurred, the sufficiency of PowerSchool’s data security practices, and how and when PowerSchool notified breach victims.

The panel also said that centralization will avoid the possibility of inconsistent pretrial rulings, particularly with respect to class certification.

The federal court in San Diego is also an appropriate district for the litigation because ""action is pending in the district, and related state court litigation is pending” in San Diego County Superior Court, according to the order.

Senior Judge Roger T. Benitez of the Southern District of California was assigned to the transferred cases.

PowerSchool launched in 1997 in Folsom. It has been owned over the years by companies including Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) and London-based educational publisher Pearson PLC. In 2016, Pearson (NYSE: PSO) sold PowerSchool to private equity firm Vista Equity Partners.

Isaka’s comments come about a month after Seven & i and Couche-Tard revealed they’d begun identifying potential buyers for at least 2,000 overlapping c-stores in North America to appease antitrust concerns in pursuit of their merger. By mid-March, the retailers were having prospective buyers sign non-disclosure agreements.

Although the divestiture plan seems to have stalled, conversations between the two retailers are still ongoing, and they even met before Seven & i shared its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday, according to a Q&A released Wednesday morning.

“At the moment, we are having constructive conversations with ACT to see if we can find a way forward together,” Seven & i said in the Q&A, which does not specify who is speaking.

Seven & i pointed to the Kroger-Albertsons attempted merger not only as a lesson in how difficult these megadeals can be to pull off in the U.S. due to antitrust concerns, but also the danger of not continuing to develop as a company during that process.

The Kroger-Albertsons merger dragged on for more than two years before it fell apart, and by focusing on the merger instead of its own operations, Seven & i believes Albertsons was weakened as a company.

How important is the pharma / biotech sector to Switzerland’s economy?

The epicentre of the country’s industry is located in Basel, home of such global heavyweights as Novartis and Roche.

According to KOF Economic Institute in Zurich, this industry is Switzerland’s “growth engine.”

“It has become the largest industry in Switzerland, contributing significantly to country's goods trade surplus.”

And the industry umbrella association, Interpharma, points out that the sector’s productivity is five times higher than the Swiss average.

Why is the pharma sector so appealing for employees?

Because of its sheer size and the impact on the country’s economy, the industry is always seeking highly qualified specialists in the fields of research, development, and manufacturing.

Also, the pharma / biotech field is never stagnant — that is, there are constantly new inventions and discoveries, and a huge potential for further innovations.

Last but certainly not least, the pay scale is among the highest in Switzerland.

While an entry level job in one of the pharmaceutical fields may be close to the Swiss average of 80,000-plus francs a year, the earning potential will gradually grow to reach three-digit figures.

Just as an example, an average salary for a scientist working at Roche or Novartis ranges from 116,000 to 132,000 francs a year, according to Glassdoor recruiter.

More qualified professionals can command even more: closer to 200,000 francs a year, and top executives closer to 500,000.

Can foreign nationals work in this field?

Many do.

And unlike most sectors in Switzerland, which give priority to nationals of the European Union and EFTA (Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein), big pharma companies actively recruit people from third countries, namely the United States.

In fact, Roche and Novartis pull out all the stops to attract foreigners — especially from the US — for top management positions.

“Depending on the size of the company, the number of [locally-based] candidates is very limited for certain positions. Hiring foreign executives is therefore inevitable,"" according to recruiter Erik Wirz. ""And in the United States, there are very qualified employees in the pharmaceutical or technological fields.”

Factories in the U.S., Mexico and Canada retrenched sharply in March due to tariffs, with purchasing activity down the most in Canada

UK supplier activity contracting at a rate that has only ever been surpassed twice previously in the last 25 years, signaling considerable manufacturing weakness

CLARK, N.J., April 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index — a leading indicator tracking demand conditions, shortages, transportation costs, inventories, and backlogs based on a monthly survey of 27,000 businesses — decreased for a third successive month in March to -0.51 and posted its lowest value in almost five years, indicating the highest degree of spare capacity across global supply chains since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

A key finding from GEP's latest data was a sharp decline in the number of companies building buffers into their stocks. Overall, manufacturers' stockpiling was the lowest in nine years, highlighting caution among procurement leaders worldwide about future demand.

""March's sharp decline in supplier activity was due to the stifling effect of tariffs and tariff-related uncertainty, which had its strongest impact in North America, where manufacturers reported cutbacks to purchasing activity and inventories,"" said John Piatek, vice president, consulting GEP. ""Until just last week, most companies had taken a wait-and-see approach. Now, organizations are aggressively exploring every possible way to eliminate costs, push suppliers to absorb tariffs, and de-risk their global supply chains.""

In the U.K., supplier spare capacity rose for the fourth month in succession to a level that has only been surpassed during either the COVID-19 pandemic or global financial crisis period. U.K. factories aggressively destocked and reduced spending during March, suggesting the country's industrial sector is bracing for a downturn.

Our data showed significant slack across European supply chains in March, although in contrast to the U.K., there were budding signs of recovery for the continent's industrial sector as demand for raw materials, commodities and components were down by the softest margin in almost three years.

Meanwhile in Asia, supply chains are broadly running at full capacity. In March, there was even a slight uptick in regional procurement activity, driven by China and India.

Interpreting the data:

Index > 50 means growth. The further above 50, the faster the growth

Index < 50 means decreasing. The further below 50, the larger the contraction.

MARCH 2025 KEY FINDINGS

DEMAND: Our indicator, which tracks global demand for raw materials, components and commodities, was broadly unchanged during the month and therefore remained close to its long-term average, signaling global purchasing activity was near its historical trend. There remains considerable geographical differences, however, with a worsening of factory input demand in North America contrasting with some pick-up in Europe and Asia.

INVENTORIES: Reports of safety stockpiling from manufacturers across the globe decreased in March to their lowest since July 2016 as procurement managers show a strong reluctance to add to their inventories. The data continues to point to the adoption of a ""wait-and-see"" mentality among buyers as uncertainty regarding worldwide trade conditions remains rife.

MATERIAL SHORTAGES: Our global item shortages indicator, which tracks the availability of critical commodities, common inputs and components, remains below its long-term average, signaling robust global material supply levels. This metric implies that vendors have stock to meet orders from their customers.

LABOR SHORTAGES: Reports of labor shortages remained contained. Companies are not struggling to process workloads due to staff capacity constraints, according to our backlogs tracker.

TRANSPORTATION: Global transportation costs fell to their lowest in the year-to-date. Overall, they were close to their long-term average level in March.

REGIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN VOLATILITY

NORTH AMERICA: Index at -0.63, down severely from -0.18, signaling a sharp rise in spare capacity across North American supply chains. U.S., Canadian and Mexican manufacturers retrenched in March.

EUROPE: Index ticks up to -0.63, from -0.72, pointing to a still-high level of underutilization across European supply chains. Tentative signs of recovery emerge, however, as weakness in input demand recedes.

About the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index

The GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index is produced by S&P Global and GEP. It is derived from S&P Global's PMI® surveys, sent to companies in over 40 countries, totaling around 27,000 companies. The headline figure is a weighted sum of six sub-indices derived from PMI data, PMI Comments Trackers and PMI Commodity Price & Supply Indicators compiled by S&P Global.

A value above 0 indicates that supply chain capacity is being stretched and supply chain volatility is increasing. The further above 0, the greater the extent to which capacity is being stretched.

A value below 0 indicates that supply chain capacity is being underutilized, reducing supply chain volatility. The further below 0, the greater the extent to which capacity is being underutilized.

A Supply Chain Volatility Index is also published at a regional level for Europe, Asia, North America and the U.K. For more information about the methodology, click here.

📧 Editor’s note: Subscribe to our retail newsletter to make sure you see each weekly edition of Ecommerce Trends.","Online sales for the largest Consumer Electronics retailers in North America have been climbing out of a hole, following negative growth year over year in 2023 and 2024, but new tariffs from an escalating trade war between the U.S. and other countries could put that recovery in jeopardy.

Already, Apple and Best Buy have issued warnings about negative effects from tariffs, and analysts have cited concerns about the impact as tariffs add costs to importing goods from abroad. Apple and Best Buy are No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, in the Top 2000 Database‘s Consumer Electronics category. The database ranks North America’s largest online retailers by their annual ecommerce sales. Overall, Apple is No. 3 in the Top 2000, and Best Buy is No. 8.

Then, on April 2, President Donald Trump announced a new round of tariffs, starting with a 10% tariff on all imported goods to the U.S. as of April 5. China implemented retaliatory tariffs of 34% on goods imported from the U.S.

What tariffs mean for online Consumer Electronics sales

“International trade is critically important to our business and industry,” said Corie Barry, the chief executive officer at Best Buy, speaking to investors during a March earnings call. “The consumer electronics supply chain is highly global, technical, and complex. China and Mexico remain the No. 1 and No. 2 sources for products we sell, respectively.”

Best Buy web sales by year

Meanwhile, Apple warned in a November filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that restrictions on international trade, including tariffs, “can materially adversely affect the Company’s business and supply chain.” It attributed that vulnerability to the fact that it is reliant on overseas manufacturing.

“Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam,” Apple noted.

It detailed the direct impact it expected to see in an environment with elevated trade-related costs.

Apple web sales by year

“The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations,” Apple explained. “Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected products, services and third-party applications to its customers.”

In addition, Apple is one of five retailers, including Nike, that depend on international sales for more than half of at least $1 billion in annual online sales globally.

Impact on prices

Apple may need to raise the prices of its iPhones and Apple Watches by as much as 43% to cover costs from new tariffs, according to the investment firm Rosenblatt Securities. In a recent note, the company assessed that Apple was not receiving exemptions or waivers for its products as it did with previous tariffs.

Higher prices in turn have the potential to incentivize consumers to put off electronics purchases, accelerating a trend from 2024 that saw shoppers waiting for the best deals possible during promotional events such as Cyber 5 sales or Amazon’s Prime Day.

New survey data release Tuesday from Salsify and the Digital Shelf Institute showed that 53% were already delaying purchases, eyeing events such as Prime Day or Walmart Deals as opportunities to get better pricing.

Factories in the U.S., Mexico and Canada retrenched sharply in March due to tariffs, with purchasing activity down the most in Canada

UK supplier activity contracting at a rate that has only ever been surpassed twice previously in the last 25 years, signaling considerable manufacturing weakness

CLARK, N.J., April 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index — a leading indicator tracking demand conditions, shortages, transportation costs, inventories, and backlogs based on a monthly survey of 27,000 businesses — decreased for a third successive month in March to -0.51 and posted its lowest value in almost five years, indicating the highest degree of spare capacity across global supply chains since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

A key finding from GEP's latest data was a sharp decline in the number of companies building buffers into their stocks. Overall, manufacturers' stockpiling was the lowest in nine years, highlighting caution among procurement leaders worldwide about future demand.

""March's sharp decline in supplier activity was due to the stifling effect of tariffs and tariff-related uncertainty, which had its strongest impact in North America, where manufacturers reported cutbacks to purchasing activity and inventories,"" said John Piatek, vice president, consulting GEP. ""Until just last week, most companies had taken a wait-and-see approach. Now, organizations are aggressively exploring every possible way to eliminate costs, push suppliers to absorb tariffs, and de-risk their global supply chains.""

In the U.K., supplier spare capacity rose for the fourth month in succession to a level that has only been surpassed during either the COVID-19 pandemic or global financial crisis period. U.K. factories aggressively destocked and reduced spending during March, suggesting the country's industrial sector is bracing for a downturn.

Our data showed significant slack across European supply chains in March, although in contrast to the U.K., there were budding signs of recovery for the continent's industrial sector as demand for raw materials, commodities and components were down by the softest margin in almost three years.

Meanwhile in Asia, supply chains are broadly running at full capacity. In March, there was even a slight uptick in regional procurement activity, driven by China and India.

Interpreting the data:

Index > 50 means growth. The further above 50, the faster the growth

Index < 50 means decreasing. The further below 50, the larger the contraction.

MARCH 2025 KEY FINDINGS

DEMAND: Our indicator, which tracks global demand for raw materials, components and commodities, was broadly unchanged during the month and therefore remained close to its long-term average, signaling global purchasing activity was near its historical trend. There remains considerable geographical differences, however, with a worsening of factory input demand in North America contrasting with some pick-up in Europe and Asia.

INVENTORIES: Reports of safety stockpiling from manufacturers across the globe decreased in March to their lowest since July 2016 as procurement managers show a strong reluctance to add to their inventories. The data continues to point to the adoption of a ""wait-and-see"" mentality among buyers as uncertainty regarding worldwide trade conditions remains rife.

MATERIAL SHORTAGES: Our global item shortages indicator, which tracks the availability of critical commodities, common inputs and components, remains below its long-term average, signaling robust global material supply levels. This metric implies that vendors have stock to meet orders from their customers.

LABOR SHORTAGES: Reports of labor shortages remained contained. Companies are not struggling to process workloads due to staff capacity constraints, according to our backlogs tracker.

TRANSPORTATION: Global transportation costs fell to their lowest in the year-to-date. Overall, they were close to their long-term average level in March.

REGIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN VOLATILITY

NORTH AMERICA: Index at -0.63, down severely from -0.18, signaling a sharp rise in spare capacity across North American supply chains. U.S., Canadian and Mexican manufacturers retrenched in March.

EUROPE: Index ticks up to -0.63, from -0.72, pointing to a still-high level of underutilization across European supply chains. Tentative signs of recovery emerge, however, as weakness in input demand recedes.

U.K.: Index slumps to -1.23, a near five-year low, from -0.85, with U.K. procurement managers significantly reducing buying and inventories as the country's economy shows signs of slowing.

ASIA: Index at -0.12, down from 0.00 in February. Overall, Asian supply chains are broadly operating at full capacity.

FOX Business' Eric Revell contributed to this report.","Walmart executives on Wednesday told investors that their confidence hasn't been rocked by President Donald Trump's escalating trade war, despite the levies impacting the retailer's significant trading partners.

""I want you to know how confident I remain in our company. I've seen us navigate times like the period after 9/11, the global financial crisis, the pandemic, and more recently, high inflation,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told a room full of investors and journalists in Dallas.

McMillon acknowledged that the company is not immune to some of the effects in the short term but that it's ""positioned to play offense.""

LEVI STRAUSS CEO SAYS ANY PRICE HIKES RELATED TO TARIFFS WILL BE ‘SURGICAL’

""Nothing about the current environment impacts our confidence in our business or our strategy. The changes we're making add even more strength and flexibility for our future,"" he said.

The company's head of finance, John David Rainey, reiterated his sentiment, saying that the company sees ""opportunities to accelerate share gains and are more maintaining flexibility to invest in price as tariffs are applied to incoming goods.""

President Donald Trump has already implemented baseline tariffs — which are taxes on imported goods — of 10% on all imports to the U.S. That took effect last week. But the administration has slapped on tariffs for specific countries with higher tariffs in place on American goods.

BILL ACKMAN CALLS FOR 90-DAY 'TIME OUT' ON TARIFFS, OR RISK 'SELF-INDUCED, ECONOMIC NUCLEAR WINTER'

Nearly two-thirds of Walmart U.S. spending goes toward products made, assembled or grown in the U.S., but the remaining third comes from around the world, with China and Mexico being the largest contributors.

The company has long warned that the tariffs are going to pump up prices for consumers, with Rainey telling FOX Business late last year that the levies ""are going to be inflationary.""

In February, Rainey told FOX Business Digital that the company was going to try and get its suppliers to absorb some of the impact, diversify its supply and lean into its private brands.

The company is still in discussions with its suppliers to lower prices, but there is no overall request for a specific price reduction. Instead, Walmart negotiates price changes based on product categories, rather than by country of origin.

The administration has argued that tariffs could serve several purposes, such as increasing federal tax revenue to offset other tax cuts, encouraging the reshoring of manufacturing, or as a negotiating tool to reduce tariffs among U.S. trading partners.

Those goals are contradictory in some respects: Tariffs that are imposed and later removed through negotiations resulting in lower trade barriers generate less tax revenue and remove the incentive for reshoring. Similarly, if companies move operations to the U.S. to avoid tariffs, the government would collect less tax revenue.

In the fourth quarter of 2024, ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih mothballed blast furnace No.
The company operated one blast furnace, Blast Furnace No.","The unit was launched in a record four days

PJSC ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih has resumed operation of blast furnace (BF) No. 6, which was mothballed in the fall of 2024 due to the market crisis and high electricity tariffs. This is stated in the corporate newspaper Metallurg.

The process of launching the furnace, which usually takes up to ten days, was completed in a record four days. The unit is currently operating stably and is reaching its planned capacity of 3.4 thousand tons of pig iron per day.

Before the launch, the blast furnace operators made considerable efforts to prepare the unit.

“We cleaned the unit from charge residues and dust, and paid special attention to general cleaning in the tundish area to ensure that the output of finished smelting products was free. We also prepared the drainage system for operation… We needed to make sure that after the blast furnace was decommissioned, its technical health was in good shape,” said Grigory Sazonov, Senior Blast Furnace Foreman at Blast Furnace Shop (BF) No. 1.

According to Anton Kisterets, Deputy Head of BF No.1 for Technology, all four blast furnace teams were involved in the launch process.

“Blast furnace blow-up is a complex, multi-stage process, but our blast furnace operators have already mastered it to the point of automation… The furnace did not show its temper, it immediately started working smoothly and efficiently,” he said.

Dozens of specialists were involved in the launch, including shift foremen, blast furnace operators, gas workers and engineers.

BF No. 6 has a symbolic meaning for the enterprise – it was here that the first pig iron was cast in April 2022 after the start of the full-scale invasion. In 2023, the unit underwent an extended second-category overhaul with the modernization of the air heater, aspiration system and electrical equipment.

In the fourth quarter of 2024, ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih mothballed blast furnace No. 6 to survive the war, due to high electricity tariffs for industrial enterprises in Ukraine and unfavorable sales markets. The company operated one blast furnace, Blast Furnace No. 8.

Despite the difficulties, in 2024 the company managed to increase production of all types of products compared to 2023. In particular, pig iron production increased by 42.7% y/y – to 2.17 million tons, and steel production increased by 69.9% y/y – to 1.65 million tons. Rolled steel output amounted to 1.53 million tons, up 72.1% y/y.

2025 RTIH INNOVATION AWARDS

Retail media will be a key focus area at the 2025 RTIH Innovation Awards.

The awards. which will open for entries in April, celebrate global tech innovation in a fast moving omnichannel world.

Our 2024 hall of fame entrants were revealed during an event which took place at RIBA’s 66 Portland Place HQ in Central London on 21st November, and consisted of a drinks reception, three course meal, and awards ceremony presided over by comedian Lucy Porter.

In his welcome speech, Scott Thompson, Founder and Editor, RTIH, said: “The event is now into its sixth year and what a journey it has been. The awards started life as an online only affair during the Covid outbreak, before launching as a small scale in real life event and growing year on year to the point where we’re now selling out this fine, historic venue.”

He added: “Congratulations to all of our finalists. Many submissions did not make it through to the final stage, and getting to this point is no mean feat. Checkout-free stores, automated supply chains, immersive experiences, on-demand delivery, next-generation loyalty offerings, inclusive retail, green technology. We’ve got all the cool stuff covered this evening.”

“But just importantly we’ve got lots of great examples of companies taking innovative tech and making it usable in everyday operations - resulting in more efficiency and profitability in all areas.”

Congratulations to our 2024 winners, and a big thank you to our sponsors, judging panel, the legend that is Lucy Porter, and all those who attended November's gathering.

As the population ages and more people are diagnosed with chronic diseases, hospitals are seeing an uptick in patients who need MRI exams. But instead of building out new suites, some providers are renting and buying mobile MRI units to cut down on construction costs. Medtech companies such as Siemens Healthineers, Philips and GE HealthCare sell movable MRIs that can fit inside trailers and scan patients being treated for everything from knee cartilage problems to cancer.

Related: Philips launches upgraded AI tech for MRI scanners

Providers can either buy or rent a mobile MRI scanner and trailer. Rental companies such as Shared Medical Services, Mobile MRI Rentals, DMS Health Technologies and Rayus Radiology purchase mobile MRI scanners from medtech companies and place them into trailers custom-built for this purpose.

Elizabethtown Community Hospital in New York leases a mobile MRI unit with a Philips scanner to offer exams both at its hospital and its rural standalone emergency clinic with an inpatient unit in Ticonderoga, New York. The unit is parked four days per week at the Elizabethtown location and one day at Ticonderoga.

“The number of patients that will require an MRI, it's not negligible [but] it's not large enough to justify just one MRI fixed in one location,” said Dr. Jun Chon, chief medical officer at Elizabethtown Community Hospital, which is part of The University of Vermont Health Network. “How do we do it economically so that patients don't bear the cost because eventually that's what the cost goes to?""

The cost savings for renting a mobile MRI can be significant. Engineering and design firm HGA estimates the cost to build a typical MRI suite including both construction and equipment is between $3 to $5 million. In contrast, Elizabethtown spends $500,000 annually to lease the mobile MRI unit.

Building an MRI suite is also a time-consuming process that involves obtaining various permits to comply with local, state and federal regulations. Some states also require hospitals obtain a Certificate of Need in which the facility must prove that the community needs the MRI, said Katie Grant, head of the magnetic resonance business at Siemens Healthineers North America. Renting mobile MRIs allows providers to forgo those potential roadblocks and serve an immediate need.

Rental agreements can last from from a day to a decade, said Maureen Kenney, president of rental company Shared Medical Services. Some hospitals rent a mobile MRI unit for a short period of time when their in-house MRI is out of service and they still need to conduct exams, she said. Others may need a rental while building an MRI suite.

“It really just depends on the type of budgetary planning that those facilities are doing,” Kenney said. “If they know that they will never have the patient volume to be able to support full-time services, then they will be a longtime customer of ours.”

Mobile MRI units can be stationed next to or near a healthcare facility, or they can be transported to various healthcare facilities along a designated route. When the mobile MRI is at Elizabethtown Community Hospital, it’s placed adjacent to the hospital as though it’s part of the facility, said Paula Gonyea, vice president of radiology for The University of Vermont Health Network.

“As a patient, they're actually going through the hospital to get on the truck,” Gonyea said. “It's not like they're going outside in a cold parking lot. It feels more like it's part of the hospital.”

Rental companies can also provide their own technologists to help with the industrywide shortage of workers. A survey from the American Society of Radiologic Technologists in October found the radiology technologist vacancy rate is about 18%, up from 6% in 2021.

“There is a nationwide technologist shortage right now, and so we often get calls to ask if they can just use our staff, and we are a package deal,” Kenney said. “Because technologists are at a premium, we certainly provide the mobile MRI service in order for them to get their scans done, but we won't provide just the technologists.”

Other providers see mobile MRIs as a pathway to strategic expansion. In August, full-body imaging company Prenuvo opened a mobile MRI clinic in Buffalo, New York to serve patients in Buffalo and Canada. A spokesperson said the mobile MRI gives patients in both countries a more accessible option to receive the exam rather than driving long distances to a hospital with an MRI suite.

The mobile MRI is located at the OWM Integrative Wellness Center in Buffalo but eventually will be driven over the border to Toronto. The company needs to get permission from the Ontario government before making the move to Canada.",https://s3-prod.modernhealthcare.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/Elizabethtown-Community-Hospital-mobile-MRI.png,N,,2025-04-10 11:11:30.942823

The sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration — including a 104% duty on Chinese imports — have one analyst calling the move an “Armageddon scenario” for the U.S. technology sector.

That’s according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who warned Wednesday that President Donald Trump’s tariffs “will go down as the worst U.S. policy mistake” since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which deepened the Great Depression. Ives said the tariffs will significantly affect the U.S. tech sector because the “hearts and lungs of the supply chain are cemented in Asia.”

He wrote, “A U.S. tech company CEO cannot decide last night... ‘Lets call Smith Semi Fab Operations in the Midwest to get those semi chips’... as there is one slight problem... IT DOES NOT EXIST... and would take 4-5 years to build a manufacturing plant... and the labor force does not support this in the U.S.... the IP of the supply chain is cemented in Asia after 30 years of making U.S. tech products... and the products will go up 3x-4x once implemented after years... being paid by the U.S. consumers/companies.”

Ives added, “‘Debacle’ is an understatement for this tariff policy.”

The “self-inflicted uncertainty” of the tariffs has “turned the global supply chain upside-down, and U.S. consumers are the ones paying,” according to Ives. He doesn’t expect any tech companies to give guidance on first-quarter conference calls, given all the uncertainty. Still, he recommends owning stocks in Apple (AAPL-5.98%) and Nvidia (NVDA-7.47%) because “despite this massive, near-term uncertainty, it does not change their installed base, technology leadership, and long-term growth opportunities, especially with Nvidia leading the AI industry.”

Apple is down 20% since Trump announced the sweeping tariffs on the so-called “Liberation Day” on April 2 and 28% year-to-date. Nvidia is down 10% since the recent tariff announcement and 26% year-to-date.

Ives said Wedbush will stay fluid. The firm work under the assumption that the tariffs in their current form will stick around for a few months and will adjust its numbers as the tariffs change or remain.

The Wedbush analyst recommends tossing out the next few quarters (June and September) and working with new financial models for 2026 for valuations as the tariff situation gets negotiated. Ives said his firm has a worst-, base-, and bull-case framework that it’s using to screen tech stocks; that’s how Wedbush will “navigate this unprecedented situation” and hold investors’ hands over the coming days and weeks.

“Market volatility and nervousness has been one of the highest I have seen in 25 years on this job covering tech stocks on the Street,” Ives said. “Now, the question is what is next and how to navigate this Category 5 storm tariff coming to the U.S economy.”","https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/3c97f20373913dfdb69a6c4310ca0ec6.jpg",N,,2025-04-10 12:29:30.250318

What item is McDonald’s adding to its menu?

READER'S DIGEST, COURTESY MCDONALD'S

On April 8, McDonald’s permanently added real lemonade to its menu! And trust us, it’s the perfect sip for spring and the sunny summer days ahead.

But what really sets it apart from the usual lineup? We’re breaking down exactly what makes this drink so refreshingly different (and why you’ll want to try it ASAP).

What makes this McDonald’s lemonade special?

McDonald’s started testing their lemonade in select locations in March 2023, and it quickly became a fan favorite. People loved it so much that McDonald’s decided to make it a permanent menu item nationwide.

The lemonade is made with real lemon juice, bits of lemon pulp and cane sugar—just like grandma used to make. It’s not just tastier—it could even be considered a healthier choice.

Has McDonald’s sold lemonade before?

McDonald’s has been in the lemonade game for a while. You might remember their old go-to: Minute Maid from the soda fountain, packed with high fructose corn syrup and artificial ingredients. Not exactly fresh.

What’s more, if you’re a fan of their Frozen Strawberry Lemonade, it isn’t going anywhere! You can still find it under the McCafé Iced section, available in regular or large sizes. It’s the same icy and tangy lemonade with that sweet strawberry swirl you know and love. But take note: The allergen info has changed. Their Blended Ice Drinks may now contain wheat and soya, so check the details if you’ve got food sensitivities.

How much does McDonald’s lemonade cost?

McDonald’s lemonade prices vary by size. A small is $2.73, a medium is $2.98 and a large is $3.44. Fresh, citrusy vibes starting under three bucks? Yes, please!

What are fans saying about McDonald’s lemonade?

If you’re skeptical about McDonald’s lemonade—don’t be. Fans on TikTok are already hyping it up with glowing reviews.

One TikTok account, Kilroy Family McDonald’s (a Cincinnati-based franchise), called it the “perfect mix of sweet and tart with a refreshing burst of lemony goodness.” And get this—you can even mix it with sweet tea for a little DIY Arnold Palmer twist.

Plus, an alleged McDonald’s crew member from Ohio shared her take on TikTok, rating it 8.8 out of 10 and even said she likes it more than Wendy’s lemonade. Bold move—and we respect it. Now we’re just waiting for McDonald’s to bring back their iconic snack wrap.

Chipotle Mexican Grill has opened at 84South, where two other restaurants are nearing their debut.

The retail center in Greenfield welcomed Chipotle on Tuesday, just weeks before Starbucks and Cooper's Hawk are expected to join the shopping center's food lineup.

""These restaurants created a lot of energy to open together, so I like that,"" said Scott Yauck, CEO of Cobalt Partners, which developed the 50-acre, mixed-use complex at the corner of West Layton Avenue and South 84th Street.

Starbucks is expected to open May 1 and Cooper's Hawk in the latter part of May, Yauck said.

Greenfield's new Chipotle, at 8515 Sura Lane, is 2,400 square feet and features the restaurant's signature Chipotlane, a drive-thru lane that allows guests to pick up digital orders.

The restaurant expects to fill 30 job openings, according to a press release.

Chipotle's menu invites customers to build their own burritos, tacos, bowls and salads.

Starbucks will be near West Layton Avenue and Falcon Pass in a 2,456-square-foot space. The cafe is a relocation of a shop at South 76th Street and West Layton Avenue that will close, Yauck said.

Cooper's Hawk, also new to Greenfield, is planned in a 10,700-square-foot building at 8415 Sura Lane.

The business characterizes its menu as ""contemporary American,"" offering a range of choices including prime churrasco grilled steak, braised short rib risotto, roasted chicken giardiniera and gnocchi with roasted butternut squash.

The initiative, supported by a large scale national advertising campaign, will provide emergency relocation support for domestic violence for the first time.

Home is the most dangerous place for women

In France, domestic violence is on the rise. The number of domestic violence victims reported to police stations has doubled between 2016 and 2023, rising from over 124,000 to more than 270,000, and these are only the reported cases. According to the Women’s Foundation (Fondation des Femmes), the actual number of victims is estimated to be closer to 1 million each year.

According to the French Ministry of the Interior, 77% of calls to 3919 (a national helpline for domestic violence) mention the urgent need to find alternative housing.

Many factors can prevent a woman from leaving a violent household. But one of the main barriers to leaving for victims of domestic violence is the lack of rehousing solutions, which forces them to remain in their home. Indeed, victims of domestic violence are often isolated from family and friends and placed under financial control by their abusive partner. As a result, they are left without resources, support, or anywhere to go.

AXA steps in to provide emergency housing relocation

When a victim of domestic violence seeks help, it often coincides with a peak in danger, an escalation of violence. Acting quickly is crucial. This presents a challenge in victim support -and that’s where the insurer has a role to play. Insurers are specialized in emergency rehousing in the event of a disaster, such as a fire or flood. They have assistance systems in place to rehouse a family within 24 hours, in an equivalent accommodation. With its expertise, the insurer can provide rapid assistance, ensuring that the victim and their children are safely relocated. AXA steps in during this critical emergency window to help women land on their feet, allowing nonprofit organizations to take over and provide long-term support.

As part of its ongoing commitment to fighting domestic violence, AXA France is now introducing two new guarantees in its home insurance policies:

Legal, psychological, and financial support, provided by Juridica, AXA France’s legal protection subsidiary, through a team of 50 lawyers trained to assist victims of violence.

Emergency rehousing coverage for a period of 7 days (renewable) for the victim and their children, giving them the time and security needed to take essential steps and find a long-term housing solution.

This new support system is built on:

A dedicated legal assistance helpline, available Monday to Friday from 9:30 AM to 7:00 PM, to provide victims with guidance on their rights and assess their potential need for emergency housing relocation.

A specialized unit for domestic violence victims within AXA Partners, an entity focused on everyday assistance, available 24/7. This team is responsible for securing safe and suitable accommodation (hotel or trusted third party) while ensuring anonymity, security guarantees, geographic considerations, and family needs (e.g., number of children). They also arrange transportation to the chosen location.

Large scale communication campaign

To raise awareness of this new support system, AXA has launched a large-scale communication campaign (TV, national billboards, social media) designed and led by Publicis Conseil. The campaign centers around the addition of ‘three words’ to insurance policies – ‘and domestic violence’ – which will make all the difference.

A TV commercial will run for three weeks, supported by a national billboard campaign, as well as press, digital, and social media coverage.

A 2-minute educational video explaining the initiative and detailing the victim support process behind AXA’s new guarantee is released online. This video is designed not only for victims but also for their loved ones, who may use it to inform and support them.

A short documentary, directed by Marjory Dejardin in collaboration with Sarah Barukh, takes an immersive, on-the-ground approach. It follows the entire victim support process from the moment they reach out to AXA, highlighting the efforts of those working to help them.

After a launch in France, the AXA group is considering expansion into other countries.

Agathe Bousquet, President of Publicis Groupe France, said: “Victims of domestic violence are often isolated from their family and friends by their abusive partner. As a result, they may feel like they have no way out. When an insurer like AXA includes emergency rehousing in its home insurance policies and communicates about it in national media, it sends a powerful message: ‘You are not alone, solutions exist, and you can ask for help.”",https://www.adobomagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Policies-with-Three-Words-hero.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 08:00:12.586351

The production will be reinforced at the Fulda site, under its ‘Renew Danone’ initiative, wherein significant investment is planned, the company added.

Operational Challenges

The decision to close the Ochsenfurt facility follows several operational challenges.

Production volumes at the facility have not grown as expected, with current utilisation at only half the level recorded in 2019.

Changes in consumer behaviour and production costs considerably above the average of other Danone plants in Europe have further impacted the site’s economic viability.

Danone believes that these factors necessitate the closure of the plant, to offset persistent unprofitability, resulting from low utilisation and high costs.

The Fulda site, employing nearly 600 staff members and specialising in products such as infant formula and medical nutrition, will be the focus of future investment and strategy, the company added.

Support Measures

The management has committed to minimising the impact on employees and the local community.

Richard Trechman, managing director of Danone DACH, stated, “In recent years, we have grown in the German-speaking region in an extremely challenging environment and are strongly positioned for the future. I am very proud of what we have achieved as a team.”

Trechman further noted that, although the decision is regrettable, efforts will be made to reassign as many affected employees as possible to positions at the Fulda site.

Danone will introduce specific retraining and upskilling programmes and collaborate with the regional Federal Employment Agency and local companies to facilitate the transition of personnel.

For employees who cannot be re-employed within the organisation, Danone plans to negotiate a fair social plan with the Works Council, taking measures such as early retirement and pension-bridging into consideration.

Additionally, the company announced that it will engage with political stakeholders and regional partners to ensure that the closure does not have significant adverse effects on Ochsenfurt and its surrounding region.",https://trademagazin.hu/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/35853129552_00ea98df96_c-e1744280117650.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 12:27:20.903706

Leger, a Canadian market research and analytics company, has just published the results of its 28th Reputation study, which unveils the list of the country’s top reputable companies. The company surveyed over 38,000 Canadians to find their perspective on 326 companies across 30 sectors.

“Conducted annually, it is based on Leger’s exclusive model of six recognized pillars of reputation — financial success, social responsibility, honesty, transparency, quality, attachment, and innovation,” reads the statement. Companies are scored based on these factors, with 100 being the maximum a company can score.

Costco Canada and other reputable companies of 2025

According to Canadians, Google was the most reputable company in 2024 with a reputation score of 75, followed by Sony.

This year, Google (72) fell several spots after being dethroned by Costco Canada (74), while Sony retained second place (74).

Here are 2025’s most reputable companies, and their reputation scores:

Costco (74)

Sony (74)

Samsung (73)

Google (72)

Canadian Tire (71)

YouTube (71)

Interac (69)

Dollarama (68)

Home Depot (68)

Toyota (67)

Canadians’ perception of these companies fluctuates and reflects how they see the world around them, according to Lisa Covens, senior vice-president of public affairs and communications at Leger.

“In today’s marketplace, brands that understand the evolving expectations of Canadians and actively work to meet them are the ones that will earn and keep their trust,” she stated.

The Trump effect

The ranking reflects issues on Canadians’ minds, with 10 per cent saying they’re worried about housing affordability and healthcare. Concerns about inflation (21 per cent) have been surpassed by worries about tariffs, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. aggression (32 per cent).

According to Leger, the day Trump was sworn in for his second term marked “a turning point” as he announced tariffs that strained Canada-U.S. relations.

According to Leger’s list of the 10 most admired companies in Canada, several U.S. companies’ reputations have taken a hit.

McDonald’s and Starbucks lost 22 points, while Netflix lost 27 points after price hikes and growing anti-American sentiment.

Coca-Cola (-24) and Google (-16) publicly supported Trump and saw some big reputational hits.

Canadians didn’t take kindly to companies’ affiliations with Trump, as Amazon’s (-29) and Meta’s (-28) reputations have tanked. However, Tesla was the biggest loser this year, losing -42 points.

The redemption arc

Out of all the Canadians who participated in the survey, 85 per cent are proud to be Canadian. So, it’s unsurprising that rising anti-American sentiment has led Canadians to choose Canadian companies.

Here are the top 10 Canadian companies, according to participants:

Canadian Tire

Interact

Dollarama

Shoppers Drug Mart

McCain

Maple Leaf

Winners

Mark’s

A&W

Cineplex

Canadian Tire saw a steady increase of four points as its alignment with national values “continues to reinforce consumer trust.” Air Canada (+8) and Sunwing (+6) have rebounded from previous lows, but Canada Post appears to have had the most significant resurgence.

Last year’s biggest loser due to strikes and service issues, Canada Post’s reputation surged 24 points as “Canadians rallied behind homegrown brands.”

But Leger warns that top companies can’t rest on their laurels yet.

“Reputation 2025 shows that Canadians are watching closely — and acting accordingly,” reads the survey.

“In an era of political polarization, economic strain, and global uncertainty, brand perception is being shaped by more than price and performance. Companies must not only deliver value but align with consumer values.”",https://images.dailyhive.com/20250409101537/costco-canada-10.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 11:11:08.195266

WELL THEN: “President Donald Trump reversed course in the global trade war he launched just a week ago, announcing in a social media post a 90-day pause on new tariffs against every country but China,” POLITICO’s Eli Stokols, Adam Cancryn, Dasha Burns and Daniel Desrochers write. The abrupt 180 “came just hours after Trump urged the country to ‘BE COOL’ in another post that came amid continued worldwide chaos, with China and the European Union hitting back and the financial fallout spreading to bond markets.”

POLARIS SIGNS PEPSI: PepsiCo. has retained veteran competition lobbyist Bryan Cunningham of Polaris Consulting as the food and beverage giant works to refute allegations that it engaged in price discrimination against retailers. Cunningham, who has advised clients like AT&T, Microsoft, Comcast and Cigna during high-profile antitrust probes or mergers, began lobbying on “competition matters” for Pepsi at the beginning of March, according to a newly filed disclosure.

— The FTC sued Pepsi in the final days of the Biden administration under the long-dormant Robinson-Patman Act, accusing the company of charging smaller retailers more than it did for one large multinational grocery chain that news reports have identified as Walmart.

— But Trump has since booted the Democratic FTC commissioners who voted for the Pepsi suit, leaving new Republican Chair Andrew Ferguson and GOP Commissioner Melissa Holyoak — both of whom voted against bringing the complaint — as the only remaining members of the agency, presenting an opening for Pepsi, which has denied any wrongdoing, to get the case dismissed.

— Polaris is working for Pepsi as a subcontractor of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, which is representing the snack food conglomerate in the FTC case. It marks Pepsi’s second new outside lobbying hire this year as food companies face a reckoning over nutrition under new HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In January, Pepsi retained BGR Group’s Bob Wood — a former HHS chief of staff — and Steven Pfrang to lobby on issues related to the food and beverage industry.

LACIVITA JR. REGISTERS TO LOBBY: Chris LaCivita Jr., the son of former Trump co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita, has registered to lobby for the first time in the latest batch of new clients disclosed by his firm Checkmate Government Relations. The younger LaCivita joined Checkmate in December following Trump’s win and has been helping the North Carolina-based firm make the leap to D.C. and assisting clients with public affairs work.

— LaCivita Jr. is among a team working for SAS Institute Inc. on the use of data analytics “to enhance government efficiency and identify fraud, waste, and abuse,” for the research institute RTI International on health policy and funding, and for the Louisiana-based nonprofit hospital system Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady Health on issues related to access to care and the health care workforce, disclosures show.

*EYES EMOJI*: George Gresham, the head of the nation’s largest health care union 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East, “has for years used the politically influential union’s funds to benefit himself, his family and political allies,” according to a jaw-dropping nine-month investigation by POLITICO’s Maya Kaufman.

— The details of Gresham’s personal spending from the union’s coffers — which sometimes involved “bypassing the officers tasked with signing off on major expenses” and having to “request retroactive approval or pay back the union” — comes at an inflection point for the labor movement, which has come under attack by the Trump administration and is undergoing a wave of anti-incumbent sentiment.

— “Gresham and his allies say he is best positioned to take on Trump and Republicans in Congress as they pursue hawkish immigration and health care policies that could harm the union’s members and the institutions that employ them.”

— “The officers spearheading the bid to oust Gresham this spring say his effort to cling to power is one reason organized labor has faltered: leaders prioritizing their own interests over the needs of dues-paying members. And his spending, they argue, is a prime example of their grievance.”

NETFLIX CASTS AKIN LOBBYIST: “Netflix has tapped Clete Willems, a veteran D.C. trade attorney, as its chief global affairs officer,” Axios’ Sara Fischer reports. Willems has spent nearly six years at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, and before that he “served as deputy assistant for international economics to President Trump in his first term and legal adviser and chief counsel at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative during the Trump and Obama administrations.”

— “Willems will only oversee the company’s global policy strategy, not communications. Netflix was reportedly looking to combine both functions after former communications chief Rachel Whetstone and former vice president of public policy Dean Garfield departed in October. The company is still searching for someone to lead its communications efforts.”

BIDEN SBA CHIEF HANGS A SHINGLE: Former SBA Administrator Isabel Casillas Guzman is launching Avenida Advisors, an LA–based strategic advisory and consulting firm. Isabelle James, who was previously deputy chief of staff at SBA, and Katie Frost, who was head of SBA’s loan programs, will also be joining at launch.

WHO’S COMING TO DINNER: “When Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang attended a $1 million-a-head dinner at Mar-a-Lago last week, a chip known as the H20 may have been on his mind. That’s because chip industry insiders widely expected the Trump administration to impose curbs on the H20, the most cutting-edge AI chip U.S. companies can legally sell to China, a crucial market to one of the world’s most valuable companies,” per NPR’s Emily Feng and Bobby Allyn.

— But that changed following the Mar-a-Lago dinner, with the White House “revers[ing] course on H20 chips, putting the plan for additional restrictions on hold, according to two sources with knowledge of the plan who were not authorized to speak publicly.”

— “The planned American export controls on the H20 had been in the works for months, according to the two sources, and were ready to be implemented as soon as this week,” but things shifted “after Nvidia promised the Trump administration new U.S. investments in AI data centers, according to one of the sources.”

WALL STREET’S WORRIES: “Last week, bank CEOs including JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon, Goldman Sachs’ David Solomon, Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan and Wells Fargo’s Charlie Scharf were in Washington for an industry meeting when the matter of communications with the White House came up,” The Wall Street Journal’s AnnaMaria Andriotis, Gina Heeb and Alexander Saeedy write.

— “Executives in the room took turns saying when they last spoke to President Trump. The general response: not recently. Many of them said they hadn’t had a substantive discussion with Trump since the pandemic hammered markets in 2020, according to people familiar with the meeting.”

— “While some bankers have been talking to administration officials during the tariff-driven turbulence of the past week, including Vice President JD Vance and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, top executives sense their opinions don’t carry much weight with the president,” breaking from past financial crises like the pandemic or 2008 financial implosion.

— Today’s tariff pause likely notwithstanding, “bankers are uncertain about Trump’s endgame on tariffs, and uneasy about the impact on the global economy as well as their own businesses. A Wall Street that had been excited for Trump, and the unleashing of animal spirits in markets, is now deflated.”

LABOLT RETURNS TO LEAD BPI: Ben LaBolt is returning to progressive public affairs and consulting firm Bully Pulpit International as its new president. LaBolt, who joined what was then known as Bully Pulpit Interactive in 2016, when it acquired the LaBolt-co-founded Incite Agency, returns to the fold after spending the previous two years as communications director and senior adviser to former President Joe Biden. BPI co-founder Andrew Bleeker will become the firm’s CEO.

SPOTTED on Tuesday at the Consumer Technology Association’s 20th annual Digital Patriots Dinner, per a tipster: Reps. Don Beyer (D-Va.) and Bill Foster (D-Ill.), former FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson, Kinsey Fabrizio, Gary Shapiro, Tiffany Moore, Michael Petricone and Ed Brzytwa of CTA; Deena Ghazarian of Austere, Gretchen Littlefield of Moore, Jessica Nigro of Lucid and Steve Downer of Amazon.

— And on Tuesday at a reception hosted by the Vinyl Institute following its annual fly-in, per a tipster: Reps. Vicente Gonzales (D-Texas) and Rick Larsen (D-Wash.), Dave Natonski of Sen. Markwayne Mullin’s (R-Okla.) office, Ivan Zapien of Hogan Lovells, Jeff More of Capitol Solutions, Mandy Gunasekara of Section VII Capital and Ned Monroe and Kevin Koonce of the Vinyl Institute.

As previously reported, Starbucks’ slipping sales last year contrast sharply with Dutch Bros’ continued growth.
As a result, the largest players — Starbucks and Dunkin’ — saw their combined share dip from 85.9% in 2019 to 77.9% in 2024.
This is all part of an overall coffee boom in the post-pandemic years following a period when most people made their coffee at home.
This could be the result of the largest coffee chains growing rapidly outside of their initial coastal, urban-heavy store concentrations.","The coffee category is more competitive than ever. As trendy drive-thru chains like Dutch Bros and 7 Brew gain momentum, and newer emerging brands chip away at market share, Starbucks and Dunkin’s longtime reign at the top faces fresh challenges.

As previously reported, Starbucks’ slipping sales last year contrast sharply with Dutch Bros’ continued growth. New data from Placer.ai highlights this trend: Over the past five years, small coffee chains grew their traffic share from 3.2% to 4.4%, and mid-sized chains jumped from 10.8% to 17.6%. As a result, the largest players — Starbucks and Dunkin’ — saw their combined share dip from 85.9% in 2019 to 77.9% in 2024. While they still dominate, customers clearly are exploring alternatives beyond the most ubiquitous.

These gains have consequently resulted in traffic shares of the largest chains (Starbucks and Dunkin’) declining slightly from 85.9% to 77.9% since 2019, which is still a sizable industry lead, though many customers are clearly seeking more diverse coffee options than the biggest names.

This is all part of an overall coffee boom in the post-pandemic years following a period when most people made their coffee at home.

“The coffee segment has seen consistent visit growth over the past few years, demonstrating remarkable resilience – a trend fueled by steady consumer demand,” Placer.ai’s report said.

Placer.ai’s report also noted that the Midwest and South have particularly shown “heightened interest” in coffee. This could be the result of the largest coffee chains growing rapidly outside of their initial coastal, urban-heavy store concentrations. These areas are also the epicenter of growth for drive-thru chains like 7 Brew and Dutch Bros, the latter of which has not expanded to the Northeast region at all despite its rapidly growing popularity in other locales.

Visitor behavior to coffee shops is also evolving, with two very clearly separate occasions emerging: the quick drive-thru or mobile order pickup, and the longer café visit. According to Placer.ai, short visits of less than 10 minutes increased at larger and mid-sized chains over the past year, while smaller chains saw a larger increase of longer visits than shorter ones.

These behavior patterns could change as Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol looks to bring back Starbucks’ role as a third-place café, rather than just a quick stop after ordering on the app.

“These shifts highlight the different needs that coffee shops can fill within a community, with some offering speed and convenience, while others can meet the desire for a relaxed and personalized coffee experience,” the report stated.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltea7aee2fca050a19/blt827ee069cd4b2fa8/67f698ff5538ca8438188ceb/Starbucks-AI-earnings-call.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-04-10 09:09:58.685155

Moreover, Barclays has allocated an additional £7.5million specifically for those affected by the outage that started at the end of January and extended into early February.","Barclays is offering financial compensation to select customers as a token of goodwill following a significant technical glitch earlier this year - and sending out letters to all those impacted.

The banking giant has initiated the reimbursement process for some users to make amends for troubles experienced during the service disruption in January.

A substantial portion of these repayments are expected to be completed very soon, yet more intricate cases may encounter delays. Those eligible for the refund will see a distinctive entry in their mobile app payment history labelled ""Barclays UK Refu"", accompanied by the refund sum.

The bank has dispatched letters through the mail outlining the compensation amounts sent to those entitled to it, with some customers likely to notice money in their bank accounts even before receiving the correspondence, potentially catching them off guard. The sum of the refunds varies among clients based on the degree to which they were affected by the system downtime.

This update comes after numerous Barclays patrons reported their bemusement on social media platform X upon noticing unanticipated deposits in their bank statements; a few fortunate individuals have reportedly pocketed as much as £600.

Social media buzzed with intrigue, as one customer tweeted: ""Did anyone else randomly receive 50 pounds from Barclays?"" and another posted in surprise: ""Barclays just refunded me £600? ? I don't know what's going on down there but I will be taking that money.""

A perplexed user took to the internet asking: ""Does anyone have any idea why Barclays would send me a payment for £50?"" while another equally baffled person inquired: ""Why did Barclays just give me money?"".

The technical glitch at Barclays that began in late January affected thousands, coinciding with payday for numerous customers. The disruption spanned several days, leaving many unable to access their online banking or make transactions.

The timing was particularly unfortunate as January 31 marks the deadline for submitting self-assessment tax returns and settling dues with HMRC, resulting in significant inconvenience.

In response to the disruption, Barclays announced its intention to proactively contact those impacted to offer compensation, with the amount varying based on the extent and duration of the impact experienced by each customer.

Barclays disclosed plans last month to compensate customers who suffered from outages since January 2023, according to a letter sent to MPs. Vim Maru, the CEO of Barclays UK, stated in the correspondence released by the Treasury Committee: ""We acknowledge that through no fault of their own, some of our customers and clients may have suffered loss or distress and inconvenience.""

The bank has set aside approximately £5million to cover compensations for outages spanning from January 2023 to the present year.

We assume pharmaceutical tariffs are enacted but do not last after 2026 due to political pressure from midterm elections.

Why it matters: The biopharma industry has largely been exempt from tariffs (except for 20% tariffs on imports to the US from China, implemented in March). The industry continues to brace for a potential pharma-specific announcement, which could have implications for global manufacturing strategies.

The rumored 25% tariff could be applied to products manufactured in Europe and imported into the US. While there might be some flexibility to move toward a more domestic manufacturing strategy, avoiding tariffs completely would require new facilities that take several years to build.

Both US and Europe-based firms have significant European manufacturing exposure due to tax advantages (US firms), home country manufacturing (Europe firms), and other reasons, including lower production costs and lower exposure to currency fluctuations.

The bottom line: We are not changing our biopharma uncertainty ratings or fair value estimates, as we think the direct impact from tariffs on earnings is likely to be limited in scope. Moreover, the indirect impact from a potential recession should also be limited given the noncyclical nature of drug spending.

We assume pharmaceutical tariffs are enacted but do not last after 2026 due to political pressure from midterm elections. In this scenario, we think biopharma is unlikely to wholesale rethink its manufacturing footprint, apart from incremental US capacity additions.

Using a non-GAAP industry average margin analysis of the short-run tariff impact, a 25% tariff would only amount to a 2-percentage-point operating margin headwind in the worst case, or a 6% headwind to operating profits, using an industry average 32% operating profit margin.

Healthcare Stocks as a Safe Haven

Big picture, we think investors are likely to weigh the safe-haven nature of healthcare against the threat of potential US policy changes like international reference pricing. The healthcare sector tends to see relatively minimal impact to growth rates and margins during a recession because of the inelastic nature of healthcare demand. That being said, in a prolonged recession, less funding for biotech could put pressure on industry productivity. We continue to see a low probability of a broad US price reset to international levels, which would require the endorsement of a Republican-controlled Congress that does not support price controls.

With industry gross margins generally around 85% after excluding profit-sharing agreements and roughly 55% of industry sales stemming from US-branded drug sales, we think a reasonable maximum target for a tariff would be the 50% of manufacturing costs, or 7.5% of global sales, that are destined for the US market. In reality, this number is likely even lower because of depreciation costs embedded in the cost of sales line, significant US manufacturing footprints for many firms, and the higher-margin nature of US-branded drug sales (making them a lower percentage of manufacturing costs than the revenue split would imply). But if we apply a 25% tariff to 7.5% of sales, this yields less than a 2-percentage point hit to gross margins and operating margins.

This analysis also does not consider the ability of wide-moat biopharma firms to pass on their cost increases in the form of higher prices; we think many higher-priced differentiated products could support this strategy to help counter any tariff pressure.

Regardless of whether tariffs take hold for a significant time span, we think the roughly 15% tax rates enjoyed by many US biopharma firms could begin to inch up closer to the 21% US corporate tax rate over time, as tax advantages from international manufacturing could be removed. We already have tax rates increasing over time in most of our models, and we don’t expect any significant fair value estimate changes as we further update our models",https://morningstar-morningstar-prod.web.arc-cdn.net/resizer/ZypG0E5aXd4Plzu9dqAmZhA8CW0=/2401x1351/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/FNALQZSVJJCFFHS5VS7QPQ2HSA.png,N,,2025-04-10 07:59:59.634429

ID6,Barclays,2025-04-10 08:47:21+00:00,eFinancialCareers,Barclays' habit of hiring-not promoting top bankers continues - eFinancialCareers,Daniel Davies,,,,,https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/andrew-woeber-barclays,"Investment bankers have always known the wisdom of the old Hollywood proverb attributed to Sam Goldwyn – “we’re overpaying him, but he’s worth it”.
If you want a strong M&A franchise, you need strong talent.
Barclays, accordingly, seems to have come to the conclusion that it needed Andrew Woeber, its new global head of M&A, whose arrival was announced yesterday.

This seems to have left Barclays without a strong bench to promote from.","Investment bankers have always known the wisdom of the old Hollywood proverb attributed to Sam Goldwyn – “we’re overpaying him, but he’s worth it”. If you want a strong M&A franchise, you need strong talent. Barclays, accordingly, seems to have come to the conclusion that it needed Andrew Woeber, its new global head of M&A, whose arrival was announced yesterday.

Woeber had been chilling out for a few years. He was once a partner at boutique firm Centerview, but left there in 2022. He represents the latest in a line of senior bankers that Barclays has hired-in, instead of promoted-up.

The problem seems to be Barclays' banker pipeline. Less than five years ago, Barclays was still engaged in a battle with activist investors over whether it ought to have an investment bank at all. A lot of senior bankers subsequently left in 2023 during a bout of internal politics surrounding the appointment of Cathal Deasy from Credit Suisse to the position of co-head of global banking. The kind of person that Barclays would have wanted to be the successor to Ihsan Essaid, its previous global head of M&A, who left in May 2024, would be exactly the sort of person who would not have been likely to hang around during that time.

This seems to have left Barclays without a strong bench to promote from. The bank's head of EMEA M&A is Stephen Pick, who is in his late 30s, was hired from Credit Suisse in 2023 and is probably still too green for a global role. Dan Grabos has more years in the industry, but was only promoted to head of Americas M&A in 2023 and hasn’t given up his co-headship of global Industrials M&A. There are a few “Chairman” figures like Larry Hamdan, but there’s nobody obviously able to step up into managing the franchise globally.

Obviously, the best way to avoid paying up to hire people externally is to develop them internally. But that’s much easier said than done. In order to have a solid internal candidate for a job like global head of M&A, you need to have had a level of stable career development and low turnover of personnel that’s rarely seen outside the bulge bracket.

Banking shares this characteristic with professional football – a winning team can either be built by consistency over more than a decade, or by having very deep pockets. Heads of investment banking Cathal Deasy and Taylor Wright were put into their jobs with an ambitious mandate to help Barclays climb up the league tables, but with limited resources to do so. So they’ve been left trying to spend their budgets wisely and to pick up undervalued talent.

The danger, though, is that a Citi-style phenomenon emerges, where incumbents are vying for top roles only to be displaced by an outsider. That's not good for morale, but as at Citi it seems to happen a lot at Barclays - just ask Deasy himself.

Elsewhere, although the virtues of having a trading business have become very apparent in 2025, the industry still suffers from the problem that the fixed cost investments are huge, and get bigger every year, while the revenues tend to be concentrated on the top two or three players. This means it’s very difficult to be a second-tier player, particularly in fixed income trading.

Citadel Securities is now offering some of them a way out. If you install some software from a third-party provider called TransFICC, then you can effectively outsource your trading desk, letting your clients place their orders as normal, and then sending them on in anonymized form to Citadel for execution. It’s not dissimilar to the standard model for equity market making, and in principle it allows the banks to concentrate on client relationships while offering better pricing and global capabilities. But anyone employed in the trading business is likely to see it as the beginning of the end. Citadel Securities is focused on a few markets above others - 'US Treasuries, dollar, euro and sterling interest-rate swaps and US investment-grade corporate bonds.' Traders at second tier banks in these markets may want to watch out.

Moving to T+1 in the United States and Canada in May 2024 introduced a new paradigm which is challenging Europe to adapt to the evolution of the global post-trade landscape.

The implications are wide and wide - ranging for different kinds of actors, from market participants to liquidity providers, and to financial infrastructure players.

Challenges and impacts for Europe

In the Old Continent, a fundamental step in the transition to a T+1 settlement cycle concerns the accelerated adoption of messaging standards and their contents, which will improve harmonized communication between central securities depositories, custodian and market participants. However, there are many challenges that need to be addressed in this sentence.

One of the objectives of the T+1 migration is, in fact, a significant reduction in the post-trade processing window, which will make handling real-time exceptions and automated reconciliation a fundamental priority. The instructions for the confirmation, allocation and settlement of the negotiations will now have to be completed in a few hours, rather than in a one-day period, leaving players with a minimum time to resolve discrepancies. For market participants, the need to adapt to this accelerated timetable is a challenging and significant aspect, both for IT enhancement costs and more generally for post-trade processes.

What needs to change

For now, the allocation and confirmation of negotiations are semi-automated for most of the players. This dependence on manual intervention introduces inefficiencies due to human error or mismatch in the ""data enrichment"" systems related to settlement instructions resulting in settlement delays.

The transition to T+1 will generate significant impacts on securities lending and repo market, forcing participants to adjust operational flows, collateralisation strategies and liquidity management.

In a T+1 context, multi-listed financial instruments are additional challenges in managing positions, especially for market makers. Non-timely adjustments between different places of settlement increase fail rates by requiring real-time positions and increased reliance on securities lending. In this sense, better access to centralised guarantee pools or repurchase agreements will be central to market makers to efficiently manage their liquidity exposure.

Prepare for change

It should become clear, the T+1 transaction requires multiple implementations to market players. These include the complete automation of operations flows; the adoption of tools for real-time position updates and automatic call time arrangements for securities lending; the development of intraday liquidity pools; the introduction of automatic position realignment mechanisms; the adoption of standardised and synchronised sealed keeping protocols for multi-listed parties including MIC code and place of settlement (PSET). Optimising operational processes, strengthening IT infrastructure, managing their risks and synergies between market players will therefore be crucial to ensure an efficient T+1 switch in Europe.

Group adjusted profit also increased at actual rates by 10.6 percent, amounting to 3.13 million pounds over the period, with retail contributing 2.97 million pounds, at an increase of 7.7 percent on the year prior.

Profit for the year after tax increased 36.7 percent to 1.63 million pounds.

Outlook to provide flexibility as market competitiveness heats up

Tesco said its various investments in the last four years have helped it to strengthen its competitive position and its financial and trading momentum, with it delivering “well against the multi-year performance framework we set out in 2021”. However, noting that there had been a “further increase in the competitive intensity of the UK market”, the company is looking into opportunities to protect its current positioning.

Its guidance for the FY25/26, therefore, “gives us flexibility and firepower to be able to respond to current market conditions”. Group adjusted profit for the period is anticipated to be between 2.7 to 3.0 billion pounds, with a free cash flow within the medium-term guidance range of 1.4 to 1.8 billion pounds.

In the report, chief executive, Ken Murphy, said the company was “making significant progress on our long-term growth opportunities, further enhancing our digital capabilities with increased personalisation, further improvements to our online experience and an expanded retail media offering”.

He added: “Building on our strong financial performance, robust balance sheet and positive momentum, we are setting ourselves up for the year ahead with the flexibility to continue to win in a highly competitive market. Despite inflationary headwinds, we are committed to ensuring customers get the best possible value by shopping at Tesco, and see further opportunities to strengthen our competitiveness.”",https://r.fashionunited.com/kj_wjcYm0-_0T_9e2Li7dlBI5DCMipJjB4ukP9el3vM/resize:fit:1200:630:0/gravity:ce/quality:70/aHR0cHM6Ly9mYXNoaW9udW5pdGVkLmNvbS9pbWcvdXBsb2FkLzIwMjMvMDQvMTMvdGVzY28tNmwyZmVocGEtMjAyMy0wNC0xMy5qcGVn.jpeg,N,,2025-04-10 07:03:30.776053

Who is Peter Schiff?","Economist Peter Schiff has predicted that Nike will not establish U.S. factories to produce sneakers due to high tariffs.

Schiff argues that 40% tariffs make domestic production economically unviable, according to Inquisitr News. Instead of absorbing these costs, Nike could redirect its products to international markets.

""The comments come as Nike shares plummeted 14.44% on Thursday after President Donald Trump announced sweeping reciprocal tariffs affecting the company’s supply chain,"" Inquisitr News wrote. ""Vietnam, where Nike produces over half of its footwear, will see a 46% tariff increase.""

Has Nike ditched the U.S.?

No, this is just a prediction.

Trump's tariff plan

President Donald Trump declared a national emergency due to large U.S. good trade deficits. To address this, a 10% tariff was imposed on all countries, effective April 5, 2025.

Additionally, countries with the largest trade deficits will face even higher, individualized tariffs, starting April 9, 2025.

Trump said: ""Over the decades, they ripped us off like no country has never been ripped off in history and we're going to be much nicer than they were to us, but it's substantial money for the country,"" he told reporters.

These tariffs will remain in place until the trade deficit issue is resolved, Trump claimed. The plan uses the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) for authority.

Who is Peter Schiff?

Schiff, co-founder of Echelon Wealth Partners in Canada, is an American stockbroker, radio personality, and financial commentator.

According to Fox Business, ""He is a widely followed opponent of debt-fueled growth policies and known for his advocacy for emerging market and commodity-focused investments in countries with positive fiscal characteristics.""

With a career built at the intersection of technology, strategy, and customer experience, she is known for her visionary leadership in driving digital transformation and growth. Throughout her journey, she has championed inclusive leadership, empowered high-performing teams, and led large-scale transformations across multiple industries.

Prior to Capgemini, Lucimary was Regional Vice President at Salesforce for over 4 years, Director of Innovation and Pre-Sales at Oracle for over 5 years, Head of Marketing at Suzano Pulp and Paper, and worked for many years at Deloitte leading transformational technology projects. Lucimary is also an advisory member of 3 companies and a mentor for women entrepreneurs, as well as a Professor at Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV). She is completing her Chief Revenue Officer Program at Wharton University in June 2025.

Recently, in an exclusive interview with Digital First Magazine, Lucimary shared insights on the concept of Transformational Hypothesis and how to apply it to different industries, the secret mantra behind her success, personal hobbies and interests, future plans, words of wisdom, and much more. The following excerpts are taken from the interview.

What drives your passion for digital transformation and customer experience?

I’m passionate about digital transformation because I believe in the power of technology to truly elevate the human experience. It’s not just about innovation—it’s about inclusion, accessibility, and impact. Every transformation is an opportunity to create something better: more seamless, more meaningful, and more connected. What drives me is the ability to shape the future while solving real problems today.

When technology is used strategically, it can go beyond creating seamless experiences — it can unlock new revenue streams and generate lasting value. It’s inspiring to witness digital journeys that are not only efficient but also emotionally engaging and purpose-driven.

What do you love the most about your current role?

What I love most is the opportunity to drive impact both externally and internally. I have the privilege of influencing our clients’ strategic growth while also empowering the incredible teams I work with every day. I get to work with diverse industries, talented people, and complex challenges that require constant innovation. It’s a role that balances analytical thinking with creativity — and that keeps me inspired every day. I can help our clients unlock new growth paths through digital innovation. It’s a space where curiosity meets impact — every day brings a new challenge, a new possibility, and a new way to grow.

Can you elaborate on your concept of “Transformational Hypothesis” and how you apply it to different industries?

The Transformational Hypothesis is the belief that every business challenge holds the seeds of transformation—if we ask the right questions. It’s a framework I use to reimagine outcomes, not just processes. Across industries, I help clients shift from incremental improvements to bold, hypothesis-driven change that integrates technology, data, and design to drive revenue growth, operational excellence, and market differentiation.

What role do you think AI and automation will play in shaping the future of customer experience?

AI and automation are rewriting the rules of customer experience. They’re not just making things faster—they’re making them smarter, more personal, and more intuitive. But the future belongs to those who use these tools to humanize experiences, not just digitize them. Empathy and ethics will be just as important as algorithms. Executives must think beyond efficiency to strategic orchestration—how these technologies can unlock new business models and elevate brand trust.

Congratulations on being recognized as one of the Top 25 Women Leaders in Consulting for 2025. Our readers would love to know the secret mantra behind your success.

Thank you! If I had to choose one mantra, it would be: Lead with vision, act with heart. My journey has been guided by a deep sense of purpose, a relentless desire to learn, and the courage to take risks. I’ve been fortunate to work with inspiring people and to build bridges between ambition and impact. Success, to me, is about lifting others as you rise.

How do you stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in your field?

I stay curious. I read, I listen, I ask questions. I learn from my clients, from my teams, from startups, and from the next generation. I believe the future is a dialogue, not a download—and staying relevant means staying in conversation with the world around you.

I also make time for deep dives into industry reports, thought leadership, and research papers. Peer networks, mentoring circles, and executive events keep me grounded in what others are doing and learning. And perhaps most importantly, I pay close attention to what clients are asking for—their challenges often signal where innovation is needed next.

Is there a particular person you are grateful for who helped get you to where you are?

Yes — many, in fact. I’m especially grateful to my family, the leaders I’ve worked with, and the incredible teams I’ve had the privilege to lead and learn from. In today’s complex environments, nothing meaningful is achieved alone. Throughout my career, I’ve been fortunate to have many allies and mentors who stood out by challenging me to believe in my voice and to lead boldly, even when I felt like the outsider in the room. Their belief in me taught me how to believe in myself. I carry that lesson with me and do my best to pay it forward to others who are still discovering the strength of their own leadership.

What are some of your passions outside of work? What do you like to do in your time off?

My son!!! I enjoy spending time with my family! I love to travel, explore different cultures, and dive into books that challenge how I see the world. I also mentor women in tech and consulting — it’s something I’m deeply passionate about. Outside of the boardroom, I find joy in meaningful conversations, beautiful places, and the kind of quiet that lets ideas grow.

How do you approach leadership and team management, and what qualities do you believe are essential for effective leadership?

To me, leadership is about creating space — space for people to grow, to speak up, to thrive. I lead with trust, clarity, and empathy. Great leaders don’t have all the answers; they ask the right questions and empower others to lead with them. The best teams I’ve worked with are built on authenticity, collaboration, and shared purpose. Empathy, adaptability, and strategic clarity are, in my view, the essential ingredients of great leadership today.

What is your biggest goal? Where do you see yourself 5 years from now?

My biggest goal is to keep expanding the impact I can make — on businesses, on people, and on the future of inclusive leadership. In five years, I hope to be influencing global strategy at scale, shaping the next wave of sustainable and human-centered innovation, and continuing to build spaces where diverse talent can thrive.

What advice would you give to companies looking to leverage digital channels to expand their customer base?

Start with listening. Digital transformation is not about channels — it’s about connection. Understand who your customers are, what they value, and how you can serve them in ways that are personal, relevant, and responsible. The most successful companies are those that combine technological ambition with a deep sense of human insight and care. And most importantly — stay agile, because the customer is evolving faster than ever.

During his nomination hearing to become NASA’s new administrator, he announced plans to continue the Artemis lunar program. However, he also noted the importance of the Martian mission. This position immediately caused controversy because of its conflict with the views of Elon Musk, who insists on abandoning the Moon altogether in favor of a “jump” to the Red Planet.

Between the Moon and Mars

Isaacman, who previously funded the private space mission Inspiration4, emphasized that returning to the Moon was an integral step to prepare for a mission to Mars. “We can discover scientific, economic and national advantages along the way,” he said. The symbolic support was a visit from the Artemis II crew, which is preparing to orbit the Moon in 2026.

However, his words contradict the position of Elon Musk. The SpaceX CEO called NASA’s plans to return to the Moon a “distraction” earlier this year, and called for “flying straight to Mars”. Musk also criticized the program for being “inefficient,” noting that it is designed to support jobs, not results.

Congress is opposed to change

However, lawmakers have sharply rejected the idea of closing Artemis. Senator Ted Cruz warned that abandoning the Moon would make it a “gift” to China, which would be a disaster for national interests. In addition, the program has already absorbed more than $40 billion, and its cancellation threatens to lose investment in the development of the SLS system, a heavy-lift launch vehicle.

“Why did it take so much time and money?” – Isaacman questioned. But added that Artemis remained a priority. At the same time, he assured that NASA was capable of combining lunar missions with preparations for Mars: “It shouldn’t be an either-or choice.”

Balance between NASA and SpaceX

US President Donald Trump has nominated Isaacs to head NASA. On the night of April 10, congressional hearings were held to confirm the new head. Electing a billionaire to this important position is a highly unusual decision, as the position is usually filled by former politicians or people who have more traditional spaceflight experience.

The future head’s main dilemma is to retain the confidence of Congress without quarreling with Musk, whose Falcon and Starship rockets are critical to the agency. But it’s already noticeable that Isaacman is taking the agency’s side, because he understands its importance to the United States. However, the billionaire is trying to restrain Elon Musk, who is trying to influence NASA in every way possible.

“SpaceX are the contractors, NASA is the customer. They work for us, not the other way around,” was the response of the future head of the space agency during a congressional hearing.

It’s not yet clear how Musk will respond to Artemis’ support. But if Isaacman doesn’t find a compromise, NASA risks losing both its lunar ambitions and its Martian dream. Will the billionaire astronaut succeed in becoming a bridge between two worlds? The answer will emerge in the coming years.

How Will Trump's Tariffs Impact Budget Laptop Prices?
On a $500 budget laptop, that's a $225 price increase, pushing a once-affordable laptop to a much less affordable $725.
Most budget laptops have a slim profit margin to begin with, often 10% or less.
If inexpensive Chromebooks stop being profitable and easily accessible, what we think of as the ""budget laptop"" category becomes a ghost town.","President Donald Trump's recent wave of tariffs on, well, pretty much everything is poised to hit the computing world hard. The sweeping new trade policy aims to raise revenue and revive American manufacturing while correcting perceived trade imbalances. However, one near-certain side effect? Thousands of products will increase in price as businesses look to offset costs.

Since I review these products daily, I wondered, ""What does this mean for laptops?""

The impact of Trump's tariffs is already visible in the US. Companies like Framework and Razer have already paused new laptop orders, and others, like Acer, planned price hikes weeks before the most significant tariffs landed. (And, given the evolving tariff landscape, as I write this, the scale of ""significant,"" and who is affected and when, is changing almost by the hour.) To understand the complexities of this situation and what it truly means for consumers, I spoke with supply chain expert Joe Hudicka. Below, I'll break down the potential consequences of these tariffs on laptop prices and availability, particularly for budget-conscious shoppers.

No PC Component Spared: New Taxes on Everything

As imported goods face extra taxes in the form of tariff levies, the cost for a manufacturer to import a given item increases. And that cost must be borne up front when the goods hit US shores.

This is an especially big deal for products from China, given the current lay of the tariff land. Imports from China will be subject to drastically increased tariffs on all goods. (On April 9, that was a sky-high 104%, which, as I hit publish, was just pushed to 125%. Tune in tomorrow...) China is the assembly point for most laptops (not to mention many other classes of tech products), as well as a major source for the components that go into them.

According to the Consumer Technology Association trade group, China accounted for an estimated 79% of total US imports of laptops and tablets in 2023. Laptop makers, by extension, will be pressed to pass on that increase to US consumers by raising prices. Also at this writing, a wave of 10% reciprocal US tariffs on other nations, excepting China, was paused for 90 days. So this remains very much an evolving situation.

Electronics-producing nations like China and Taiwan are especially exposed to these tariffs—both at the moment and long-term, if they stick—because they make more than just semiconductor chips. Passive components (like capacitors and resistors), printed circuit boards, display panels, and batteries, as well as more complex components, like Wi-Fi modules, are all mass-produced in China and Taiwan, with supplies and assembled parts flowing back and forth between the two countries. Even if, at some point in the future, the final assembly of laptops were to occur in the US, most components would still need to be imported from China or other Asian countries. And the tariffs of the moment would apply to these bits if imported separately, regardless of where assembly occurs.

The new tariff regime is poised to significantly hurt companies that rely on major Chinese manufacturing and assembly hubs like Shenzhen and Guangdong. Numerous smaller, lesser-known companies, such as Inventec, Ju Teng, and Pegatron, exist entirely within that electronics-manufacturing supply chain. Pressures on those firms likely would have a knock-on effect that might spread beyond just US imports, as these suppliers could feel pressure on their businesses from downstream due to, say, lesser demand by US consumers.

Even nations like Japan and South Korea, which make laptops and weren't initially targeted with the highest tariff rates, are still subject to sweeping 10% tariffs for all trade partners, though the date of implementation was in flux as I wrote this. Plus, these companies rely on supply chains in China and Taiwan for some laptop parts. How that may play into the rates their wares are subject to when entering the US is an open question. With every major brand sourcing parts and assembly there, it's hard to think of a corner of the laptop industry that won't be affected.

How Will Trump's Tariffs Impact Budget Laptop Prices? Budget Buyers Will Be Hardest Hit, Experts Say

It's hard to estimate precisely how much those prices will change, since the situation remains very dynamic. Still, supply chain expert Joe Hudicka tells me, ""Tariffs tend to increase the price of imported goods, which directly affects the affordability of budget electronics, including laptops.""

With the actual numbers in flux, one conclusion is pretty much guaranteed: They'll all be more expensive to make and buy.

Two things will likely happen as the new tariffs take hold. First, I expect prices to rise on all new laptops, as well as on incoming shipments of in-market models. Components and assembly may make up only a portion of the cost of a laptop, alongside software and licensing, marketing, and research and development. Still, if those costs are met with additional taxes at the point of import, expect that cost to pass to the consumer. Some companies may eat part of the rise. But rates in the 100% range, if they stick, are impossible for any company to simply absorb.

Acer has already announced a 10% US price hike, and other manufacturers will likely follow suit. Earlier this year, the Consumer Technology Association estimated that laptop prices could rise as much as 45% in a January forecast report titled ""How the Proposed Trump Tariffs Increase Prices for Consumer Technology Products."" On a $500 budget laptop, that's a $225 price increase, pushing a once-affordable laptop to a much less affordable $725. And mind you: These estimates were made based on an expected 10% tariff on China, not the escalating tit-for-tat fight that's currently going on with an extra zero tacked on that.

Second, I expect many of the most affordable models to disappear entirely as the tight profit margins on budget laptops disappear. It's not strictly a maker of budget laptops, but we've already seen upgradable-laptop pioneer Framework pausing sales of some base models of its Framework 13 laptops, citing tariffs on Taiwan that would make selling the entry-level models at a profit impossible.

Most budget laptops have a slim profit margin to begin with, often 10% or less. As tariffs increase the costs of manufacturing these budget machines, many sub-$600 models may not get sold anymore as makers shift to more profitable midrange and premium ones.

According to Hudicka, affordable systems and budget shoppers may take the biggest hit. ""In this space, buyers generally fall into two groups: those who prefer to buy affordable devices, and those who rely on low-cost options because they can’t afford anything else.""

He continues, ""Some consumers in the first group might decide to stretch their budgets and opt for more expensive models since the price gap has narrowed. However, the bigger concern lies with the second group—those who simply don’t have the financial flexibility. They risk being priced out of the market entirely, losing access to essential technology for school, work, or communication.""

This, indeed, is poised to hurt the most budget-friendly subcategory of laptops: Chromebooks. These lightweight systems frequently sell for less than $500, and they effect that savings by using Google's ChromeOS instead of Windows, sidestepping the licensing expenses associated with Microsoft's familiar operating system. The most affordable machines today are almost all Chromebooks, whether you're looking at traditional clamshell designs or 2-in-1 models. If inexpensive Chromebooks stop being profitable and easily accessible, what we think of as the ""budget laptop"" category becomes a ghost town.

What Are Laptop Makers Doing About the Tariffs?

The positive news (what little there is, at the moment) is that many of the biggest laptop manufacturers have been working for months and years to diversify their manufacturing and assembly operations, shifting more of the supply chain out of China. But that doesn't happen fast.

(Credit: Brian Westover)

HP, for example, has started moving out of China, assembling consumer laptops in Thailand and commercial laptops in Mexico, despite manufacturing the bulk of its laptops in Chongqing, China. With a new laptop production line opening in Vietnam (a country also being slammed by high tariffs, in the current scheme of things), HP plans to move 90% of production out of China this year.

Dell has major laptop and desktop assembly hubs in Xiamen and Chengdu, China, but it also has dedicated sites in Malaysia, India, Vietnam, and Poland. PC giant Lenovo, which has headquarters in Beijing, China, and Morrisville, N.C., manufactures all over Asia, including India, as well as in Mexico and Brazil. The company recently broke ground on a new manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia, too.

(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)

Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang commented on a recent earnings call, ""Our innovation investment and resilient global operations put us in a good position to achieve sustained and profitable growth in the future.""

But smaller laptop makers might have to take a different approach. Short of moving manufacturing, some companies are pausing entire product lines, taking a wait-and-see approach to the tariff turmoil. Razer has recently stopped accepting new laptop orders from its direct-sales site, even delaying the hotly anticipated Razer Blade 16 launch. MSI's online store has also hit the brakes on new laptop orders, now offering only a ""Notify me"" option.

(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)

In a recent tweet from Framework, which (as mentioned earlier) recently suspended sales of its most affordable laptop models, the company suggests that ""Other consumer goods makers have performed the same calculations and taken the same actions, though most have not been open about it.""

What Can You Do to Get the Best Price on the Right Laptop?

If prices are set to rise and low-cost laptops threaten to evaporate from US store shelves, what exactly are laptop shoppers on tight budgets supposed to do? Thankfully, most of our best tips for laptop savings still hold true.

Buy now while pre-tariff inventory is available

Given that these tariffs are just now landing, you'll find a lot of laptops currently on store shelves without any tariff-driven price increases. Equipment already in the US is still selling at regular prices, but you'll need to move fast. Manufacturers are already starting to raise prices and are rethinking their supply lines. And if you look for models from our top 100 budget buys or the best cheap laptops, you're bound to find some great bargains...if you don't wait too long.

Watch for sales and discounts

Significant sales events like Back-to-School and Black Friday will continue to be ideal times to score steeply discounted products, and those sales prices will get even more attractive as prices creep up. We cover all of the major sales in our usual tech deals coverage, so keep an eye out. We'll continue to highlight great values and bargain buys throughout the year.

That might help you score a relative bargain on a new system, but also watch for those slightly older models. If you can find a decent system about a year old, the savings might make it a smart buy, even if you forgo the latest features.

Buy used or refurbished

If new laptops are getting more expensive, then it stands to reason that not-so-new laptops will also be a smart way to go. I've talked about buying refurbished laptops in the past, but here's the short version: Buy from either the brand itself or from a major retailer like Best Buy that backs the machine. This move can provide confidence that the refurbished product is decent and that you have a warranty to rely on when things aren't working. Refurbished business laptops can be especially good deals, thanks to their generally higher build quality.

Upgrade, repurpose, and recycle

If a whole laptop is too pricey, consider upgrading what you already have. A new SSD or additional memory can do wonders for a system that has started feeling sluggish, and owners can easily service many laptops with just a screwdriver and a new drive or RAM module. A new battery is also a quick way to give your old laptop a new lease on life.

Additionally, if your Windows laptop is getting old, you might find that switching it to ChromeOS using ChromeOS Flex can turn it into a peppy browsing laptop.",https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/05n5IEpbHiyvKSW9nT2H7in-6.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1744220168.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 06:05:46.684722

Michelin will report first-quarter results on April 24.","(Reuters) - Michelin expects its first-quarter sales to be slightly below market consensus due to steeper than expected seasonality in the first half of 2025, according to the transcript of an investor call held late on Wednesday.

The French tyre maker said that U.S.-imposed tariffs would add to volatility in the market, but its local-to-local strategy would prove valuable in dealing with them.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

Michelin employs more than 23,500 people in its production sites across the U.S. and Canada. It has two plants in Mexico - Queretaro and Leon - and three in Canada - Pictou, Bridgewater and Waterville.

Analysis of the recent U.S. executive orders still require clarification and no conclusion can be drawn at this stage, Michelin's management said during the call.

The North American market, including Mexico, accounted for 38.6% of its total annual sales in 2024.

KEY QUOTES

""Finished products flows from other regions to the US could be impacted by the 25% tariff that applies to auto and auto parts, yet it is still to be confirmed whether all tires are falling under this tariff.""

""For Michelin, the main flows are Europe-to-US in Agricultural tires and Indonesia-to-US in Tier 2 Passenger car tires.""

""As regards retaliation tariffs from non-US countries, the story is just beginning. What we can say is that the USA is a low-exporting country for Michelin, therefore exports from US to Europe and Asia are very limited.""

""In the current highly volatile context, we will not develop any forward-looking view today, we will keep it for our Q1 sales release later in the month.""

BY THE NUMBERS

Michelin confirmed it expects volumes to drop between 6% and 8% in the first quarter, driven by lower car demand after the end of 2024.

Analysts on average were expecting it to report quarterly sales of 6.67 billion euros ($7.33 billion) and a volume drop of 2.6% in a company-provided consensus dated February 17.

Concerning U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, the group said that 70% of its tyres sold in the United States were manufactured in the country.

It also noted that natural rubber was not impacted by any of the recent announcements and that U.S. could be considered self-sufficient for the production of synthetic rubber.

Michelin will report first-quarter results on April 24.

Co-founded in 2015 by Karim Pichara and Matias Muchnick, the company has revolutionised how food formulations are created, focusing on using AI to develop plant-based alternatives and improve product formulations.

The AI platform, named Giuseppe, was initially designed to generate plant-based versions of animal-derived ingredients but has since expanded to support broader product development needs. Giuseppe enables food scientists, chefs, and product developers to optimise formulations by exploring vast ingredient combinations and adjusting variables to meet specific goals such as texture, nutritional profiles, and cost efficiency.

With AI’s assistance, NotCo has significantly reduced development timelines. Traditional R&D processes in the food industry can take years, but NotCo’s technology can cut this down to just a few months. This capability has attracted the attention of major CPG companies, including Mars, Nestlé, Mondelēz, and Kraft Heinz, all leveraging NotCo’s platform to enhance product offerings, improve nutritional labels, and comply with ever-changing regulations.

The company’s B2B business is growing rapidly, with NotCo providing complete product formulations and technology for companies to integrate into their own R&D processes. In addition to its core plant-based products, NotCo is working with Kraft Heinz on a joint venture to create co-branded, plant-based products across multiple categories.

NotCo’s AI-driven approach is particularly valuable in product reformulation, where many companies face increasing pressure to enhance sustainability and health benefits. The company’s platform helps businesses navigate the complexities of ingredient substitution and optimisation, addressing challenges like reducing sugar without compromising on flavour and texture.

As part of its long-term strategy, NotCo further expands its B2B offering, particularly its software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. The company is also expanding its product range, including functional snacks and new plant-based innovations. With AI continuing to drive its success, NotCo is positioned to be a key player in the evolving food tech landscape.",https://www.fdiforum.net/mag/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/notmayo.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 06:06:17.127949

Today the coffee shop business is both mass and small-scale, driven by convenience and an artisan mindset.
The national players The coffee shop business divides most easily among companies that do business in multiple locations and those based in a single metro area.
The locals: Caribou Coffee Caribou was founded in 1992 by John and Kim Puckett in Minneapolis at 44th and France Avenue South (the location closed in 2023).
The locals: Dunn Brothers Coffee Dunn Brothers is a 38-year-old coffee shop business rooted in the Twin Cities.","If you’re under 50, you don’t remember when coffee in America was mostly swill that came from granules spooned into hot water. The term “coffee shop” referenced a daytime diner, a la Seinfeld, where people went for pancakes or a tuna sandwich, whose coffee rarely was something to write home about. But sometime in the 1980s, things started to change. Coffee became an artisanal good, like in Italy or France. Drinking Sanka or Folgers became a sign you were a yokel.

With this evolution came entrepreneurs, notably Starbucks, which picked up on the growing thirst and slaked it, and coffee became a feedback loop that brings us to today, where a small latte sells for $7.40 at a “third-wave” coffee shop.

The coffee cognoscenti describe its evolution in waves. The first was the coffeehouses of the beatniks (1950s-60s); the second was Starbucks and Caribou and the democratization and commercialization of good beans in the ’90s; the third wave was the barista-driven, latte art, specialty coffee era from 2000. Fourth-wave coffee involves a re-democratization of the third wave—coffee shops in the Australian style (friendly and unpretentious all-day cafes with third-wave coffee and a carefully chosen scratch food menu). There’s not much of it in the Twin Cities.

This evolution turned the old coffee shop into an industry category where Americans routinely spend $5-$15 to start their day. The business is full of paradoxes, as packed shops struggle to break even, new entrants emerge quarterly, and consumers decry the spiraling expense but seem powerless to resist it.

Locally Caribou is for sale, Rustica just sold, Dunn Brothers sold recently and wants to quintuple in size, while Starbucks is retrenching. Independents like FRGMT, Spyhouse, Backstory, and Café Ceres are routinely packed, but the latter shut down due to chronic unprofitability. And national drive-thru chains Scooter’s, 7 Brew, and Dutch Bros are eyeing us for expansion.

The business today runs the gamut from tiny one-offs to local chains to large regional and national players. The Twin Cities is not a market the nationals immediately look to, so we tend to see them later in their growth cycle.

The daily ritual

What’s unique about coffee is whereas most of us don’t crave pancakes or tuna salad every day, coffee isn’t optional. “Coffee is emotional,” explains Lee Wallace, owner and CEO of locally based Peace Coffee. “It’s a special daily ritual to people.” As a result, there’s opportunity. “McDonald’s breakfast business was up 20% just on upgrading its coffee,” says Jonathan Maze, editor-in-chief at Restaurant Business, a trade publication. “You can trace that to Starbucks.”

Wallace pinpoints it to about two decades ago, when coffee consumption broadly became “about excellence of coffee and ethical supply chains.”

And then there was the pandemic. “Coffee had a moment during Covid,” explains Erin Newkirk, chief brand and marketing officer for Brooklyn Center-based Caribou Coffee. “It was an essential business. It got you out of the house.” If you hadn’t cared about coffee shops before, now you did.

A good business?

Maze says the pandemic accelerated changes already underway, as second-wave shops spawned variations both downmarket and upmarket. Today the coffee shop business is both mass and small-scale, driven by convenience and an artisan mindset. A few bullet points define common denominators:

Work from home has remade the industry.

Workspaces are essential for the one-offs and small chains, as is a welcoming environment that encourages people to bring their work from home to the shop.

Gen Z customers increasingly want cold drinks and non-coffee products.

Specialty coffee is the growing segment. Sixty percent of Americans drank specialty coffee last year, says Wallace.

“All the growth [in coffee] is suburban,” says Maze. “We think of coffee as an urban phenomenon, but now it’s suburban.”

Light roast

Entrepreneurs and investors get into coffee for a variety of reasons, almost always because of their love of the drink, at least initially. But there are business imperatives as well. Daniel Del Prado, who operates some of Minneapolis’ most celebrated restaurants and operated the four-location coffee chain Cafe Ceres, explains, explains:

Coffee has less upfront investment. “You get a lot of tenant improvements [from a landlord]. A restaurant costs a minimum of a million dollars to build out, a basic coffee shop $100,000.” He says percentage of revenue or even free rent is common, making it easier to ride out slow months. “Landlords want [the coffee shop] as an amenity,” he says.

Coffee also promotes loyalty. “It’s a frequency business,” explains Newkirk. “It’s sticky,” adds Wallace. “Once people get into a place, it’s kind of like Cheers—the whole third-place idea.”

And optimally, it’s an appealing place to work. “We have positive, passionate customers, and that really inspires our team,” explains Michael Kollar, a Dunn Brothers franchisee with stores in the west metro.

Dark roast

Despite this, coffee has its downsides.

Del Prado shared some ominous metrics. Wages are up 50% from 2020 in all job categories. Plus, “butter, flour, coffee, milk all has gone up 50% or more in price,” he says. “I can’t charge what I should to make a profit.” He sells a latte for as much as $7.75 but says it should be $11 to generate acceptable margins. Given the absurdity of the situation, he says, “Coffee shops are money pits. I can’t imagine being in this business much longer.

“Coffee shops don’t produce cash flow,” he continues. “Five of them equal one restaurant, and it’s a more difficult worker base,” as he has come to learn.

And the margins are low—“they are low for anything in food,” notes Rustica owner Brent Frederick. “You do it because you love it.”

Rustica’s Lake Street location sits next to a Punch Pizza, which occupies less space but does roughly twice the revenue. “The dirty secret of coffee is it takes an incredible volume to be successful—a line out the door in the morning and busy inside all day,” explains Caribou founder John Puckett, who now is co-owner of Punch. “A store can look busy but not make money. We barely broke even on every college campus.”

Unions have organized various Starbucks around the country, as well as Café Ceres. Puckett theorizes that the intense demands of Starbucks’ volume during Covid uniquely stressed its worker base. But urban coffee shop workers also tend to seek more workplace control. Maze says virtually all unionized non-hotel restaurants are in coffee. But most of the locally based operators TCB talked to said they faced no current issues.

“Labor doesn’t scare us,” says Rustica’s Frederick. “Having a good culture, the right training, scheduling, and benefits helps.”

But the business faces layers of other pressures. Dunn Brothers’ Kollar cites regulatory fees, obligatory retirement plans, and the state’s new paid leave system. Wholesale coffee bean prices have quadrupled in five years due to increased global demand and climate-driven shortages—so retail pricing has risen relentlessly.

Though “we’ve not seen a lot of price sensitivity [among consumers] so far,” notes Peace Coffee’s Wallace, the company chose to get out of the coffee shop business during the pandemic. Wallace says her coffee made at home is roughly 60 cents a cup.

The role of the chew

Most people want food with their morning brew; it’s rare to find a coffee shop without at least a tray of pastries. But most go further, with an array of prepared egg sandwiches and lunchtime fare. For the big boys, it’s all frozen or pre-packaged, but many of the locals cook from scratch. That adds dynamics such as additional training, spoilage, and prep, plus the regulatory burdens that come with fresh food. But woe to the coffee shop that rolls without it.

“Beverages are the profit center,” says Maze. “You sell food to get the beverage sale.” That’s because people don’t want to go to multiple venues, says Caribou’s Newkirk. So “you add food, and you double your sales and add frequency,” says Ben Hertz, co-founder of defunct fourth-wave coffee chain Penny’s. “Come for a meeting, stay to do emails, and at 11:30 you’ll have a salad.”

But where to draw the line? Starbucks has decided its menu is unnecessarily large and is paring back. “The question for us was always how much complexity to add,” Wallace recalls. “Food, cold drinks, alcohol?”

Caribou founder Puckett would draw the line at anything requiring ice: “In my opinion, cold beverages have ruined the coffee business” because they don’t require a skilled barista and are often glorified milkshakes.

The national players

The coffee shop business divides most easily among companies that do business in multiple locations and those based in a single metro area.

Among the big players, smaller-format stores, often without seating but with drive-thru capabilities, are the growth business.

Starbucks is the largest operator of coffee shops in the country, with roughly 17,000 locations. It created the category, by and large, and continues to dominate it. But it is struggling. During the pandemic, with more drive-thrus and better digital capabilities, Starbucks “blew up,” as the kids say—its business exploded, and today it is reaping both the benefits and the drawbacks.

It’s not uncommon to go into a Starbucks and see more than a dozen drink and food items waiting for pickup, or to wait 10-15 minutes for an order in a store with barely any customers. The company also removed seating from stores during the pandemic and didn’t restore all of it. It opened shops designed only for pickup orders. Starbucks admits to hollowing out the hospitality side of the brand and has refocused around restoring that part of its business.

“Customer service data metrics show people don’t like Starbucks, which is driving part of their leadership’s desperation,” Maze explains. “Starbucks has been overwhelmed by mobile.” The company’s new leadership is adapting mobile capacities to control volume while charting a “back to the future” mantra, but “you make money churning customers,” says Maze, who notes that Starbucks hopes for an average of $2 million in revenue per store, which only a handful of the busiest coffee shops in the Twin Cities experience.

Starbucks “can’t turn off the demand that Covid created,” notes Puckett, who says he is watching its evolution closely. Starbucks entered the Twin Cities after Caribou’s 1992 founding—later than it did many metro areas—and we’re one of the few large metro markets the company doesn’t dominate.

The other notable category of national operator is the small-format drive-thru-only business model of 7 Brew, Scooter’s, and Dutch Bros, which are currently the talk of the industry. They are predominantly in suburbs and exurbs. (Scooter’s has a small number of Minnesota locations.)

“The idea of a coffee shop is changing,” says Maze.

The locals: Caribou Coffee

Caribou was founded in 1992 by John and Kim Puckett in Minneapolis at 44th and France Avenue South (the location closed in 2023). The Pucketts sold the company in 2000, it went public in 2005, and it was taken private by German food conglomerate JAB in 2012. (Caribou’s history is fascinating but too involved for this feature.) JAB transferred many of Caribou’s stores outside the Upper Midwest to its owned-brand Peet’s Coffee, and Caribou retrenched to the Upper Midwest and a few domestic pockets like Atlanta.

JAB more recently placed Caribou under the umbrella of its St. Louis-based Panera Brands group, along with Einstein Brothers and Bruegger’s Bagels. Last year, Panera announced it was exploring a sale of Caribou and the bagel properties. Caribou’s CEO, John Butcher, announced his departure this March.

Caribou still controls the largest number of coffee shops in the Twin Cities region, but outside observers are uncertain about its trajectory.

“I feel like they’re sort of ignored within JAB,” says Maze. “The parent is very focused on Panera, which is not doing well. I can’t see an obvious strategy to [JAB’s] ownership tenure other than ‘own brands and combine them.’ The Caribous they converted to Peet’s mostly closed.”

Caribou has evolved its strategy over the years. It had long licensed stores in grocery stores, hospitals, and airports, but in 2021 it began franchising stand-alone stores, which is driving current growth back into Michigan and Ohio, plus Florida. Company-owned store growth is in Wisconsin and the Southeast. (Over 40% of Caribou’s stores are franchised in the Arabian Peninsula, North Africa, Turkey, and Bosnia, a legacy of the period before JAB ownership when the company’s largest shareholder was Arcapita, a Bahrain-based investment fund. There are arguably more standalone Caribous in Cairo and Riyadh than Minneapolis.)

Food service advisory firm Technomic Ignite ranks Caribou as the nation’s sixth-largest coffee shop by sales volume. At the end of 2024, it had 487 U.S. locations, 335 of them company-owned. In a franchise disclosure filed for FY23, Caribou said its company-owned full-service coffeehouses with drive-thru (1,500 square feet) averaged $1.08 million in sales, while the drive-thru-only cabin (600 square feet) averaged $806,000, making the economic advantages of the smaller format evident.

“My take is that the biggest factor behind Caribou’s slip in national market share has been the aggressive expansion of its competitors,” says Kevin Schimpf, director of industry research for Technomic Ignite. “Caribou is getting squeezed in both directions by the store growth of bigger players like Starbucks and Dunkin’ as well as the proliferation of smaller upstarts. For context, Starbucks opened over 500 U.S. stores just in the last year.” (Caribou added seven stores in 2024.)

Hertz, the founder of Penny’s, says he perceives Caribou as “gun-shy, risk-averse. They don’t innovate.”

Caribou would, of course, disagree with this characterization. But what’s notable about the company is that as its competitors retrench around coffee basics, Caribou sees itself as more of a coffee-themed hospitality business.

“Caribou is doing what we’ve always done, making people feel like they belong,” says Newkirk. “It doesn’t have to be coffee. Our focus is on where consumers are going.” She describes “meeting guests where they’re at,” with an emphasis on “optionality.”

“There’s the product and there’s the service, the emotional benefit, the gatherings, moments that happen,” Newkirk continues. “We’re there for all of that. … We stay on trend. There’s real lavender on our menu. We’re looking at botanicals, energy drinks that play off the coffee experience.”

Caribou’s founder still sees potential in the company. “I’m sorry to see John [Butcher] go,” says Puckett. “He’d attracted a good team, reinvigorated the culture. Any buyer would want to have him. I think Caribou is still a good business for the right buyer.”

It roasts its beans in-store, and they are brewed within five days. Its food menu is limited, but the eggs are cracked and the bread sliced right there, compared to the frozen product reheated by the big guys.

Dunn is a franchisor of coffee shops, with only four owned stores. Most stores are in Minnesota, but it also operates in the Dakotas, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Texas. It was sold in 2022 to Gala Capital, a private equity firm based in Orange County, California. Dunn currently franchises 43 stores, down from 54 in 2019. Its 2023 franchise disclosure identified 28 optimized Dunn Bros. with drive-thrus and full menus that averaged $576,000 in revenue, with the best-performing earning just over $1 million.

The company is in the midst of an evolution, says vice president of marketing Alexis Gillette. “Coffee is at our core, but post-Covid we’re rethinking our core. We’re looking at different store formats and footprints, working to grow and create consistency. We’re here to help budding entrepreneurs grow businesses.”

“Quality of coffee is our differentiator,” says west metro franchisee Michael Kollar. “I roast the beans, and our customers give us feedback [on the roast] because they are passionate about coffee.” Kollar’s operation is unorthodox in that he takes less profit and pays staff more because it’s a retirement project for him—but he insists his coffee shops are viable stand-alone businesses: “If my kids wanted to take over my stores,” he says, “they’d live a nice life.”

The locals: The little guys

The Twin Cities is rich in artisanal coffee shops. From Rustica to Spyhouse to Dogwood, they blanket Minneapolis and St. Paul. “The small chains drive the sector forward, like upscale indie restaurants do,” says Maze. “They try new things that filter down. The chains watch them for ideas that work.”

But they may or may not be good businesses.Local restaurant operator Jester Concepts (Parlour, P.S. Steak) recently bought two-unit coffee shop Rustica and announced plans for a third in a defunct Wayzata Wuollet bakery. Jester CEO Brent Frederick says his company, which mostly operates upscale restaurants, got into coffee strategically.

“The bakery drove a lot of it,” and partner Mike DeCamp loves coffee, Frederick says. “On our bakery side, we saw an opportunity for efficiencies and fun integrations with our restaurants.” Jester also found itself overinvested in the inner city after Covid and sees coffee as an antidote. “There’s a path to growth in the suburbs,” says Frederick. “The pandemic exposed us; everything reoriented to the suburbs. Meetings kept happening, but not downtown. We see opportunities in existing coffee shops, such as Wuollet’s awful situation.” (It has been shedding locations due to financial distress.)

It’s worth noting that Rustica once had a million-dollar wholesale bakery business, so at its core, it’s more of a bakery than most coffee shops. Frederick says he hopes to generate at least $1 million in revenue per store.

Del Prado hoped his restaurant chops would deliver a value-add in coffee. When he created Café Ceres, he wanted to grow to 12 units. “It’s an easy business to scale because of low overhead,” he says—assuming you don’t build full-service kitchens (as in the former Penny’s stores he took over). Del Prado and partner Shawn McKenzie lost interest after the shops unionized and the economics of coffee deteriorated.

Though his stores are crowded and lively, he says they don’t break even, whereas his restaurants in the same trade areas do. It’s hard to understand how an operator like Michael Kollar can hit it out of the park in Hopkins and Savage, yet Del Prado can’t in affluent southwest Minneapolis, but that’s the conundrum of coffee.

Percolating…

If you’re wondering where the business is heading, the words one hears most are “automation” and “off-premise.” “Every coffee business is moving toward automation,” says Del Prado. “There are affordable espresso machines today that grind, steam, and do latte art.”

Jonathan Maze adds that “off-premise is the present and future of coffee. The economics of it are compelling.” Chain coffee either wants you to consume in the car or believes you want to.

Both phenomena push the business toward less rent and labor, not to mention mechanized consistency. But the idea of that “third place”—which, in a work-from-home America, so many people seem to crave—seems only a growth engine of Starbucks and the small urban chains.

“It’s funny,” Maze says. “Everyone says they like the idea of that type of coffee shop, it’s just that more and more they are choosing something else.”",https://d5c1j5k5drfk7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/coffee-header.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 04:02:20.799066

Analyst firm Canalys spotted a 9.4 percent year-over-year shipment surge that meant 62.75 million PCs rolled off the production line in 2025’s calendar Q1. Rival analyst IDC counted 63.2 million combined shipments of desktops, workstations and laptops, a 4.9 percent jump on the numbers it compiled in Q1 2024.

Those are jumps that have not been seen in the PC market for years (COVID anomalies notwithstanding) because refresh cycles have lengthened due to modern personal computers being so robust and powerful they can satisfy most needs for five years or more. Many business buyers used to buy new machines every three years.

It’s also worth noting the analysts’ numbers report global shipments, and only the USA is slapping tariffs on PC-producing nations at the moment. That suggests stateside buyers have bought up big to avoid the price increases that follow tariffs.

Canalys principal analyst Ishan Dutt said the shipments surge was “driven by vendors accelerating deliveries to the US in anticipation of initial tariff announcements.”

IDC research veep Jean Philippe Bouchard agreed. “The market is clearly showing some level of pull-in in the first quarter this year as both vendors and end-users brace for the impact of US tariffs,” he said. “In a first quarter still relatively untouched by tariffs, the entire ecosystem attempted to accelerate the pace of deliveries to avoid the first round of US tariffs and expected volatility for the remainder of the year.”

Those tariffs were announced last week and saw goods imported from major sources of PCs like Vietnam, Malaysia and China slugged with tariffs of 46 percent, 36 percent, and 34 percent. In the last few days the Trump administration paused the introduction of tariffs on all nations other than China, which now faces 125 percent duties on its exports.

Like almost everyone else trying to figure out what the USA’s whipsaw trade policy will mean, the analysts struggled to predict its impact on the PC market.

Canalys’s Dutt worried that higher PC prices caused by tariffs might see some orgs defer a move from Windows 10, which Microsoft won’t support as of October 14th, to Window 11s. Delayed OS migrations may also delay PC purchases.

IDC’s Bouchard thinks the Windows transition remains a strong demand factor for PC purchase that won’t go away.

Microsoft declares 2025 'the year of the Windows 11 PC refresh'

The two analysts agree that PC shipments in the rest of 2025 are likely to slow down – but offered that opinion before today’s sudden pause on tariffs.

Another thing both analysts agree on is that Lenovo is the world’s top PC vendor. Canalys thinks it has 24.2 percent market share, IDC reckons it has 24.1 percent. Both also have HP Inc. in second place, followed by Dell, Apple, and ASUS.

The two firms have also seen PC manufacturers make efforts to shift their supply chains so they can produce hardware in locations less likely to wear tariffs.

But both also acknowledge that whatever tariff regime the US settles on, PC-makers will be left with no alternative but to pass higher costs onto consumers. ®",https://regmedia.co.uk/2021/10/07/shutterstock_pcwindow.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 06:05:57.114400

All eyes, then, are on Vietnam – Nike’s most important production base.
Betting on Vietnam Nike entered Vietnam in 1995 with five contract footwear factories, part of a long-term bet by co-founder Phil Knight.
He offered to cut tariffs on US goods to zero and encouraged Mr Trump to do the same.","- At Nike headquarters in Oregon, US, executives are trying to figure out how to best spread the pain of new tariffs.

Nike, the factories that produce its goods, the wholesalers that sell the goods and ultimately shoppers will all likely share portions of the cost, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The backbone of Nike’s supply chain is being threatened by US President Donald Trump’s global tariff campaign, straining a decades-long investment just as the world’s largest sneaker company tries to rebound under a new chief executive.

Over the past 30 years, Nike has funnelled billions of dollars of production into Vietnam, helping turn the South-east Asian nation into a powerhouse for footwear and apparel production. On April 9, Mr Trump imposed a 46 per cent tariff on goods from Vietnam – among the steepest of the countries he targeted – that threatens to devastate its manufacturing industries.

The announcement was then thrown into limbo hours later when Mr Trump said he would pause higher tariffs on dozens of non-retaliating countries for 90 days. Nike shares rose 7.2 per cent at 1.30pm in New York after the President posted about the pause on social media.

Nike has become a symbol of corporate fallout from Mr Trump’s tariff blitz: A famed US brand entangled in an economic calamity that has wiped trillions from stocks and pushed global supply chains into disarray. Executives have been left with a costly conundrum across Asia, where nearly all Nike sneakers are made.

The timing could not be worse. New CEO Elliott Hill is attempting to revive a company weighed down by slumping sales and corporate layoffs. Nike expects further declines in revenue and profitability, and shares have fallen 30 per cent so far in 2025.

Mr Hill must now navigate rising costs across his supply chain, with the possibility of passing price hikes on to consumers.

In March, he told investors that he visited factory partners in Asia “to see how we’re executing”, but has yet to outline a plan to manage tariff fallout.

Management’s options are limited, and analysts say it is impossible for Nike to quickly reorient its supply chain.

Vietnam, China and Indonesia – all hard-hit by Trump tariffs – account for 95 per cent of Nike footwear production.

The total workforce that manufactures Nike products in those three countries is roughly 850,000 – slightly larger than Apple supplier Foxconn, according to company disclosures.

TD Cowen analyst John Kernan said there is simply nowhere else with the comparable capacity or labour costs to absorb that volume.

All eyes, then, are on Vietnam – Nike’s most important production base.

Betting on Vietnam

Nike entered Vietnam in 1995 with five contract footwear factories, part of a long-term bet by co-founder Phil Knight. It was a gamble because the industry was still developing, and its workforce lacked experience and oversight, but Mr Knight saw opportunity.

Since then, Nike’s footprint in Vietnam has only increased, adding more factories as the industry gained infrastructure and manufacturing experience.

Rivals like Adidas and Puma followed, as did newer brands such as Lululemon Athletica, Skechers USA and Allbirds.

Half of all Nike brand sneakers are made in Vietnam now, according to filings.

Vietnam’s footwear and apparel industries were big winners during Mr Trump’s first term.

Geopolitical tensions pushed Western brands out of China, and they flocked to Vietnam, with its established manufacturing history and infrastructure.

Vietnam now ranks among the world’s top exporters of both apparel and footwear, according to the World Bank.

Vietnam’s government has lauded Nike’s investments as vital to their economy’s growth.

The nation has been among Asia’s fastest-growing economies in recent years, with gross domestic product up 7.1 per cent in 2024.

That mutual dependence has led to a close relationship between Nike and Vietnam’s government.

Officials in Hanoi have hosted Nike executive in recent years.

In 2022, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh asked the company for policy recommendations to deepen Vietnam’s integration into global supply chains.

Limited options

These days, Nike works with more than 100 apparel factories, footwear plants and equipment makers in Vietnam, the company has disclosed.

Most are clustered around Ho Chi Minh City, where major contractors each employ over 10,000 workers.

Nike could pressure vendors to take on more of the new costs, streamline operations or coordinate with retail partners to raise prices, said Ms Anna Andreeva, an analyst at Piper Sandler.

But she warned that there is a ceiling.

“That’s the number one question: How much price increase can the consumer realistically absorb?” Ms Andreeva said.

Executives at Foot Locker, Nike’s biggest retail partner, said last week that they are in “constant communications” with brands on pricing strategy as they mull over how much of these tariff costs will end up being placed on US shoppers.

“We’re going to work through brand by brand,” Foot Locker CEO Mary Dillon said at a JPMorgan event last week. “It’s a combination of ‘What do they take? What does the consumer take?’”

Meanwhile, Vietnam’s government has been working to placate Mr Trump.

On April 5, Vietnam’s leader To Lam asked Mr Trump to delay his tariffs for at least 45 days to allow for negotiations.

He offered to cut tariffs on US goods to zero and encouraged Mr Trump to do the same.

Mr Trump said the call was “very productive”.

But White House adviser Peter Navarro said Vietnam’s offer was not enough.

Vietnam upped the offer on April 8, promising to buy more US defence and security products. BLOOMBERG",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a471f89ae9fc7486b2eb6e5668b0f5d8dd039a57555a3e9ba8f4e44404acbee3,N,,2025-04-10 01:59:59.527806

It is arguably one of the clearest expressions to date of what CEO leadership should look like in the age of AI.

In the memo, Lütke states plainly, “Using AI effectively is now a fundamental expectation of everyone at Shopify.” Not just developers. Not just analysts. Everyone.

This is not some passing trend or another bullet point on an IT roadmap. It is a cultural shift. It’s a new way of working and thinking — one that Shopify is now weaving into its performance reviews, product development cycles and company-wide expectations. In the memo, Lütke makes the following proclamations:

AI Proficiency Is Now Mandatory: Using AI effectively is no longer optional at Shopify — it is a baseline expectation for all employees, regardless of role. This marks a significant cultural and operational shift.

Non-Use of AI Requires Justification. Employees must demonstrate why AI cannot be used before requesting additional resources (e.g., more staff or time). Stagnation is framed as failure — employees are encouraged to continuously upskill and experiment with AI.

AI in Product Development. AI must be integrated into the early stages (prototype phase) of all GSD (get sh** done) projects. This approach is intended to dramatically accelerate learning, iteration and team collaboration.

Performance Accountability. Shopify is adding AI usage to its performance and peer review criteria, making AI adoption part of how employees are evaluated and rewarded, including leadership and executive teams.

The tone of the memo is direct and urgent. Lütke asserts that failing to adopt AI now will lead to stagnation and decline, emphasizing that employees must keep climbing — or risk sliding backward.

“This exemplifies what CEO leadership looks like in the Age of AI,"" says Paul Baier, CEO of GAI Insights and Forbes AI contributor. “CEOs must adapt to leading organizations of, say, 1,000 employees empowered with 5,000 AI assistants.”

AI Is a Business Mindset, Not a Technology Stack

What makes the Shopify memo so compelling is its bluntness. Lütke doesn’t politely suggest employees try using AI. He doesn’t offer training modules or optional tools. He says adapt or fall behind: “Stagnation is slow-motion failure. If you're not climbing, you're sliding.”

Lütke’s memo also reflects a broader reality: AI has already shifted from experiment to expectation. The companies that thrive in this new environment will be those whose CEOs stop treating AI as an initiative and start treating it as a core operating model.

This isn’t bravado, attention-seeking or trying to be the “cool kid” in the industry. It’s realism. For organizations in the crucible of generative AI disruption — media, retail, finance, logistics — awareness and experimentation are no longer enough. Adaptation is the new mandate and must start at the top.

Other CEOs Are Quietly Making AI Everyone’s Job

Several other business leaders are issuing similar directives — less publicized, but equally transformative:

Jon Moeller, CEO of Procter & Gamble, has articulated a pragmatic but ambitious vision for AI across the company’s business units, describing it as “a force multiplier for growth and productivity.” In an interview with Goldman Sachs, Moeller explained that AI is already being used to improve real-time quality control on manufacturing lines, generate product formulations faster and personalize marketing. He emphasized that it’s not about replacing people but amplifying their impact, saying, “AI enables each of us to be more productive and more effective — to be better at our jobs.” For Moeller, AI isn’t a future bet — it’s a current driver of business performance.

Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, has made AI a central pillar of the bank’s $12 billion modernization strategy, not only for internal efficiencies but as a customer experience accelerator. In a July 2023 Fortune interview, Fraser noted that generative AI tools are already being deployed across development teams and data functions, including tools for code generation and data cleanup. “We must be proactive about embracing AI,” she said. “It’s an essential part of winning in the digital era.” Fraser’s framing of AI is decidedly business-first — not a technological leap, but a means to deliver better, faster and safer banking services at scale.

Chip Bergh, CEO of Levi Strauss & Co., has overseen the integration of AI to sharpen demand forecasting, optimize inventory and improve supply chain agility. By adopting predictive models that draw from real-time sales and external signals, Levi’s has been able to better match supply with demand, reduce markdowns and improve product availability. In remarks to the press, Bergh underscored that speed and adaptability are essential, especially in apparel: “You can’t outsource speed. The world moves too fast, and consumers expect more now. AI helps us keep pace.” For Bergh, AI isn’t about transformation for transformation’s sake — it’s how the company stays competitive in a volatile retail landscape.

What these leaders understand is that AI is about much more than tools and apps. Nor is it a sidecar to business strategy. It is business strategy.

What Real CEO Leadership in the Age of AI Looks Like

Executive leadership isn’t about cheerleading AI or greenlighting another pilot project. CEOs must fundamentally shift how they lead. Here’s what that looks like in practice:

Mandate Use, Don’t Just Encourage Exploration. Like Lütke, CEOs must make clear that using AI isn’t optional. AI literacy and experimentation should be expected of everyone — not just the innovation team. Make it a part of onboarding, performance reviews, promotions and project evaluations.

Tie AI to Productive Output. Shopify isn’t asking teams to build AI for AI’s sake. It wants people using AI in the prototype phase of projects — the earliest stages of idea development — when speed and iteration matter most. CEOs should insist that AI be applied where it accelerates core business goals: faster onboarding, better forecasting and more responsive customer experiences.

Formalize Accountability. Follow Shopify’s lead in including AI proficiency in feedback loops — whether through peer reviews, OKRs or team dashboards. This reinforces that AI isn’t a tech skill, it’s a work ethic.

Design for Scale, Not Just Sparkle. Stop launching pilots with no path to production. Instead, build AI usage standards, define enterprise-wide tooling strategies and create “AI-as-default” policies in business workflows. This is how you shift from novelty to normalcy.

Lead Culturally, Not Just Operationally. One of the most overlooked CEO responsibilities in this era is cultural modeling. Use AI in your own daily work. Talk about it publicly. Ask teams how they’re applying it. CEOs are the ultimate cultural signal — if they treat AI like a gimmick, so will the rest of the organization.

The Emergence of the Self-Driving Enterprise

We’re fast approaching an era when leading companies will function more like self-driving enterprises — data-fueled, agentic AI orchestrated, highly automated and continuously learning and strategically adapting in real time. That won’t happen by happenstance. It will require CEOs to shift their organizations’ very metabolism.

What Shopify has shown is that the path to this future isn’t paved with expensive platforms or massive headcount changes — it’s built by creating a workplace culture where AI is part of every project, every role and every decision. Not because it’s trendy, but because it’s an imperative to be sufficiently efficient and adaptable.

Organizations that treat AI as a way of life will thrive. Those that relegate it to the IT department will lag — or lose altogether.

The memo from Lütke is more than an internal directive. It’s a mirror for every senior executive to look into and ask: Are we organizationally adapting? Or are we merely treating AI as a science project?

The report further pointed out that Chinese consumers are increasingly focused on gear that serves daily needs rather than extreme performance or celebrity endorsements.","Comfort has raced past fashionability for consumers according to sportswear brand Skechers after a meeting in Shanghai on Monday unveiled the 2025 Consumer Comfort Sports Trend Report in collaboration with Chinese financial news outlet Yicai.

The report offers insights into shifts in consumer health perspectives and the rising importance of comfort technology in sports consumption, pointing out that 60.15 percent of consumers begin their health journey by purchasing sports equipment, with 46.05 percent identifying comfortable sports shoes as their first choice.

Consumers increasingly prioritize ease of use and long-term comfort over complex or highly technical gear. Light sports activities such as walking in the city or urban areas are gaining popularity, particularly among working adults aged 26 to 45 and middle-aged to elderly consumers.

The event also showcased Skechers' product innovations through an immersive display zone, emphasizing the brand's strategic focus on comfort in the evolving consumer landscape.

Feng Jiancong, Skechers' vice-president of brand and product center, emphasized that the brand's product lines — from sports to casual and outdoor footwear — are designed around real consumer needs. ""Our focus is on building a comprehensive comfort technology system rather than chasing trends,"" he said.

The brand aligns with China's three-year action plan to further raise health awareness for citizens, prioritizing comfort in its product strategy, Feng added.

The report further pointed out that Chinese consumers are increasingly focused on gear that serves daily needs rather than extreme performance or celebrity endorsements.

Established in 1992, Skechers boasts a global presence spanning over 180 countries.

Orion’s share performance has been uninspiring, down 33% since taking a secondary inward listing on the JSE in 2017.
Even in established copper districts such as Chile, projects can take 20 years to build from discovery to production.
“That is a modest ticket, especially bearing in mind we have got the Industrial Development Corp [IDC],” said Errol Smart, Orion’s former CEO.
Helpfully, the differing copper output of Orion’s projects enables blending, which offtakers appreciate as it gives them flexibility.","Shareholders in copper exploration firm Orion Minerals can look forward to brighter days after it unveiled bankable feasibility studies of two projects in the Northern Cape. Prieska Copper Zinc Mine (PCZM) and Flat Mines will produce 28,500t of copper a year, says Orion.

Orion’s share performance has been uninspiring, down 33% since taking a secondary inward listing on the JSE in 2017. In its defence, building mines — even brownfields ones, which it is doing — is a slow-drip process. Even in established copper districts such as Chile, projects can take 20 years to build from discovery to production.

Nonetheless, the hope is that the newsflow from Orion speeds up from here, taking its share price with it, especially as it’s a good time to be mining copper. The metal’s price has surged to about $10,000/t in recent weeks, driven by expectations it could push through last year’s record high of $11,000/t. “I think we’ll see higher than $12,000,” Kostas Bintas, global head of metals and minerals at Swiss commodities trading house Mercuria, told the Financial Times.

With the market seemingly at its back, Orion is hoping to raise R8.9bn to fund both projects, though not in a single bite. PCZM consists of two stages with the shallower part of the orebody — known as the Upper Project — a starter project that Orion says can be built in 13 months for R550m. “That is a modest ticket, especially bearing in mind we have got the Industrial Development Corp [IDC],” said Errol Smart, Orion’s former CEO. He was speaking to the FM a week before he resigned. The IDC holds minority project stakes and will finance Orion’s BEE shareholders.

Smart’s resignation came as a surprise, but he tells the FM in a second interview on April 4 there was no bust-up over strategy. “I’m just exhausted and the project needs fresh, firm legs to get funding and construction completed.” His replacement is Tony Lennox, previously a nonexecutive director of Orion and before that a former MD of Palabora Copper when it was owned jointly by Rio Tinto and Anglo American. “Tony is really good and more than capable of taking it forward,” says Smart. “I’m still involved as an adviser so it’s not like I’m out. I just won’t have the daily grind to worry about.”

One of Lennox’s first jobs will be structuring the project finance, based on various principles. Smart says copper traders and royalty companies are only too keen to provide prepayment terms for the copper, given the growing supply deficit. Helpfully, the differing copper output of Orion’s projects enables blending, which offtakers appreciate as it gives them flexibility. Shareholders should expect Orion to step forward with an announcement before long. There will also be commercial debt, most likely a syndication of capital — a process Smart says can take the best part of a year to do.

A third funding avenue is equity. Though it’s not the cheapest form of financing it is nonetheless critical. “There will always be an equity component,” says Smart. “You can’t get away from it. The key is to minimise it.” The participation of a major mining company is a possibility.

“There are some interesting discussions to be had,” says Smart of potential equity partners. “The majors recognise we can operate fleet of foot. We have moved quickly at a relatively low cost whereas they [larger companies] would have struggled. But we could bring in a big brother to help us. It is an interesting idea so we’ll see where those discussions go.”

If Orion can mobilise funds for PCZM’s Upper Project, first production will come on stream roughly 13 months after the final investment decision. It will operate for about four years while Orion prepares PCZM’s deeps section. To keep costs tidy, the Upper Project will “sacrifice” its zinc by-production — forecast to be 65,000t a year — in favour of gold and silver by-products. It’s a pity this production isn’t happening now while both metals trade at historic highs. But given the extent of geopolitical and economic distress globally, there’s no indication that safe-haven precious metals will lose their lustre.

All in all, the PCZM mine will operate for about 14 years. Phased to follow PCZM is Flat Mines, which will operate concurrently but first requires A$103m in capital. It is scoped to produce average production of 6,500t a year of copper, peaking at 9,500t a year with a mine life of 12 years. Smart says more pre-development is required at Flat Mines, so described because the deposit is sausage-like before plunging halfway at a 90° angle.

The feasibility studies estimate an all-in sustaining cost of $4,550/t of copper equivalent metal sold. Total capital intensity, including project costs, is just below $9,200 per equivalent ton. “You see other projects talking of $12,000/t so what we’ve got, with a fully permitted project in the lowest cost quarter, is top order,” says Smart.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/I3iBVPagk08rscslVdra35DhRldHysvi0FIYLX6Vu6pVH5K-8i6LOEkzW0nFQQfBdtThHRZ_q7lFj-8V2wItHmUf4Kapo7f7nphcCpGkCkhqcvQ=s1000,N,,2025-04-10 11:11:02.823238

Net-zero industrial manufacturing of iron is, already today, economically competitive.” The most energy-intensive part of iron production is the reduction process, in which iron ore is reduced, losing its oxygen content.","In a world hungry for sustainable solutions, Namibia’s HyIron has fired up a game-changer — producing “green hydrogen” and using it to refine iron ore. The Oshivela pilot project, near Arandis in the Erongo region, is not only a first for Namibia but a world first in carbon-free iron production.

With a solar-powered facility and cutting-edge hydrogen technology, HyIron is setting the stage for a revolution in the steel industry. The project is the first on the planet to use green hydrogen for processing iron oxide to produce direct reduced iron ore (DRI), a crucial component in sustainable steel production.

The Oshivela project on the Bloemhof farm is supported by €13m from the German federal ministry for economic affairs & climate action. HyIron is a consortium of German companies with a Namibian partner, HyIron Green Technologies.

Construction of the facility began in 2024. Within six months, HyIron had successfully installed 44,000 solar panels across 25ha, capable of generating 25MW of renewable energy. The facility only operates during the daytime, supported by the 25MW solar energy farm and 13.4MW of battery storage capacity.

GEiSt (German for “green iron for the steel industry”) has piloted the technology in Lingen, Germany, in co-operation with RWE (a multinational energy company) and Benteler (a German steel company).

The Oshivela project uses the technology on an industrial scale. With an initial production capacity of 15,000t annually, the plant demonstrates that large-scale production of green iron is technically achievable and can be economically viable.

The modular construction model enables easy scalability in future production.

“The primary aim of the pilot plant,” says HyIron’s Namibian CEO and co-founder Johannes Michels, “is to enhance the process and evaluate different iron ores while refining the products used across the value chain. Its peak production capability is 5,000kg an hour.

The company intends to increase production to 25,000kg an hour by the end of 2027, while extending the production period to 24/7. It is initiating a comparable project in Australia, and is also evaluating opportunities in Angola and Brazil, along with up to four more sites in Namibia.

The company’s Oshivela plant produces hydrogen using a 12MW electrolyser unit supplied by China’s Peric Hydrogen Systems. The electrolyser, which generates green hydrogen, is the largest of its kind in Southern Africa. It operates within a smart microgrid, “which means there is no grid connection and the production is aligned with the available stored or generated renewable energy,” Michels says.

The plant, powered entirely by solar energy, is expected to begin production of DRI by mid-April. It aims for an initial output of 15,000t a year, targeting 2Mt by 2030.

HyIron-Oshivela has secured its first offtake agreement to supply a large part of its first-stage production to German steelmaker Benteler, which has the option to also buy part of the phase 2 product.

The initial phase required an investment of €30m, of which more than 40% took the form of grants from the German government. The rest was mustered through private investment from the company’s founders.

HyIron expects to begin the second phase of development at the end of this year. This phase aims to greatly enhance solar power capacity and will need an investment of €230m. “The funds for this will come from equity investors and debt funders,” says Michels.

The third phase is expected to start in 2027 and aims to boost capacity by a factor of 10 once more. This will need additional investment of €2.3bn. By 2030, HyIron aims to produce 2Mt of DRI per year.

“HyIron’s DRI manufacturing method is completely free of carbon emissions since it uses hydrogen as its energy source. The water used in this process is endlessly recycled, ensuring that no water sources are being exhausted,” Michels says.

James Mnyupe, Namibia’s green hydrogen commissioner, says this is a significant milestone. “While Namibia has significant natural capacity to produce hydrogen at a low cost, the government is not solely focused on marketing hydrogen itself. Instead, we are promoting a stable and conducive environment, rich in the resources needed for cost-effective hydrogen production.

“We aim to establish sectoral legislation and a favourable fiscal framework that will enable the use of hydrogen for industrialisation in Namibia. This will allow us to produce a variety of goods with low-carbon content for international trade.

“Therefore, our focus is not just on hydrogen production but on the development of sustainable industries in Namibia. And HyIron is a case in point.”

Central to this project is HyIron technology, an innovative process to reduce iron ore in a rotary kiln with the help of green hydrogen. It is therefore entirely carbon neutral.

Says Michels: “Every ton of iron produced this way replaces 1.8t of carbon dioxide in the traditional process. Net-zero industrial manufacturing of iron is, already today, economically competitive.”

The most energy-intensive part of iron production is the reduction process, in which iron ore is reduced, losing its oxygen content. Every year, about 1.9-billion tons of iron are produced globally. Two-thirds of that comes from primary production, the extraction of iron ore, and one-third is from recycled materials.

Iron production now relies entirely on fossil fuels. As a result, the iron industry accounts for about 8% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions, making it one of the most significant drivers of climate change. The demand for iron is projected to increase to 2.2-billion tons per year by 2030, implying an annual increase of 50Mt.

Michels explains the technical process underlying production: “Iron ore is an oxide that needs to be reduced by separating it from its oxygen content before it is further manufactured into steel or cast iron. For this process, a reduction agent is required which draws the oxygen from the iron ore.

“Fossil fuels such as coking coals are the most commonly used reduction agents. At HyIron, we replace these with green hydrogen to produce DRI, which is then turned into hot or cold briquetted iron — all of this with zero emissions.”

The product can then be used directly in foundries or steel factories to find its way into daily life as steel or cast iron.

Of course, for solar power to be economically viable, such plants need to be guaranteed extended periods of sunshine. According to a recent report by the International Energy Agency, solar photovoltaic systems in Namibia can generate twice as much electricity as comparable systems in central Europe.

The opportunities for the exploitation of solar power are also available for South Africa, acknowledged to be one of the most sun-rich countries in the world.

According to the World Data Centre for Meteorology, the sunniest place in the world from November to February is the Upington district in the Northern Cape , with a peak of 367 hours a month and an average of nearly 12 hours a day. Over a full 12 months, Keetmanshoop in Namibia is globally the sixth most sunny location (after Yuma and Phoenix in Arizona, two towns in Egypt and one in Chile).",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Dv3HOFSOZv9yKbx_Ibie_XPISWRQ2FiLnT27cXT_gLuaJVIBGH7PN-ZqqtzkZAw9SZYHKDXcg2ir63r51QHosLaYOXl5iu61iqHynn4f2XH0=s1000,N,,2025-04-10 00:00:22.275800

The breach was discovered on February 11, 2025, when Microsoft’s security team alerted the OCC about unusual activities on its network.

The hackers had infiltrated an administrator’s account, allowing them to spy on employee communications, including those of senior deputy comptrollers and international banking supervisors.

According to a draft letter to Congress reviewed by Bloomberg News, this unauthorized access extended from June 2023 until the breach was detected and the affected accounts were disabled.

The OCC, an independent bureau within the U.S. Treasury Department, oversees national banks, federal savings associations, and foreign banks’ federal branches and agencies, which collectively manage trillions in assets.

Critical Information in Compromised Emails

The compromised emails contained critical information regarding these institutions’ financial status, potentially leading to a significant decline in public trust, as noted by OCC Chief Information Officer Kristen Baldwin in the draft letter to Congress.

This incident adds to high-profile cyber breaches targeting U.S. government entities. In December 2024, the Treasury Department disclosed that Chinese state-sponsored hackers had accessed their network through a third-party vendor, viewing unclassified documents and gaining access to former Secretary Janet Yellen’s computer.

Although it remains unclear if the OCC breach is connected to these incidents, a Bloomberg report reveals the pattern of state-sponsored cyber espionage targeting U.S. financial institutions.

The OCC has labeled this breach a “major information security incident” and has taken immediate steps to assess its full scope, engaging external cybersecurity specialists for a comprehensive review of its IT security protocols.

Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney Hood emphasized the need for accountability and the addressing of organizational weaknesses that contributed to this event.

Such breaches have profound implications for the security of financial data and the integrity of the national banking system.

The OCC’s role in ensuring compliance with laws and regulations and its power to enforce actions against banks underscore the critical nature of this breach.

As the investigation continues, the OCC is reviewing its cybersecurity measures to prevent future incidents. This highlights the ongoing challenge of securing sensitive government and financial data against sophisticated cyber threats.

The incident has been reported to the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is pivotal in securing federal systems and sharing threat information.",https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgeIJC32Ooq4SUWHs0lQIUSUk7cA-cmH4Ncss5BrXpW6suSjMZxhMn4b3YxH8J7_eyn4W2rKDscqgqT9F1WpRgnu_6DmmbXvmx4QyRAh__5uNDZ9hlbFY6c4olsPAbZV9HomCiD24EAbd_hlEYhdT0ijlAdIN_wAt2rvtmfKR7dHQ3MwW18dZsC_ybroZJz/s16000/Hackers%20Intercepted%20100+%20Bank%20Regulators%E2%80%99%20Emails%20for%20More%20Than%20a%20Year.webp,N,,2025-04-10 01:00:36.578716

In the broader context of the global trade war with China, tariffs are having a profound impact on the travel industry. When goods become more expensive to import, it leads to higher costs across the board. This extends to the cruise industry, – Carnival Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean International, Norwegian Cruise Line, Princess Cruises, Holland America Line, Celebrity Cruises, MSC Cruises, Disney Cruise Line, Cunard Line, Oceania Cruises, Viking Ocean Cruises, Seabourn Cruise Line, Crystal Cruises, Azamara, Regent Seven Seas Cruises, P&O Cruises, American Cruise Lines, Windstar Cruises, Saga Cruises, which relies heavily on international goods and services for its operations. As costs increase for cruise lines, consumers may see higher prices for their vacations. This may impact travel trends, as more budget-conscious travelers may rethink spending on expensive cruises. Additionally, the uncertainty created by the tariffs could make travelers hesitant, preferring to hold off on booking large trips until the future of U.S.-China trade relations becomes clearer.

U.S. Retail Imports and Global Trade War with China: The Far-Reaching Impacts

The escalating global trade war between the U.S. and China, exacerbated by President Trump’s tariff policies, has been causing widespread disruption. Retail imports into the U.S. are feeling the brunt of these economic shifts. With tariffs climbing to staggering levels, particularly on Chinese goods, U.S. retailers are seeing a decline in the flow of products, forcing many to reduce their inventory or delay new imports. According to trade experts, U.S. cargo volumes from the cruises, Matson Navigation Company, Crowley Maritime Corporation, American Roll-on Roll-off Carrier (ARC), SeaLand, TOTE Maritime, Liberty Global Logistics, Horizon Lines, APL (American President Lines), Maersk Line, Hapag-Lloyd, Ocean Network Express (ONE), Wallenius Wilhelmsen, NYK Line, Grimaldi Group, K Line, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) could see a dramatic drop of 20% in 2025. Retailers, once reliant on Chinese imports, are now scrambling to adjust, and the uncertainty has left them unable to forecast sales accurately.

This decline in imports is not limited to the retail sector; it impacts multiple industries across the U.S., including travel. The global travel sector, including airlines and cruises, relies on the smooth operation of trade routes to maintain competitive pricing on goods and services. As the cost of doing business rises, consumers may turn away from discretionary spending like international travel, cruises, and luxury getaways. The travel sector, in particular, faces a tough road ahead with these higher costs, making it even more challenging to attract the budget-conscious traveler.

How Tariffs Are Transforming the Cruise Sector

The cruise sector is being uniquely affected by the U.S.-China trade war and rising tariffs. Cruise lines are no strangers to the challenges posed by the global economy. From fuel price fluctuations to labor costs, cruise companies must navigate a complex set of external factors. However, with the latest round of tariffs, particularly on Chinese imports, the cruise industry and the cruise lines, Carnival Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean International, Norwegian Cruise Line, Princess Cruises, Holland America Line, Celebrity Cruises, MSC Cruises, Disney Cruise Line, Cunard Line, Oceania Cruises, Viking Ocean Cruises, Seabourn Cruise Line, Crystal Cruises, Azamara, Regent Seven Seas Cruises, P&O Cruises, American Cruise Lines, Windstar Cruises, Saga Cruises faces higher costs for goods sourced internationally, from ship-building materials to luxury items for passengers.

As operational costs increase, cruise lines are faced with the possibility of raising prices, which could push travelers to consider alternative vacation options. In particular, Chinese tourists, who have become a vital segment for the cruise industry, could see a reduction in their ability to travel due to the increased cost of Chinese-made products and higher cruise prices. With China’s own retaliatory tariffs impacting the U.S. economy, both Chinese outbound tourism and U.S. tourism to China could see declines, further disrupting cruise line revenues.

Moreover, as the trade war persists, global uncertainty continues to mount. Consumers may hesitate to book cruises if they feel uncertain about the economy or their financial future. Cruise lines could respond by offering more flexible booking policies and discounts to encourage travelers to lock in vacations despite the volatility. This period of unpredictability could also push cruise lines to rethink their international operations, possibly reducing reliance on certain markets in favor of more stable ones.

The latest Global Port Tracker report, released by the National Retail Federation (NRF) and Hackett Associates, paints a dire forecast for U.S. imports in the coming months, as sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration begin to take their toll. The report predicts a dramatic reduction in cargo arriving at the nation’s major container ports, with a potential drop of 20% year-over-year in imports by the second half of 2025.

Retailers, who have been bringing in goods at an accelerated pace in recent months to stockpile inventory ahead of tariff hikes, are now facing a precarious future. With the imposition of the “reciprocal” tariffs—ranging as high as 50% on several key U.S. trading partners—retailers are expected to scale back their import activities significantly. According to Jonathan Gold, Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy at the NRF, the uncertainty surrounding these tariffs has created anxiety across American businesses, which are now reluctant to make further imports due to unpredictable changes in policy.

Trump’s Unprecedented Tariff Actions on U.S. Trading Partners

The ongoing U.S. trade war has reached new heights with President Donald Trump’s recent decision to impose a 10% tariff on all U.S. trading partners, along with reciprocal tariffs as high as 50%. This move follows earlier tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico and represents an escalation of the already volatile trade climate. In addition to the base tariffs, Trump introduced a national emergency tariff, pushing the total duties on China up to a staggering 104%, a move that has caused significant disruption within the global trade network.

As the tariffs continue to spiral upwards, businesses across sectors are grappling with higher costs and uncertainties about future trade relationships. Retailers, in particular, are feeling the pressure, as the goods they import are now subject to steep tariffs, further driving up costs and narrowing profit margins.

Retailers Brace for Slowdown and Inventory Rebalancing

Retailers have been stockpiling merchandise in anticipation of these tariff hikes, but the window for making preemptive imports has now closed. Gold notes that the 90-day pause that President Trump announced on tariffs for over 75 countries is expected to offer some relief, but it will not fully offset the negative effects on the retail sector. As a result, retailers are expected to rely on their existing inventories to meet consumer demand, at least for the next few months.

However, the long-term effects of this trade war are far from clear. Hackett Associates founder, Ben Hackett, expressed concerns that if the tariffs remain in place, imports could decline by 20% or more in the second half of 2025, potentially dragging overall cargo volume down by 15% year-over-year. The dramatic drop in imports is poised to affect both U.S. retailers and their international suppliers, leading to disruptions in the flow of goods.

The 90-Day Tariff Pause: A Strategic Reversal or Temporary Relief?

In a surprise twist, Trump took to social media to announce a 90-day pause on the latest tariff hikes for 75 countries. This decision comes after a surge of calls from global trading partners, including representatives from the U.S. Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), who are seeking to negotiate a solution to ongoing trade disputes. Trump’s move has been interpreted as an attempt to ease tensions with key allies and give both sides time to find common ground.

While the 90-day pause may offer temporary relief, it is far from a permanent solution. Trump’s announcement still leaves the door open for further tariffs and trade disputes, with the possibility of higher duties being reintroduced after the pause period. For U.S. importers, this creates further uncertainty, as they will need to navigate the shifting landscape of international trade in the coming months.

The Growing Economic Fallout: What’s at Stake for U.S. Industries?

The ripple effects of Trump’s escalating tariffs are already being felt across several industries. Retailers face rising costs, which could lead to higher prices for consumers. The technology sector is particularly vulnerable, as many tech products are manufactured overseas and subject to tariffs, raising production costs and potentially leading to higher prices for consumers. The automotive industry is also impacted, with tariffs on steel, aluminum, and auto parts driving up manufacturing expenses.

The shipping and logistics industries are equally affected by these tariff increases, as rising costs and uncertainty in trade volumes create operational challenges. U.S. ports, especially major container hubs, are likely to see slower growth or even declines in cargo volumes, as businesses cut back on imports and adjust their strategies to deal with the rising tariffs.

Impacts on Container Ports and Global Shipping

Major U.S. container ports are bracing for a slowdown in imports, as retailers pull back on purchases and rely on their existing stockpiles. Hackett’s forecast indicates that U.S. cargo volume could see a net decline of 15% or more in 2025, driven by the combined effects of escalating tariffs and the broader global trade slowdown. Ports, particularly those on the West Coast, which handle a significant portion of U.S.-China trade, are expected to experience dramatic drops in throughput as companies look to cut costs and delay shipments.

The uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy is likely to discourage investment in the global shipping industry, as companies and governments struggle to plan for the future. For now, the situation remains fluid, with the possibility of further changes in tariff rates, trade agreements, and shipping routes.

What Lies Ahead: More Uncertainty or a Path to Resolution?

The situation remains in flux, with President Trump’s 90-day pause offering a temporary respite but not a definitive solution to the ongoing trade war. With China continuing to retaliate with tariffs of its own, and many U.S. trading partners still wary of Trump’s aggressive trade tactics, the global economy is left to grapple with the effects of this escalating conflict.

For now, retailers and businesses across the U.S. and abroad will be forced to adjust to the new reality of higher tariffs and uncertain trade relations. The coming months will be critical in determining whether these trade tensions will ease or intensify, as both the U.S. and its global trading partners navigate a rapidly changing economic landscape. One thing is certain: uncertainty will continue to reign, and businesses must be prepared for the ongoing turbulence in global trade.

Bell argues that Starlink’s flat-rate pricing structure, which offers the same pricing model nationwide demonstrates its ability to operate sustainably without additional financial assistance to serve areas such as the Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. The company contends that subsidies would be better directed toward providers building and maintaining physical infrastructure in the North, according to documents seen by the Financial Times.

Starlink, which was approved to operate in Canada in 2022, has become a widely used option in rural and remote areas, offering high-speed internet via low-Earth orbit satellites. The service is particularly popular in communities where fibre-optic networks are not available. According to the company, it had over 400,000 active subscribers in Canada as of June 2024.

SpaceX disagrees with Bell’s position, stating that excluding Starlink from eligibility would limit consumer choice and potentially increase costs for residents in remote regions. The company has previously faced similar challenges in other jurisdictions — in the United States, a $900 million rural broadband subsidy was withdrawn in 2021 after concerns were raised about cost and performance.

The CRTC opened a public consultation on the subsidy program earlier this year and has said it will make a final decision based on the submissions received. In a January statement, the commission acknowledged that subsidies could help make internet services “more reliable and affordable” in the Far North, where the digital divide remains a persistent issue.

The federal government has entered into several contracts with SpaceX in recent years, including a $2.26 million agreement for Shared Services Canada and another valued at $414,000 for the Innovation, Science and Economic Development agency.

Analysts have warned of rising anti-American sentiment that could hit US brands hard, possibly leading to steeper prices at popular spots like McDonald's. Despite the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) shielding many food imports from tariffs, concerns loom large for companies like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Domino's.

BTIG analyst Peter Saleh expressed to Yahoo Finance his concern over customer backlash in international markets, which could significantly harm American brands. ""The bigger issue, in my mind, is the anti-American pushback in these countries on Western or US brands... we'll see... what companies say when they start reporting in the next couple of weeks if they're starting to see that already.""

Goldman Sachs predicts foreign boycotts could shave off 0.1% to 0.3% from US GDP this year, translating to a $28 billion to $83 billion loss. The tariffs' effect on consumer spending is another source of anxiety for analysts.

UBS analyst Dennis Geiger shared his insights in a note to clients on Monday, stating, ""We view the direct cost impact of tariffs on restaurants as manageable, with a focus on select commodity costs, but see the bigger risk as incremental pressure on consumer spending and industry demand.""

This comes as fast food businesses are just beginning to recover from the impacts of the covid pandemic. McDonald's global same-store sales saw a slight increase of 0.4% last quarter, defying Wall Street's expectations of a 0.91% decrease. However, its US same-store sales were down 1.4% year over year, due to an E. coli outbreak in late October.

The brand's international stores experienced positive same-store sales growth in the Middle East, along with growth in Japan and ""encouraging signs of stabilization"" in China. Last month, it was revealed that McDonalds had been dethroned as the largest restaurant chain in the world by Chinese bubble tea and ice cream chain Mixue Bingcheng.

The bubble tea chain boasts more than 45,000 restaurants worldwide as of September 2024, while McDonald's maintains around 41,800 locations globally, according to Statista via Chowhound. Meanwhile, coffee behemoth Starbucks is still striving for a rebound in its international business.

The company's Q1 results showed total same-store sales were down 4% year over year and international same-store sales fell 4%, while China sales dropped 6%.

While walk-ins are welcome, CVS encourages patients to make an appointment at CVS.com or through the CVS Health app in advance to ensure vaccine availability.
CVS said its pharmacy staff can assist patients in determining whether the vaccine is covered by their insurance plan.","(COLORADO) — Three cases of measles have now been confirmed in Colorado, and health leaders are encouraging vaccination as one of the best preventative methods to avoid becoming infected with this highly contagious disease.

The third measles case in the state was confirmed on Tuesday, April 8 in Pagosa Springs, following previously confirmed cases in Pueblo and Denver.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, measles presents with a number of symptoms, including fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes, followed by a rash that is red and blotchy. Symptoms can appear seven to 14 days after exposure but may take up to 21 days.

Measles is highly transmissible to others. If one person has it, up to nine out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected. An infected person can spread measles to others even before knowing they have the disease—from four days before developing the measles rash through four days afterward.

According to CVS Health, vaccination is the most effective way to help protect people from measles, and may provide some protection if given within the first three days (72 hours) after exposure to measles. CVS Pharmacies across the state of Colorado are offering the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine at more than 50 locations.

Patients ages three and older can receive the MMR vaccine at CVS Pharmacy locations. The first dose, if planned to be given during the recommended age of 12 to 15 months old, cannot be administered at a CVS Pharmacy. People are considered immune to measles if they have received two MMR vaccines or were born before 1957.

While walk-ins are welcome, CVS encourages patients to make an appointment at CVS.com or through the CVS Health app in advance to ensure vaccine availability.

The U.S. has also reportedly withdrawn its delegation from the talks, effective Wednesday.

The response is in line with the administration's combative rhetoric towards carbon regulations and other international agreements, but it is a stark departure from the neutral tone that U.S. negotiators previously maintained. It is unclear whether senior White House leadership was involved in formulating the more accommodating U.S. negotiating position that American representatives projected in the runup to this week's MEPC meeting in London, which ends Friday.

""Should such a blatantly unfair measure go forward, our government will consider reciprocal measures so as to offset any fees charged to U.S. ships and compensate the American people for any other economic harm from any adopted GHG emissions measures,"" the White House wrote in a last-minute warning to other national delegations. ""We must be clear the U.S. rejects any and all efforts to impose economic measures against its ships based on GHG emissions or fuel choice.""

Any participation in a tax on shipping's GHG emissions - the first global carbon levy of any kind - would have been in deep conflict with White House policy on climate change. President Donald Trump campaigned against climate action and withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement on the first day of his second term, and he has promoted the production and use of all fossil fuels - including the renewed use of coal, the most carbon-intensive fuel.

An IMO bunker levy would also boost shipbuilding activity in East Asia, which would undercut White House policy goals. The Trump administration wants to reduce the power of Chinese shipyards, which lead the market and would stand to benefit from any IMO incentives for green retrofits and newbuilds. China's state-owned CSSC is the world's largest commercial shipbuilder, and any additional merchant vessel orders would cross-subsidize its warship deliveries for the PLA Navy, the U.S. Navy's pacing threat.

Some environmental advocates have suggested that action at MEPC is still possible, despite U.S. threats of retaliation (and rumored opposition from certain oil-producing member states).

""Let’s not get dazzled by the drama — this isn’t the United States of Shipping,"" Seas at Risk shipping policy officer Anais Rios told Politico. ""There are 175 countries in the room, and delegates are rolling up their sleeves to find the best path forward.

The first will see Scripps Sports partner with Sports Illustrated on a new biennial all-star tournament called the “SI Women’s Games,” which will feature athletes from six different sports. This year, the tournament will take place in Oceanside, California and run from October 28 to November 2, the companies said.

Teams of athletes representing “Team Americas” and “Team World” will compete in tournament events, including basketball, gymnastics, tennis, volleyball and combat sports. The tournament will broadcast on Ion, the multicast channel acquired by Scripps five years ago. Ion is available on free streaming platforms and on broadcast and cable TV.

“The SI Women’s Games are a groundbreaking opportunity to do what we have always done at Sports Illustrated,” Steve Cannella, the Editor-in-Chief of Sports Illustrated, said in a statement on Wednesday. “This is an exciting new way for us to tell the best stories in sports. We can’t wait to watch these incredible athletes compete in California and celebrate everything they do, both on and off the field.”

“We’re proud to partner with Sports Illustrated, one of the most iconic brands in sports, to showcase and bring the compelling and exciting stories, athletes and events of the SI Women’s Games to every American household,” said Brian Lawlor, president of Scripps Sports. “This is another milestone for Scripps Sports and Ion as a premier destination for the best in women’s sports.”

Additionally, Scripps Sports is teaming up with Intersport to bring the Elevance Health Women’s Fort Myers Tip-Off to broadcast and streaming TV. The tournament formed in 2022, and has established itself as a premier earl season tournament for college-level sports.

The first broadcast will take place on Ion during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend (November 28-29), and will be held at Suncoast Credit Union Arena in Fort Myers, Florida.

“As the popularity of women’s sports among audiences and advertisers continues to explode, the Elevance Health Women’s Fort Myers Tip-Off will immediately become another major sports property for Ion,” Lawlor said. “We’re proud that women’s sports have found a home on Ion, and we look forward to bringing fans the action-packed world of women’s college basketball this fall.”

“Scripps Sports and Ion are now a top destination for women’s sports, and we’re thrilled to partner with them for the Elevance Health Women’s Fort Myers Tip-Off,” said Mark Starsiak, the Senior Vice President of Intersport. “This tournament has proven to be an exciting one for college basketball fans everywhere, and the Scripps Sports team will elevate this event even further.”

Live sports rights are becoming a bigger part of Scripps’ business model as the company seeks to attract and retain viewers and advertisers alike.

For broadcasters, live athletic competitions are “appointment-viewing events,” one where the best experience for the viewer is to watch a game as it happens in real-time, compared to scripted TV series and films, which can be watched and enjoyed on-demand.

Live sports also attracts advertisers because those types of TV events are unlikely to result in a viewer switching across channels or services, or finding other ways to avoid commercial spots.

At its Upfront event Wednesday evening, Scripps touted the prominence of live college and professional sports on its local and national channels as part of a broader strategy to deliver appointment-viewing programs of interest that can reach the broadest audience possible.

In addition to the two tournaments announced on Wednesday, Scripps also had the rights to Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) and National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) games for Ion, and some of its local stations have regional broadcast agreements for NBA and National Hockey League (NHL) games.

But, is anyone watching? So far, the answer appears to be “yes,” with 20 million unique viewers tuning in to watch NWSL matches and shoulder programming on Ion this year, and nearly 23.4 million people tuning in to watch WNBA games last season.",https://thedesk.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/BLANK-Caitlin-Clark-John-Mac-Flickr-WEBP-TD.webp,N,,2025-04-09 20:06:34.515026

There are over 500 CVS pharmacy employees in the state of Arkansas.
HB 1150 would make Arkansas the first state in the country to prohibit PBMs from holding pharmacy licenses.","Arkansas lawmakers in the Senate on Wednesday passed a bill that would stop pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning pharmacies and selling drugs retail in the state. The bill now heads to the governor's desk for her signature.

PBMs are the middlemen who negotiate with insurance companies, manufacturers, and pharmacies to set drug prices. Where the controversy comes in is when PBMs also own their own pharmacies, creating what many believe is a conflict of interest.

Arkansas is leading the charge in regulating PBMs, which the are inflating drug costs and squeezing local pharmacies that aren't affiliated with them.

Federal and state officials and pharmacists alike have criticized the practices of healthcare companies like CVS, which owns their own insurance company, Aetna, their own pharmacies, as well as pharmacy benefit manager, CVS Caremark.

PBMs serve pharmacies, including those outside their ownership, by setting reimbursement rates for drugs sold through health insurance plans. Pharmacists have accused PBMs of using their market power to set reimbursement rates to levels below independent pharmacies' costs while at the same time paying their own affiliated pharmacies many times more than actual drug acquisition costs.

""When you have that conflict of interest, where the fox is guarding the hen house, then you can abuse that power as a monopoly to raise prescription drug prices and limit access for patients,"" said John Vinson, CEO of the Arkansas Pharmacists Association.

CVS has been accused of limiting access to drugs by steering patients with insurance plans using CVS Caremark to their own mail-order pharmacies.

""One day I was standing at the pharmacy counter and they said you can no longer fill here, your insurance isn't going to cover it,"" said Loretta Boesing, founder of Unite for Safe Medications.

Boesing says that news was distressing—her son Wesley nearly died the last time her family had gotten drugs through a CVS mail-order pharmacy, which shipped the medication improperly. Medication Wesley needs daily so his body doesn’t reject the transplanted liver he got at the age of two.

""It was a 102-degree day here in Missouri, one of the hottest on record and they delivered the medication. I got the package, and I felt how hot it was, and I just knew that something didn't feel right. But I thought, surely, they wouldn't do this if it wasn't safe. It was a liquid oral transplant medication,"" Boesing said. ""Wesley at the time was a toddler. So, I gave it to him and then he ended up in the hospital and he was fighting for his life again.""

Boesing says when CVS shipped the drugs improperly again after forcing her to use one of their mail-order pharmacies, she dropped them.

Boesing came to Arkansas to testify in support of HB 1150, which would force companies like CVS to choose between operating as a PBM or owning pharmacies in Arkansas to eliminate the potential for predatory and exclusionary practices.

If CVS chooses to continue operating as a PBM in Arkansas, it will have to close its pharmacies here.

""All 23 stores, all of our CVS pharmacies would be shut down in 2026 and our hundreds of pharmacy colleagues would be displaced. They would be without jobs, myself included,"" said Ashley Ellis, CVS Health's district leader for pharmacy operations in Arkansas.

There are over 500 CVS pharmacy employees in the state of Arkansas.

""We're looking at 340,000 patients that would be affected and would have to find new pharmacies,"" Ellis told KATV.

CVS Health issued the following statement after HB 1150 passed in the Senate Wednesday:

This bill rips medicine away from sick patients and makes it harder for people to achieve better health. A veto will protect communities, improve care, and help hundreds of thousands of Arkansans get the medicines they need. Governor Sanders should choose people over misguided policy that will lead to serious consequences.

Arkansas Pharmacists Association CEO John Vinson said the following in a press release Wednesday evening:

If we want to protect patient choice, lower drug costs and support local businesses, then ending PBM ownership of pharmacies is essential...this bill ensures Arkansans will continue to have access to the quality care they deserve — delivered by trusted local pharmacists, not dictated by out-of-state corporations.

In the viral clip, Nia and Noela calmly question why they’re being asked to leave. A manager repeatedly tells them that service is being refused but offers no clear reason. When asked directly, she says, “To be completely honest with you, I don’t have to have a reason,” and later adds that they had “been seen in here before.” One of the girls responded that she had never been in the store.

The encounter, which took place at the Coronado Center location in February 2024, prompted outrage online as many saw it as an example of discriminatory treatment.

After the video gained renewed attention this week, H&M addressed the incident publicly with a comment posted to its official Instagram page:

“We take the incident from February of last year at our Albuquerque store very seriously. Following the incident, we immediately acted according to our strict guidelines.

'We saw a lot of people before the political stuff were planning on getting PCs, either in the first quarter – which was good for us – or the second quarter. We are seeing people that have five-plus-year old machines, and this is the year they budgeted for it,’ says Michael Goldstein, president of LAN Infotech of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.

The 2025 PC refresh is underway with device shipments up 4.9 percent in the first quarter of the year and commercial customers showing an appetite to buy new devices, however global economic conditions make the outlook for the rest of the year challenging to predict, according to market research firm IDC.

“In a first quarter still relatively untouched by tariffs, the entire ecosystem attempted to accelerate the pace of deliveries to avoid the first round of US tariffs and expected volatility for the remainder of the year,” said Jean Philippe Bouchard, research vice-president with IDC’s Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, in a statement.

Michael Goldstein, president of LAN Infotech, a Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.-based solution provider, told CRN on Wednesday that his commercial customers appear to have baked in the cost of PCs and even stop-and-go tariffs have not slowed down their purchases. Helping all of this is Microsoft’s October deadline for Windows 10 end of life.

“We saw a lot of people before the political stuff were planning on getting PCs, either in the first quarter – which was good for us – or the second quarter,” he said. “We are seeing people that have five-plus-year old machines, and this is the year they budgeted for it.”

Goldstein’s comments to CRN fit what IDC saw in the market as well, with IDC’s Bouchard adding that just how tariffs will factor into the future spend, is still unknown.

“Evidently, commercial demand remained strong in the first quarter, but the new round of US tariffs announced on April 2 could have a direct inflationary impact on the PC market that could result in delayed IT spending for the remainder of the year,” Bouchard said in a statement.

Goldstein said he has not yet heard from vendors around pricing, but he did receive a note from a distribution partner who indicated that any additional tariff costs would be passed on to the buyer.

“You hear one thing, or you hear another. I don’t blame them for not coming up and saying it, because obviously, immediately everyone probably has (inventory),” he said. “If I go onto the disty’s site, I see plenty of desktops and laptops that are physically in stock. So, 30 days from now could change the story.”

Ryan Reith, group vice president with IDC’s Worldwide Device Trackers, said in a statement that so far IDC has not seen any big shifts one way or the other, which is expected given the uneven implementation of the duties.

“So far, our supply chain checks haven’t shown any drastic shifts, but this isn’t surprising as it’s almost too volatile to make drastic business decisions,” he said. “Companies are undoubtedly evaluating everything from inventory on hand, capacity to manufacture by location, possible reroute opportunities to lower import tariffs, and for some, their deal discussions with the US administration. When it comes to hardware like PCs and similar devices, we still maintain the view that most (if not all) price increases will get passed directly to the consumer.”

According to IDC figures, all of the big PC makers increased shipments in the first quarter, with Lenovo shipping 1.5 million more units, HP sent 800,000 more, Dell upped its first quarter shipments by 300,000, and Apple sent 700,000 more.

CPI, in collaboration with global leaders in digital pharma, including AstraZeneca, Atos, AWS, Capgemini, GSK, and Siemens, through its Digital Membership consortium, has launched a pioneering Digital Architecture designed to revolutionise the process of pharmaceutical manufacturing.

Digital Architecture: A Clear Roadmap for Digital Transformation

This cutting-edge framework provides a clear roadmap for integrating digital technologies, overcoming data silos, and enabling real-time release for drug manufacturing. In doing so, it empowers companies to reduce the time taken for product release from days to hours and ultimately drives the industry toward autonomous pharmaceutical manufacturing.

Digitalisation is becoming an urgent priority for pharmaceutical companies, as it plays a pivotal role in driving the decarbonisation of manufacturing processes. With health systems accounting for 5% of global carbon emissions, it’s estimated that digitalisation can cut energy consumption in manufacturing by up to 20%.

Overcoming Challenges with Digital Architecture Integration

For pharma companies striving to implement an autonomous pharmaceutical manufacturing strategy, the challenges of integrating legacy infrastructure, managing vast amounts of siloed data, and justifying capital investment have long been barriers to progress.

The Digital Architecture provides organisations with a structured, step-by-step approach to overcoming these challenges, making seamless digital transformation an achievable reality. It is a first-of-its-kind solution that enables pharmaceutical companies to incrementally integrate their Operational Technology/Information Technology (OT/IT) infrastructure, avoiding the risks of a full-scale digital overhaul. By providing a domain-driven, technology-agnostic approach, this architecture ensures that companies can implement automation at their own pace.

Global Leaders Support Digital Architecture Adoption

The architecture serves as both a roadmap and a coded blueprint and has been developed through the Digital Membership consortium at CPI’s Medicines Manufacturing Innovation Centre, with global leaders in pharmaceuticals, technology, and academic institutions.

Francis O’Doherty, Director, Operations IT at AstraZeneca, said: “AstraZeneca has successfully leveraged the work of this CPI collaboration to define our Autonomous Manufacturing strategy, which has supported our vision of implementing industry-leading pharmaceutical manufacturing and accelerated the development of our future-ready IT architecture.

“A technology-agnostic Digital Architecture empowers us to choose the right solutions for our enterprise, ensuring flexibility and adaptability. Together, we are pioneering a transformative journey towards a digital-first and sustainable future, where AI-driven automation is augmented with human insights and oversight.”

Digital Architecture Helps Remove Barriers to Digitalisation

Dave Tudor, Managing Director of Pharma, HealthTech, and Quality at CPI, said: “The pharmaceutical industry stands at a crossroads. Companies must embrace digitalisation to stay competitive, but the complexity of integrating digital technologies has been a significant challenge.

“CPI’s Digital Architecture removes these barriers, offering a structured, technology-agnostic roadmap that allows companies to scale digital solutions efficiently. Our collaboration with global leaders ensures that this solution is practical, actionable, and aligned with the industry's future needs.”

The Future of Autonomous Pharmaceutical Manufacturing with Digital Architecture

Samantha Jones, Atos Senior Vice President, Healthcare, Life Sciences, and Manufacturing, said: ""Together with CPI’s Digital Membership consortium, our objective is to improve the availability of therapies to patients. Using our extensive experience in digital transformation and blueprinting techniques, we have created assets that de-risk digital implementation and accelerate time to value for new processes.”

Dave Berry, Director of Digital Pharma at CPI, said: “The Digital Architecture is more than just a framework – it’s a coded resource designed to help pharmaceutical manufacturers digitalise their processes more rapidly; in a more strategic and targeted way. It enables companies to address high-impact digitalisation projects today, whilst still knowing those projects will aid the bigger picture of autonomous manufacturing.

“By moving forward with an autonomous pharmaceutical manufacturing strategy, companies can streamline operations, enhance regulatory compliance, and accelerate time-to-market for new therapies.”

Collaborative Success of Digital Architecture

Rob Pears, UK Head of Life Sciences, Manufacturing, and Automotive at Capgemini, said, “We’re committed to accelerating innovation in pharma, alongside our clients and partners. This new Digital Architecture has demonstrated the impact that can be achieved through the collaborative spirit of the ecosystem, and we’ve already seen impressive results across industry. The future of autonomous manufacturing lies in digitalisation and harnessing the power of data, and we look forward to seeing further positive outcomes through this approach for the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors.”",https://www.eurekamagazine.co.uk/media/g0jdyiuj/2148755140.jpg?width=1002&height=564&v=1dba997cb5eb8e0,N,,2025-04-10 04:02:00.725503

Back to Dollar Tree.
I asked a clerk when they had opened and he said ‘This morning.” No hoopla, no advertising, no Chamber of Commerce welcoming committee, no Mayor thanking them for opening another outlet.
Unlike the other Dollar Tree which for months appeared half full.
“Price check on register one.” Another silent opening was a retailer next to the Post Office on N. Escondido Boulevard.","The other day when I stopped in at the Dollar Tree store on W. El Norte Parkway a clerk did not know when the new store would open by Home Depot at W. Valley and 9th. A few days later I checked on the progress of the new store and was surprised to find it open for business. This silent opening is the second such new store I have come across lately.

You may remember I wrote about the largest auto parts store in the County that took over the old Albertsons/Stater Bros and former Rube’s Country Market location. That was another let-me-see-the-progress trip only to find the store already opened without fanfare.

Back to Dollar Tree. As I approached about 2 p.m. I noticed the door open and customers inside. I asked a clerk when they had opened and he said ‘This morning.” No hoopla, no advertising, no Chamber of Commerce welcoming committee, no Mayor thanking them for opening another outlet. I wondered how did these customers, about 20, find out the store was open? Did people just come by the store by accident and find it open?

It was interesting seeing every shelf in every aisle filled with product with some exceptions where an item had been purchased. Unlike the other Dollar Tree which for months appeared half full. It made me chuckle to see UPC scanners in the aisles (yes, plural) so customers can check the price. Hey, the store is called Dollar Tree, actually $1.25. Reminds me of an old joke by a comedian talking about going into a 99 cent store and hearing over the P.A. “Price check on register one.”

Another silent opening was a retailer next to the Post Office on N. Escondido Boulevard. Hibbett Sports, a company I have never heard of, recently opened quietly. According to their website the store is open—however I have yet to see anyone entering or leaving the store and the building shows no sign of life. Even the sign is easily missed. I hope the sporting goods store does well.

Today I saw a photo of the triathlon event Saturday in Oceanside. I get tired just reading about what is involved in this exhausting event. How about a 1.2 mile ocean swim and a 13.1 mile run and a 56 mile bike ride? In my book, anyone who can finish a triathlon deserves much credit, winning or not. Just finishing deserves a trophy.

The photo was closeup shot of a cyclist. Three spectators were shown along this portion of the ride. What struck me was that all three were not looking at the rider but had their faces in their cell phones. Seriously, why attend the event? It didn’t seem they were interested in cheering or giving encouragement to the participants. I wonder if the photographer thought the same after seeing the print.

Here we go again with yet another survey from WalletHub showing no respect for Escondido. This latest highlights the Healthiest Cities in America. Again, with a giant gasp and huh, San Francisco is numero uno in America. How the… never mind. San Diego is #5— even ahead of Surf City aka Huntington Beach at #10. Alas, North County is represented by #39 Oceanside. I’m from New Jersey and when I see Newark ranked at 142 and Detroit, Michigan ranked at 168 how does Escondido not outscore them?

Oh, this is rich. Riverside is rated #101. Years ago my wife’s grandmother lived in Riverside and had to be moved to Escondido—not only to be closer to family but air quality in Riverside was detrimental to her health. She improved dramatically after moving here. Also, Escondido isn’t even on the list of 182 cities.

Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said Wednesday that Americans are behaving as if they're in a recession.

Delta, the first major carrier to report earnings since broad tariffs were announced, has suspended its 2025 forecast due to ""uncertainty.""

Domestic trips have been stalled since late February, Bastian said, adding that corporations and consumers have adopted a ""defensive posture.""

Americans are behaving as if they're in a recession, Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian said Wednesday as the carrier withdrew its full-year forecast.

Corporate and domestic leisure travel has stalled since late February, according to Delta, the first major airline to release earnings since widespread tariffs were announced. Demand has waned because of bad weather, ""high-profile aircraft incidents,"" and global economic uncertainties, Bastian told CNBC.

""We're acting as if we're going [into] a recession. I think everyone is going into a defensive posture,"" Bastian said. ""...If that continues and we don't get resolution soon, we will probably end up in a recession.""

Delta reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results but said it would not affirm full-year projections at this time ""given current uncertainty."" Current-quarter revenue is seen between 2% below to 2% above Q2 2024 levels, the company said.

Delta had planned to expand its capacity by about 4% in the second half of 2025, but no longer envisions growing, Bastian said. Business travel was up about 10% before stalling, he added. Price-sensitive consumers are buying fewer domestic tickets, the CEO said, adding that international travel, summer bookings, and premium ticket sales remain strong.

'Uncharted, Unprecedented Uncertainty'

""We're in uncharted, unprecedented uncertainty,"" Bastian said, adding that it was a ""self-inflicted situation.""

UBS analysts downgraded a number of airline stocks days after the Trump administration unveiled ""reciprocal"" tariffs on goods from most of the U.S.' trading partners.

Last month, several airlines lowered their forecasts as Americans were growing uneasy about the economy and planning fewer trips, executives said.

""We are seeing what others are seeing,"" JetBlue Airways (JBLU) CEO Joanna Geraghty said at a conference last month, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. ""The peaks remain healthy. The troughs obviously are under pressure.""

Consumers spent ""around 6% below 2024 levels at the start of this year"" on airfare, according to Bank of America's analysis of debit and credit card spending released March 28.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PqRA8gtRd9d1Y.x9x8zrww--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/investopedia_245/ec3b76f8de34b3a1225ec8bc0a896ccf,N,,2025-04-09 20:06:21.561798

Last year, we saw Google announce Axion at its Google Cloud Next event, its first Arm-based CPU for data centres.","At its big annual cloud event, Google Cloud Next ‘25, Google announced a massive wave of new AI tech aimed at helping businesses work faster, cheaper, and more creatively. Here’s an overview of the big news from the opening keynote today.

Over the past year, Google says it rolled out 3,000+ updates to its cloud services. This includes improvements to Google Workspace (such as Gmail, Docs, etc.) and its AI tools. More than 4 million developers are already using its Gemini AI models, and companies are now building apps with tools like Vertex AI, Imagen (for images), and Veo (for videos).

A New Kind of Network

Google also said its cloud network which moves at “Google speed” is now available for billions of users globally at near zero latency. Dubbed Cloud WAN, Google says it is the new global internet backbone for the enterprise. Basically, it lets businesses plug into Google’s private internet network, making things run up to 40% faster and cheaper compared to old-school setups.

Next-Gen AI Hardware: Meet Ironwood

Google revealed its seventh-get Ironwood TPUs – powerful computer chips made for running large AI models. These chips are over 10 times more powerful than previous versions, giving businesses a major upgrade in computing power for AI tasks like image generation, chatbots, and more.

They’re also rolling out new GPUs from NVIDIA, faster storage systems, and smarter software to help all this tech run smoothly and at lower cost.

Smarter AI Models

Google launched Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash, the newest versions of its Gemini AI. Pro is great at deep thinking tasks like medical reports or coding, while Flash is built for fast, low-cost tasks like customer service chats or quick summaries.

They also showed off Imagen 3, which makes high-quality images from text; Chirp 3 for creating custom voices with just 10 seconds of audio; Lyria for making music from text prompts; and Veo 2, which generates and edits videos with cool features like background removal and screen resizing.

AI for Everyone

Google introduced Agentspace, a tool that helps everyday employees use AI at work—no coding required. Workers can ask AI to summarize reports, generate ideas, or find documents across their company.

Agentspace has new improvements, such as Agent Designer, a drag-and-drop tool that lets anyone create custom AI helpers, and Deep Research, an agent that digs into complex topics for you and returns an easy-to-read report.

More Use Cases: From Doctors to Developers

Google shared some practical examples of how its AI agents are making big moves in the real world for clients:

Healthcare & Retail: Doctors can search patient data more easily. Retailers like Lowe’s are using Google AI to recommend products.

Call Centres: Google’s AI now understands emotions and can even see live video to help respond better.

Creative Work: Brands like Kraft Heinz and Agoda are using Google’s AI tools to make ads and travel videos faster and more cheaply.

Coding: Google says 25% of its own code is now written by AI. New tools can help with debugging, planning, and coding in teams.

Data & Security: Their new “alert triage agent” can figure out if a cybersecurity alert is real or not, and explain why.

Google’s big push this year is to make powerful AI tools more accessible to everyone—from companies dealing with sensitive data (on local servers) to employees using a spreadsheet. The focus is on speed, cost-saving, creativity, and flexibility.

Last year, we saw Google announce Axion at its Google Cloud Next event, its first Arm-based CPU for data centres.

Topics: Leadership Communications","Ragan’s Council Career Conversations, a recurring video series from Ragan’s Communications Leadership Council, allows members to share the strategies that made them leaders and the lessons they’ve learned about their careers.

Lauren Libitz, senior director of global communications at ThermoFisher Scientific, told Ragan that a sense of agility is a must for ascendant communications leaders.

“As a leader, you need to be agile and flexible with not only what’s going on in the outside world but with what’s going on in your particular company,” Libitz said.

She added that comms leaders also need to lean into transparency with their teams.

“The more transparent you can be as a leader, the more effective you can be as a leader,” she said. “It’s a combination of being able to flex and approach things differently depending on the environment and being able to tell you’re team what you’re doing.”

Libitz also shared that leaders should think deeply about how they show up every day for their teams.

“Now that you’ve been given an opportunity to step up as a leader, what does that mean?” she posited. “As you shift from the day-to-day and you get a seat at the table, how are you going to use it?”

The company has had a location in East Abilene for about 20 years. It needed space to expand its operations. To that end, it is working with the Development Corporation of Abilene (DCOA) to help secure its next location. DCOA President and CEO Misty Mayo explains that this project will only benefit Abilene in the long run.

“The Development Corporation works every day to ensure that both local existing companies, as well as companies outside of the Abilene area, hear about what a great place Abilene is to do business. Abilene is the premier destination for business expansion, so R+L Carriers will build a new 58,000-square-foot facility in the Development Corporation of Abilene Access Business Park,” shared Mayo.

Located in East Abilene, right across from Great Lakes Cheese, this new facility is expected to create 22 full-time jobs while retaining 16 existing positions. Over the next 10 years, it is estimated to generate an economic impact of $173 million and beyond, both directly and indirectly.

“When companies can get the supplies they need, they can continue to grow. As companies continue to grow, that means more jobs for our citizens; it means more jobs for our children and for our grandchildren. When we’re building primary jobs, we’re building a core for our community. As we build a core for our community, we’re building a future for our community,” added Mayo.

Construction for this project is expected to begin sometime this year. Another project in early development, Hamilton, is also in the works and expected to create 33 new jobs. The company’s name will be released later.

“Project Hamilton will mean new jobs for a local existing company. It’s 33 new jobs, and it’s 19 existing employees who will have an opportunity to continue to grow with their company. It’s exactly the type of project that the DCOA continues to work on every day, working with local existing primary employers to help them grow their existing footprint,” explained Mayo.",https://www.bigcountryhomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2025/04/PKG.00_00_50_00.Still004_8216b5.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-04-09 19:05:56.716991

Read more analyst ratings on DELL stock","Personal computer (PC) shipments rose in this year’s first quarter as orders and deliveries increased with companies scrambling to get ahead of import tariffs.

Research firm Canalys estimates that shipment for PCs rose more than 9% during Q1, while data from IDC Research pegs the growth at 5% from a year earlier. The growth translates into about 63 million PC units shipped in the first three months of the year.

The growth is good news for PC makers such as Dell Technologies (DELL) and HP Inc. (HPQ), as well as PC component manufacturers such as Logitech International (LOGI). The rise in PC shipments comes as companies and consumers raced to beat the deadline for U.S. President Donald Trump’s import tariffs, which threatened to raise prices for computers and other electronics that are made outside America.

Return to Growth

The Q1 sales growth was especially welcome given that the PC market has been largely stagnant in recent years following a surge in purchases during the Covid-19 pandemic when people were working and going to school remotely from home. In 2024, worldwide PC shipments increased only 1% after two straight years of declines, according to IDC data.

Despite the strong sales between January and March, it remains to be seen how President Trump’s ongoing tariffs will impact demand going forward, especially with a 125% tariff placed on goods imported from China, where much of the world’s PC manufacturing takes place. Canalys said notebook shipments grew 10% during Q1 to more than 49 million units, while desktop shipments rose 8%.

Is DELL Stock a Buy?

The stock of PC maker Dell Technologies has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 14 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 11 Buy and three Hold recommendations issued in the past three months. The average DELL price target of $134.39 implies 60% upside from current levels.

Google Cloud has taken a major step toward revolutionizing how marketers and agencies operate by unveiling new AI-driven tools designed to simplify marketing processes and elevate customer experience. The announcement was made during the company’s much anticipated Next ’25 conference held in Las Vegas from April 9 to 11.

The new developments come at a time when marketers globally are under increasing pressure to meet evolving consumer expectations, manage longer buying journeys, and cut through a growing clutter of information overload. According to Carrie Tharp, Vice President for Global Solutions and Industries at Google Cloud, AI is key to navigating these shifting dynamics and regaining marketing efficiency.

Google Cloud’s latest innovations include the integration of Lyria, a generative text-to-music AI model, into its Vertex AI platform. This positions Google as the only platform currently offering generative capabilities across video, image, speech, and music. Brands can now create custom soundtracks for product launches, branded content, or immersive in-store experiences with unprecedented ease and speed.

Major global brands are already leveraging these AI tools. L’Oréal Groupe is using Vertex’s Veo and Imagen tools to speed up the creation of high-quality visual assets across 20 countries, while Kraft Heinz has reported an eight-week creative process being compressed.

Closer to home, this innovation signals a significant opportunity for Nigerian and African brands that want to stay globally competitive. With growing access to AI-powered platforms, agencies and marketers across the continent can explore how these tools can reduce production timelines, personalize customer journeys, and generate real-time campaign insights, into just eight hours using Google’s AI capabilities. According to the company, these tools are reshaping how creative teams approach content development, from ideation to execution.

Google’s Creative Agencies are also being adopted by major industry players. WPP has integrated them into its Open platform, Brandtech Group is using Pencil to predict and optimize ad performance, and Papa Johns has partnered with Google to use AI across ordering, delivery, and marketing. The potential for localized, one-to-one marketing through these tools marks a paradigm shift in how data-driven customer engagement is executed.

Google Cloud says its focus remains on simplifying these innovations so marketers, merchants, analysts, and brand managers can seamlessly integrate them into their daily processes. As brands increasingly seek speed, creativity, and personalization. Google’s latest offerings are poised to set a new standard for how modern marketing is done.",https://marketingedge.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image_fx-3.png,N,,2025-04-09 17:07:13.542186

Dr. Saltman referenced the Third Party Review Program, where accredited Third-Party Review Organizations can review low-to-moderate risk medical devices.

Liberation Day dilemmas Though not directly tied to FDA layoffs, the tariffs imposed by the current administration could be devastating to medical device manufacturing, commercialization, and innovation.","During an April 7 session of the Biopharma Congress, Janet Woodcock, MD, former acting FDA Commissioner and former principal deputy commissioner of food and drugs, called the recent FDA staff cuts a “slow-moving catastrophe.”

Dr. Woodcock was referring to drug development, but the same could be said for medical device development. Devices will still move through the regulatory pathways, but the process could take longer, and there could be mistakes.

Jeff Shuren, MD, longtime director of FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), who retired last year, said during Biopharma Congress and during a recent NAMSA webinar that “it would not be surprising if we saw longer review times, at least in the near term.”

That’s because CDRH recently lost 3,500 employees, many of them involved in premarket review. Some of those individuals could be reinstated—or not. And that’s if they decide to come back.

Dr. Shuren said FDA will need to focus on recruitment and retention as well as leverage digital tools to improve efficiency. Generative AI is a possible solution for certain tasks, such as email composition and similar low-risk tasks. The Digital Health Policy Navigator can help developers determine the regulatory status of a given software function.

R.I.P. open communication

Of the many concerns that arise from staff cuts, Martin Leon, MD, Mallah Family Professor of Cardiology at Columbia University, director of Columbia Care Center for Interventional Care at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, and founder of Cardiovascular Research Foundation, said he observed that FDA “no longer has a public-facing interaction capability.” That interaction refers to the early and open communication FDA worked for years to establish.

“What we were most proud of was the fact that we had open communication with the agency,” he said. “We could discuss regulatory science, we could brainstorm new ways to be able to improve how we manage certain approval processes…that dynamic of an open communication process was extremely helpful.”

Dr. Leon’s statement sparked a new question from webinar moderator and NAMSA Chief Medical Officer Adam Saltman, MD, PhD: Should the industry step in to fill in the gaps? Dr. Saltman referenced the Third Party Review Program, where accredited Third-Party Review Organizations can review low-to-moderate risk medical devices. Could we do more of that?

Juan Granada, MD, president and CEO of the Cardiovascular Research Foundation, said he would applaud potential public-private collaboration, such as between FDA and CROs, to assist with certain reviews. However, device clearance processes must remain standardized, and the collaboration must not add complexity to an already complex process.

Ken Ouriel, MD, an executive VP and KOL managing director at NAMSA, reminded the panel that medical device companies pay hefty fees to work with FDA. User fees cover about half of the FDA’s total budget.

Liberation Day dilemmas

Though not directly tied to FDA layoffs, the tariffs imposed by the current administration could be devastating to medical device manufacturing, commercialization, and innovation. “If you have to bring in materials that are more expensive, or are no longer available, or if we damage relationships with countries that have certain expertise, that’s going to affect importation, manufacturing, and cost,” said Dr. Granada. “And if someone puts tariffs on medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that’s going to make access even more complicated for countries that need them.”

Leon agreed, noting that FDA, NIH, and CDC have done a great job at fostering global connections. However, “tariffs really do fragment relationships, and those relationships have been forged over the course of decades,” he said.

To counter some of the negative chatter about globalization, Leon suggests manufacturers emphasize positive outcomes where possible. “Some of the most important medical products we've developed have resulted from global communications and global interactions because there is great science all around the world,” he said. “And when you put people together, it really is synergistic. So I would try to emphasize that it's embedded within the entire innovation process. Make that a key point: we can't function in isolation and expect to achieve what we've been able to achieve over the past several decades.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt14ac89070d5e4751/blte57a652d95a4ded6/67f6d7b5ddb6d87ab6291e15/Copy_of_MD_DI_Quote_Graphic_(1600x900)_(1).png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-04-09 21:00:32.881280

Within the shelf-stable grated cheese category, dollar sales suffered a small YoY dollar sales loss of 2% to $671 million, while unit sales dipped by 1% to 154 million.","Overall, it has been a strong past 52 weeks for cheese, especially when looking at the natural cheese category. There were some pockets of weakness however, mainly the processed cheese and grated cheese subcategories, according to Chicago-based market research firm Circana’s data for the 52 weeks ending Jan. 26.

Let’s start with the natural cheese category, which counts natural cheese-shredded, natural cheese-chunks, natural cheese-slices, natural cheese-string/stick, natural cheese crumbled, natural cheese-all other forms, ricotta cheese, natural cheese-cube and refrigerated grated cheese as subcategories. Impressively, all of these subcategories had year-over-year (YoY) dollar-sales improvements compared to the prior 52-week period, with the exceptions of ricotta cheese and natural cheese-cube. Yet, both of those subcategories only suffered small losses of less than 1%, respectively.

The entire natural cheese category saw dollar sales rise by 3% YoY to $20.6 billion, while unit sales enjoyed the same YoY percentage increase to 5.1 billion. Looking at specific subcategories, we’ll kick it off with natural cheese-shredded, whose YoY dollar sales picked up a 1% gain to $7.4 billion, matched by the same YoY percentage gain in unit sales to 1.98 billion. Leading the way in the natural cheese-shredded subcategory is private label, whose dollar sales picked up 0.4% YoY to $5.2 billion, along with a 1% unit sales rise to 1.4 billion, Circana data reports. A big standout in this subcategory was No. 6 seller V&V Supremo Foods. The Chicago-based company’s dollar sales rose 42% YoY to $91 million, bested by a 51% unit sales increase to just shy of 10 million.

The natural cheese-chunks subcategory also had a strong year, Dollar sales gained 7% to $5.78 billion, while unit sales jumped 8% YoY to 1.26 billion. The top seller here is once again private label, gaining 8% YoY to $2.1 billion in dollar sales, bested by a 10% unit sales rise to 601 million. No. 2 seller, Tillamook County Creamery Association, also had a solid year, with dollar sales picking up 11% YoY to $399 million, pairing well with a 13% jump in unit sales to 57 million.

Natural cheese-slice dollar sales eked out a small 0.5% YoY gain to $3.7 billion, but unit sales came in at just over $1 billion, good for a 4% improvement, Circana data reveals. Once again, private label took the top spot in this subcategory, with dollar sales rising 4% YoY to $1.9 billion and unit sales pocking up a slid 7% YoY to 640 million. A star in this subcategory was Cabot Creamery. The Vermont-based division of Agri-Mark enjoyed a 19% YoY dollar sales increase to just shy of $60 million, along with a 16% YoY unit sales jump to 16 million.

Next up is natural cheese-string/stick, whose dollar sales improved by 2% YoY to $1.8 billion, but unit sales suffered a small loss of 1% to 391 million. Private label, again, assumed the top spot in this subcategory. It outpaced many competitors, evidenced by its 5% YoY dollar sales increase to $626 million, with unit sales gaining the YoY percentage gain to 151 million. Enjoying a strong year in this subcategory was Lactalis American Group, the No. 4 seller. The Buffalo, N.Y.-based company saw dollar sales and unit sales both jump 15% YoY to $119 million and 18.5 million, respectively.

Natural cheese-crumbled’s overall dollar sales rose 2% to $636 million, with unit sales increasing a similar 1% to 133.4 million. For the first time, private label was not the leading seller in this subcategory. Instead, this honor goes to Seymour, Wis.-based Emmi Roth USA Inc., whose dollar sales popped by 3% YoY to $165 million, as well as a 0.3% unit sales gain to 30.3 million. No. 5 seller, Monroe, Wis.-based La Morenita Food Products, had a strong year in this subcategory, enjoying a 15% YoY dollar sales rise to $43 million and a 13% unit sales rise to 5.5 million, according to Circana.

Next up is natural cheese-all other forms, which sported a robust 8% YoY jump to $546 million and a 5% unit sales gain to $106 million, for the 52-week period ending Jan. 26. The No. 1 seller for that timeframe was Belgioioso Cheese. The Green Bay, Wis.-based company’s dollar sales and unit sales both gained 5% YoY to $198 million and 35 million, respectively. Although on a much smaller scale, Bel Brands USA has to be mentioned for its growth in the natural cheese-all other forms subcategory. The Chicago-based company’s dollar sales came in $15.2 million and unit sales reached 1.43 million. Each skyrocketed by more than 8 million percentage points YoY, states Circana.

When it comes to ricotta cheese, dollar sales dipped by 0.6% YoY to $321 million, along with unit sales declining by nearly 1% to 76.5 million. Private label is the leading seller in this subcategory, with its dollar sales bucking the overall trend by rising 3% YoY to $133.5 million and unit sales picking up 1% to 38 million. Another standout in this subcategory was Saputo Cheese USA Inc., whose dollar sales and unit sales both increased by 11% YoY to $7.6 million and 1.4 million, respectively.

Natural cheese-cubed also saw slight YoY declines, as dollar sales dipped by 0.3% to $222 million and unit sales came in at 60 million, a 1% YoY loss, Circana data shows. Private label was the leader in this category, with dollar sales rising 3% to $138.5 million, while unit sales increased by 1% to 42.5 million. Green Bay, Wis.-based BelGioioso Cheese was a superstar in this subcategory, as its dollar and unit sales both rose by 19% to $3.8 million and 767,254, respectively.

The final subcategory under natural cheese is refrigerated grated cheese, which had a fantastic 52-week period. Dollar sales skyrocketed by 14% YoY to $203.5 million, pairing nicely with an 11% unit sales jump to 38.6 million. Many of the top 10 sellers in this subcategory enjoyed strong double-digit YoY gains, including No. 2 seller BelGioioso Cheese (dollar sales up 23% YoY to $43.5 million and unit sales up 26% YoY to 9 million); No. 4 seller, Darlington, Wis.-based Mexican Cheese Producers (dollar sales up 32% to $16 and unit sales up 29% to 2.8 million); and No. 6 seller, Sarasota, Fla.-based Boar’s Head Provision Co.

Moving on to the processed cheese category, overall, dollar sales lost 2% YoY to $3.6 billion and unit sales dropped 1% to 745 million. Under processed/imitation cheese slices, the subcategory dipped by 2% YoY to $2 billion, while unit sales declined by 1% to $461 million. While Chicago-based Kraft Heinz Co. was the No. 1 seller in this subcategory, its dollar sales and unit sales both dropped by 2% YoY to $1.23 billion and 227 million, respectively. One dairy processor among the top 10 achieved both double-digit YoY dollar and unit sales improvement. This honor is bestowed upon Amsterdam, Netherlands-based Flora Food Group, whose dollar sales jumped by 14% YoY to $20.4 million, while unit sales rose 16% to 4 million, Circana data reveals.

Next under the processed cheese category is cheese balls-spreads, whose overall dollar sales improved by 3% YoY to $682 million, while unit sales picked up 2% to 132 million. The No. 1 seller in this subcategory for the period ending Jan. 26 was Bel Brands USA, picking up 8% in dollar sales to $355 million, along with a 6% unit sales rise to 68 million. A star in this subcategory is No. 2 seller Chairmans Foods. The Nashville based company’s dollar sales and unit sales both jumped 14% to $70 million and 11.4 million, respectively.

The processed/imitation cheese/loaf subcategory had a rough year, with dollar and unit sales dipping 4% YoY to $386 million and 49 million, respectively. Kraft Heinz was the No. 1 seller in this subcategory for the 52 weeks ending Jan. 26. Its dollar sales dropped by 4% YoY to $370.5 million, as well as a 3% unit sales drop to 46.6 million. Placing second in this smaller subcategory was private label, which suffered a 12% YoY dollar sales loss to $14.3 million and a 16% unit sales loss to 2.4 million, per Circana data.

Under processed/imitation cheese-all other, the subcategory dipped by 2% to $271 million, as well as the same unit sales percentage loss to 49 million.

Processed/imitation cheese-shredded suffered a down year, as dollar sales plummeted by 8% YoY to $111 million, with unit sales dropping by the same percentage to 27 million.

Lastly, under the processed cheese category is aerosol/squeezable cheese spreads. This subcategory had a difficult year, as dollar sales dropped by 7% YoY to $109 million, while unit sales dropped by 6% YoY to 26 million. Mondelēz International led the way in this subcategory, but its dollar sales declined by 8% YoY to $71 million.

Margaret McDonald has spent the past 26 years collecting and using data to advance improvements in home health and community-based care.

An administrative leader of the only research center embedded in a home care organization, she guides a team of 30 researchers. Her team’s National Institutes of Health-funded research studies have focused on improving healthcare for the country’s most vulnerable populations, including homebound older adults, people living with disabilities, underserved minority groups, and those with multiple chronic conditions who need support to live independently and avoid unnecessary hospitalizations.

McDonald is a mentor to junior researchers and fosters collaboration among her team and other clinicians, scientists and providers.

“As a leader, Margaret keenly understands the importance of listening and collaboration,” noted her Pinnacle Award nominator. “Her vision is as essential as it is expansive.”

McDonald’s research has made significant contributions to the home care field. In a recent study, she and her team used technology to identify people at higher risk of adverse medication-related events and developed a plan to mitigate those risks. That study helped facilitate the development and integration of new decision support tools for medication management.

She also has overseen primary data collection and clinical intervention research of more than 4,000 patients and caregivers. This effort has involved conducting in-home interviews and observations to gain insights from people receiving in-home care to improve understanding of those issues and the challenges facing patients managing complex clinical conditions.

Often honored, McDonald has co-authored more than 100 peer-reviewed scientific publications and a variety of other publications.

She earned a Master of Social Work degree from Fordham University and a bachelor’s degree in health administration from the New York University Stern School of Business.

McDonald started her career as a research coordinator at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.

MINNEAPOLIS — As wildfire response and emergency rescue demands grow, ensuring first responders have the right tools at their disposal is more critical than ever. Polaris Government and Defense has supported fire and rescue operations for decades, providing off-road vehicles and job-specific accessories that enhance traditional apparatus fleets – helping departments increase mobility and reduce response times in remote areas and during disaster response. Expanding its portfolio of purpose-built solutions, Polaris introduces two new QTAC firefighting skids from MTECH, Inc.: the 9HP Fire & Rescue and Ultra High Pressure (UHP) Firefighting Skids, validated for RANGER XD 1500, RANGER XP 1000 and RANGER XP Kinetic.

“It is imperative that fire and emergency teams respond with confidence, and that means having the right equipment to get the job done efficiently and effectively,” said Tony Stanley, business development, Polaris Government and Defense. “Polaris continues to drive innovation in emergency response mobility. The introduction of our new firefighting skids, alongside our proven lineup of fire and rescue UTVs and turn-key packages, furthers our commitment to equipping first responders with high-performance, mission-ready solutions.”

With new legislation proposing increased funding and resources – including response time standards – highly mobile, rapidly deployable emergency vehicles are essential. Polaris fire and rescue UTVs are designed to meet this need, improving response time and extending reach without compromising mobility, budget or effectiveness. When equipped with fully validated QTAC skids, these vehicles offer integrated water transport, pump and hose systems and patient transport solutions.

New QTAC Fire & Rescue Skid Offerings for RANGER Vehicles

The QTAC 75UHP Firefighting Skid delivers powerful fire suppression in a compact, cost-effective package, utilizing ultra-high-pressure (UHP) pump technology originally developed by the U.S. Air Force. With a flow rate of 6.7 GPM at 1,200 psi, it maximizes efficiency, providing 11 minutes of continuous firefighting on a single 75-gallon tank. Built from impact-resistant, non-corrosive copolymer, it features a 2.5-gallon foam cell, an electric UHP technology offers key advantages over traditional centrifugal systems, including smaller water droplets that convert to steam faster for efficient heat transfer, reduced water consumption to minimize damage and enhanced foam penetration to cut off the fire’s fuel source and prevent re-ignition.

The QTAC 9HP Fire and Rescue Skid is a UTV EMS firefighting system featuring a unique, flip-down rescue litter platform. This convertible design maintains a compact footprint while utilizing a 60-gallon welded-copolymer tank. When secured in the down position, the platform accommodates a full-size rescue litter and when folded, it remains compact enough to allow the tailgate of a standard short-bed UTV to close. Equipped with a 9HP pump with a standard electric start, the skid ensures reliable water delivery and the capability to draft from an auxiliary water source.

Manufactured by MTECH, Inc., QTAC fire and rescue skids are specially integrated on Polaris RANGER utility vehicles, with a purposely designed mounting system from Polaris – allowing for easy install and removal of the skid with no drilling or modifying of the UTV. QTAC skids are built with PolyTough® construction, a lightweight ultra durable material that withstands extreme temperatures for the highest level of performance for years to come. The 75UHP Firefighting Skid and the 9HP Fire and Rescue Skid are available on RANGER XD 1500, RANGER XP 1000 and RANGER XP Kinetic UTVs.

New QTAC Fire & Rescue Skid Offerings for RANGER Vehicles

The company’s lineup of validated Fire and Rescue vehicle packages complete with QTAC Fire and Rescue skids, including the QTAC Firefighting skid, the QTAC Fire & Rescue Skid and the QTAC Rescue Skid will be on display at FDIC International in Polaris booth #3265, April 10-12 in Indianapolis.

The QTAC Firefighting Skid is capable of drafting, applying retardants and small-scale fire suppression. It is ideal for use cases such as small to large scale prescribed burn control, grass and prairie burns and incident mop-up. The firefighting skid features additional options, including a 2.5-gallon foam capacity, a draft hose kit, an electric hose reel option, a viper nozzle and a 9-horsepower version with electric start.

The Fire & Rescue Skid includes a unique, convertible rescue litter platform that allows for the tailgate to be closed on the UTV when not in use. This skid is ideal for the same use cases as the firefighting skid with the addition of remote rescue and public event safety. The Fire & Rescue Skid can also be equipped with optional 2.5-gallon foam capacity, a draft hose kit, electric hose reel option and a viper nozzle. Options also include a 6-horsepower and 9-horsepower version.

The QTAC Rescue Skid has a full-size rescue area, sliding storage and an attendant seat, with optional IV pole and O2 bottle mounts available. The skid is ideal for remote rescue operations and public event safety.

QTAC fire skid options feature water capacities between 60 and 85 gallons and Waterax Versax 6 or 9-horsepower pumps for maximum capacity and reliability. Each skid configuration can be mounted to RANGER XP 1000, RANGER XD 1500 and RANGER XP Kinetic vehicles.

Built to help responders navigate areas inaccessible to traditional vehicles, this year’s FDIC lineup includes the RANGER CREW XD 1500 NorthStar, RANGER CREW XP 1000 and RANGER XP 1000 NorthStar Standard. Each vehicle will be specifically outfitted for fire and rescue operations.

Polaris Fire and Rescue UTVs

Polaris firefighting UTVs incorporate a professional system that is familiar, and fire skid packages incorporate a capable pump, hose and reel, tanks for water and foam and the ability to draft from an external water source. Rescue vehicles incorporate a rear attendant seat is also available, which includes the fire tank and equipment option for the rear equipment skids to be removed all together for additional applications or use by other departments. Custom graphics and body panels can be added so vehicles match the rest of the fleet. And these UTVs are compatible with traditional Polaris accessories options.",https://lexipol.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dc6d9ca/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1080+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-lexipol.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff5%2Fc7%2Ff77d3c614332ab9b7ccaeccebebd%2Ffr1-affiliate-images-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 17:07:31.206593

H&M is taking a high-profile leap into generative AI, creating digital twins of 30 real-life models for use in ads and social content. The move is already stirring debate.

For some, the move is a savvy blend of tech and trend. For others, it raises thornier questions about authenticity, creativity, and what happens when “real” people are rendered optional.

H&M says the project is deeply collaborative. “We are doing this in close collaborations with other creatives within the industry, as well as model agencies and the models themselves, who will hold the right of usage to their digital twin,” said Jörgen Andersson, H&M’s chief creative officer, in a statement. “We are curious to explore how to showcase our fashion in new creative ways -- and embrace the benefits of new technology -- while staying true to our commitment to personal style. This initiative is about exactly this: exploring the benefits of what generative AI can bring to the creative process… Ultimately, H&M’s purpose is to liberate fashion for the many and to celebrate self-expression in everything we do.”

While other fashion brands -- including Levi’s, Calvin Klein, Prada, and Balmain -- have dabbled in AI-generated models, H&M’s approach takes things a step further. By creating digital twins of real people, the retailer is exploring how these avatars might function not just as visual assets, but as influencers in their own right.

“It’s inevitable this will be adopted quite widely by brands,” says Karen Fielding, chief strategy officer at General Idea, which works with luxury clients including Louis Vuitton and Coach. “How they adopt it, and in which places, will be what’s interesting.”

In practical terms, the appeal is clear: AI speeds up content production, cuts costs, and reduces the need for time-consuming photo shoots. But from a branding perspective, the move is more complex -- especially for a company built on the tension between accessibility and aspiration. “H&M’s business model has always been delivering a Vogue-like kind of brand image at the cheapest possible price,” Fielding says. “To me, the question is, are they still delivering that kind of luxury and image, if they're using this technology rather than real people?”

Ansley Williams, head of influence at Ogilvy North America, sees opportunity in the technology's use, but urges caution. “Does this effort serve a creative purpose? Is this a cost-saving move? Or a different way to appeal to the consumer?” she asks. She notes that Ogilvy has worked extensively with virtual influencers, including Lu from Brazilian retailer Magalu, who has built a large and loyal following by blending digital identity with human-like storytelling.

Williams says consumers deserve transparency about what they’re seeing. “We’re really passionate about disclosure,” she says. But she also believes the real opportunity lies in augmenting -- not replacing -- human connection. “From a creative perspective, people build connection with real people. And when they see real humans being able to interact with clothing and fashion, it adds a human element.”

She predicts a kind of aesthetic whiplash as AI-generated visuals become more common, with a rebound toward messy, imperfect, unmistakably human content. “Maybe we’ll just completely bounce back to what’s true in reality,” she says.

Fielding agrees, especially for luxury. As AI floods the market with infinite amounts of polished but generic imagery, she expects high-end brands to double down on emotional storytelling, craftsmanship, and imperfection. “There will be a move to things that are human -- handmade, imperfect things,” she says. “And those will become more prevalent in luxury.”

But just as most people will never be able to distinguish between a real Hermes bag or a fake, consumers aren’t likely to spend much time poring over the endless stream of fashion images, challenging themselves to spot the imposters.

Hatfield, through his attorney, told The Oregonian/OregonLive that he “unequivocally” denied the allegations revealed in the unsealed surveys.
The Oregonian/OregonLive fights prior restraint in the case Still, the legal battle over documents in the case isn’t finished.
The appeals court panel in March overturned a lower court’s ruling that declined to claw back sealed court records that The Oregonian/OregonLive independently obtained from an attorney for the plaintiffs.
“I find the decision baffling and quite troubling on First Amendment grounds,” said Therese Bottomly, editor of The Oregonian/OregonLive.","Documents made public in a high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit against Nike reveal for the first time the names of nearly two dozen company employees, including several former top executives as well as high-ranking employees still with Nike, who were accused in anonymous complaints of inappropriate sexual behavior and harassment.

As The Oregonian/OregonLive reported, the new information contradicts Nike’s previous public statements that the complaints largely named managers below its executive ranks.

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ordered the documents to be unsealed last month after Business Insider, The Oregonian/OregonLive, and Portland Business Journal fought for years to make public more than 5,000 pages of case filings that detail Nike’s response to reports of a “boys’ club” culture within the company. The media coalition was represented by attorneys from the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.

But the Ninth Circuit panel also issued a separate ruling that clears the way for a lower court to silence The Oregonian/OregonLive’s reporting on other records that it independently obtained outside the litigation, reasoning that the news outlet had submitted to the district court’s power to protect discovery documents by filing an unsealing motion in the case. Last week, joining The Oregonian/OregonLive’s original counsel in that separate appeal, Reporters Committee attorneys asked the Ninth Circuit to rehear the issue, arguing that the panel’s decision as it stands will have a “crippling chilling effect on press coverage of important judicial proceedings.”

“The press plays a vital role in enforcing the public’s right to know what unfolds in the federal courts, as the Nike litigation illustrates,” said Grayson Clary, a staff attorney at the Reporters Committee. “But standing up for the public’s right to see judicial records shouldn’t come at the cost of your right to gather the news outside the courtroom.”

The legal fight for court records

The documents at the center of a three-year fight for transparency by Insider, The Oregonian/OregonLive, and Portland Business Journal are related to a lawsuit that several female Nike employees filed against the company in 2018, alleging gender-based pay disparities and sexual harassment at the sportswear giant.

The plaintiffs asked a federal district court in Oregon to convert the lawsuit into a class action on behalf of more than 5,000 current and former female Nike workers who they argued were subject to systemic discrimination and harassment. To support their motion for class certification, the plaintiffs presented internal surveys that a group of Nike employees collected from their peers to document their experiences at the company, known as the Starfish surveys.

But those records and others related to the motion for class certification were filed under a protective order, leaving the public in the dark about the underlying facts surrounding a pivotal moment in the case, Clary said.

“Class certification is typically the single most important moment in any putative class action. It’s where cases live and die,” Clary said. “Allowing parties to seal the evidence that they submit in support or in opposition to class certification as a matter of course would withdraw an enormous amount of material from public view.”

In 2022, ahead of the court’s decision on whether to certify the class, Reporters Committee attorneys representing the news organizations challenged the protective order that shrouded the documents in secrecy. The court later made public over 5,000 pages of records, including most of the Starfish surveys, but it redacted the names of Nike employees accused of misconduct.

As Insider reported, the unsealed court records provided “the most detailed look yet” at the allegations against Nike, which The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal first chronicled at the height of the “#MeToo” movement.

According to Insider, in the Starfish surveys, female Nike employees alleged “abhorrent sexual behavior combined with corporate bullying, fear of retaliation, and a lack of faith in Nike’s willingness to do anything about it.” Other court documents claimed that Nike paid women $11,000 a year less than men between 2015 to 2019. Nike said that calculation wasn’t accurate and there was no gender pay gap.

In late 2022, the district court denied class certification in the case. Soon after, Reporters Committee attorneys sought to unseal the remaining redacted documents on behalf of the media coalition, arguing that the public has a common law right of access to the records that the court used to make its determination.

Nike argued that the records should be shielded from public view because they weren’t related to the merits of the case, and even if they were, releasing them would subject its employees to embarrassment and create a “media circus.”

Two federal judges sided with the news organizations, finding that the records were related to the case’s merits and that the public’s strong interest in the filings outweighed the privacy interests Nike wanted the court to protect. Nike appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which heard oral arguments in February. Clary represented the media coalition at the hearing.

Last month, the Ninth Circuit upheld the district court’s ruling, lifting the redactions from the Starfish surveys and shedding more light on the allegations that rattled Nike in 2018.

The now-unredacted documents allege misconduct by high-ranking employees, some of whom have since left the company and some of whom remain, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. One Starfish survey included a list of men that an anonymous complainant described as “well known philanderers with lower level employees whom they exert influence and power over,” which includes Nike’s former No. 2 executive Charlie Denson and Tinker Hatfield, who designed some of Nike’s most iconic Air Jordan models.

Hatfield, through his attorney, told The Oregonian/OregonLive that he “unequivocally” denied the allegations revealed in the unsealed surveys. Denson didn’t immediately respond to The Oregonian/OregonLive’s request for comment via phone and email messages, the outlet reported.

In a statement to The Oregonian/OregonLive after the Ninth Circuit ruling, Nike said it “conducted a large-scale investigation” in response to employee complaints, including those in the Starfish surveys, “and took corrective action where appropriate.” The company has also changed its policies and procedures to make it easier for employees to raise concerns, it added.

“Nike is committed to a workplace that is respectful and inclusive of all employees, and we do not tolerate discrimination or harassment in any form,” the company said in the statement, according to The Oregonian/OregonLive. “We take any and all accusations seriously, objectively look at the facts, and take appropriate action based on the information received.”

Nike recently agreed to settle the lawsuit, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported.

The Oregonian/OregonLive fights prior restraint in the case

Still, the legal battle over documents in the case isn’t finished. On behalf of The Oregonian/OregonLive, Reporters Committee attorneys are joining the organization’s original counsel in challenging a separate Ninth Circuit ruling that would allow a district court to issue an unconstitutional prior restraint against the news outlet.

The appeals court panel in March overturned a lower court’s ruling that declined to claw back sealed court records that The Oregonian/OregonLive independently obtained from an attorney for the plaintiffs.

Last year, the attorney asked a federal judge to force The Oregonian/OregonLive to return or destroy documents that she inadvertently emailed to the news outlet after she met with one of its reporters for a story that was not about the litigation. A district court denied the request, ruling that The Oregonian/OregonLive obtained the records lawfully and has a First Amendment right to report on them. Nike appealed to the Ninth Circuit.

In reversing the district court’s decision, the appeals panel held that because the outlet had separately intervened to challenge the protective order in the case, it became a party in the lawsuit and therefore could be prohibited from reporting on information that remained under seal. The panel sent the case back to the district court for further action.

“I find the decision baffling and quite troubling on First Amendment grounds,” said Therese Bottomly, editor of The Oregonian/OregonLive. “We simply intervened in a very limited way on behalf of the public good and should not have to set aside our constitutional rights to do so.”

This month, Reporters Committee attorneys began representing The Oregonian/Oregon Live alongside its original counsel and asked the Ninth Circuit to rehear the case.

In the petition for rehearing, Reporters Committee attorneys argue that the panel’s decision “will put the press to an impossible choice: Refrain from exercising the right of access to judicial records, or risk forfeiting the right to gather the news ‘through means independent of the court’s processes.’” It would have a chilling effect on news reporting, they argue, “at the ultimate expense of the public.”

“The classic First Amendment rule should have governed here,” the petition states. “No branch of government has the power to bar the press from publishing lawfully acquired, truthful information on a matter of public concern.”",https://www.rcfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Grayson-at-Cahill-v.-Nike-oral-argument.png,N,,2025-04-09 17:07:22.702321

The acquisition allows Kapitus to expand its product offering to include equipment finance and working capital loans to its client base.","The relatively high interest rate environment which hampered the M&A market for equipment finance companies in 2022 and 2023 carried into the first half of

2024, setting the stage for another year of limited transaction activity. The Federal Reserve’s continued battle against inflation over the past three years resulted in seven Federal Funds rate increases during 2022 followed by four more increases in 2023, increasing the target rate range from 0 to 25 basis points to a 21-year record-high range of 5.25 – 5.50 basis points. At the start of 2024, it appeared as if the Federal Reserve’s aggressive actions during 2023 were driving us toward a soft landing. Inflation had dropped significantly from 6.5% in December of 2022 to 3.4% in December of 2023. Based in part on these results, the Fed was predicting at least four rate cuts during 2024, hinting that the rate cuts might start as early as March of 2024, providing optimism to the market that inflation was indeed behind us, and we would soon return to a lower-rate environment.

Unfortunately, persistently high inflation rates combined with low unemployment and strong jobs reports in the first half of 2024 delayed the Fed’s proposed rate cuts, creating more uncertainty and confusion about the economic environment. It wasn’t until September of 2024 that the first of three rate cuts would occur with a reduction of 50 basis points in September and additional 25-basis-pointcuts in each of November and December. Some have argued that the 2024 rate reductions have been too aggressive, as inflation reversed course and increased from 2.4% in September to 2.9% in December, well above the Fed’s target inflation rate of 2.0%. The Fed is now indicating that future rate cuts may be limited, and some have indicated that the Fed may have to actually reverse course and raise the target rates again if inflation persists.

For most of 2024, election uncertainty influenced the M&A market. The United States faced two candidates and administrations with very different ideas about the regulatory environment, energy policy, tariffs and trade, corporate and personal tax policies and other important factors influencing the M&A market, company valuations and potential future business conditions. In addition, geopolitical risks associated with the United States involvement in wars in both the Middle East and Europe created additional uncertainty about the general health of the economy and government spending.

NOTABLE RECENT TRANSACTIONS

Despite the challenging M&A environment, there were still a handful of notable equipment finance transactions that took place throughout 2024. In March of 2024, Vivakor, a publicly held company focused on developing, acquiring, accumulating and operating assets, properties and technologies in the energy sector, signed a membership interest purchase agreement to acquire Meridian Equipment Leasing, Endeavor Crude, Equipment Transport and Silver Fuels Processing from Jorgan Development and JBAH Holdings, for approximately $170 million. The purchase price consisted of approximately $120 million paid at closing in common stock and the balance was subject to the combined companies achieving a minimum of $12 million of EBITDA in 2024 and would be paid in Company Series A Preferred Stock.

Quiktrak, founded in 1991 and headquartered in Beaverton, Ore., acquired TKS Group in March 2024. Quiktrak provides asset verification, floorplan auditing and risk management services to the equipment leasing and finance industry. According to the press release, the acquisition of TKS Group, based in Madrid, Spain, expands Quiktrak’s offerings to include an end-to-end technology solution for managing assets and audit processes providing advanced insights and risk management solutions to customers.

In April 2024, in an effort to streamline its operations and create a more efficient business model, Société Générale agreed to sell the majority of Société Générale Equipment Finance (SGEF) to Group BPCE for approximately $1.2 billion. According to the press release, Société Générale would maintain equipment leasing and financing activities in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. SGEF operated in 25 countries through a network of dealers, manufacturers, vendors and banks with a focus on transportation, industrial, technology, medical and renewable energy equipment. Group BPCE has committed to using its capital and resources to grow and expand SGEF’s activities internationally. According to Group BPCE’s press release, the acquisition will position the company as the leading provider of equipment financing solutions in Europe.

JA Mitsui Leasing, through its subsidiary JA Mitsui Leasing USA Holdings, acquired Oakmont Capital Holdings (dba Oakmont Capital Services) in April 2024. Oakmont, headquartered in West Chester, Pa., with a full-service office in Albany, Minn., provides small-ticket commercial equipment financing and working capital solutions nationwide. Oakmont was founded in 1998, initially operating as a full-service independent brokerage and made the transition to a full-service lessor shortly after adding a lift-out team consisting of 11 former Stearns Equipment Finance professionals in July 2018. The acquisition provided JA Mitsui with the ability to expand its current operations by adding a streamlined small-ticket financing solution to its existing equipment financing operations in the United States.

Centra Funding, a nationwide equipment finance company headquartered in Plano, Texas, announced last May that it had acquired the LeaseQ Restaurant and Franchise Team and the associated equipment finance platform from TimePayment Corp. With the acquisition, Centra expands its commitment to the foodservice industry and will continue to partner with TimePayment to provide instant approvals for micro-ticket restaurant and franchise transactions. Centra anticipates that the offering will be rebranded to Centra Culinary Finance and will be led by Sandra Van Buren and Kim Lorang. According to John Boettigheimer, president of Centra, the company looks forward to adapting the LeaseQ platform across many of the other industries Centra serves.

In August, GreatAmerica Financial Services hired a team of eight technology leasing and financing individuals led by Jonathan Fales. Prior to joining GreatAmerica, Fales was a divisional president of LEAF Commercial Capital and led the VAR Technology Finance business that LEAF acquired in 2019. With the acquisition, GreatAmerica hopes to expand its existing technology offerings to the value-added reseller and national service provider markets.

In September, Liventus, a custom software development firm headquartered in Northbrook, Ill., announced its acquisition of Sparkflow Data Analytics. Liventus was founded in 2002 and serves the equipment finance, fintech, insurance, healthcare and eCommerce industries. Sparkflow provides innovative data warehouse and analytic model design tools. The acquisition provides Liventus with the ability to combine its custom software development with Sparkflow’s data analytics to better position the company to meet its customer’s needs.

Strategic Funding Source, dba Kapitus, founded in 2006, a fintech specializing in business loans for small and medium businesses, announced the acquisition of Ten Oaks Commercial Capital in October. The acquisition allows Kapitus to expand its product offering to include equipment finance and working capital loans to its client base.

North Mill Equipment Finance, headquartered in Norwalk, Conn., announced in November 2024 that it had acquired 100% of the stock of TF Group, dba Taycor Financial. North Mill is focused on originating small and medium-sized commercial equipment leases and loans through third-party referral origination sources. The Taycor Financial acquisition expands this offering through Taycor’s focus on developing and strengthening vendor and direct origination programs.

In December, CHG-Meridian Group, a technology company focused on providing customers with custom technology financing solutions, acquired Meridian Leasing, a managed services provider for cloud, infrastructure and IT security. CHG-Meridian Group believes the merger will result in increased profitability and improved customer offerings.

THE CURRENT MARKET

The M&A market continued to improve during the second half of 2024, due in large part to the reductions in the federal funds target rates. M&A activity and company valuations are heavily influenced by levels of liquidity and access to credit, portfolio quality, stock market trends, unemployment rates, political and economic uncertainty and business confidence levels. One of the more influential factors in determining the level of M&A activity and company valuations is interest rates. When interest rates fall, potential acquirers can afford to pay higher prices for target companies, which generally results in more opportunities for successful transactions. In addition, sellers who hold fixed-rate portfolios where the majority of the originations took place during a higher interest rate environment will benefit from higher net interest margins and profitability.

Industry performance remained strong in 2024 and several companies are reporting record-high originations and profitability for the year. In fact, the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association recently reported in its CapEx Finance Index that year-to-date new business volume for 2024 increased by 4.8% from 2023. Adding to the strong industry performance, portfolio quality remains strong with the Index reporting that receivables over 30 days stood at 2.0% in December 2024, down from 2.3% in December 2023 and up slightly from 1.8% in December 2022. The Index further pointed out that much of the new volume growth was due in large part to an increase in bank-owned finance activity, bringing the banks’ share of business volume in December 2024 to 62% of total volume. As banks continue to seek growth and market share in the industry, the prospects for M&A activity improve.

Industry confidence continues to improve as we start 2025 with the Equipment Leasing and Finance Foundation reporting that the Monthly Confidence Index for the equipment finance industry increased to 69.6 in January of 2025, up sharply from 48.6 in January 2024, and 48.5 in January 2023. This index, which is designed to reflect a qualitative assessment of industry leaders’ perceptions of current and future business conditions, has not seen the current confidence levels since July of 2021, suggesting that we may have turned the corner on the prospects for sustained economic growth and profitability.

In addition to the strong stock market, low unemployment rate and highest business confidence levels in the past three and a half years, the uncertainty of the 2024 presidential election is now behind us. The new administration’s campaign ran on the promise of promoting a more business-friendly environment through reduced regulations, lower corporate tax rates and reduced pricing for goods and services driven by a more robust energy policy. If the government can deliver on these objectives, it should provide an economic environment that promotes M&A activity in our industry.

Despite the strong industry performance and improving economic environment, a number of factors might challenge the M&A market in 2025. In addition to showing improvement in many areas, the CapEx Finance Index reported that charge-offs reached 0.52% of receivables in December of 2024, up sharply from 0.44% in December of 2023 and 0.27% in December of 2022. Credit approval rates dropped to 74% at the end of 2024, down from 75% for the same period a year ago and 77% in 2022, indicating that applicant credit quality could be starting to deteriorate.

The New York Federal Reserve reported that credit card debt reached $1.166 trillion in the third quarter of 2024, the highest on record since the measurement began. According to BankRate, the average credit card interest rate is 20.14% as of January 2025.

Certain key provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by Congress in 2017 are set to expire at the end of 2025. A number of tax policy changes were included in the bill, including reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. With Republicans holding a slim majority in the house, it remains uncertain if the key provisions of the bill will renew or expire. The bill also included a scheduled phase out of bonus depreciation, reducing the deduction from 100% in 2022 by 20% per year until it is entirely phased out in 2027. These factors will continue to create economic uncertainty and could influence the level of M&A activity during 2025.

The new administration is focused on trade and may introduce import tariffs on certain foreign goods being sold in the United States. If import tariffs are implemented, it may take some time to determine the long-term impact — if any — on the supply chain, prices and inflation rates, as well as their effect on equipment demand and the availability of new equipment or parts needed for repairs and maintenance. The Alta Group discusses many of the above factors in its 2025 Insights report, available at thealtagroup.com.

CONCLUSION

Current economic factors on balance would suggest that the industry should expect an improvement in M&A transaction volume in 2025. The uncertainty of the election is behind us, and we are at the beginning stages of a more friendly business environment with an administration promising a reduction in regulations and corporate taxes. Independent equipment finance companies continue to be attractive acquisition targets for investors as they generally provide for an above-average risk-adjusted return over the long term. As we begin 2025, we continue to hear from qualified buyers that they have an interest in acquiring quality finance companies, but these buyers have become much more selective about the market segments and types of equipment finance organizations that would be of greatest interest to them.

Potential sellers still have several reasons to consider a sale in the near term. Many independent finance companies in the industry have aging owners who are beginning to

focus on estate planning and transitioning their businesses to successor firms. Most of these owners understand that they need to start the sale process early as, regardless of their succession plan, they will likely need to continue working at least part-time after the sale to successfully transition the business and achieve the optimal sale price for their company.

Several private equity firms and family wealth funds made initial investments in companies seven to 10 years ago. It is typical for these investors to look to exit their investments during this timeframe to provide their clients with their target returns and provide liquidity to invest in other projects. Since these investors have not feasibly or profitably been able to exit these investments in the past three years, they will likely want to opportunistically test the M&A markets in 2025 to determine if they can successfully exit. A number of strategic finance companies have indicated that they are interested in acquiring lift-out teams that can provide them with access to new business relationships or new market offerings. In fact, several successful lift-outs have already been announced in 2025.

The current challenge, which will likely remain an issue in the early months of 2025, is persistent inflation and the uncertainty around the Federal Reserve’s position on the number of and magnitude of rate changes for 2025 to achieve a soft landing and finally get inflation under control. This will remain a key factor in returning to a more robust M&A environment and driving more successful deal flow. •",https://www.monitordaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/shutterstock_2446835149-balancing-400.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 16:10:31.442252

Shares of Nike, On Holding, Skechers, Deckers Outdoor and Foot Locker on Wednesday jumped after President Trump authorized a 90-day pause on certain tariffs to most countries, excluding China.

Nike shares traded around 11% higher, with shares of Hoka owner Deckers up 13% and Skechers stock rising around 10% shortly after Trump made the announcement on a post on his Truth Social platform. Shares of on Holding and sports retailer Foot Locker led the gains, rising 15% and 16%, respectively.

Footwear companies' manufacturing operations are heavily dependent on Vietnam, among other Asian countries, and their shares underwent a major selloff after Trump disclosed a new round of tariffs last week that targeted their key suppliers.

For sneaker giant Nike, supply-chain partners in Vietnam and Indonesia make 61% of the sneaker company's manufactured goods. China represents 34% of its manufacturing. On Holding has 90% of its footwear made in Vietnam, according to William Blair.

Analysts had expected significant price increases from retail companies to offset higher costs related to tariffs, coming at a time marked by weakening consumer sentiment amid inflation and unemployment fears.

Despite these constructive developments, the company's share price witnessed a 16% decline over the past week, which aligns with broader market movements influenced by heightened tariff uncertainties. The volatility in the markets, particularly the impact of sweeping tariffs, largely overshadowed UPS's latest product-related announcements, which could have otherwise presented potential growth opportunities in the evolving logistics landscape.

Trump's oil boom is here — pipelines are primed to profit. Discover the 20 US stocks riding the wave.

The recent announcement by United Parcel Service of its new shipping options, UPS Ground Saver and UPS Ground with Freight Pricing, could potentially enhance its competitive position in the logistics sector. This strategic move is anticipated to diversify revenue streams by addressing varied customer needs, although the recent 16% share price decline might shift the focus away from these growth prospects. Considering the company's emphasis on network reconfiguration and efforts to bolster efficiency, there is potential for sustained cost savings and an improvement in operating margins.

Over a longer-term five-year period, UPS's total shareholder return, including dividends, was 8.21%, reflecting a steady, albeit modest, performance. This return period provides context against recent share price movements and broader market declines. However, in the past year, UPS underperformed both the US market, which declined by 5.8%, and the logistics industry, which saw a 30.8% fall, suggesting challenges specific to the sector.

The expansion of shipping options could support positive shifts in revenue and earnings projections if effectively integrated into existing operations. The price movement, leading to a current share price of US$95.56, represents a significant discount to the consensus analyst price target of approximately US$130.07. This presents an interesting scenario for investors assessing market conditions versus analyst expectations, who see a potential uplift, contingent upon execution and macroeconomic factors.

ID14,Danone,2025-04-09 17:57:04+00:00,RNZ,Formula firms fight against expanded online ad ban despite WHO warnings - RNZ,Anusha Bradley,,,,,https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/in-depth/557694/formula-firms-fight-against-expanded-online-ad-ban-despite-who-warnings,"""A communication blackout will deny New Zealand parents and carers the information to make informed choices on the best nutritional options for their infants,"" Danone wrote.
It said ""exploitative"" and ""insidious"" marketing practices online had led to increasing sales of formula, while dissuading mothers from breastfeeding.
INC, which runs the voluntary code of practice for marketing formula in New Zealand, told MPI the guidelines were ""a bit of a shocker"".
The health ministry told RNZ there was no timeline for implementing the new WHO digital marketing code in New Zealand.
The pushback against the WHO guidelines was revealed amid a recent RNZ investigation into a government backdown over trans-Tasman formula guidelines.","Baby formula companies tried to convince the government to resist an expanded global ban on internet marketing of infant milk, despite evidence that online advertising was discouraging mums from breastfeeding.

The former chief executive of the local formula industry body even met with diplomats based at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva to raise its concerns, documents obtained by RNZ under the Official Information Act show.

Meanwhile, French multinational Danone, whose Karicare and Aptamil brands dominate the market in New Zealand, separately told senior ministers that new World Health Organisation (WHO) digital marketing guidelines were ""misguided"" and urged officials not to enshrine them into law.

""A communication blackout will deny New Zealand parents and carers the information to make informed choices on the best nutritional options for their infants,"" Danone wrote.

WHO issued the new guidelines last year, recommending a ban on ""digital"" advertising of all formula - and baby food - for children under three years old, after a review found social media was now the main way parents were exposed to formula marketing.

It said ""exploitative"" and ""insidious"" marketing practices online had led to increasing sales of formula, while dissuading mothers from breastfeeding.

""Through tools like apps, virtual support groups or 'baby-clubs', paid social media influencers, promotions and competitions and advice forums or services, formula milk companies can buy or collect personal information and send personalized promotions to new pregnant women and mothers,"" the WHO report said.

The World Health Assembly is expected to formally adopt the guidelines into its International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes in May.

The New Zealand government's 2023 submission to the draft guidelines - made in consultation with formula companies - did not support the full scope of the proposed rules banning digital marketing of foods for infants and young children, or the expanded definition of breastmilk substitutes covering infants up to three years of age.

New Zealand has been a signatory to the Code since 1983, but only partially complies with it because compliance is based on a voluntary, industry-run code of practice, rather than regulations enshrined in law.

The Code, which is run by industry body the Infant Nutrition Council (INC) and overseen by the Ministry of Health, currently prohibits members from marketing products for infants up to 12 months of age, including digital marketing.

Rules 'misguided'

Documents released to RNZ show that Danone urged senior ministers against adopting the new guidelines into law, despite the company's own 'advocacy policy' stating it supports national legislation that supports the WHO International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes.

""The guidance is misguided and will have profound consequences for the infant formula industry and consumers,"" Danone New Zealand operations manager Steve Donnelly wrote in a December 2023 letter to Food Safety Minister Andrew Hoggard and Trade and Agriculture Minister Todd McClay.

He urged ministers to apply a ""national interest test"" to the WHO guidance, referring to the National-New Zealand First coalition agreement requiring the government to apply such a test before it accepted any United Nations agreements.

""Our view is that the consequences of the WHO guidelines for breast milk substitute digital marketing are of the national interest and should not be adopted,"" wrote Donnelly.

The guidelines would lead to a ""total ban"" of all digital communications about its products for newborns up to 36-months old, he said.

Even though potential ratification by New Zealand was ""likely years away"" and led by the health ministry he urged the ministers and MPI to ""take an active interest in these developments.""

Danone had also raised its concerns to the Ministry for Primary Industries' Dairy Product Safety Advisory Council (DPSAC) in November 2023, questioning what action the government was taking over the issue.

DPSAC was set up in 1999 to ""promote communication between MPI and industry and assist in developing standards and policies."" Danone has been a member since 2020.

At the time, MPI told Danone the final guidelines had already been issued and there was nothing it could do, documents show.

Danone raised concerns again in April 2024 with Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters.

""Our primary concern is that babies and parents do not become the poor relation of regulation,"" wrote Donnelly.

The letter was forwarded to Associate Health Minister Casey Costello, who oversees maternal health, to respond to.

Her officials noted the guidance issued by WHO was not legally binding, and health, MPI, MFAT and Health NZ would work together to determine ""whether any actions from the guidance will be implemented.""

Costello told Donnelly the government had no plans to change the voluntary INC code of practice currently in place.

""If evidence emerged that suggested New Zealand's current approach does not adequately cover digital marketing practices, then New Zealand may consider measures covered in the guidance,"" she wrote in a June letter.

She would expect the industry to be consulted if changes were proposed, she said.

'A bit of a shocker'

RNZ asked Danone why it was against the new guidance when the current INC code already banned the use of digital marketing.

The company declined to be interviewed, but in a statement said it wrote to senior ministers over the ""concerning language used in the digital marketing guidance which suggested it was mandatory and superseded national laws"".

When asked why it opposed national laws when it was its own policy to support national legislation supporting the WHO code, it responded that it supported the code but the digital marketing guidelines were not yet officially part of it.

""We believe it must be made clear to policymakers that preventing infant formula manufacturers from providing factual information about their products via digital channels may exacerbate existing issues faced by parents and carers, such as the rise of misinformation and unreliable content online,"" it said.

Danone's own 2023 global advocacy policy stated the company would support the WHO code.

""As a first step we will support the adoption, implementation and, critically, enforcement of national legislation to meet the needs of each market.""

It also stated it is ""committed to lobbying only in support of measures to improve health and nutrition, consistent with the public interest and nutrition"".

Danone was not the only organisation opposed to the WHO guidance.

INC, which runs the voluntary code of practice for marketing formula in New Zealand, told MPI the guidelines were ""a bit of a shocker"".

""We think it should not proceed,"" INC policy analyst Carole Inskter told MPI officials in September 2023.

That same month, then-INC chief executive Jan Carey flew to Geneva and met with Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials based at New Zealand's permanent mission to the World Trade Organisation over the issue.

""From industry's point of view, digital marketing is already covered under the WHO Code including in New Zealand's response which is the INC Code of Practice for the Marketing of Infant Formula in New Zealand,"" she wrote.

The College of Midwives said it would like to see the WHO code enshrined in New Zealand law ""to protect breastfeeding.""

In a 2023 submission to the Commerce Commission about the INC code it raised concerns about New Zealand not fulfilling its obligations under the WHO code.

Legislation would ""support unbiased information about the safe and appropriate use of commercial milk formula for parents and carers,"" it said.

""The marketing of commercial milk formula directly undermines breastfeeding protection.""

The INC Code requires Commerce Commission approval because it brings companies together in a way that could be perceived as collusion.

In February, Australia's competition regulator denied extending the INC's code on that side of the Tasman for another five years over concerns about its voluntary nature, limited scope and ability to restrict digital marketing methods.

Australia's health department has recommended replacing it with a mandatory code, which is expected to take two years to implement.

The health ministry told RNZ there was no timeline for implementing the new WHO digital marketing code in New Zealand.

The pushback against the WHO guidelines was revealed amid a recent RNZ investigation into a government backdown over trans-Tasman formula guidelines.

That investigation found a handful of formula companies, led by Danone and The A2 Milk Company, successfully lobbied against the government adopting tougher trans-Tasman food standards for baby formula.

The companies opposed two labelling rules they claimed would have affected sales and exports to China.",https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--6bCls33H--/t_tohu-badge-facebook/v1743725788/4K9H5ZL_infant_formula_03_jpg?_a=BACCd2AD,N,,2025-04-09 15:12:07.387179

Two new sports ventures are joining the ION lineup. One is the Elevance Health Women’s Fort Myers Tip-Off, an early season college basketball tournament held over Thanksgiving weekend. Scripps Sports has locked up rights for five years from the agency Intersport, which manages the tournament.

Since launching in 2022, the Fort Myers Tip-Off has been a draw for prominent teams, among them South Carolina, Tennessee, Maryland, Purdue and others.

Scripps is also teaming with media outlet Sports Illustrated on the SI Women’s Games, a biennial all-star competition featuring elite athletes in six sports. The debut edition is set for Oceanside, CA from October 28 to November 2.

Live women’s sports is a key pillar in the company’s overall strategy, notably the WNBA and the National Women’s Soccer League. Ratings for a range of women’s sports properties have been rising dramatically in recent years, with ad buyers also attracted to the enthusiastic viewership. Rather than devoting resources to originals, ION’s programming budget is mostly targeted to sports, along with the acquired series it programs in prime time.

ION is in the final year of its deal to broadcast Friday night WNBA games. While WNBA rights are part of a broader rights package with NBA games, which are changing partners for the 2025-26 season (with Amazon and NBCUniversal entering the picture with Disney-ESPN), the Friday night slot remains available. ION execs say they are remaining in discussions with the league about continuing as a media partner.

Beyond ION, Scripps also said it had renewed two of its most popular series: Court TV’s Interview with a Killer and Bounce TV’s Mind Your Business.

Interview, a true-crime series hosted by David Scott, became Court TV’s most-watched original when it debuted last fall. The new season will kick off April 13 with a 2-hour episode about Gary Michael Hilton, who calls himself the oldest serial killer in America.

Mind Your Business, which received an NAACP Image Award nomination, is returning for a second season on June 7.

The series focuses on the Williams family, which operates an event and party space in Chicago. Ensemble cast members include Columbus Short (Scandal, Stomp the Yard), Drew Sidora (The Real Housewives of Atlanta, That’s So Raven) and Rolonda Watts (Rolonda).

Companies Looking For Diversifying Operations

In recent years, many leading companies have been diversifying their operations as they face with supply chain disruptions, first due to the COVID and then geopolitical tensions. The companies are trying to diversify business to reduce risk and increase flexibility.

Given its political stability, India has emerged as a favourable place. With a huge market opportunity backed with a dynamic workforce, the companies are considering the country as a one of the best places to set up manufacturing bases.",https://imagesvs.oneindia.com/img/2025/04/hp-laptops-chennai-1744198379.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 16:09:42.884361

The acquisition of Family Dollar by Dollar Tree occurred in 2015 for $9 billion.
The situation is complicated, and many discount chains, including Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, struggle to adapt to a challenging economic environment.
Family Dollar Will Have to Change The future of Family Dollar, now in the hands of Brigade Capital and Macellum Capital, seems to be headed toward a restructuring.
The company's future seems to be centered on its main brand, Dollar Tree, which will continue expanding its store network.","Dollar Tree has taken an unexpected turn by announcing the sale of its Family Dollar chain for $1 billion. This move comes after a series of massive closures that affected more than 1,000 Family Dollar stores in recent months.

The sale will be conducted through a consortium formed by Brigade Capital Management and Macellum Capital Management. This operation is an important step in Dollar Tree's restructuring strategy. According to Mike Creedon, the company's CEO, this agreement marks a ""significant milestone"" in their transformation process.

Creedon highlighted that the sale will allow Dollar Tree to focus on its growth and expansion. Especially through its main brand, which already has more than 16,000 stores in the 48 states of the United States.

Dollar Tree Has a Plan

The closure of stores has been a recurring issue for Family Dollar, as in the first half of 2024, the company closed about 600. This was followed by another 370 closures after the expiration of lease contracts. These closures reflect the difficulties Family Dollar faces in keeping competitive in an increasingly demanding discount market.

The acquisition of Family Dollar by Dollar Tree occurred in 2015 for $9 billion. At that time, Dollar Tree sought to expand its presence against its competitor Dollar General. However, Family Dollar's performance was not the desired one.

The high prices of some of its products, along with changes in consumer behavior, have severely affected the brand. Inflation and the decrease in the purchasing power of many customers have been key factors in this debacle.

""The discount store sector faces uncertainty,"" indicated Michael Lasser, an analyst at UBS. The situation is complicated, and many discount chains, including Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, struggle to adapt to a challenging economic environment.

Meanwhile, competitors are also facing their own challenges. The CEO of Dollar General, Todd Vasos, commented that many of their customers can no longer afford products outside of the strictly essential. Inflation has left many shoppers without resources to spend on non-essential products. This has affected sales in several discount chains.

Family Dollar Will Have to Change

The future of Family Dollar, now in the hands of Brigade Capital and Macellum Capital, seems to be headed toward a restructuring. The expectations are that the sale will help stabilize the brand and improve its long-term prospects. Experts point out that this process could offer an opportunity to optimize store operations and reduce costs.

This move also highlights the widespread struggle of many brands in the retail sector. It is estimated that in the coming years up to 45,000 stores will close in the U.S., which highlights the difficulties of traditional commerce against the competition from e-commerce. Large chains like Walmart, Costco, and Target seem to be the ones that will emerge victorious in this new landscape, while others, like Family Dollar, may have to completely reinvent themselves.

Dollar Tree is no stranger to changes. In December 2024, Jeff Davis resigned as the company's CFO, reflecting the internal adjustments Dollar Tree is making to keep competitive. The company's future seems to be centered on its main brand, Dollar Tree, which will continue expanding its store network.",https://edatv.news/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-exterior-dollar-tree-family-dollar-chica-sorprendida-senalando_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-04-09 15:11:48.940546

While the industry has managed to dodge tariffs for now, the largest companies have lost hundreds of billions in market value in the past month.

Eli Lilly has lost $95.4 billion in market value in just one month. Rival weight loss pharma Novo Nordisk has dropped $72.4 billion in the same time period.

The decline at many of the other top 10 pharmas by market cap was less extreme but equally apparent. AbbVie has lost $52.5 billion in equity value and Johnson & Johnson, the largest healthcare company in the world until recent years, went down by $40.8 billion.

Novo’s shares have seen the steepest decline, with a 21% drop on April 4 that brought the stock down to about $62. The Danish company’s shares peaked at $145 apiece in June 2024. That’s a 51% decline in one year.

Lilly’s stock is still sky-high. The shares were worth about $777 apiece a year ago and closed Tuesday at $730, a 6% decline. But within the past year, the stock has hit as high as $957.

Pharma is not alone in this market misery right now. The S&P 500 has declined 12% in one month and 14% year to date, so every industry is feeling the weight of the macro headwinds.

Jefferies said in an investor note that the tariffs—which have yet to hit pharma specifically—“have triggered a continued flight to safety” in the sector. S&P’s biotech index, the XBI, has dropped nearly 19% in one month and 21% year to date.

Trump has not yet followed through on threats to place tariffs on the pharma industry specifically and the true impact will not be known until he does. Truist Securities analysts said the market damage is already being done. In a note to investors on Monday, they wrote, “We expect to see more volatility in biopharma until greater clarity.”",https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/8cf554a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3758x2114+0+77/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7a%2F22%2F0ec0922944b4989aec70abe83ce7%2Fistock-2158575336-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 19:06:35.394537

Kroger said in its 2024 annual report that the company spent $684 million in 2024, $316 million in 2023, and $44 million in 2022. Those costs included “third-party professional fees and credit facility fees …” Kroger said.

And that price tag is still rising as Kroger defends itself in a lawsuit brought by Albertsons that aims to collect on the $600 million termination clause in the contract between the two grocery giants. Albertsons has said it aims to sue for more than just the $600 million.

Kroger also faces a lawsuit from its would-be divestiture partner, C&S Wholesale Grocers, which argues it is owed a $125 million termination fee for the failed deal.

Meanwhile, Kroger is fighting back against both companies, arguing that the two colluded to pressure Kroger to increase the number of stores to divest to C&S Wholesale.

“As detailed in the court filing, while Kroger was working diligently to seek regulatory approval and close the merger, Albertsons was engaging in a secret and misguided campaign, together with C&S Wholesale Grocers, the divestiture buyer, to pursue its own regulatory strategy, which ultimately undermined Kroger's efforts,” the grocer said in the press release.

The price tag for Albertsons has also been steep.

Through June 15, the Boise, Idaho-based grocery retailer had spent $329 million on the merger effort, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

As the companies battle it out in court, Kroger is working to get back on track with opening new locations and renovating existing ones.

In early April, the grocery chain, which operates roughly 2,750 locations under a wide range of banners, including King Soopers, Ralphs, Dillons, Fred Meyer, and others, announced it will spend about $130 million in 2025 to renovate 16 existing stores and build three new stores and four fuel centers.

The new stores will be located in Edgewood and Newport, Kentucky, and Eaton, Ohio, the company said in a press release.

“As the hometown grocer to the Cincinnati/Dayton community we take pride in our ability to improve access to fresh affordable food and always improving the customer experience,” said Ann Reed, president of the Cincinnati/Dayton division, in the press release. “Our investment of $130 million underscores our commitment to our associates, customers and communities while providing a best-in-class shopping experience for everyone.”

Renovations to the 16 stores—located across Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky—are expected to cost about $45 million.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt58a1f8f560a1ab0e/blt66f79f61422be300/67f6a4e65538ca21ff188d38/kroger-albertson_Logos.png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-04-09 14:10:16.653834

The measures are a response to President Trump's latest round of tariffs, which went into effect overnight, and include a 104% levy on Chinese goods.

The Chinese finance ministry says the new charges will take effect at midnight in China, or Wednesday noon Eastern time.

""The US's practice of escalating tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake,"" the ministry said in a statement announcing the fresh round of levies.

China calls on the U.S. to cancel its tariffs against Chinese goods, ""and properly resolve differences with China through equal dialogue on the basis of mutual respect,"" the ministry added.

Hopes had risen among some investors that the U.S. would strike trade deals to lower the tariffs over time, leaving the punitive measures as a temporary negotiating tactic. Trump has signaled he is willing to talk, posting Tuesday on Truth Social that China ""wants to make a deal, badly.""

But Trump's statement was undermined by the new measures, which sent Dow futures down more than 700 points. S&P futures are also down 1.8% and Nasdaq futures tumbled more than 1.4%.

Global stock market slump continues

Stock markets in Europe opened Wednesday with sharp downturns. In London, Frankfurt and Paris, share prices fell once more in early trading Wednesday after recovering some of their value earlier this week. The French and German markets remained almost 12% lower than they were a week ago, when the new tariffs were first announced.

Earlier, many markets across Asia had also slumped, with Japan's Nikkei closing down nearly 4%. South Korea's KOSPI fell 1.74% and Taiwan's composite index shed 5.79%. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index opened down more than 3% before recovering to close up about 1%.

In mainland China, key indexes closed up more than 1%, despite Chinese goods being the hardest hit. The steep new levy was a response to Beijing issuing reciprocal tariffs of 34% on American goods last week.

Other countries try negotiations

Japan is the country with the largest foreign direct investment in the United States and Japanese negotiators are scheduled to hold talks in Washington that could include discussions of foreign currency exchange rates as Trump has accused Tokyo of devaluing the yen to support Japanese exports — something Japan has repeatedly denied.

Trade negotiators from South Korea, another close American trading partner, will also begin talks with the U.S. soon as the government in Seoul announces a series of emergency actions, including subsidies and tax breaks, to support the country's export sectors, including auto manufacturers.

Meanwhile, the deputy prime minister of Vietnam, which has in recent decades become a global center for low-cost manufacturing, will meet with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday to discuss the 46% tariffs placed on its exports to the U.S.

The stock market in Vietnam fell almost 10% on Wednesday, the sharpest in Asia, and during the past week it has fallen almost 20%.

India also said the country is engaging with the United States. India's external affairs minister said on Wednesday that the two countries are hammering out a bilateral trade agreement, which could conclude by the fall of this year.

Recession fears raised further at home

Fears of a U.S. and indeed a wider global recession have been further heightened by the continued volatility of America's stock market since last week.

Alongside that destruction of trillions in corporate value over recent days, government bonds — traditionally considered safer than equities — have also plummeted, while President Trump has confused investors by describing the tariffs as ""permanent,"" while also boasting that global leaders have requested trade negotiations that might include offers to end their own preexisting tariffs or non-trade barriers on U.S. goods.

The U.S.-based investment bank JP Morgan has said its economists estimate there is now a 60% chance that the world could enter a recession by the end of 2025.

The $9.7 billion in total sales is not adjusted for inflation, and remains elevated from pre-pandemic years.

Walmart tops all other retailers for online grocery sales with 25.7% of the total market share. Amazon has 22% of the share, and Instacart, which works with dozens of retailers like Aldi, has 21.6% of the share. Kroger has about 9%, and Albertsons has 3.4% according to e-Marketer.

The Brick Meets Click Grocery Shopping Survey, sponsored by Mercatus, found that consumers remain loyal to delivery, with that segment’s sales rising 30% amid an expanding monthly user base.

“Delivery’s remarkable year-over-year rebound highlights the potency of promotional strategies that help customers save more money,” said David Bishop, partner at Brick Meets Click. “And, memberships/subscriptions are becoming essential for retaining customers and driving more recurring revenue via gains in order frequency and average order values.”

The latest monthly performance gains for online grocery sales reflect aggressive promotions and deep discounts on annual memberships and/or subscriptions that began around May 2024, according to the report. The promotions have been offered by a broad range of grocery retailers, including mass retailers like Walmart, supermarkets, and third-party providers like Instacart who have benefits that include free delivery.

March 2025 also marked five years since the COVID-19 pandemic began, which altered how U.S. households purchased their groceries, noted the survey report.

Online grocery sales for delivery totaled $4.2 billion in March, up from $2.5 billion, up 68% over the past five years. Online grocery sales for store pickup totaled $3.8 billion in March, up 58.3% from $2.4 billion when the pandemic started in March 2020. Ship-to-home online grocery orders totaled $1.8 billion in March, rising 12.5% from $1.6 billion five years ago, according to the report.

The report indicated that in August 2019, online grocery rang up $2 billion in monthly sales in the U.S. Then seven months later, in March 2020, online grocery sales skyrocketed to $6.5 billion, a more than 200% increase. This initial surge accounted for about 60% of the total gains for e-grocery since the pandemic. After peaking in early 2021, total e-grocery sales rebalanced through mid-2024, contributing another 20% of overall gains. More recently, there has been another 20% in gains driven by the uptick in subscriptions and memberships promotions, with March 2025 representing the 8th consecutive month of sales of over $9.5 billion, the report notes.

The report notes that while the pandemic motivated more households to try online grocery shopping, the share of consumers who now regularly shop for groceries online has risen from 25% to 57% over the past five years. The report also found that consumers are shopping more often, with 2.6 average online grocery orders per month, up from an average of two orders per month during the pandemic.

The “new” lemonade launched April 8 as a permanent offering at participating McDonald’s restaurants nationwide, according to the fast-food chain.

“Our Lemonade quickly became a fan-favorite in select local markets after being introduced in March 2023,” McDonald’s said on its website. “Now, it’s making its way to the national stage.”

Customers can also get tea-lemonade mixes featuring sweetened or unsweetened tea, according to the Snackolator food blog.

Saga completed 30,000 PMI policy sales in 2024 through its broking arm, down 9% from the 33,000 it reported in 2023.
When combined with its travel insurance sales, which also fell by 10.3%, gross written premiums for the two businesses fell by 6.3% to £125.5m from £134m.

The group also paid a £2.6m share of profit to Axa Health after it ended the solus supplier contract with the insurer for health cover to replace it with Bupa.

And it wrote down its insurance broking business by £138.3m following a £104m write-down in goodwill for the same operation in 2023, as post-tax losses surpassed £100m for a second consecutive year.

Saga completed 30,000 PMI policy sales in 2024 through its broking arm, down 9% from the 33,000 it reported in 2023.

It also cited lower renewal margins on PMI which further reduced the revenue and profitability of the operation.

“While sales of PMI reduced slightly, there were net rate inflation pressures in the current year, reducing renewal margins and leading to written gross profit after marketing expenses decreasing by £3.5m,” it said.

When combined with its travel insurance sales, which also fell by 10.3%, gross written premiums for the two businesses fell by 6.3% to £125.5m from £134m.

The firm also operates a general insurance arm for home and motor insurance which it underwrote but is in the middle of completing a sell-off to Ageas.

Post-tax losses break £100m again

Overall, the group saw its after-tax loss grow to £164.9m a 46% increase on the £113m post-tax loss made in 2023.

This included the £138.3m impairment to insurance broking goodwill, which was an addition to the £104m write-down it made to the same business a year earlier.

There were other exceptional items totalling £50.6m which included a £30.8m write-down to software assets “that will no longer drive economic benefit to the group following the transition to the insurance broking partnership with Ageas”.

And it reported restructuring costs of £32.2m, including the expected costs of restructuring insurance broking operations, ahead of the Ageas partnership becoming operational.

The group’s underlying profit before tax of £47.8m was up from £38.2m primarily due to a £23.6m increase in its travel operations which arrange cruises and other trips and insurance underwriting growing by £12m to £10.7m.

Saga group chief executive officer Mike Hazell said he was “very pleased” with the progress it has made over the past 12 months and that it “delivered a strong performance” from a trading perspective.

“This was driven by the strength of our travel businesses, with especially high levels of customer demand for our differentiated ocean and river cruise offers,” he said.

“In addition, we took the significant strategic action necessary to reposition the group for future growth. We completed our strategic review, successfully signed a new 20-year insurance broking partnership with wholly owned UK subsidiaries of Ageas SA/NV and agreed the sale of our insurance underwriting business.

“These achievements materially reduce the risk and complexity of the insurance business going forward and, when combined with our continued strong trading performance, meant that we were able to complete the refinancing of our long-term corporate debt, replacing our 2026 debt maturities with new long-term credit facilities.”

Director departures

Two directors are leaving the board as a result of the Ageas deals to “reflect the group’s new simplified business model” it said.

Executive director Steve Kingshott and senior independent director Sir Peter Bazalgette have left from today.

Sir Peter is chairman of the nomination committee and is also a member of the remuneration committee. Gareth Hoskin will replace Sir Peter as senior independent director, chairman of the nomination committee and as a member of the remuneration committee.

An escalating trade war is expected to have a profound impact on the global car industry, particularly given the high globalization of supply chains.

Europe's auto giants slipped on Wednesday, extending recent losses as U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries came into effect — including a whopping 104% levy on China.

Trump's latest trade measures, which came into force as of 5 a.m. London time, include a 20% tariff on the European Union, a 24% tariff on Japan and a 49% levy on Cambodia.

China responded to Trump's tariff policies by hiking its levies on U.S. imports to 84%, with the duties set to take effect from April 10.

In Asia, Japan's Nissan and Toyota fell 7% and 2.6%, respectively.

Trump's ""reciprocal"" trade measures will be applied separately and not on top of existing U.S. auto tariffs, according to S&P Global.

The U.S. implemented a 25% charge on all foreign cars imported into the country last Thursday. The White House said it also intends to place tariffs on some auto parts no later than May 3.

Analysts warn that German car manufacturers are likely to be the most exposed to the U.S. trade measures.

""The tariffs are a blow for especially the German car makers which export hundreds of thousands of units to the US annually (749,000 in 2024) and produce many cars in the US itself which require European parts,"" Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, told CNBC in emailed comments.

""It's hard to work around the tariffs, and they seem to stay at least a while, so they need to deal with it and will have to reconsider product offerings, pricing and manufacturing footprints,"" he added.

An escalating trade war is expected to have a profound impact on the global car industry, particularly given the high globalization of supply chains and the heavy reliance on manufacturing operations across North America.

In the days since Trump's auto tariffs came into effect, car giants have responded by announcing plans to raise prices, impose import fees, pause shipments, idle plants and even lay off staff.

ING's Luman said that, while a drop in U.S. unit sales will likely hurt German carmakers amid an already complex set of challenges, this picture ""doesn't look dramatic"" just yet.

""China is indeed even more important, and their home market require more attention,"" Luman said. ""I would say that bolstering competitive strength and selling more cars in the European home market (and perhaps develop other export markets across the world) will be the focus.""

Tariff exposure

""BMW and Mercedes are among the top exporters of cars by value from the US, thus the most exposed to retaliatory tariffs among the European automakers,"" Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar, told CNBC by email.

Volkswagen EV sales double in Europe in the first quarter

Volkswagen delivered 216,800 all-electric vehicles globally in the first quarter, up 59% from 136,400 last year. The growth bumped up Volkswagen’s global EV market share from 6% to 10%.

Strong growth in Europe and the US helped offset fewer deliveries in China. In Europe, Volkswagen delivered over 150,000 EVs through the first three months of 2025, more than double (+113%) the number it handed over in the year prior.

Volkswagen is the “clear BEV market leader in Europe” with around 26% of the market. In comparison, Tesla’s sales were down in every European market in Q1, except the UK.

In Germany alone, almost every second EV came from a VW Group brand. With new models like the ID.7 Tourer and Audi Q6 e-tron, Volkswagen’s orders in Western Europe are back up around one million (980,000).

Volkswagen’s top five best-selling EVs globally were the ID.4 and ID.5 (43,700), ID.3 (28,100), Audi A4 e-tron (22,800), Škoda Enyaq (20,200), and ID.7 (19,100).

Global BEV deliveries rise but slip in China

In the US, VW Group EV sales were up 51%. The VW ID.4 was one of the top-selling EVs in the first quarter, with 7,663 units sold. Its electric minibus, the ID.Buzz is now rolling out, with 1,901 units sold in Q1.

Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume said, “Now we’re shifting into the fast lane” with new models arriving. The company expects “additional tailwinds” from new model launches in 2025.

Despite growth in Europe and the US, Volkswagen is still struggling to keep pace with BYD and others in China. Volkswagen blamed an “intense competitive situation in China” after EV deliveries fell 37% to 25,900, down from 41,000 last year.

After surpassing VW as the top-selling car brand in China last year, BYD’s impressive sales run is heating up in 2025.

BYD sold 166,109 electric cars last month alone. Through the first three months of 2025, the Chinese EV giant has sold 416,388 all-electric vehicles.

After cutting prices this month on some of its top-selling models, BYD’s cheapest EV, the Seagull, now starts at under $8,000 (56,800 yuan).

For the full fiscal year, Levi’s expects net revenues to decline 1% to 2%, the company previously said.
If price changes seem necessary to blunt the effect of tariffs, they “will be very surgical,” Gass said.
Levi’s “delivered a strong beat in 1Q, while speaking to consistent/accelerating demand over the past few months.","Dive Brief:

Levi Strauss & Co. is still evaluating the implications of tariffs, and executives compared the challenge to the pandemic. On a call with analysts this week, they emphasized a diverse supply chain, with about 1% sourcing from China, about 5% from Mexico and mid- to high-single-digits from Vietnam.

The levies are hitting the denim brand at a time of strength, with Q1 net revenues up 3.1% year over year to $1.5 billion. DTC rose 9% and delivered 52% of total net revenues, and wholesale fell 3%. The Levi’s brands (which include Levi's, Levi Strauss Signature and Denizens) rose 3% and were the bulk of total net revenues, as Beyond Yoga rose 9.8% to $35.2 million. Dockers, likely to be sold, was considered ""discontinued operations.”

Gross margin expanded 330 basis points to 62.1%, and the company swung into the black with $135 million in net income, from its $10.6 million loss a year ago. Inventory was up 7%, and most inventory needed for Q2 U.S. orders has been secured.

Dive Insight:

Levi’s has been cutting back on promotions lately, but pricing is one of the levers, along with managing costs and working with vendors, that could help the brand blunt the effect of tariffs on the economy and its business, Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass and Chief Financial and Growth Officer Harmit Singh told analysts. They emphasized that the situation is “fluid” and “dynamic,” which makes it uncertain.

Because of the unknowns, the company is not embedding any impact from tariffs in its full year or Q2 guidance, Singh said. For the full fiscal year, Levi’s expects net revenues to decline 1% to 2%, the company previously said.

“It's all being planned right now,” he said. “I think the best proxy, unfortunately, but the best proxy recently is 2020 and ’21, which was COVID.”

The Levi’s brand enjoys pricing power, and in Q1 average retail prices rose again. After pulling back on promotions, the company enjoyed more full-price selling. If price changes seem necessary to blunt the effect of tariffs, they “will be very surgical,” Gass said.

The international business is so strong that it could mitigate any weakness in U.S. sales, Singh said. Nearly 60% of the company’s revenue comes from outside the U.S., according to Gass.

The company beat expectations in the quarter, Wells Fargo analysts led by Ike Boruchow said in a research note following the brand’s report. “No slowdown here,” Boruchow said. Levi’s “delivered a strong beat in 1Q, while speaking to consistent/accelerating demand over the past few months. While the tariff question was not fully answered (not embedding in guidance), this was a much better than feared print.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/AHG-8KhiNuj7JRZSod5dizxcU7tz40ZMhkPgzcO9umI/g:nowe:0:11/c:4895:2766/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9zdG9yZXNfc2YtNS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-04-09 14:11:20.415134

Based on year-to-date results through February, the Company currently expects financial results will meet or exceed its previously issued guidance for full year 2025.

'As I continue to build out my leadership team, I am confident that Brian and Amy will help us continue the momentum we have built over the past several months as we execute on our strategy to deliver better health care to the 185 million Americans we are privileged to serve,' said Joyner. 'Their collective and individual experience and expertise are well suited to CVS Health and we welcome them both to our leadership team.

'I am personally grateful for the leadership Tom has shown in his time at CVS Health, and before that, Aetna. He stepped up during a challenging year, and helped position our enterprise for long-term growth opportunities. I wish him all the best in the future.'

'I am confident in our continued success and growth potential, and I look forward to putting my experience to work as we help our clients, customers, and colleagues succeed.'

'As a clinician, I see the best our health care system can do, and as an administrator, I have seen the challenges that stop us from doing our best all the time,' said Dr. Compton-Phillips. 'CVS Health has every opportunity to deliver simply better health, and that starts with the patient-medical professional relationship. I am committed to making sure we do all we can to improve the experience and outcome of every person we serve.'

The company’s cancellations of the orders came without warning and didn’t mention tariffs, but their timing suggests they came in response to the tariffs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (April 9), citing unnamed sources and a document it had seen.

It’s not known how widespread Amazon’s cancellations of orders are, according to the report. The report cited one vendor who said the company canceled a $500,000 order, and an eCommerce consultant who said Amazon canceled orders from “several” clients.

Amazon did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comments.

About 40% of the products sold on the company’s website are purchased by Amazon directly from vendors, while the remainder are listed on its site by third-party sellers, according to the report.

Tariffs were one of several factors that led Amazon and rival retailer Walmart to lower their first-quarter outlooks in February, PYMNTS reported at the time. The companies said other factors contributing to the weak guidance included inflation, weak consumer demand, foreign exchange challenges and a shift in consumer focus toward essentials.

On Wednesday, Walmart retracted its first-quarter operating income outlook due in part to tariff-related concerns. The company said in a press release that it wants to “maintain flexibility to invest in price as tariffs are implemented.”

The announcement came on the same day that Trump’s tariffs went into effect, impacting some of the nations that Walmart relies on to source its goods.

Hackers breach US bank regulator’s email system for more than a year

Hackers infiltrated the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a key US bank regulator, and gained access to highly sensitive financial information for more than a year by compromising an administrator’s email account, as reported by Bloomberg on Tuesday, citing anonymous sources and a draft letter to Congress obtained by the news agency.

According to Bloomberg’s sources and details from the letter, the hackers gained access to an administrator’s account at the OCC, allowing them to monitor staff communications and access around 150,000 emails from May 2023 until they were discovered earlier this year.

The identity of those behind the OCC breach remains unclear.

On February 26, the agency disclosed a “cyber security incident” linked to an administrative account within its email system, which it had uncovered earlier that month. It said that a “limited number of affected email accounts” had been identified and subsequently disabled.

“Earlier this year, the OCC discovered unauthorised access to a limited number of its executives’ and employees’ emails that contain highly sensitive information relating to the financial condition of federally regulated financial institutions used in its examinations and supervisory oversight processes,” OCC chief information officer Kristen Baldwin wrote in the draft letter.

The OCC has reported the breach to the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. In its initial disclosure, the regulator noted there was no sign of any impact on the financial sector “at this time”.

Barclays scraps diversity targets in the US

Barclays is scrapping its diversity, equity and inclusion targets within its US operations, the bank said on Tuesday, following a policy review prompted by political pressure from US President Donald Trump, who has signed a raft of executive orders aimed at ending government support for such programmes.

The changes include ending targets such as having women occupy 33 per cent of director and managing director roles by the end of 2025, and increasing ethnic minority representation in senior US roles by 50 per cent.

The move comes just months after chief executive CS Venkatakrishnan publicly reaffirmed the bank’s “enduring and unwavering” commitment to DEI.

In a memo seen and reported on by Bloomberg, Venkatakrishnan said: “The group executive committee has been carefully considering the changed environment in the US.

“As a global organisation, we have always complied with the local requirements in the jurisdictions in which we have operated. In doing so, we have remained faithful to our workplace culture.”

Barclays said its diversity targets would continue to apply in the UK and other markets.

Swiss regulator backs UBS plan to cap investment bank size

Stefan Walter, chief executive of Switzerland’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority, has declared his approval of UBS’s proposal to restrict its investment bank’s size.

During a press conference on Tuesday, Walter said ‘“UBS has said that it would limit the size of the investment bank as a proportion of risk-weighted assets. We welcome that of course.”

Switzerland’s parliament is expected to begin debating legislation this year that could require UBS to hold up to $25bn in additional capital, a proposal the bank has strongly criticised. As one potential concession, UBS executives have suggested that the investment bank cap be written into Swiss law.

UBS’s investment banking division is already subject to a self-imposed cap, limited to 25 per cent of the bank’s risk-weighted assets. The move could help ease regulator concerns that higher-risk investment banking activities could trigger a crisis that would ultimately require state intervention.

Revolut fined €3.5mn in Lithuania over money laundering handling

Financial regulators in Lithuania have fined Revolut €3.5mn over its inadequate handling of money laundering activities.

The Bank of Lithuania, the monetary authority that issued the fine, said the penalty was due to insufficient monitoring that led to “the bank not always properly identifying suspicious monetary operations or transactions carried out by customers”.

The penalty comes as digital banks face growing scrutiny over alleged shortcomings in conducting proper checks on new customers and preventing financial crime. In 2024, Starling Bank was fined £29mn by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority for deficiencies in its screening of high-risk customers.

Kroger poured more than $1 billion over three years into its unsuccessful quest to combine with rival Albertsons, the supermarket chain disclosed in a regulatory filing last week.

The expenses primarily consisted of third-party professional fees and credit facility fees Kroger incurred as it sought to obtain regulatory approval for the proposed merger, which drew fierce opposition from the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general on the grounds that it would be anticompetitive.

In its annual 10-K report for 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, Kroger said it recorded $684 million in merger-related costs last year. That amount was on top of $316 million the company spent on fees and other expenses related to the merger in 2023, as well as $44 million it devoted to the deal in 2022.

Kroger also said it took on $34 million in interest expenses in 2024 related to $10.5 billion the company borrowed in preparation for its acquisition of Albertsons. Kroger directed the bulk of the borrowed funds to the share-buyback program it implemented after the merger fell apart.

Kroger and Albertsons announced their intention to combine in a deal valued at $24.6 billion in October 2022, sparking swift and loud blowback from a range of foes that included labor groups and politicians as well as government antitrust officials. The FTC sought a federal court order to stop the merger, while the attorneys general of Washington state and Colorado asked state courts to block the deal. On Dec. 10, a federal judge granted the FTC’s request to halt the deal and a judge in Washington also ruled against the merger.

Kroger now faces the cost of defending itself against a lawsuit Albertsons filed accusing it of sabotaging the merger by not taking more aggressive steps to assuage the FTC’s concern that the deal would have created an overly powerful supermarket company. Albertsons is also seeking to collect a $600 million termination fee from Kroger.

Meanwhile, C&S Wholesale Grocers, which had agreed to acquire almost 600 grocery stores as part of a divestiture deal related to the merger, wants a $125 million termination fee. Kroger contends that Albertsons and C&S forfeited those fees, which were specified in the merger agreement, because they took actions that went afoul of the deal’s terms.

As of this month, the coffeehouse has cut several of its items. These include blended Frappuccinos, the Royal English Breakfast Latte and the White Hot Chocolate.

“These items aren’t commonly purchased, can be complex to make or are like other beverages on our menu,” Starbucks wrote on their website. The company said it wants to, “focus on fewer, more popular items,” in hopes of decreasing wait times and enhancing the overall quality and consistency of its service. The company expects to cut up to 30% of offered items before Oct. 1, when its next fiscal year begins.

People have given mixed reviews on the changes so far.

“There is a surplus of drinks on the menu and focusing on perfecting and enhancing a select few would improve their quality,” Nyla Bowers, a sophomore economics major, said.

Nicole Thomas, a sophomore English and Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies double major, said so far the menu change doesn’t affect her.

“A deal breaker would be them not serving anything chai,” Thomas said.

The new Starbucks CEO, Brian Niccol, was brought in to reinvigorate the global chain, but its stock continues to slide. On Tuesday, March 18, Starbucks closed at $98.28, down 1.3% from the $99.58 close on Tuesday, March 11.

The Seattle-based company laid off 1,100 corporate employees and employees affected were notified on February 25.

Niccol released a Global Support Partner announcement message, which said, “We are simplifying our structure, removing layers and duplication and creating smaller, more nimble teams.

More than 25 consumer brandsare linked to oil and gas fracking in the Permian Basin due to their sourcing of fossil-fuel derived plastic packaging, according to a new investigation by the climate group Stand.earth and the Center for International Environmental Law.

The brands include 26 household names such as Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, and Walmart. Many of these brands or their parent companies, including P & G, PepsiCo, L’Oréal, the Coca-Cola Company, Unilever, and Nestlé, had previously pledged to reduce their use of virgin plastic in favor of more sustainable alternatives.

Stand.earth also used the findings to build a “Fracked Plastics Map”— an interactive tool linking consumer brands to packing companies, plastics producers and fracking companies that extract petroleum from the Permian Basin. The map reveals that just three companies — Dow, Ineos and Reliance — supply the plastic to the 26 brands for their packaging.

Dive Insight:

It was estimated that more than 500 million metric tons of plastic would be consumed last year, with most of this quickly becoming waste, according to the United Nations International Governing Committee on Plastic Pollution.

The Committee estimated that nearly all (98%) of single-use plastic products are produced from fossil fuel rather than recycled plastic. By 2040, greenhouse gas emissions associated with such products will make up 19% of the global carbon emissions budget, or the amount of carbon emissions that will keep the planet from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, according to the Committee.

Stand.earth’s investigation used customs data, export/import data, company 10-K filings, supplier disclosure documents and investor presentations to trace supply chains for such single-use plastic packaging, per the April 1 press release. The report focused exclusively on packaging made of polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate, which in turn was derived from ethane extracted in the Permian Basin, Stand.earth said in an email to ESG Dive. The investigation was not able to quantify volumes of single-use plastics bought by each company because this is proprietary information, Stand.earth said in the email.

However, of the companies investigated, the Coca-Cola Company had the most supply-chain connections to petrochemical companies, with 10 links identified. Other companies with a high number of links were Unilever, Nestlé and PepsiCo, Stand.earth told ESG Dive. These are the same four companies that generate the most plastic pollution worldwide, according to a 2023 audit by the global coalition Break Free From Plastic.

The investigation highlights the role of plastics in the global climate crisis, Stand.earth Investigative Researcher Devyani Singh said in the press release.

“While much of the climate conversation focuses on transportation and energy, petrochemicals are quietly becoming the biggest driver of fossil fuel demand,” Singh said. “This research pulls back the curtain on the hidden supply chains behind plastic production, exposing the corporations fueling both the plastic and climate crises.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/NyT6zhNWCOTG4XGxlO9QbzwmgPcNwkjJtx6SviCBANI/g:nowe:0:160/c:2997:1693/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy00NjI4NDM1NDZfRjhnQUhUOS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-04-09 16:09:46.293094

ID35,S&P Global,2025-04-09 16:23:33+00:00,Axios,What robotaxis will mean for Uber and Lyft drivers - Axios,Joann Muller,,,,,https://www.axios.com/2025/04/09/robotaxis-uber-lyft-drivers,"Reality check: Cashiers aren't going away, and neither are factory workers or Uber drivers.
By the numbers: Uber controls about 75% of the U.S. ride-hailing market; Lyft owns the rest.
Uber drivers earn an average of $513 per week, while Lyft drivers gross $318.
Where it stands: So far, the presence of robotaxis in San Francisco, LA and Phoenix hasn't affected ride-hailing drivers much, Gridwise found.
Entrepreneurial drivers could run an entire fleet of robotaxis on Lyft.","As robotaxi services begin to spread across America, ride-hailing drivers could worry that they'll be pushed aside in favor of robots — or at least that their incomes will shrink.

Why it matters: Like manufacturing, retailing and other industries, transportation is a prime target for automation.

Reality check: Cashiers aren't going away, and neither are factory workers or Uber drivers.

Instead, they'll work alongside robots for the foreseeable future.

Driving the news: Uber and Lyft are starting to offer robotaxis as a ride option in select cities, joining Waymo, which is already in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix.

In the beginning, these robotaxis will be confined to certain neighborhoods and will only operate in optimal conditions.

But they'll help Uber and Lyft manage their networks more efficiently, such as during peak demand when prices often surge.

Longer term, as technology advances and costs come down, robotaxis could also mean cheaper fares for riders.

By the numbers: Uber controls about 75% of the U.S. ride-hailing market; Lyft owns the rest.

Drivers on both networks earn about $23 per hour, according to Gridwise Analytics, which collects driver data to track the gig economy.

Uber drivers earn an average of $513 per week, while Lyft drivers gross $318.

Where it stands: So far, the presence of robotaxis in San Francisco, LA and Phoenix hasn't affected ride-hailing drivers much, Gridwise found.

""Drivers are still working at the same pace, getting the same incentives, and taking as many trips as before,"" co-founder and CEO Ryan Green tells Axios.

The big picture: The hassles and costs of owning a car in urban areas have fueled the growth of ride-hailing platforms, especially among younger people.

That growth is expected to accelerate sharply over the next 15 years, as more people turn to ride-hailing for their daily commutes instead of just occasional use, say forecasters at S&P Global Mobility.

""Gen Z and Gen Alpha have a different mindset when it comes to mobility,"" Mario Franjicevic, a principal research analyst at the firm, tells Axios.

""They don't own CDs or vinyl. They don't own DVDs. They subscribe to Netflix and Spotify. They will do the same with mobility. Owning a car is not a status symbol to them.""

By 2040, S&P Global Mobility is projecting 15 billion ride-hailing trips a year in the U.S., up from 3.6 billion in 2024.

The intrigue: About half of those trips will be in robotaxis; the other half will still be driven by humans.

Between the lines: Jeremy Bird, Lyft's executive vice president of driver experience, described three phases of the robotaxi transition in a recent blog post.

Adoption: Robotaxis are still a novelty. There aren't enough of them to meet a city's transportation needs, and they can't operate in certain weather conditions or on certain roads. (That's where we are today.)

Hybrid network: Some riders will select robotaxis, but others will still prefer a human driver for extra assistance or premium service.

Lyft-ready network: Anyone's automated car can be deployed on the ride-hailing network to generate income when they're not using it. Entrepreneurial drivers could run an entire fleet of robotaxis on Lyft.",https://images.axios.com/69mTEojQcvyvSpt5vf2ffTGGQ9Y=/0x0:1280x720/1366x768/2025/04/09/1744208580073.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 15:13:39.450306

This annual United Nations observance day, established in 1993, highlights the importance of freshwater, and raises awareness about the 2.2 billion people worldwide living without access to safe water.

The brewery’s half-day event was hosted by the senior leadership team and attended by key stakeholders, including government officials, local media, strategic suppliers, and NGOs.

By aligning their event with World Water Day, Accra Brewery PLC demonstrated their commitment to addressing global water challenges while highlighting their own sustainable water management practices to stakeholders and industry partners.

Solomon Ayiah, Head of Legal and Corporate Affairs at Accra Brewery PLC said, “Beer is made of natural ingredients, with water being essential to both our beer and our business. We rely on farmers, clean water, healthy communities, strong suppliers and thriving natural ecosystems.

“Water is the number one ingredient in beer and a key resource in the communities where we live and work. As one of Ghana’s leading brewers, we are focused on finding solutions to global water challenges across our communities and supply chains.”

Diaan Kruger, Country Director at Accra Brewery added, “AB InBev is taking steps to reduce water usage by responsibly managing water consumption and discharge across its operations and supply chain.

“We are constantly innovating to reduce water use in our operations and, over the past year, have improved our water use efficiency by approximately 15%. However, we are not stopping there as we see our evolution as a journey of continuous improvement.”

As a responsible steward of Africa’s natural resources, Accra Brewery PLC is committed to ethical supply chain operations. The brewery’s dedication extends beyond its operations, ensuring a positive impact on the local economy while prioritising environmental responsibility. The World Water Day event provided a platform to showcase its commitment to water conservation excellence and reaffirmed the brewery’s role in protecting this essential resource for future generations.

AB InBev has implemented key water stewardship initiatives across all zones that are making a positive impact in local communities. Throughout its business operations worldwide, the company has compelling stories to share about its strong water stewardship efforts. These efforts include the automation of raw water tanks to prevent overflow, water recycling, automated water collection and water saving borehole installation and a range of other smart technologies.

“By highlighting our innovative approaches and measurable achievements in water management, we have strengthened our reputation as responsible stewards of natural resources. The event’s interactive demonstrations and brewery tour highlight AB InBev’s efforts towards providing all stakeholders, including media and the public a transparent view of our hands-on commitment to conservation efforts that benefit the entire country.

“The compelling data presented throughout the tour resonated strongly with attendees, generating positive feedback and meaningful dialogue about future collaborations. The event also provided an opportunity for key stakeholders to sign our pledge board, demonstrating their commitment to efficient water usage,” said Ayiah.

With growing global concerns about water scarcity, Accra Brewery PLC recognises its responsibility as a major consumer of water to lead by example in adopting sustainable practices.

“We continue to work toward our 2025 Sustainability Goals and our ambition to achieve net zero by 2040 across our value chain. We remain committed to continuous improvement as we work toward our goal of becoming the industry’s most water-efficient brewery by 2030,” said Kruger.

Meanwhile, smaller manufacturers categorized under “Others” saw a collective decline of 3.6%, indicating that market share is consolidating toward larger, more resilient players.
Bottom Line The PC market showed strong early traction in 2025, but the underlying picture is anything but stable.","The global PC market started 2025 on a strong note, with first-quarter shipments increasing 4.9% year over year to 63.2 million units, according to the data compiled by International Data Corporation (“IDC”). The data was impressive and marked the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. However, the near-term prospects of the PC industry seem highly volatile, given an uncertain environment triggered by the U.S. government’s new tariff policies, inflationary concerns and shifting PC upgrade cycles.

First-Quarter Growth: A Pre-Tariff Rush

At first glance, the first-quarter shipment data suggests strong momentum in the PC space. However, much of this growth appears to be driven by strategic stockpiling by vendors and buyers to have front-loaded orders ahead of new tariffs announced by the U.S. government in early April, according to IDC. These tariffs, which are expected to directly impact hardware imports from China, could raise costs for both suppliers and end-users in the coming quarters.

Per IDC, many players in the PC supply chain made calculated decisions to accelerate shipments in the first quarter to avoid additional tariff pressure. This makes the first quarter look stronger than it might have otherwise been. However, this elevated first-quarter performance has introduced uncertainty about how the rest of the year will unfold once the full impact of the tariffs takes hold.

Computer - Mini computers Industry 5YR % Return

Commercial Demand Still Intact

Though the first-quarter performance benefited from a pre-tariff stockpiling strategy, there are signs that some underlying drivers of PC demand remain healthy, particularly for commercial PCs. The demand for commercial PCs is likely to be driven by two structural tailwinds.

First, businesses are likely to refresh PCs ahead of the end of Microsoft’s Windows 10 support in October 2025. Second, rising interest in PCs equipped with on-device AI capabilities could be a major demand booster for the PC industry.

These trends have helped sustain steady demand in the first quarter. It is most likely that even if consumer sentiment weakens due to pricing pressure, the enterprise refresh cycle and AI-enabled device innovation could provide some insulation for PC manufacturers.

Vendor Performance and Market Share

Among the top five vendors, Lenovo LNVGY retained its market-leading position with 15.2 million shipments and a 24.1% market share, up from 22.8% in the same period last year. HP Inc. HPQ followed with 12.8 million shipments, gaining modestly from last year, while Dell Technologies DELL posted a smaller increase of 3% to reach 9.6 million units. HP and Dell Technologies had a market share of 20.2% and 15.1%, respectively.

Apple AAPL, however, stole the spotlight with the highest growth among the top players. Its first-quarter shipments surged 14.1% year over year, reaching 5.5 million units. Apple ended the quarter with a market share of 8.7%.

ASUS also stood out, growing shipments by more than 11.1% to capture a 6.3% market share. Meanwhile, smaller manufacturers categorized under “Others” saw a collective decline of 3.6%, indicating that market share is consolidating toward larger, more resilient players.

What’s Ahead for the PC Industry?

The April 2 announcement of new U.S. tariffs has introduced a wave of uncertainty. As of now, companies have yet to fully respond, but Ryan Reith, group vice president of IDC's Worldwide Device Trackers, believes it's only a matter of time before strategies shift. Vendors would start evaluating multiple options like relocating manufacturing, adjusting inventories or negotiating trade exemptions. However, Ryan opines that no matter what approach vendors would undertake, it is most likely that cost increases will ultimately hit consumers and enterprise buyers.

That raises the risk of delayed purchases in the coming quarters. If hardware becomes more expensive and economic sentiment weakens further, even a strong commercial refresh cycle may not be enough to sustain demand at the first-quarter levels.

Bottom Line

The PC market showed strong early traction in 2025, but the underlying picture is anything but stable. The pre-tariff inventory pull-in inflated first-quarter numbers and cast a shadow over the rest of the year. Investors should expect heightened uncertainty as the effects of tariffs begin to bite, especially if inflation and macro risks escalate.

The company reported a 4% decrease in the UK last year, citing a “challenging consumer environment.” It comes after Starbucks faced a boycott during the Israel-Hamas war last year, which executives say was a misconception.

The chain was named on a list of companies that support Israel, but Starbucks denied that claim. The company said in response to the list at the time: “We have no political agenda. We do not use our profits to fund any government or military operations anywhere — and never have.”

CEO Brian Niccol told Bloomberg at the time: ""The boycott and that whole information cycle, it's really unfortunate. Because obviously, it hurts the brand, it hurts our partners in the stores, and the thing that's really disappointing about it is, it's just not based on anything that's accurate or true, you know, we've never supported any militaries.""

It comes after Trump had a bizarre brain collapse in Biden-esque moment' while speaking for almost an hour on Wednesday, sparking health fears after yet another strange moment.

But it wasn’t just the boycotts. The chain has been hit with inflationary pressures as the cost of living continues to rise.

Duncan Moir, president of Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), said: “It has been a difficult period for the sector. We navigated significant macroeconomic pressures including inflationary headwinds which have also had an impact on consumer confidence.

“We are focused on regaining momentum by strengthening and scaling how we integrate technology across the business, building on the popularity of our Starbucks Rewards programme and further optimising our menu to ensure we continue delivering on our core offering every time.”

But the UK isn’t the only place where the company is looking to bounce back. Starbucks brought on Niccol as the new CEO last year, and he’s been tasked with bringing customers back to the coffee chain.

Capgemini expands strategic partnership with Google Cloud to revolutionize CX across industries with agentic AI

Paris, April 9, 2025 – Capgemini today announced a strategic agentic AI initiative with Google Cloud to transform customer experience (CX) into a key value driver for clients. Building on its existing partnership, Capgemini will create industry-specific agentic AI solutions designed to handle customer requests across all communication channels (web, social, phone etc.) and improve employee productivity. Underpinned by Google Cloud’s AI technology, Capgemini will develop bespoke solutions designed to enhance customer services with intelligent automation and deep customer insights, enabling organizations to deliver more personalized, efficient, and effective CX to elevate brand perception, increase loyalty, and drive revenue growth.

A recent report by the Capgemini Research Institute found that although customer service is considered strategically important, less than half of organizations feel prepared to integrate AI and generative AI into the function.1 Recognized as the Global Industry Solution Partner of the Year 2025 by Google Cloud, Capgemini will combine its deep industry expertise and technical capabilities to develop solutions powered by Google Agentspace and Customer Engagement Suite with Google AI. This will accelerate adoption of secure, trusted agentic AI capabilities that are interoperable with a client’s existing technology infrastructure and can support a variety of industry and regulatory needs. The agentic AI solutions will be designed to significantly optimize business processes and unlock commercial value by enhancing organizations’ own search capabilities, automating complex workflows, as well as understanding and proactively anticipating customer needs.

“Capgemini is entering the next phase of its strategic partnership with Google Cloud and this new collaboration focuses on driving revenue for our clients by elevating customer service to a strategic value driver in industries where CX is paramount,” said Fernando Alvarez, Chief Strategy and Development Officer and Group Executive Board Member at Capgemini. “The customer service function is undergoing a transformative shift as business leaders increasingly recognize its importance in unlocking commercial potential. Agentic systems can play a key role in this, and the future of customer service will require a strategic blend of human and virtual agents, enhanced by generative and agentic AI. By understanding the potential of agentic AI and the business realities of our clients, we’re expertly placed to maximize its value and deliver genuine impact.”

""Businesses require a combination of technical expertise and advanced technology to fully realize the benefits of agentic AI within their current IT infrastructure. Through Agentspace and our new Agent2Agent interoperability protocol, our partnership with Capgemini will provide clients with AI solutions that drive long-term value across industries,” said Kevin Ichhpurani, President, Global Partner Organization, Google Cloud.

Primarily focused on telco, retail, and financial services, the partnership is intended to expand into further industries such as life sciences and utilities, with a goal of accelerating business outcomes by enabling customer services transformation. This includes areas such as:

Improving productivity in telco: New solutions to optimize call routing and resolution in contact centers by leveraging conversational AI to improve intent and understanding, increase call containment and assist agents. Organizations can benefit from reduced handling time and improved first-call resolution rates, while human agents are freed-up to focus on higher value tasks. Capgemini’s research finds that around 9 in 10 organizations using gen AI are already seeing improved first contact resolution rates or expecting to see this benefit in the future.1

Personalizing CX in retail: AI agents to help better personalize shopping experiences by using AI to analyze customer data and provide tailored product recommendations, promotions, and support interactions across all channels (online, in-store, mobile).

Enhancing security in financial services Using Google Cloud’s AI, financial services clients can improve risk assessment and fraud detection with agents that analyze customer transactions and identify suspicious patterns, improving security and regulatory compliance.

Google Cloud’s new Agent2Agent interoperability protocol will enable AI agents to successfully communicate with one another, safely exchange information, and coordinate actions no matter which platform they are running on or built on top of. As agentic AI becomes more widely adopted, this protocol will ensure agent functionality across diverse and separate data sources and applications.

Google Cloud recognizes Capgemini as a trusted partner for driving clients’ large-scale transformation, with the company winning three Google Cloud Partner of the Year awards in 2025. The awards celebrate Capgemini’s expertise in creating compelling solutions that make an impact for joint clients worldwide:

Global Industry Solutions Partner of the Year

Global Industry Solutions Partner of the Year for Sustainability

Country Partner of the Year in Denmark

According to BTIG analyst Peter Saleh, customer pushback in international markets has the potential to be detrimental to American brands.
McDonald's global same-store sales grew 0.4% last quarter, a surprise considering the 0.91% decrease that Wall Street expected, but its US same-store sales were down 1.4% year over year, due to an E. coli outbreak in late October.
The brand's international stores saw positive same-store sales growth in the Middle East, and there was more growth in Japan and ""encouraging signs of stabilization"" in China.
For the company’s Q1 results, total same-store sales were down 4% year over year and international same-store sales fell 4%, while China sales dropped 6%.","Trump's worldwide reciprocal tariffs continue to cause huge upset among targeted countries, while brands in the US are worrying about the potential problems that lie ahead.

One concern among analysts is the anti-American sentiment towards US brands likely to emerge, which could in turn result in a major price increase for customers at places like McDonald's.

The effect of tariffs on commodity imports is generally small for food chains, as many of the ingredients used are domestically grown and most imports from Canada and Mexico are exempt from tariffs, under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

But there are other worries plaguing brands like McDonald's, Yum! Brands, Starbucks, and Domino's. According to BTIG analyst Peter Saleh, customer pushback in international markets has the potential to be detrimental to American brands.

Saleh told Yahoo Finance, ""The bigger issue, in my mind, is the anti-American pushback in these countries on Western or US brands ... we'll see ... what companies say when they start reporting in the next couple of weeks if they're starting to see that already.”

Foreign boycotts overall will cut US GDP by 0.1% to 0.3% this year, meaning a hit of roughly $28 billion to $83 billion, according to Goldman Sachs.

Analysts are also concerned about the tariff's impact on consumer spending.

UBS analyst Dennis Geiger wrote in a note to clients on Monday, “We view the direct cost impact of tariffs on restaurants as manageable, with a focus on select commodity costs, but see the bigger risk as incremental pressure on consumer spending and industry demand.”

This comes at a time when fast food businesses are only just getting back on their feet after reeling from the covid pandemic.

McDonald's global same-store sales grew 0.4% last quarter, a surprise considering the 0.91% decrease that Wall Street expected, but its US same-store sales were down 1.4% year over year, due to an E. coli outbreak in late October.

The brand's international stores saw positive same-store sales growth in the Middle East, and there was more growth in Japan and ""encouraging signs of stabilization"" in China.

Last month it was announced that McDonalds was no longer the largest restaurant chain in the world, as it was taken over by Chinese bubble tea and ice cream chain Mixue Bingcheng.

The bubble tea chain currently has more than 45,000 restaurants worldwide as of September 2024, while the number of McDonald’s restaurants all over the world remains at around 41,800, according to Statista via Chowhound.

Meanwhile coffee giant Starbucks is still fighting to see a rebound in its international business. For the company’s Q1 results, total same-store sales were down 4% year over year and international same-store sales fell 4%, while China sales dropped 6%.

Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said he visited China and saw firsthand ""how dynamic the market is and the opportunities ahead,"" as the brand continues to face lots of local competition in the country.",https://i2-prod.themirror.com/incoming/article1081775.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-522660468.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 18:08:36.227312

Department stores, including Macy’s, are closing about 150 underperforming stores, blaming competition from big box retailers and a shift to online shopping.","A popular grocery chain is closing its doors for good leaving locals unable to buy kitchen staples or pharmaceuticals.

According to Anchorage Daily News, Carrs-Safeway is closing its store and pharmacy located in a small town in Alaska.

The store, which is a subsidiary of Albertsons, has been open since 1957.

'It's devastating,' president of the Fairview Community Council James Thornton told Anchorage Daily News.

'The neighborhood needs this primary source of food, especially those that don't have vehicles.

'It's their only way to get food and medicine in a lot of cases.'

Community leaders have warned that locals in the town will not be able to buy essentials, with many residents lacking cars to drive further afield.

Former store manager Richard Watts Jr. called it “a very sad day”.

Watts began his decades long career at Carrs working at the Gambell store in 1964 as a box boy, and worked his way up to becoming a manager.

He said the store was unique as it was so central to the people in the neighborhood.

“The Carrs-Safeway on Gambell is the heartbeat of Fairview, so it’s almost like cutting the heart out of the community,” Watts said.

“I just hope another store opens there after it closes.”

The grocery chain said pharmacists and prescriptions will be transferred to the Carrs pharmacy nearby while 35 employees will be given the option to move to other stores in the city.

'Carrs-Safeway has been proudly serving Anchorage for decades, and the decision to close this store isn't one we made lightly,' the chain said in a statement.

'With our focus on growth, we continuously evaluate the performance of our stores, and occasionally it's necessary to close locations that are not growing and are perpetually unable to meet financial expectations.'

RETAIL APOCALYPSE

A number of major retailers are suffering as the sector grapples with changing consumer behavior, the rise of e-commerce, and inflationary pressures sparked by the pandemic.

With a raft of chains, including Walmart, winding back their retail footprint, experts say companies are suffering from increased borrowing costs and consumers tightening their wallets amid ongoing cost of living pressures.

According to analysis by retail data provider CoreSight, there has been a 24% increase in store closures in 2024 alone.

Amid growing concern over pharmacy deserts, CVS last year announced it had replaced CEO Karen Lynch with company veteran David Joyner and withdrew its 2024 profit forecast amid growing investor pressure.

In 2024, the pharmacy giant revealed plans to lay off nearly 3,000 employees, as the company struggles to drive higher profits and improved stock performance.

Department stores, including Macy’s, are closing about 150 underperforming stores, blaming competition from big box retailers and a shift to online shopping.

In its annual 10-K report for 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, Kroger said it recorded $684 million in merger-related costs last year.
Kroger also said it took on $34 million in interest expenses in 2024 related to $10.5 billion the company borrowed in preparation for its acquisition of Albertsons.
Kroger directed the bulk of the borrowed funds to the share-buyback program it implemented after the merger fell apart.
Albertsons is also seeking to collect a $600 million termination fee from Kroger.","Kroger poured more than $1 billion over three years into its unsuccessful quest to combine with rival Albertsons, the supermarket chain disclosed in a regulatory filing last week.

The expenses primarily consisted of third-party professional fees and credit facility fees Kroger incurred as it sought to obtain regulatory approval for the proposed merger, which drew fierce opposition from the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general on the grounds that it would be anticompetitive.

In its annual 10-K report for 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, Kroger said it recorded $684 million in merger-related costs last year. That amount was on top of $316 million the company spent on fees and other expenses related to the merger in 2023, as well as $44 million it devoted to the deal in 2022.

Kroger also said it took on $34 million in interest expenses in 2024 related to $10.5 billion the company borrowed in preparation for its acquisition of Albertsons. Kroger directed the bulk of the borrowed funds to the share-buyback program it implemented after the merger fell apart.

Kroger and Albertsons announced their intention to combine in a deal valued at $24.6 billion in October 2022, sparking swift and loud blowback from a range of foes that included labor groups and politicians as well as government antitrust officials. The FTC sought a federal court order to stop the merger, while the attorneys general of Washington state and Colorado asked state courts to block the deal. On Dec. 10, a federal judge granted the FTC’s request to halt the deal and a judge in Washington also ruled against the merger.

Kroger now faces the cost of defending itself against a lawsuit Albertsons filed accusing it of sabotaging the merger by not taking more aggressive steps to assuage the FTC’s concern that the deal would have created an overly powerful supermarket company.

According to sources cited by Bloomberg, these negotiations are part of CLN’s broader strategy to divest assets and restructure its financial obligations.

CLN, a longstanding manufacturer of metal components for the automotive sector, has been facing financial challenges, leading to its filing for court protection in October 2024. The company had previously proposed a 90% reduction of its unsecured debt, which was met with resistance from creditors. A revised proposal with a smaller reduction is currently under consideration. ​

In addition to the potential sale of its Italian plants, CLN is also in talks with Stellantis regarding the sale of facilities in Brazil and Poland. However, Stellantis has yet to make a formal commitment, and the future scope of CLN’s operations remains uncertain. ​

Founded post-World War II by Mario Magnetto, CLN is predominantly owned by the Magnetto family (75%), with the remaining stake held by steel producer ArcelorMittal. The company is headquartered near Turin, Italy, the historic base of Fiat—now a brand under Stellantis—and has expanded its operations across Europe, Latin America, China, and South Africa.

This development aligns with Stellantis Chairman John Elkann’s efforts to bolster Italian car production. Following the departure of former CEO Carlos Tavares, Elkann reaffirmed a commitment to procure €6 billion (approximately $6.5 billion) in orders from Italian suppliers during a parliamentary hearing in Rome earlier this month. ​

While official comments from Stellantis and CLN are pending, the potential acquisition of CLN’s Italian assets could represent a strategic move to stabilize the supply chain, preserve employment, and enhance production capabilities in the region amid ongoing challenges in the global automotive industry.​",https://moparinsiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STELLANTISLogo-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-04-09 12:20:14.512776

Building on its existing partnership, Capgemini will create industry-specific agentic AI solutions designed to handle customer requests across all communication channels (web, social, phone etc.) and improve employee productivity. Underpinned by Google Cloud’s AI technology, Capgemini will develop bespoke solutions designed to enhance customer services with intelligent automation and deep customer insights, enabling organizations to deliver more personalized, efficient, and effective CX to elevate brand perception, increase loyalty, and drive revenue growth.

A recent report by the Capgemini Research Institute found that although customer service is considered strategically important, less than half of organizations feel prepared to integrate AI and generative AI into the function.[1] Recognized as the Global Industry Solution Partner of the Year 2025 by Google Cloud, Capgemini will combine its deep industry expertise and technical capabilities to develop solutions powered by Google Agentspace and Customer Engagement Suite with Google AI. This will accelerate adoption of secure, trusted agentic AI capabilities that are interoperable with a client’s existing technology infrastructure and can support a variety of industry and regulatory needs. The agentic AI solutions will be designed to significantly optimize business processes and unlock commercial value by enhancing organizations’ own search capabilities, automating complex workflows, as well as understanding and proactively anticipating customer needs.

“Capgemini is entering the next phase of its strategic partnership with Google Cloud and this new collaboration focuses on driving revenue for our clients by elevating customer service to a strategic value driver in industries where CX is paramount,” said Fernando Alvarez, Chief Strategy and Development Officer and Group Executive Board Member at Capgemini. “The customer service function is undergoing a transformative shift as business leaders increasingly recognize its importance in unlocking commercial potential. Agentic systems can play a key role in this, and the future of customer service will require a strategic blend of human and virtual agents, enhanced by generative and agentic AI. By understanding the potential of agentic AI and the business realities of our clients, we’re expertly placed to maximize its value and deliver genuine impact.”

“Businesses require a combination of technical expertise and advanced technology to fully realize the benefits of agentic AI within their current IT infrastructure. Through Agentspace and our new Agent2Agent interoperability protocol, our partnership with Capgemini will provide clients with AI solutions that drive long-term value across industries,” said Kevin Ichhpurani, President, Global Partner Organization, Google Cloud.

Primarily focused on telco, retail, and financial services, the partnership is intended to expand into further industries such as life sciences and utilities, with a goal of accelerating business outcomes by enabling customer services transformation. This includes areas such as:

Improving productivity in telco: New solutions to optimize call routing and resolution in contact centers by leveraging conversational AI to improve intent and understanding, increase call containment and assist agents. Organizations can benefit from reduced handling time and improved first-call resolution rates, while human agents are freed-up to focus on higher value tasks. Capgemini’s research finds that around 9 in 10 organizations using gen AI are already seeing improved first contact resolution rates or expecting to see this benefit in the future.1

Personalizing CX in retail: AI agents to help better personalize shopping experiences by using AI to analyze customer data and provide tailored product recommendations, promotions, and support interactions across all channels (online, in-store, mobile).

Enhancing security in financial services Using Google Cloud’s AI, financial services clients can improve risk assessment and fraud detection with agents that analyze customer transactions and identify suspicious patterns, improving security and regulatory compliance.

Google Cloud’s new Agent2Agent interoperability protocol will enable AI agents to successfully communicate with one another, safely exchange information, and coordinate actions no matter which platform they are running on or built on top of. As agentic AI becomes more widely adopted, this protocol will ensure agent functionality across diverse and separate data sources and applications.

Google Cloud recognizes Capgemini as a trusted partner for driving clients’ large-scale transformation, with the company winningthree Google Cloud Partner of the Year awards in 2025. The awards celebrate Capgemini’s expertise in creating compelling solutions that make an impact for joint clients worldwide:

""We're obviously very excited about the acquisition,” Duetto CEO David Woolenberg told Hotel Management in an exclusive interview last week.
“The acquisition accelerates Duetto’s ambition to become the definitive revenue- and profit-operating system for the hotel industry.” The entire HotStats team—including CEO Michael Grove—will join Duetto.
The leadership team will continue to lead the business in partnership and collaboration with the broader Duetto team.
“Duetto customers can purchase HotStats’ financial-benchmarking solution to better understand relative performance and to improve efficiency and profitability across individual properties and portfolios.","The mergers and acquisitions across the hospitality industry are continuing apace: Revenue-management software company Duetto has acquired HotStats, a hotel benchmarking, financial-performance reporting, market data and insights company. Going forward, HotStats will operate as a subsidiary of Duetto and will be known as HotStats, a Duetto company. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

""We're obviously very excited about the acquisition,” Duetto CEO David Woolenberg told Hotel Management in an exclusive interview last week. “The acquisition accelerates Duetto’s ambition to become the definitive revenue- and profit-operating system for the hotel industry.”

The entire HotStats team—including CEO Michael Grove—will join Duetto. The leadership team will continue to lead the business in partnership and collaboration with the broader Duetto team. “We’re really building on an incredible foundation here,” Woolenberg said. “Duetto brings expertise in tech development, cloud-based software and operational optimization that will help drive better outcomes for HotStats and its customers.”

Building a Deal

HotStats’ financial benchmarking capabilities and global reach “align well” with Duetto’s focus on driving profit optimization across every revenue stream, Woolenberg said. “We can provide hoteliers worldwide with a differentiated view of both their top-line revenue and operating performance across rooms, food-and-beverage and ancillary services.” HotStats is a “trusted global brand” with longstanding customer relationships, he added—“Their team has put a lot of work into creating standardized reporting, data aggregation [and] reporting systems, which is incredibly valuable.”

The acquisition aligns with Duetto’s focus on top-line performance, adds the profit perspective and drives expansion into the data ecosystem, Woolenberg continued. “We love the culture of HotStats,” he said. “We love the brand they've built. They've got great relationships with their customers, and that aligns very well with what we've built at Duetto. We are excited to continue to innovate and develop new solutions for the hospitality industry.”

Benefitting the Industry

The two CEOs expect HotStats’ core offering in hotel-profitability benchmarking to support Duetto’s goal to give better visibility into top and bottom line, according to a statement from the two companies. The complementary products can provide a clear view of revenue and profit performance.

The leaders see other advantages of the partnership as well. “From a structural point of view, obviously the expertise that Duetto has in the areas of technical development, for instance, [is] where we should be able to leverage some of the expertise over time,” Grove told Hotel Management last week.

Overlaps and Opportunities

While there is some crossover between Duetto’s and HotStats’ audiences and customers, there is plenty of opportunity for both companies to continue to grow, according to Grove. “Partnering with Duetto allows us to uncover entirely new sales opportunities,” he noted. “The scale and efficiencies across the business will allow us to optimize our operating structure. There will also be the ability for us to leverage their expertise and allow us to scale from a business-development point of view.”

The solutions will be sold separately, but Woolenberg is excited to introduce HotStats products to Duetto’s existing customers. “Duetto customers can purchase HotStats’ financial-benchmarking solution to better understand relative performance and to improve efficiency and profitability across individual properties and portfolios. HotStats will sell their products to Duetto customers, and we hope to sell Duetto to HotStats customers—but they will remain distinct products.”

Woolenberg expects the two businesses to continue growing together as they have been doing individually. “We aspire to become the revenue- and profit-operating system for the hotel industry, and we think there's a huge value proposition underlying that,” he continued. “As we fulfill that vision, we expect to bring on more customers for both companies and unlock new growth channels. We are excited to explore what we can innovate and build for the industry in the coming years.”

I don't mean that in a bad way, but, indeed, no matter where you venture — be it within Toronto or, really, anywhere else in the world — you're sure to find a Starbucks location not too far away.
Losing Starbucks locations is nothing new for the neighbourhood, who have seen locations at Queen and Hammersmith (now a Pizzaiolo location) and Queen and Waverley (now What A Bagel) shut down in years past, nor is it for Toronto, who saw dozens of Starbucks locations close down in a restructuring back in 2021.

Oh, Starbucks. We've come a long way since the early days of the Seattle-based coffee house.

What was once viewed as an indie enclave for pretentious bohemians has evolved into the McDonald's of coffee shops. I don't mean that in a bad way, but, indeed, no matter where you venture — be it within Toronto or, really, anywhere else in the world — you're sure to find a Starbucks location not too far away.

For my part, living within spitting distance of a handful of exemplary indie coffee houses with the nearest Starbucks location a longer walk away, my own patronage to the coffee chain has waned in recent years, but I once could have been the poster child for the chain.

More specifically, growing up in the Beaches, the location at Queen East and Brookmount was a second home to me, supplementing early mornings in high school and hunger that could only be sated with a pink cake pop before after-school activities.

Though I've since moved out of the neighbourhood and don't visit that location much anymore, I couldn't help but be heartbroken to learn that that very location — 1842 Queen Street East — is slated to shut down for good this spring.

More recently, locations on Queens Quay and Queen West have closed down, too. Maybe they just don't like Queen?

A representative from Starbucks tells me that, rather than some Queen-related bias, the closure of my beloved Queen East location actually comes as the result of a natural lease expiration.

""When we approach the end of a lease with any of our stores, we review the partner and customer experience, and after careful consideration, we decided to not renew our lease at this location,"" they explain.

The last day of operation for the location will be May 18, they add.

In her newly created role at Callen, she will identify growth opportunities for the agency’s roster of clients, including Disney+, Supercell, and Olipop.
Davidson, meanwhile, brings over 20 years of production expertise to Callen, most recently serving as executive vp and managing director of brand production at PXP, Publicis Groupe’s global content and production network.
In his new role, Davidson will oversee all production activities across the agency’s portfolio.","Austin-based independent agency Callen has appointed Jess Monsey as its first-ever chief opportunity officer and named Mike Davidson head of production.

The leadership expansion comes after the creative shop, which doubled in size between 2023 and 2024, reported a 12% revenue increase in the first quarter of 2025.

Since the start of the year, it has also added five new clients to its books, including Vera Bradley, Nutpods, and Long Drink.

Monsey, a former Wieden+Kennedy president and managing director, and 72andSunny managing director, returns to the advertising industry after a two-year hiatus spent developing The Paladins League, a library of over 500 tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons.

She brings a wealth of experience from her previous roles where her work for brands such as Old Spice earned her Cannes Grand Prix awards and a Grand Effie.

In her newly created role at Callen, she will identify growth opportunities for the agency’s roster of clients, including Disney+, Supercell, and Olipop. She will also lead proactive business outreach initiatives.

Davidson, meanwhile, brings over 20 years of production expertise to Callen, most recently serving as executive vp and managing director of brand production at PXP, Publicis Groupe’s global content and production network.

Throughout his career, he’s led creative campaigns for brands like Nike, Coca-Cola, and Old Spice, earning Cannes Lions and The One Show accolades. Davidson’s experience also includes senior roles at Media.Monks and Wieden+Kennedy, where he worked closely with Callen’s Craig Allen and David Hughes.

In his new role, Davidson will oversee all production activities across the agency’s portfolio.

A bumper year ahead

The new hires will help sustain momentum and drive further expansion for the agency, which now employs 25.

Founder and chief creative officer Craig Allen attributes much of Callen’s success to the agency’s collaborative culture. “Our full-time employees often start in a freelance role to ensure that we’re a good fit for each other both socially and professionally, like a test drive without all the awkward negotiating at the end,” he told ADWEEK.

“We like to keep a healthy balance between work and fun and create an environment that people want to be a part of, so we’ve been lucky that the people we really want here also very much want to be a part of what we’re building.”

Monsey told ADWEEK the role drew her back to advertising because of the opportunity to collaborate with a bold, creative team.

“I get lit up working with creative people who lead with imagination and a deep desire to take extraordinary creative leaps that people never saw coming,” Monsey said. “Craig is the epitome of that, and together with Mike, the three of us have a track record of work that I’m insanely proud of.”

David Hughes, president at Callen, shared his thoughts on the new chief opportunity officer remit: “Since I have known Jess, no one has unlocked more opportunities where others might not have seen it,” Hughes said. “Leading all things ‘opportunity’ for Callen—with existing or new partners—only made sense as her officially-official title.”

Hughes said Davidson’s ability to push boundaries in production, and “execute at the highest level of craft, and foster innovative thinking,” made him the perfect fit for the team.

Davidson views production as a “vital component” to the agency’s wider strategy: “Woven into our process throughout, we work more efficiently in moving from ideas to making, more strategic utilization of our client budgets and driving growth through successful delivery and performance of our creative output,” he said.",https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/callen-staff-2025.png?w=600&h=315&crop=1,N,,2025-04-09 12:23:15.180039

Razer.com has mysteriously delisted all laptop products in the US, including the upcoming Razer Blade 16. Instead, the site is only offering various accessories. Its Canada site continues to take laptop orders and preorders.

For now, Razer is remaining mum on the change, telling The Verge, “We do not have a comment at this stage regarding tariffs.” But we wouldn’t be surprised if the company is taking a page from Nintendo and reviewing potential price changes to offset cost increases from Trump’s tariffs, which take effect on Wednesday.

Framework Computer, another PC vendor, has also temporarily discontinued several base models of the company’s 13-inch laptop, citing Trump’s tariffs on Taiwan. “We priced our laptops when tariffs on imports from Taiwan were 0%. At a 10% tariff, we would have to sell the lowest-end SKUs at a loss,” the company said.

In a tweet, Framework also claims that rival PC makers have been quietly delisting lower-priced products in response to the tariffs. Indeed, MSI’s online store seems to have stopped accepting new laptop orders as well; the site is only showing a “notify me” option.

Trump’s reciprocal tariffs are expected to affect a wide range of consumer electronics since most are made in the tariffed countries, including China, Vietnam, India, Malaysia, and Cambodia. Entry-level products, which have thin margins between their manufacturing cost and final price, will see the most impact, forcing vendors to raise prices, analysts have told PCMag.

“As far as I can tell, almost all consumer electronics categories would be better off being bought sooner rather than later, especially given the latest threat of an additional 50% tariff on China,” said Ishan Dutt, an analyst with Canalys.

On Wednesday, Trump plans on raising tariffs on Chinese imports to 104%, which threatens to drastically raise prices for many products.",https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/04PCJaNrpR9atOdujeHTEIX-1.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1744145288.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 14:10:51.635233

'What it really means to be a barista' Zavatsky, from Nanticoke, started working as a barista seven months ago.
There are 18 employees at the Wilkes-Barre location, Zavatsky said.
But hopefully after ours goes through, they [will] get motivated and cheer on Starbucks Workers United,” Zavatsky said.
“The backing of the Starbucks Workers United … makes it a lot easier,"" Zavatsky said.","Employees at Starbucks' location on Kidder Street in Wilkes-Barre are looking to unionize. They also say they have been under heightened scrutiny from corporate management since they filed election paperwork on March 24.

“We've had the district manager coming in a lot more lately, kind of observing us. We've noticed a few people actually sitting in the lobby taking notes … and just staring at us for almost the entire day. They've started cracking down on the dress code, on time, attendance and a lot of other things so far,” barista Bree Zavatsky said.

Staff at the Kidder Street location, which opened last year, are looking to join Starbucks Workers United (SBWU), a national unionization effort of over 10,500 baristas at over 550 stores. A vote is expected in the coming weeks.

Starbucks spokesperson Phil Gee denied the $89.18 billion company was engaging in any union-busting efforts.

“At Starbucks, our success starts and ends with our partners (employees). We respect our partners' right to choose, through a fair and democratic process, to be represented by a union or not to be represented by a union, and will continue to work together to make Starbucks the best job in retail,” Gee wrote in an email.

'What it really means to be a barista'

Zavatsky, from Nanticoke, started working as a barista seven months ago. She said she liked the work at first more than her previous jobs.

“But I'm kind of slowly realizing how much corporate really doesn't have the workers' best interests in mind,” Zavatsky said during a phone interview.

Zavatsky claims Starbucks is “cracking down” on workers by scheduling shifts with fewer breaks and by demanding they cut drive-through wait times to 45 seconds without hiring extra staff.

There are 18 employees at the Wilkes-Barre location, Zavatsky said.

“I think everyone around here is honestly scared of Starbucks' union-busting. So, they're kind of just waiting it out until we have our election and see how it goes. But hopefully after ours goes through, they [will] get motivated and cheer on Starbucks Workers United,” Zavatsky said.

Lyssie Parente, a shift supervisor of six months, accused Starbucks of “empty promises,"" and said the work environment is taking a toll.

“We get increased workloads with decreased hours and a paycheck that laughs in our faces, all while feeding us the ‘we're a family’ and ‘we care about mental health,'"" Parente said.

""We're angry, we're frustrated, we can't sleep at night, we're anxious, we're depressed,"" Parente said, adding: ""but we are still here because we are the change we want to see in this company, and we demand the respect and fair treatment we deserve.""

Ashton Balliet, a shift supervisor at the Kidder Street location, said her store is “not anti-Starbucks. We believe a union is the best way to get back to what it really means to be a barista.”

“Year after year, Starbucks claims to be going back to its roots, but the only seeds being planted are those in the CEO’s pockets,"" Balliet said in a statement emailed from the union.

Negotiations update

Workers United formed nearly four years ago in Buffalo, New York to push for higher wages. Starbucks recognized the union last year, but negotiations have stalled since January 2025 over a collective bargaining agreement.

Starbucks gave a brief update on negotiations.

“Starbucks and Workers United have agreed to engage a mediator to assist the two parties in reaching a framework for single store contracts for our partners represented by the union. We have made progress over the last nine months of bargaining, and we are committed to continuing to work together — with a mediator’s assistance — to navigate complex issues and reach fair contracts,” Gee said.

Workers United spokesperson Claire Connolly said the mediation process is confidential and she could not share specifics about negotiations.

""Starbucks Workers United understands the concerns of their member baristas and are committed to fighting for a fair contract that addresses wages, staffing issues and strong benefits,” Connolly wrote in an email.

Zavatsky hopes neighboring Starbucks locations will start to unionize by late April, after her location holds its election through the National Labor Relations Board.

“After that, we get to join the cause for Starbucks Workers United and get their protections … Unfortunately for now, it is a waiting game for the next three weeks,” Zavatsky said.

She believes the union ""definitely has our backs on this"" in the meanwhile, adding that the union has filed 90 complaints against Starbucks in January alone.

“This effectively closes off options for rerouting international trade flows, which means these countries will not only feel the full force of tariffs but there will be broader disruption to global supply chains,” Jeremy Leonard, managing director of global industry services at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients.

Southeast Asian Countries Are Looking to Make a Deal—As Apparel Makers Hold Their Breath

Changes may be coming as Wednesday's tariff deadline approaches. Cambodia has offered to cut tariffs on U.S. goods, Indonesia is offering to negotiate and Thailand is seeking to boost U.S. imports.

Trump has said Vietnam has offered to cut its tariffs to zero. However, his trade advisor Peter Navarro later told CNBC that it “means nothing to us because it’s the nontariff cheating that matters,” citing concerns about intellectual property theft or Chinese products making their way to the U.S. through Vietnam. Bloomberg reported that a top Vietnamese official has headed to Washington, D.C., for negotiations.

The outcome of the negotiations could have a significant impact on American companies. Nike’s stock fell sharply after Trump’s tariff announcements and has failed to regain momentum. The company sources 50% of its shoes and 28% of its apparel from Vietnam, according to its most recent annual report.

Nearly 20% of U.S. apparel imports and 34% of footwear imports come from Vietnam, and Cambodia, Bangladesh and Indonesia are also major exporters, Straton wrote.

But It's Not Just Southeast Asia That Will Be Affected

Though markets had expected punishing tariffs on China, the tough policies against Southeast Asia were a surprise, Morgan Stanley consumer retail analyst Alex Straton wrote in a note to clients last week.

“Past efforts to diversify away from China will no longer afford much protection,” Straton wrote.

Global growth could also suffer as Trump aims to “accelerate a significant reorganization of global trade and financial flows,” wrote Alejo Czerwonko, chief investment officer for emerging markets in the Americas at UBS.",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/jfmEx2jDiLWcyDjRvxe2R7OdeLI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-22083068511-ad504db7d16c469ca9d219e08b9a3c01.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 15:13:17.715829

While he has not yet revealed the specifics, the industry is girding for potentially disruptive fees that will, according to many experts, do nothing to encourage onshoring of pharmaceutical manufacturing or make drugs cheaper.

“Put on your life vest, as the waters are getting choppier,” BMO Capital Markets analysts warned in a note to investors early Wednesday morning.

As the industry awaits official word from the administration, pharma stocks are tanking, and analysts and other experts are considering the possible scenarios.

Arthur Wong, senior director of corporate ratings, healthcare, at S&P Global Ratings, pointed out that pharmas cannot just suddenly switch manufacturing to the U.S., even though most of the major companies have facilities in the country.

“It’s just a matter of how much capacity and how quickly can you switch that capacity to the U.S. so you could sidestep the tariff,” Wong told BioSpace.

There are a lot of unknowns at this point, but Wong said the tariffs will come down to what tax rate companies are charged as they move operations back to the U.S. “That’s the whole reason why they’re manufacturing [in] Ireland,” for example, he said.

BMO analysts agreed that pharmas do “capitalize on housing [intellectual property] in foreign jurisdictions.” But some companies like Eli Lilly and Vertex Pharmaceuticals have huge operations in the U.S. Lilly also just announced a $27 billion investment in manufacturing stateside. So did Johnson & Johnson, with a $55 billion commitment.

“It’s hard to believe that any administration would want to harm US companies, let alone US BioPharma, which is, in our view, an extremely enviable sector,” BMO wrote. “The US consistently has first access to the best medicines globally, reliable supply of any medicine. Having some supply chain overseas is good, as this adds redundancy/reliability.”

The industry had been working toward shifting some manufacturing outside of China due to pressures from Congress last year to do so. The BIOSECURE Act was to mandate a phase out of operations with certain contract manufacturing organizations like WuXi Biologics. While the legislation never passed—and as of now, has not been taken up again—the threat spooked biopharma into taking action.

But even if a pharma does have a facility capable of producing drugs in the U.S., finding the necessary staff to operate it will prove challenging, Wong said.

“Where are you going to hire these people from?” he wondered aloud. “The labor market is pretty tight within healthcare and to get people trained up and have that expertise brought up, that’s going to be difficult, and it’s going to take time to get the full efficiency.”

Wong pointed to the semiconductor industry, which has been similarly challenged to bring manufacturing to the U.S. “They have to bring people over from Taiwan into the States,” he said. “So do you do the same thing with bringing people over from Ireland [for pharma manufacturing]?”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday offered a solution: hire laid off federal workers to staff manufacturing jobs. But Wong says these jobs are highly skilled and take time to train for.

“I’m not saying you can’t find it, but it’s going to take time to hire up and it’s going to take time to train,” Wong said. “It’s going to take time to get to that higher level efficiency. I gotta think you have to bring people over from overseas.”

BMO agreed. “Global supply chains are complex, with Pharma among the most,” the analysts wrote—""it’s not as simple as moving where someone screws in little screws to make an iPhone.”

Running Out the Clock

Another key question is whether the tariffs will be based on the cost of goods, including raw materials, labor and direct factory overheads. Other uncertainties include the tariff rate, whether the fees will be phased in or dumped whole hog, and what products they will apply to.

Tariffs could hit big, branded biologics and high-margin products or lower cost generics, Wong said. Both options would be a big blow to the industry. Generics make up about 90% of prescriptions written in the U.S., while biologics and brand-name drugs make the most revenue.

For the high-margin branded products, Wong said, “there’s going to be some cost-cutting, and it’s going to take time to reabsorb that hit on the tariff.” Pharmas have more leeway to pass the costs on to customers, he added. On the generics side, pharmas have little wiggle room to raise prices and absorb the tariff cost because of the “commodity-like nature” of the market, according to a recent S&P Global Ratings analysis.

Ultimately, a lot of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) still come from overseas, China in particular. Trump has particularly targeted China with the highest tariff rates and pharmaceuticals have not been excluded from that. If a 10% tariff is enacted on API from China, S&P estimated that a generics company would take a 2% to 3% hit on its profit margins. If companies do seek alternative sources for these drug ingredients, S&P worried about supply disruptions and an exacerbation of drug shortages.

Wong noted that companies sign long-term contracts for these ingredients; they can’t just sever agreements on a whim. The BMO group said that often manufacturing facilities are situated near the source of ingredients to ease the production process.

With all these factors to consider and the time to implement any shifts in production, BMO speculates that pharma is simply going to wait out the changes brought by the new administration. “We expect most large pharma’s are likely to look at imposed tariffs with the intention of ‘running out the clock,’ waiting until the end of Trump’s presidency to consider more permanent manufacturing decisions.”

While innovative, unapproved products likely won’t be directly targeted, S&P noted that the tariffs could put a chilling effect on the pharma and life-science industries, impacting clinical trials and patient data. This could lead to delays in new drug development.",https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/ab31863/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1354x762+0+6/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F58%2F16%2F1b11ffa9498fb76d228d361c661d%2Fistock-1343489133.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 13:19:01.073946

Sofia Quaglia reports for The Guardian.

In short:

Researchers identified 56 major companies responsible for half of all plastic waste, with six companies –Altria, Philip Morris International, Coca-Cola, Nestlé, Danone and PepsiCo– producing a quarter of that.

Over five years, the team collected 1,870,000 items of plastic waste across 84 countries.

Companies are making efforts to increase recyclability and reduce virgin plastic use.

Despite corporate initiatives, plastic production and pollution have risen in lockstep, challenging the effectiveness of current recycling efforts.

CVS Health named a new CFO Tuesday as the healthcare giant continues to shake up its leadership team.

Brian Newman, most recently CFO of shipping and logistics firm UPS, will start at CVS on April 21. Tom Cowhey, who took on the permanent CFO position at CVS early last year, will become a strategic adviser to CEO David Joyner, effective May 12.

In addition to the leadership change, CVS said it expects financial results for 2025 to meet or exceed its previously issued guidance. In February, the company reported expected adjusted earnings for the year between $5.75 and $6 a share.

Dive Insight:

Newman will receive a base salary of $1 million, and his target annual equity award compensation will be $7 million, CVS said in a securities filing.

Cowhey will step down from the finance chief position about a year and half after he first took on the interim role.

He started at CVS in 2022, and then took on the interim CFO job in October 2023 after previous finance chief Shawn Guertin left due to family health reasons.

Cowhey will serve as strategic adviser and assist with transitioning his work until he leaves the company on a date that hasn’t yet been determined, according to a securities filing.

CVS also named Amy Compton-Phillips, previously chief physician executive of survey and patient experience firm Press Ganey, as chief medical officer, beginning May 19. She replaces Sree Chaguturu, who was named president of CVS’ healthcare delivery business in November, the company said in the filing.

The latest appointments come as CVS has made a number of recent leadership changes in recent months while it navigates a challenging financial environment. The company cut 1% of its workforce during layoffs last year, among other hardships.

The company’s profits were nearly cut in half last year as CVS’ insurance unit, Aetna, weathered heightened medical costs, particularly in government healthcare programs like Medicare Advantage and Medicaid.

Joyner took up the chief executive post in October, replacing Karen Lynch as the firm pulled earnings guidance due to elevated expenses at Aetna. Weeks later, the company named Steve Nelson, previously the CEO of value-based primary care company ChenMed, as president of the insurer.

Those are the health care industry's powerful middlemen between drug manufacturers and pharmacies, often owned by the same entities that operate drugstores or insurance companies.

Before Tuesday's amendment, a CVS Health executive told IndyStar that Senate Bill 140 was ""one of the most extreme pieces of legislation we've seen."" A Delaware-based pro-PBM lobbying group, Conservatives for Lower Care Costs, took out local ads on airways and social media urging lawmakers to vote the bill down.

A House committee on Tuesday decided to rein in the biggest swing in the bill which would have prevented PBMs and health insurers that operate in Indiana from having an ownership stake in one another, known as vertical integration. This is the case among each of the country's largest PBMs: For example, CVS Health Corporation owns CVS Caremark, the PBM with the largest market share in the country, as well as CVS Pharmacy and insurer Aetna.

But make no mistake, says the committee chair, Republican Rep. Martin Carbaugh: Senate Bill 140 will still make some significant moves to challenge the consolidated industry.

""I think it's much bigger than maybe people realize,"" he told IndyStar.

'Throw the marketplace into chaos'

Opponents of vertical integration argue it gives PBMs more power to manipulate the market in favor of profits at the expense of patients, since there's less competition ― an allegation over which the Federal Trade Commission has sued the three largest PBMs. Those three largest PBMs conduct 80% of the country's prescription drug business.

PBMs say the blame for high drug costs lie with the manufacturers, and PBMs use their market power to negotiate rebates. Because of how widespread and common vertical integration is, making it illegal in Indiana would wreak such administrative havoc as to make doing business in Indiana impractical for many PBMs, Prem Shah, executive vice president and group president of CVS Health, told IndyStar.

""It's going to throw the marketplace into chaos, honestly,"" he said.

The bill's author, Republican Sen. Ed Charbonneau of Valparaiso, himself called it an ""aggressive"" idea in a committee meeting. The bill is the result of six years of studying and toying around the edges of PBM issues. He told IndyStar it's been tough to make progress.

""Big picture wise, it appears we’re losing ground,"" Charbonneau said.

He also said he wasn't at all surprised to see an amendment curtailing it, given the well-funded special interests that surround this issue. Several members of the House insurance committee, too, work in the insurance field, including Carbaugh.

Carbaugh looks at that as a strength in coming up with a final product that balances legitimate business concerns with what would help lower costs for Hoosiers. Plus, he said he's not sure that the state trying to force multi-state companies to divest from their other businesses would hold up in court.

""To the extent that I think a bill may harm my clients, my constituents, I do consider that. But I think I should represent my constituents that way,"" he said. ""We do have to be careful. Sometimes we want to drop a hammer and a lot of things get broken in the process.""

What the amended bill does

Carbaugh sees the new version of the bill as tackling the competition issue in a free-market way. One example: If a self-insured company hires an insurer like Anthem to administer their health benefits, under this bill, Anthem will not be allowed to require that the employer use Anthem's preferred PBM, nor would Anthem be allowed to charge the employer more for using a different PBM.

He hopes this language will help PBMs that are not the big three or four actually get into the ring.

""We have 44 contracted PBMs in state of Indiana, and they can’t even compete for, I would say, decent-sized companies,"" he said.

A significant piece that remains in the bill, that was of great importance to mom-and-pop and independent pharmacists ― including the former pharmacist who now occupies a position in Gov. Mike Braun's cabinet ― is language ensuring PBMs do not under-reimburse pharmacists for the prescription drugs they acquire. And, it says PBMs can't reimburse pharmacies they own differently from pharmacies they don't own.

Independent pharmacists say this practice where PBMs under-reimburse pharmacists and pocket the profit, known as spread pricing, is what's led to 100 pharmacy closures in the last two years in Indiana.

And it's what leads Harry Webb, owner of Webb's Family Pharmacy in Rochester, to say that he might not be able to hand off his business to the next generation, despite operating in the small town since 1860.

""Who’s going to buy it?"" he said. ""I’m barely making money.""

Under this bill, beyond requiring PBMs to reimburse pharmacies at cost, it also provides pharmacies that do not sell alcohol a bonus ""dispensing fee"" as part of their reimbursement. The PBM industry likens these fees to a ""pill tax"" and asserts the extra costs will only be passed along to employers, and then likely to Hoosiers.

Rep. Robin Shackleford, D-Indianapolis, who helped with the amendment, said the idea is to give the smaller independent pharmacies a little boost, more so than the Krogers and Walmarts of the world that have pharmacies and sell alcohol.

""We do need to move toward everyone getting a dispensing fee,"" she said. ""But as for today, and what everyone is willing to accept, this is just a compromise.""

Charbonneau said it's likely that the Senate won't agree with the House's changes and that this will then get hammered out in a conference committee. As to whether the most drastic language has a chance of getting revived, at least a few weeks ago, Charbonneau gave it an optimistic 50/50 odds.

But one of the biggest obstacles tends to be just how complicated the space is.

""Six years ago I wanted to find out what happens when a bill goes off the Lilly production line and it goes into Ed’s mouth,"" he said. ""I still don’t know. ... This is an octopus with 40 tentacles.""

EU-US Trade For the EU, the fight over American metals tariffs started in 2018 during Trump’s first term, when the US hit nearly $7 billion of European steel and aluminum exports with duties, citing national security concerns.
In that first salvo, the US hit steel goods with 25% tariffs and aluminum with 10%, and included exemptions for certain products.","The European Union approved tariffs to hit around €21 billion ($23.2 billion) of US goods in retaliation for the 25% duties President Donald Trump imposed last month on the bloc’s steel and aluminum exports.

A majority of the EU’s 27 member states on Wednesday voted in favor of the penalties, some of which will start taking effect in mid-April. The tariffs will target politically sensitive American states and include products such as soybeans from Louisiana, home to House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as diamonds, agricultural products, poultry and motorcycles.

The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, said in a statement that the countermeasures can be suspended at any time “should the US agree to a fair and balanced negotiated outcome.”

The move adds to the growing transatlantic trade war, with the US also having applied a universal 20% tariff on nearly all European exports as well as a separate 25% duty on cars and some auto parts. Trump has said he’ll announce additional tariffs on lumber, semiconductor chips and pharmaceutical products. All of Trump’s new tariffs are hitting around €380 billion of EU goods.

Some of the EU tariffs will take effect on April 15, while another list will be imposed mid-May and a third will start on Dec. 1, Bloomberg reported earlier. Most of the targeted goods face a 25% tariff level, with a few categories set to face 10% levies.

Bourbon was removed from the bloc’s list amid pressure from member states after Trump threatened 200% duties on wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages from France and elsewhere.

Trump has repeatedly attacked the EU, the US’s largest trading partner, saying it was formed to “screw” the US and that the bloc’s trade-in-goods surplus is evidence of an unfair relationship. The EU’s trade weighted average tariff rate was 2.7% in 2023, according to World Trade Organization data.

“They come up with rules and regulations that are just designed for one reason: that you can’t sell your product in those countries,” Trump said earlier this week. “And we’re not going to let that happen.”

The EU’s trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, discussed parameters of possible engagement on trade issues with his American counterparts late Tuesday, according a commission spokesperson. Talks have so far yielded little progress and US officials don’t appear to yet have a clear negotiating mandate from Trump, according to people familiar with the discussions.

The bloc’s executive arm is working on a “term sheet” of potential areas for negotiation, including lower tariffs, regulations and standards, Bloomberg previously reported.

Wednesday’s vote underscored the unity in EU capitals in the face of Trump’s escalating trade dispute. The American measures threaten to wipe out much of the euro-area expansion the European Central Bank forecasts for this year and next.

In addition, the commission, which handles trade matters for the bloc, is preparing a set of countermeasures to retaliate against the so-called reciprocal tariffs that went into effect Wednesday. The commission is planning to announce its plans early next week and then begin consultations with member states, a spokesperson said.

The universal tariffs are meant to target all the trade barriers US exports face abroad, such as duties, domestic regulations and taxes, including the value-added tax. Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen has previously said the EU “holds a lot of cards,” including retaliatory tariffs and targeting American services and technology companies.

France, Germany and other countries have called on the commission to consider deploying the bloc’s anti-coercion instrument — the EU’s most powerful trade tool, designed to strike back against nations that use trade and economic measures coercively, Bloomberg reported earlier.

The bloc still wants to find a negotiated solution to the tariff dispute but so far it has failed to engage in meaningful negotiations with the US administration.

EU-US Trade

For the EU, the fight over American metals tariffs started in 2018 during Trump’s first term, when the US hit nearly $7 billion of European steel and aluminum exports with duties, citing national security concerns. At the time, officials in Brussels scoffed at the notion that the EU posed such a threat.

In that first salvo, the US hit steel goods with 25% tariffs and aluminum with 10%, and included exemptions for certain products.

The 27-nation bloc reacted by targeting politically sensitive companies with retaliatory duties, including Harley-Davidson Inc. motorcycles and Levi Strauss & Co. jeans. The measures were applied product-by-product and included agricultural goods and apparel in addition to steel and aluminum products.

The two sides agreed to a temporary truce in 2021, when the US partly removed its measures and introduced a set of tariff-rate quotas above which duties on the metals are applied, while the EU froze all of its restrictive measures.

The downturn is accompanied by a 9% fall in gross profit and a 4% year-on-year decline in UK revenues to £525.6m.

The coffee giant attributed its performance to factors such as high raw material costs, reduced consumer spending and “widely discussed misperceptions” about the company’s stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict.

Starbucks also noted the impact of a highly competitive branded coffee shop market in the UK, which has seen increased investment in domestic speciality coffee chains. This surge in investment has intensified the competition for Starbucks in the UK.

Despite this, we achieved our goal of opening 100 new stores in the UK.

“We remain committed to further expanding our presence and are today announcing that we will open an additional 80 stores in the UK this year.

Used sporting goods Decathlon launched its marketplace for sellers in Belgium at the end of 2020, later expanding to the United Kingdom and other European countries, including Germany.
Since last spring, selling partners have also been able to offer used sporting goods on Decathlon.de.","Last year, Decathlon generated 26 percent of its German trade volume online. The marketplace’s share within that has nearly doubled in just one year. The platform serves as a catalyst for growth for Decathlon, both in Germany and beyond.

Globally, Decathlon achieved a revenue of 16.2 billion euros last year. Adjusted for inflation, this represents a 3.8 percent increase compared to the previous year.

Online revenue

Digital sales are becoming increasingly important for the French sporting goods retailer. Last year, 20 percent of its global revenue came from online sales, including ecommerce, in-store connected orders, and marketplaces – up from 17 percent in 2023. In Germany, however, the online share is significantly higher.

In its reports, Decathlon also emphasizes its focus on the importance of the planet and people. Despite sales growth, the company reduced its CO2 emissions last year. Additionally, it continues to employ more people, now with staff from 87 different nationalities. The proportion of women in the workforce has also increased.

Omnichannel strategy and marketplace

In a separate report on Germany, Decathlon attributes its positive revenue development to “the consistent implementation of its omnichannel strategy, which seamlessly integrates the digital and physical shopping experience”. The company also highlights “the remarkable development of the online marketplace”, which accounted for 20 percent of digital sales last year. For comparison: in 2023, this was 11 percent, and in 2022, just 7 percent.

Given that Decathlon’s German marketplace has not been active for very long, its rapid growth is not surprising. However, platform sales are exceeding expectations. It has become a catalyst for further profitable online growth, much like what has been seen with online marketplaces of MediaMarkt, Zalando and Otto.

Used sporting goods

Decathlon launched its marketplace for sellers in Belgium at the end of 2020, later expanding to the United Kingdom and other European countries, including Germany. Since last spring, selling partners have also been able to offer used sporting goods on Decathlon.de.

Newer categories that offer a “denim lifestyle” like dresses, skirts and outerwear are also in growth mode, outpacing the rest of Levi’s business.
Levi Strauss & Co.’s plan to navigate President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs relies on an agile global supply chain and deep vendor relationships.
In the company’s Q1 2025 earnings call on","Levi Strauss & Co.’s plan to navigate President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs relies on an agile global supply chain and deep vendor relationships.

In the company’s Q1 2025 earnings call on Monday, Michelle Gass, LS&Co. president and chief executive officer, said the San Franscisco-based company’s ability to pivot will be key to how they address the issues in the short, medium and long term.

LS&Co. sources from 28 countries, 20 of which are countries that are imported to the U.S. Companies in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Egypt, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam are among Levi’s top vendors—countries that Trump placed 10-49 percent “reciprocal” duties against on April 2.

Describing the situation as “fluid,” Harmit J. Singh, LS&Co.’s executive VP and chief financial and growth officer, said they’re the process of scenario planning and determining different mitigation strategy.

“We recognize this is a quickly evolving macro situation and we have to see where the dust settles to give you the guidance that is going to be as helpful to you as possible,” he said.

For now, LS&Co.’s full year outlook remains unchanged and includes no impact from Trump’s tariff spree. However, Gass mention three times during the call that almost 60 percent of the company’s revenue is generated outside the U.S., underscoring the value of its international business especially if the U.S. falls into a recession.

Singh said the Q2 outlook remains consistent with the company’s internal plan. “The effects of tariffs will have a minimal impact to our margin structure in the quarter, as most of the product for spring, early summer is already in the U.S.,” he said, adding that Q2 is seasonally the company’s lowest quarter for revenue and margins in the year.

In uncertain times, Levi’s leans on its heritage—a narrative that Gass highlighted during the call.

“As an iconic brand with more than 170 years of history, we’ve weathered challenging times before. We have a playbook that begins with leveraging the strength of our brand and our deep connection with consumers. We know, especially during times like these, people turn to the brands they know and trust and prioritize value and quality. And that’s what Levi’s has always stood for,” she said.

Growth spurts

Levi’s brand was up 8 percent for the quarter. Sales in the U.S. increased 8 percent and international grew 9 percent, driven by growth in Mexico, the U.K., France and Germany. Two-third of the growth was led by units and a third by higher AUR.

Levi’s DTC-first strategy continues to gain momentum with DTC sales up 12 percent in Q1. DTC ended the quarter at 52 percent of total global net revenues, accounting for over half of the brand’s total revenue. New store openings in Italy, Mexico and India, a broad assortment of products and strong e-commerce sales supported this growth. Gass said AURs in the DTC channel are up mid-single digits as consumers gravitate to premium products. The brand also intentionally pulling back on promotions in Levi’s stores.

“DTC productivity actions, including improving the front-of-house consumer experience and back-of-house efficiency, are driving growth across key metrics, including strong conversion and traffic trends, fueling significant margin expansion in this channel,” she said. “I see firsthand how our strategies and actions are driving these results when I walk our stores and get feedback from our team.”

Online, the brand is working to elevate the consumer experience by upgrading the content on the site with higher quality imagery and enhanced storytelling. “We’re featuring more use of videos on our product detail pages, which allow our consumers to see our products in motion. And we’re seeing a strong response from our consumers with customer satisfaction scores for the U.S. e-com business rising to its highest level ever,” Gass said.

Wholesale business delivered another quarter of growth, up 5 percent. Gass said U.S. wholesale exceeded expectations in the quarter, up 9 percent, in part driven by door expansion and more space for Levi’s broadened lifestyle assortment.

Gass said the women’s category continued to accelerate, growing double digits over the last two quarters and now represent 38 percent of net revenues. Tops represents more than 20 percent of the heritage brand’s business, which has more than doubled over the last ten years.

Newer categories that offer a “denim lifestyle” like dresses, skirts and outerwear are also in growth mode, outpacing the rest of Levi’s business. Gass points out that while Levi’s remains the leader in jeans, the brand’s portfolio “beyond denim bottoms” comprises 35 percent of total sales.

In Q1, bottoms were up 9 percent. Gass attributed the success Levi’s achieved in volume to its fit diversification strategy.

“We have a style for everyone, for every occasion and for any time of year. Loose and baggy fits, which make up roughly 15 percent of our total bottoms portfolio, continue to be a significant growth driver. For her, we’re building on the trend with new fits. A great example is our launch of the Cinch Baggy, available across both DTC and wholesale, which went viral on TikTok and created tremendous interest with search volumes surpassing 200 million,” she said.

Levi’s also introduced the 568 loose straight and the 578 baggy for men. “While there’s so much buzz around the loose and baggy trend, slim and skinny styles remain a wardrobe staple and comprise more than 20 percent of both our women’s and men’s bottoms businesses,” Gass said.

“We are proud to call the Mitchell family our friends and partners for decades.
“We’re getting great support from our top vendors because they really believe this is our moment,” says third-generation co-CEO Bob Mitchell.

“So, I went to Coach and worked in the North American outlet business, then to their parent company, Tapestry, before going to business school at Columbia.” There he took family business courses and even joined the university’s family business club.","In a precarious period of high-stakes retail roulette, what could a modestly sized 67-year-old family-owned-and-operated luxury retailer possibly teach larger, more established department stores about business? As it turns out, almost everything.

Founded in 1958 by husband-and-wife team Ed and Norma Mitchell, what would eventually become known as Mitchells Stores began as “Ed Mitchells” in an 800-square-foot former plumbing supply store in Westport, Connecticut, offering a curated collection of menswear. But the secret to the couple’s early success wasn’t predicated on the clothing they stocked—exactly three private label Doncaster suits and a small selection of shirts and sweaters by American manufacturers like C.H. Hathaway, Joseph & Feiss Co., and Cluett Peabody’s Arrow brand—instead, it was owed to deep community ties and a hot pot of coffee.

In 1979, Ed Mitchells expanded from an 800-foot former plumbing supply store to its current location in Westport, CT. The department store would later change its name to Mitchells.

Although it might sound like home-spun lore (or a calculated, albeit charming, public relations yarn) the Mitchells always started their day with a cup of coffee at home before Norma would brew a fresh pot to take into the store. “Back then, what was the first thing you’d do when someone stopped by your house,” asks Andrew Mitchell-Namdar, the brand’s third-generation owner and chief marketing officer. “You’d make them a cup of coffee.” It’s a tradition that has evolved over the years and across the retailer’s ever-expanding portfolio to include extensive coffee counters with high-tech Italian espresso machines and fully stocked bars offering everything from Champagne to specialty cocktails mixed in your fitting room.

Still, if you haven’t heard of Mitchells Stores, you’ve likely shopped in one. While beloved department stores like Barneys New York have become a distant memory and Saks Fifth Avenue was plotting to gobble up Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman as part of a $2.7 billion acquisition—and with the Nordstrom family preparing to take its eponymous 120-year-old department store chain private in a $6.25 billion deal—the Mitchells have steadily increased their retail footprint under the radar. Following the flagship’s move to its current Westport location in 1979, and a subsequent early ’90s expansion, the Mitchells acquired Richards in Greenwich, Conn. in 1995; bought Marshs in Huntington, New York, in 2005; became Wilkes Bashford’s succession plan with its acquisition of his namesake San Francisco and Palo Alto outposts in 2009; took over Marios’ Pacific Northwest stores in Seattle, Portland, and Bridgeport in 2015; and, just this month, announced the acquisition of Stanley Korshak in Dallas.

News about the family’s purchase of the fabled Uptown Dallas department store from its former owner, Crawford Brock, elicited praise from long-time Mitchells friend and vendor Brunello Cucinelli who says that both families “have exemplified the highest values in luxury retail, deeply rooted in the art of relationships, community and exceptional service” and that the union will “strengthen the American retail landscape.” The Paone family, owners of Kiton, also found it noteworthy, particularly given the state of relations between larger troubled retailers and their vendors. “We are proud to call the Mitchell family our friends and partners for decades. Their reputation for excellence, and relationships with designers from around the world, will perfectly expand and compliment the magnificent selections and experience at Stanley Korshak,” they offered in a statement.

It’s partly to that mix of reputation and relationships that the family attributes its continued prosperity. “We’ve had back-to-back record-breaking years, so we continue to believe in what we’re doing and all of us, as owners, feel confident that our formula is sound,” Mitchell-Namdar says about the company’s customer-first mentality and strategy of maintaining individual store identities within their portfolio. “We don’t change the brand names, we want to honor their histories—if you asked most Wilkes customers if they knew it was part of the now largest specialty chain in the United States, they probably wouldn’t.” Though it creates something of a branding challenge, the formula works. “We’re getting great support from our top vendors because they really believe this is our moment,” says third-generation co-CEO Bob Mitchell. “And, as brands are cutting back distribution, they’re choosing to be with us—we have no debt which is an important thing in this business today.”

When you consider the refinancing that Neiman Marcus underwent in 2021 to eliminate $4.4 billion of its nearly $5 billion total debt, what the Mitchells have achieved at their own scale, over the same period of time, is considerable. “Some of it is a surprise, but if you’ve been here as long as I have, you learn it’s not easy to predict what’ll happen tomorrow,” shares third-generation co-CEO Russ Mitchell about the company’s financial success. “But what you can do is be prepared to seize an opportunity when it happens—we’re poised to grow, but not at breakneck speed and we want to stay private.” It’s a sentiment shared by his brother. “We like to be very nimble,” says Mitchell-Namdar. “The best thing you can do is be ready. We were investing when other people weren’t, and that’s helped us to grow.”

In the early ’90s when brothers Bob and Russ joined the business under their father, second-generation owner Jack Mitchell, and their uncle Bill, the company was positioned for its first major pivot. “There was a big recession in 1991 and when we felt we were coming out of it, we decided to bring in womenswear in 1993, and the business really took off,” Bob says. “It was a big growth spurt early in my and Russ’s careers, and after that we decided to [acquire] Richards in Greenwich.” While the family continued to operate Richards as a menswear shop until 2000, Mitchells’ women’s collections cornered the Westport market: Armani, Escada, Dolce & Gabbana, Donna Karan, Jill Sander, Michael Kors, Missoni, and Ralph Lauren were but a few of the early designer accounts. “The business then was dressier, and we didn’t have the casual luxury we do today; it didn’t exist,” Bob adds. “But we’ve always responded to what our communities want.” Today, Mitchells carries an alphabet soup of top brands and designers, that resonate with its clientele, from Akris and Brioni to Valentino and Zegna.

“The Mitchell family has created one of America’s unique retail experiences, executed by few,” offered Ralph Lauren about the family’s business and emeritus chairman Jack Mitchell’s 2003 book, which chronicles the retailer’s philosophies and practices. “Their passion for the intimate relationship with the customer, and the loyalty that is created, has rarely been duplicated.” Giorgio Armani agreed. “[Jack] has always pursued this goal by focusing on the one real added value: the human factor. His achievements demonstrate how personal involvement and emotional stimulus are qualities you can’t do without.”

Even more than a cup of joe, it’s that connection to their clientele in each of their stores that has made all the difference for Mitchells. “We stock the shelves with what people buy, and if something isn’t selling, we stop carrying it,” says Bob. “It’s definitely been a metamorphosis to see the communities and luxury business change, but it’s the connection between luxury and personalized service that creates a great value proposition for our clientele.” When the family took over Wilkes Bashford there was concern about casualization and whether a younger customer would still want a high level of personal service, but the worry soon subsided. “In Palo Alto we started meeting these 30-year-olds who had all the money in the world, and they were consuming services more so than even our Connecticut customer, because they’d never had good service before,” explains Bob. “All of a sudden, they came in and had someone help them put together a great outfit, or tailor something, and then it was like, ‘Hey, can you pack for us.’” Though they weren’t buying suits, the thirty-something tech founders and investors were buying Brunello Cucinelli cashmere sweaters, sport coats, and five-pocket casual pants. “At that time, Brunello was the first to really capture what he called ‘sportivo chic’—a way to dress casually but still look like you’re sophisticated,” Bob says.

Technology has also played a major role the Mitchells’ success. One of the company’s game-changing tools is a proprietary internal app they developed that allows salespeople and management to communicate with each other and its patrons, and contains information on all the company’s shoppers, from contact details, birthdays and anniversaries to their alteration status, purchase history, and even what they were looking at on the website the night before. “There’s a daily feed gives you all the information you need to service your clients in the best way possible,” says Mitchell-Namdar. “With the ease of an iPhone you can text them right away, send them images, let them know their alterations are done—it creates a very robust little black book for sellers to proactively reach out.” The app also facilitates ways to locate an individual product on any salesfloor and, within seconds, direct its transfer to another store. “What we’re really good with is the back end,” adds fourth-generation owner Lyle Mitchell who, at 30 years old, joined in July 2023 as a business development and finance manager. “It’s where you get leverage by having sellers becoming better communicators, and we win at that.”

Brothers and second generation owners, Bill and Jack Mitchell in the early 2000s. Jack wrote Hug Your Customers, the best-selling book about the family’s business philosophies and practices.

Mitchells also has a hands-on e-concierge group aptly named after the founding matriarch, Norma, who focused on customer service, as well as a “Reserve in Store” service that allows clients to peruse the entire enterprise’s inventory online and have items shipped to their local store without committing to the purchase. “If someone reserves $10,000 worth of stuff, they’ll end up spending close to that, but they’re only buying about 30 percent of what they reserved,” Bob says. “We’ve found that people are bad pickers online and that’s why return rates are so high—but they still want to buy.”

As for the Mitchell family’s succession planning and its fourth generation, entering the business means following a structured protocol established to ensure active participation is the right fit. After five years post-college, during which time they’ve developed skills working for other companies in, and outside of, retail, interested family members can apply to open roles that suit their respective talents and interests. “I joined after my brother, Lyle, so he was the first to test out the policy” explains 28-year-old Dana Mitchell who worked in education with Teach for America and later in learning and development at Zegna and in sales for ski apparel brand Bogner, before joining the company in April 2024 as an assistant team lead at the Westport store. “Neither of us reports directly to family, which is great, and we have an advisory board to help us through the process.”

The Mitchells’ succession planning is in full swing. With the second generation comfortably retired, third- and fourth-generation owners are posed for continued growth.

It’s a system that works, particularly in the way it leverages an incoming family member’s interests and abilities. “I began in more traditional corporate finance, but in the healthcare sector, and knew that’s generally where I wanted to go long-term, but healthcare wasn’t for me,” says Lyle. “So, I went to Coach and worked in the North American outlet business, then to their parent company, Tapestry, before going to business school at Columbia.” There he took family business courses and even joined the university’s family business club. “Talking with other people and hearing their stories gave me an even greater appreciation for how special family business are, so I thought who better to learn from than my dad and Russ who are at the peak of their careers.”

From a cup of coffee and relationships built on trust to tactical technologies that only enhance human interactions, the Mitchells wrote the book on how to succeed in the luxury retail marketplace—and competitors might want to stop in for an espresso to get a read on how it’s done. “Customers may have a loyalty to certain brands, but their loyalty to people is stronger we think,” Russ explains. “There are always exceptions, but to most people, relationships with other people are stronger, so we’ll always maintain that as a core strategy.”","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1970b227-fcf9-4a76-b569-db8e235c4632.jpg?crop=1xw:1.0xh;center,top&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-04-09 11:12:07.803396

It was alleged Huawei, after being banned from working with TSMC, passed its AI chip designs to Sophgo, which in turn gave the blueprints to TSMC manufacture to order as if they were Sophgo's designs.
Sophgo would then give the finished chips to Huawei, without TSMC knowing, allowing Huawei to side-step American sanctions and acquire advanced semiconductors that should have been off limits, it was feared.
TSMC had previously manufactured Huawei's chips, including the Ascend series, up until the Chinese telecommunications titan was put on the US Entities List in 2019.
Huawei gave its AI accelerator chip designs to Sophgo, it's claimed.","TSMC could end up paying $1 billion or more to settle a US investigation into whether the Taiwanese outfit busted sanctions, inadvertently or not, by indirectly manufacturing AI accelerators for Huawei.

Citing two unnamed persons said to be familiar with the matter, Reuters on Tuesday reported the penalty could amount to as much as twice the value of transactions between TSMC and Chinese chip designer Sophgo last year.

As you may recall, Sophgo was accused in late 2024 of acting as a front for Huawei, which had been cut off from TSMC by US sanctions.

It was alleged Huawei, after being banned from working with TSMC, passed its AI chip designs to Sophgo, which in turn gave the blueprints to TSMC manufacture to order as if they were Sophgo's designs.

Sophgo would then give the finished chips to Huawei, without TSMC knowing, allowing Huawei to side-step American sanctions and acquire advanced semiconductors that should have been off limits, it was feared.

TSMC suspected this plan was afoot when Sophgo placed orders for a chip closely resembling Huawei's Ascend 910B AI accelerator, and raised the alarm to Uncle Sam.

As we've previously reported, the Ascend 910B is among Huawei's most-sophisticated processors, boasting performance roughly on par with a now five-year-old Nvidia A100, with 320 teraFLOPS of FP16 performance.

TSMC had previously manufactured Huawei's chips, including the Ascend series, up until the Chinese telecommunications titan was put on the US Entities List in 2019. Being on that list means you can't do business with or using American organizations and technologies without special permission from Uncle Sam, simply put.

Because TSMC relies on US tech to fabricate chips, those export controls extended to the Taiwanese corporation, and meant that as of 2020 Huawei could no longer source silicon dies from the foundry giant without permission from the United States.

These controls didn't however apply to Sophgo, a fabless chip designer specializing in the RISC-V instruction set, hence its role in the suspected scam. Although Sophgo denied the allegations of sanctions busting, US officials weren't buying it, and earlier this year Sophgo joined Huawei on the Entities List.

So to summarize:

Huawei had its top-end AI processor designs manufactured to order by TSMC's factories.

Huawei was cut off from TSMC as a supplier by US sanctions.

Huawei gave its AI accelerator chip designs to Sophgo, it's claimed.

Sophgo went to TSMC to have the chips manufactured, as if they were Sophgo's own designs, with the intention of quietly funneling the parts back to Huawei once completed, it's alleged.

TSMC, looking at the designs, thought they closely resembled Huawei's, put two and two together, cut off Sophgo, and alerted the US government of the suspected sanctions busting.

Despite blowing the whistle on the alleged shenanigans, it seems the Trump administration nonetheless intends to extract penalties from TSMC. This is despite the corporation's plans to expand US fab production to the tune of $100 billion, announced by CEO CC Wei alongside US President Donald Trump last month.

The reported penalties may be part of a broader crackdown by the US Bureau of Industry and Security on export violations.

""We will not allow adversaries to exploit American technology to bolster their own militaries and threaten American lives,"" US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last month as part of another round of restrictions on AI exports. ""We are committed to using every tool at the Department's disposal to ensure our most advanced technologies stay out of the hands of those who seek to harm Americans.""

Alaska-based Carrs-Safeway will shut its store and pharmacy on Gambell Street in Anchorage on May 10, after nearly 70 years.

The store, managed by Carrs-Safeway, a subsidiary of Albertsons, has been a downtown staple since 1957.

Community advocates warn the closure will hit the Fairview neighborhood hard, as many residents lack cars and can't travel farther to buy essentials.

'It's devastating,' president of the Fairview Community Council James Thornton told Anchorage Daily News.

'The neighborhood needs this primary source of food, especially those that don't have vehicles.

'It's their only way to get food and medicine in a lot of cases.'

Longtime employee Richard Watt Jr. recalled starting at the store in 1964 as a box boy and later becoming its manager.

'It's a very sad day, the Carrs-Safeway on Gambell is the heartbeat of Fairview, so it's almost like cutting the heart out of the community,' he said of the closure.

'I just hope another store opens there after it closes.'

Watt's said he was hired by the store as its first black employee in Anchorage after picketing Carrs with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) for not hiring people of color.

'I just heard and it's like, ""What? Oh no!""' Christina Anowlic, who has been shopping at the Gambell location since the 1980s told the Anchorage Daily News.

'It's kind of sad,' she added.

The 35 employees of the Gambell store will be given the option to transfer to other Carrs stores in the city, a spokesperson for Carrs-Safeway confirmed.

The pharmacists and prescriptions will be transferred to the Carrs pharmacy in the Midtown Mall on Seward Highway.

'Carrs-Safeway has been proudly serving Anchorage for decades, and the decision to close this store isn't one we made lightly,' the chain said in a statement.

'With our focus on growth, we continuously evaluate the performance of our stores, and occasionally it's necessary to close locations that are not growing and are perpetually unable to meet financial expectations.'

Carrs-Safeway will continue to operate its remaining seven stores in Anchorage.

'We're going to do everything we can to fight this, because I don't know how Fairview continues on without our Carrs store,' Thornton said.

'It's the original Carrs store in Anchorage and a lot of people love it. And the people that run it have done a great job supporting the community over the years.'

While the merger failed, the competition between Kroger and Albertsons has only intensified.","Once hailed as a potential retail revolution, the proposed Kroger–Albertsons merger was set to reshape the grocery industry in the United States. However, what began as a strategic partnership has now turned into a battle of narratives, legal hurdles, and public opinion. Once eyeing unity to challenge Walmart’s dominance, Kroger and Albertsons now find themselves at odds—not just with regulators, but with each other.

The $24.6 Billion Dream

In October 2022, Kroger announced its intent to acquire Albertsons for $24.6 billion, in a move that would have created a grocery powerhouse with over 5,000 stores and a customer base stretching coast to coast. The goal? Combine strengths, cut costs, and boost bargaining power in an increasingly competitive market dominated by Walmart, Amazon, and discount retailers.

Both companies framed the deal as a win-win for American consumers, promising better pricing, improved supply chain efficiency, and stronger competition. But almost from the start, the deal faced strong resistance.

FTC Says No – Consumer or Political Move?

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) blocked the merger in early 2024, citing concerns about reduced competition, higher food prices, and potential store closures in local markets. Critics feared that combining the second and fourth-largest supermarket chains in the U.S. would create regional monopolies, limit supplier options, and lead to job losses.

While Kroger and Albertsons offered to sell hundreds of stores to C&S Wholesale Grocers to ease antitrust concerns, the FTC remained unconvinced. The rejection sparked outrage from both sides, especially from Kroger’s leadership, who believed the move was more political than economic.

Cracks Begin to Show

With the deal off the table, what followed was not just disappointment—but growing tension. Legal teams, PR strategies, and shareholder interests quickly changed tone. What was once a shared vision became blame games and competing strategies.

Albertsons, having invested heavily in preparing for the merger, began to seek alternative partners or restructure internally. Kroger, meanwhile, redirected focus on its own operations, accelerating digital transformation, automation, and private label expansion.

From Allies to Enemies

Now, rather than joining forces, Kroger and Albertsons are locked in a silent war—for market share, supplier loyalty, talent, and future relevance.

Albertsons is reported to be revisiting previous plans to spin off parts of its business, while Kroger is leveraging its size and infrastructure to undercut regional rivals, possibly including Albertsons stores.

Insiders say both companies are now more aggressive in price wars, especially in overlapping markets like California, Colorado, and the Pacific Northwest.

Meanwhile, public perception has shifted: What was once seen as a bold merger is now being remembered as a failed alliance, with long-term consequences.

The Bigger Picture: What Does This Mean for Retail?

This high-stakes fallout between Kroger and Albertsons highlights the broader uncertainty in U.S. retail. Consolidation is no longer guaranteed. Regulatory authorities are becoming more protective of competition, especially in essential sectors like food and health.

Consumers, too, are becoming more vocal—demanding lower prices, more choices, and ethical business practices. The Kroger-Albertsons saga is a lesson that bigger isn’t always better, especially in a highly regulated, politically sensitive environment.

Conclusion: What Now?

While the merger failed, the competition between Kroger and Albertsons has only intensified. Both companies now fight for dominance in a tough market where every dollar counts. What once looked like a marriage of giants is now a retail rivalry that will define the next chapter in American grocery.",https://internationalsupermarketnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-cropped-isn_corporation_logo-1-32x32.webp,N,,2025-04-09 11:11:10.760471

Supply chain interruptions reinforced its commitment to integration, but as its global presence expanded, so did its manufacturing footprint.
The first five stages—Invention, Production, Manufacturing at Scale, Vertical Integration, and Diversification—were key to Philips’ global success.
Identifying the right applications and optimizing the integration of these technologies could redefine how products are designed, manufactured, and distributed.
Let’s structure these cells to follow Philips’ successful trajectory—first achieving manufacturing at scale, then enabling vertical integration, leading to product diversification, and finally supporting overseas production.","“From sand to customer” was originally the business philosophy of Philips. The Dutch electronics firm was a pioneer in lightbulbs and later leveraged its expertise into X-ray tubes, radios, shavers, and cassettes. Initially, Philips outsourced many components or produced them overseas. For example, glass for its lamps was blown in Prague while the bulbs were manufactured in Eindhoven.

Philips began producing lightbulbs in Eindhoven in 1891, but it was only in 1916 that the company started blowing glass there. The interruption of pre-made glass supplies during World War I necessitated bringing this process in-house. Later, production in Prague and other locations resumed alongside Eindhoven before being cut off again by the Iron Curtain.

For many decades, Philips manufactured glass, lightbulbs, and tubes in Eindhoven. The company took in sand and transformed it into radios.

Philips was vertically integrated to an almost extreme degree. It not only produced and transported sand and other raw materials but also manufactured polymers, built injection molding machines, developed chips, and even created the machines used to produce those chips. The company made record players and operated its own recording studios. Supply chain interruptions reinforced its commitment to integration, but as its global presence expanded, so did its manufacturing footprint.

Local manufacturing was not driven by lower labor costs but by practical necessities such as tariffs and shipping challenges. Establishing production facilities worldwide ensured market access, allowing Philips to dominate emerging markets. By conducting R&D locally, it could attract the best minds globally. Operating within different regions also provided strategic advantages, enabling the company to better understand local markets, cultures, and needs. For instance, Philips developed spice grinders specifically for India and hand-cranked radios for Indian servicemen stationed in remote bases with limited access to power.

However, in later years, the company shifted its focus to outsourcing primarily to cut costs. Once a co-inventor of groundbreaking technologies like the CD, cassette, and LED—and a founding force behind industry giants such as TSMC and ASML—Philips lost its way. Without a clear vision, decisive leadership, or the willingness to make bold choices, it ran out of momentum. Once legendary for its design and marketing, it became uninspired and ordinary.

Its strong social instincts made it bloated and complacent, lacking the drive and daring that had once defined it. In its early years, Philips was fearless—so much so that, after the Dutch Queen was involved in a minor car accident, the company sent a letter to her secretary suggesting that the accident could have been avoided had Philips street lamps been installed. At one point, after nearly being pushed out of the lightbulb business, Philips resorted to industrial espionage to imitate U.S. firms. It once had guts, ambition, and even questionable ethics. But over time, it became slow, timid, and visionless.

Philips invested in commercializing a wide range of innovations, from MRI machines and street lighting to body shavers. However, it failed to grant its divisions the autonomy, resources, and capital needed to compete effectively in these diverse markets. The company was unprepared for the commoditization of technology, the rise of low-cost brands, the shift to e-commerce, and the resurgence of premium brands.

A series of ineffective CEOs further weakened the company, and poor leadership ultimately transformed it into a medical innovation firm—yet one that lost its commitment to quality and innovation. Instead of a cohesive organization, Philips became a fragmented collection of loosely connected units.

Deep job cuts did little to address the real problem: leadership that failed to recognize the significance of Apple, the internet, mobile phones, and the decline of big-box retail. Worse still, they failed to adjust course to navigate this new reality. With a brand that, while trusted, lacked strength, and an outdated understanding of the world, Philips gradually faded into a shadow of its former self. By delaying difficult decisions for too long, the company left itself with few good options.

NXP now has a market cap twice that of Philips, while ASML is ten times larger, and TSMC is approaching a trillion-dollar valuation. Many companies today resemble Philips in its later years—hesitant to make tough decisions, out of touch with customers, and failing to deliver products the world truly needs.

Countless firms have been commodified, yet they are the only ones who fail to recognize it. Volkswagen’s strategy of producing a car for every niche mirrors Nokia’s once-dependable but ultimately misguided approach. Stellantis is teetering on the edge, while many Mittelstand companies are running on fumes, struggling to compete with rising Chinese manufacturers.

If we view Philips’ rise and fall as a series of distinct phases, we might categorize them as follows: Invention, Production, Manufacturing at Scale, Vertical Integration, Diversification, Overseas Production, Lethargy, Blind Cost Cutting, and Sclerosis.

The first five stages—Invention, Production, Manufacturing at Scale, Vertical Integration, and Diversification—were key to Philips’ global success. These, combined with a strong identity, clear values, adaptability, and an openness to opportunity, formed the foundation of its dominance. The question is: can we replicate this success in a self-contained, modular form using 3D printing?

Can we develop a modular production environment capable of generating most of a product’s value within a monolithic system? Given today’s global supply chains, where components come from all over the world, this is only feasible for select products. However, there are still many cases where value can be created through the integration of a few automated technologies working in unison within a cell-like production system.

Imagine a system that integrates directed energy deposition (DED), water jetting, CNC milling, and laser powder bed fusion—a tightly coordinated unit capable of handling complex manufacturing tasks in a way that is more versatile, cost-effective, and adaptive than traditional methods. The key is to move beyond the OEM mindset. Just because you sell oranges doesn’t mean you should be limited to making orange juice or only products containing orange juice. I don´t care about your bonus, I care about my future. Think of a production cell, like those used for turbine blisk repair, but with a broader range of integrated technologies—one that doesn’t just scan, mill, and apply DED but incorporates additional complementary processes.

The concept of an automated production cell capable of manufacturing a wide range of products—from car seats and office chairs to armor and boat hulls—is a compelling evolution of manufacturing. These modular, flexible cells would require significant upfront investment but minimal manual labor, offering adaptability across products, geographies, and economic conditions. Their plug-and-play nature, enabled by commodity materials and quick calibration, would allow rapid deployment in response to shifting political and tariff landscapes.

This approach transforms manufacturing into a dynamic system rather than a static factory. A single cell could pivot between different products, adjust to new iterations, and evolve with market demands. By integrating multiple 3D printing technologies with automated conveyancing, scanning, CNC milling, and other processes, these production cells could create value in ways that standalone 3D printers never could.

The opportunity here is enormous—on the scale of Philips at its peak. Identifying the right applications and optimizing the integration of these technologies could redefine how products are designed, manufactured, and distributed. The ability to scale, shrink, retool, and relocate production at will makes this model resilient and future-proof.

While 3D printing alone was never the magic bullet for fully automated, end-to-end manufacturing, combining it with other technologies in a self-contained, mobile production system could make it work. Let’s structure these cells to follow Philips’ successful trajectory—first achieving manufacturing at scale, then enabling vertical integration, leading to product diversification, and finally supporting overseas production.

Trump instituted 10% tariffs across all countries last Saturday and slapped higher reciprocal tariffs on 60 countries and trading blocs today.
Customers can expect grocery prices to increase “in the next couple of weeks,” said John Ross, the CEO of IGA, a chain of independent grocery stores.
Shoppers are pulling back Grocery prices already frustrated customers before tariffs.
Grocery prices overall have increased around 23% since 2021, with prices on individual items like coffee and chocolate rising much faster.","President Donald Trump, during his announcement last week of sweeping tariffs on countries around the world, called groceries an “old-fashioned” and “beautiful term.” But his policies will make America’s groceries more expensive today, supermarket executives and food industry experts say.

Supermarkets sell imported items in every section of the store: from fresh and packaged foods to household basics. Trump instituted 10% tariffs across all countries last Saturday and slapped higher reciprocal tariffs on 60 countries and trading blocs today. US businesses shipping goods from overseas will pay for those tariffs, and they will pass some of the higher costs down to consumers.

Shoppers can expect to see prices rise on seafood, coffee, fruit, cheese, nuts, candy bars and other imported foods, according to experts. Items that contain ingredients and packaging like plastic and aluminum from other countries will also be hit. Perishable food prices will rise first, followed by shelf-stable goods. Customers may also see smaller-sized products, known as shrinkflation, and find that certain versions of items have been eliminated as companies try to offset their cost hikes from tariffs.

Customers can expect grocery prices to increase “in the next couple of weeks,” said John Ross, the CEO of IGA, a chain of independent grocery stores. “Shoppers will start seeing it at scale across the store in the next 90 days.”

Food prices will rise 2.8% overall from Trump’s tariffs, including 4% for fresh produce, Yale University’s Budget Lab estimates. The cost burden will hit lower-income shoppers, who spend a greater share of their income on essentials, the hardest.

Hit to smaller companies first

The scale of the price hikes will also depend on the size of the companies.

Prices at smaller grocers, which have less flexibility to absorb higher costs than giant chains like Walmart and Costco, may rise faster. Big food suppliers such as Campbell and Kraft Heinz also have more flexibility to manage tariffs than smaller producers. But few companies will be spared from the effects.

“It appears that the small distributors are reacting a lot more quickly,” said Steve Schwartz, the director of sales and marketing at grocery chain Morton Williams. Small distributors have less supply on hand and will raise prices first, while larger companies with more inventory in warehouses can wait longer, Schwartz said.

For example, one Italian importer that supplies olive oil and balsamic vinegar notified Morton Williams of a 20% price increase next month.

Randy Arceneaux, the CEO Affiliated Foods, a wholesaler in Amarillo, Texas servicing around 700 independent grocery stores in eight states, said that most suppliers are still waiting to see what happens with tariffs.

But that’s not the case with all Affiliated Food’s suppliers —several have already notified the company of price increases because of tariffs, including bananas and canned tuna, as well as plastic utensils.

Affiliated Foods sources bananas from Guatemala, where Trump implemented a 10% tariff. Affiliated Foods’ distributor notified the company that a 10% price increase will go into effect next week.

This will increase Affiliated Foods’ costs by 4 cents per banana case, from $1.80 to $1.84, which will be passed on to shoppers.

Global supply chain

The foods Americans eat are part of a complicated global supply chain, with much of the growing impossible to replicate stateside because of climate and crop conditions. Food that can’t be grown locally will see the biggest rise in prices.

Currently, the US imports approximately 17% of all food and beverages consumed by Americans, but it varies dramatically by category. For example, around 80% of seafood, 80% of coffee, 59% of fresh fruit and 35% of vegetables consumed in the United States are imported, according to the Department of Agriculture.

“Our food system is intricately linked with global markets − including products not grown in the United States like bananas or seasonal items − which helps keep prices down while providing American shoppers year-round access to safe, nutritious food,” Leslie Sarasin, the president of food industry group FMI, said in a statement last week.

But one major factor that could limit price increases is that Mexico and Canada were left off Trump’s latest tariff list. Mexico and Canada are the two largest agricultural suppliers to the United States, according to the Agriculture Department.

The White House has slapped 25% tariffs on those countries, but most food and agricultural products are exempt from tariffs under the existing USMCA free trade agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Shoppers are pulling back

Grocery prices already frustrated customers before tariffs. Trump said he won the 2024 election in large part due to the price of groceries.

Grocery prices overall have increased around 23% since 2021, with prices on individual items like coffee and chocolate rising much faster.

That’s caused shoppers to pull back. PepsiCo, Campbell and JM Smucker reported weak sales of their snack brands in recent earnings announcements, and tariffs will likely only accelerate the slowdown.

PepsiCo, the owner of Frito-Lay, said last month that people bought 3% fewer snacks last quarter.

“Salty and savory snack categories underperformed” the broader packaged food industry, PepsiCo said, citing the “cumulative impacts of inflationary pressures and higher borrowing costs on consumer budgets.”

Household staples, such as dish detergent, paper towels and cosmetics, have also seen a slowdown in recent weeks, according to market research firm Circana.

“Some consumers are moving away from discretionary spending” at the grocery store, said Sally Lyons Wyatt, Circana’s chief advisor for the consumer goods and food service industries.

More shoppers are taking quicker, smaller trips to stores, and switching to stores’ cheaper private-label brands, she said. These are signs that customers are watching their budgets more carefully.

Customers “are still showing that willingness to spend, but they’re being very choiceful where they’re spending,” Costco finance chief Gary Millerchip said last month.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2055599831-20250408193842627.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-04-09 11:11:51.224968

Additionally, as Instacart’s advertising business matures, it may benefit from economies of scale and improved efficiency, potentially leading to even higher margins over time.","Instacart, the leading digital intermediary in the US grocery market, continues to navigate a complex landscape of opportunities and challenges as it seeks to maintain its dominant position in the evolving online grocery sector. The company demonstrates strong financial health, earning a ""GREAT"" rating from InvestingPro’s comprehensive assessment system, with particularly robust scores in growth and cash flow metrics. With a market share of 70-75% in third-party grocery delivery, the company, operating under Maplebear Inc. (NASDAQ: ), has established itself as a crucial player in the $1.1 trillion US grocery industry. However, recent analyst reports suggest that while Instacart’s foundation remains strong, it faces increasing pressure from competitors and market dynamics that could impact its growth trajectory.

Business Model and Market Dynamics

Instacart’s core business revolves around facilitating grocery delivery and pickup services through partnerships with over 85,000 stores across 1,500 retail banners. This extensive network covers more than 85% of the US grocery market, providing the company with a significant competitive advantage. The platform generates revenue through transaction fees and a growing advertising business, leveraging its vast customer base and data insights to attract consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands.

Analysts note that the online grocery market is projected to grow at a 12% three-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR). However, some estimates suggest Instacart’s growth may lag behind this market expansion. Deutsche Bank projects a more modest 6.6% CAGR for Instacart from 2023 to 2028, highlighting the challenges the company faces in a competitive landscape.

Financial Performance and Growth Strategies

Recent financial results have shown mixed signals for Instacart. While the company’s stock has declined about 15% over the past six months, its fundamental performance remains strong, with an impressive 75.25% gross profit margin and positive earnings of $1.58 per share in the last twelve months. The company reported solid performance in its latest quarters, with gross transaction value (GTV) and EBITDA often exceeding guidance. For instance, in the fourth quarter of 2024, Instacart reported GTV at the high end of guidance and EBITDA $12 million above the high-end of guidance.

Instacart’s growth strategy focuses on several key areas:

1. Expanding its advertising business: The company aims to increase its advertising take rate from approximately 2.9% in 2024 to over 4% in the long term. This expansion is crucial for improving profitability and offsetting competitive pressures in the delivery market.

2. Affordability initiatives: To drive GTV growth, Instacart is working on making grocery delivery more cost-effective through low-cost delivery options and collaborations with merchants to reduce prices.

3. New product offerings: The company is exploring innovative solutions such as Caper Carts, which aim to enhance the in-store shopping experience and potentially open new revenue streams.

4. Strategic partnerships: Instacart’s recent collaboration with Uber (NYSE: ) to include restaurant deliveries demonstrates its efforts to diversify and expand its service offerings.

Challenges and Risks

Despite its strong market position, Instacart faces several significant challenges:

1. Competitive pressure: Well-funded rivals like Walmart (NYSE: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), DoorDash (NASDAQ: ), and Uber are intensifying competition in the digital grocery space. These competitors often have more flexibility to address affordability issues, potentially outpacing Instacart in market share growth.

2. Advertising revenue risks: Instacart’s reliance on advertising for profitability exposes it to risks from persistent CPG budget pressures and competition. Some analysts suggest that growth expectations for this segment may be overestimated by the market.

3. Affordability concerns: Instacart’s pricing remains higher than some competitors, which could limit its ability to attract and retain price-sensitive customers, especially in an inflationary environment.

4. Market saturation and adoption rates: As the online grocery market matures, Instacart may face challenges in maintaining its high growth rates, particularly if consumer adoption of online grocery shopping slows post-pandemic.

Bear Case

How might increasing competition from well-funded rivals impact Instacart’s market share?

The intensifying competition in the digital grocery space poses a significant threat to Instacart’s market dominance. Companies like Walmart, Amazon, DoorDash, and Uber have substantial resources and established customer bases that they can leverage to expand their grocery delivery services. These competitors often have more flexibility in their pricing strategies and can potentially offer lower prices to consumers, which could erode Instacart’s market share over time.

Moreover, these rivals have diverse business models that allow them to subsidize their grocery delivery services with profits from other segments. This financial flexibility enables them to invest heavily in marketing, technology, and customer acquisition, potentially outpacing Instacart’s growth. As a result, Instacart may find it increasingly challenging to maintain its current market share and could see a gradual decline in its dominant position if it fails to effectively counter these competitive pressures.

What are the risks associated with Instacart’s reliance on advertising revenue for profitability?

Instacart’s growing dependence on advertising revenue for profitability exposes the company to several risks. First, the advertising market, particularly in the CPG sector, is subject to economic fluctuations and budget constraints. Any downturn in CPG advertising spending could significantly impact Instacart’s profitability.

Additionally, as the digital advertising landscape becomes more saturated, Instacart may face challenges in maintaining its ad load and effectiveness. Some analysts have expressed concerns that the company’s advertising growth expectations may be overly optimistic, given the maturing ad load across key categories and potential headwinds in the CPG industry.

Furthermore, relying heavily on advertising revenue could create conflicts between maximizing ad placements and maintaining a positive user experience. If Instacart pushes too aggressively on advertising, it risks alienating customers and potentially driving them to competitors with less intrusive shopping experiences.

Bull Case

How could Instacart’s market leadership and extensive partnerships drive future growth?

Instacart’s dominant position in the US grocery delivery market, with a 70-75% share in third-party delivery, provides a strong foundation for future growth. The company’s extensive network of partnerships with over 85,000 stores across 1,500 retail banners gives it unparalleled reach and scale in the industry. This expansive coverage allows Instacart to offer a wide variety of products and services to consumers, enhancing its value proposition and making it a go-to platform for online grocery shopping.

The company’s market leadership also translates into significant data advantages. With access to vast amounts of consumer shopping data, Instacart can continually refine its algorithms, improve personalization, and enhance the overall customer experience. This data-driven approach could lead to increased customer loyalty, higher order frequencies, and larger basket sizes, all of which contribute to sustained growth.

Moreover, Instacart’s strong relationships with retailers position it well to capitalize on the ongoing shift towards online grocery shopping. As more traditional grocers seek to establish or expand their e-commerce capabilities, Instacart’s proven platform and expertise make it an attractive partner. This could lead to deeper integrations with existing partners and new partnership opportunities, further solidifying Instacart’s market position and driving growth.

What potential does the expansion of Instacart’s advertising business have for improving profitability?

The expansion of Instacart’s advertising business presents a significant opportunity for improving profitability. The company aims to increase its advertising take rate from approximately 2.9% in 2024 to over 4% in the long term, which could substantially boost its revenue and margins.

Instacart’s large and engaged user base makes it an attractive platform for CPG brands looking to reach consumers at the point of purchase. As the company continues to refine its advertising offerings and targeting capabilities, it could capture a larger share of CPG advertising budgets, which are increasingly shifting towards digital channels.

Furthermore, advertising revenue typically comes with higher margins compared to transaction fees, meaning that growth in this segment could disproportionately improve Instacart’s overall profitability. The company’s efforts to expand its retail media network (RMN) inventory and enhance in-store advertising capabilities could open up new revenue streams and further drive profitability.

Additionally, as Instacart’s advertising business matures, it may benefit from economies of scale and improved efficiency, potentially leading to even higher margins over time. This could provide the company with additional resources to invest in technology, customer acquisition, and new product development, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and profitability.

Group like-for-like (LFL) sales rose by just 0.3% for the year, but fell 2.5% in the UK.
BRC chairman Andrew Higginson warned that if US President Donald Trump’s tariffs remain at their current levels, prices are likely to increase.
Investors have been spooked by the uncertainty, with JD Sports’ stock price slumping nearly 11% since early April as fears over the tariff effects mounted.
JD Sports CEO Régis Schultz said: “We have delivered a solid performance in a challenging market, with organic revenue growth of 5.8% for the year.","JD Sports has met full-year profit expectations but cautioned that the year ahead will be challenging due to market volatility and tariff uncertainty.

For the 52 weeks to 1 February 2025, the sportswear giant reported a 5.8% organic sales growth, slightly ahead of guidance, with profit before tax and adjusting items falling within the range of £915m to £935m.

Group like-for-like (LFL) sales rose by just 0.3% for the year, but fell 2.5% in the UK. Europe and Asia Pacific delivered strong performances, with Q4 LFLs up 11.4% and 7.5% in North America.

As a result, JD Sports said it expects FY26 pre-tax profit to be in line with current consensus estimates of £920m, although this excludes any impact from proposed changes to tariffs, which the retailer said were still too uncertain to quantify.

BRC chairman Andrew Higginson warned that if US President Donald Trump’s tariffs remain at their current levels, prices are likely to increase.

Speaking on the Today programme, Higginson commented that it’s “unlikely” shoe production will shift to the US, but noted the outcome “depends on how high the tariffs are and for how long.”

JD Sports, which sources much of its goods from Asia, has been affected by concerns over the impact of U.S. tariffs on imported products, especially those made in countries like China and Vietnam.

Investors have been spooked by the uncertainty, with JD Sports’ stock price slumping nearly 11% since early April as fears over the tariff effects mounted.

JD Sports CEO Régis Schultz said: “We have delivered a solid performance in a challenging market, with organic revenue growth of 5.8% for the year. This reflects the continued strength of our multi-channel consumer proposition and our growing international footprint.

“We remain focused on profitable growth and maintaining trading discipline, despite an environment that remains promotional and unpredictable in key markets.

“As we enter FY26, we do so with momentum in our core regions and a clear plan to unlock further scale and efficiency across the business.”

By segment, the retailer’s core JD fascia recorded FY25 organic revenue growth of 7.1%, with sporting goods and outdoor categories also delivering solid gains.

The Washington Post: What Goes Into The Algorithm Behind Machine Learning For Health Care

The human body constantly generates a variety of signals that can be measured from the outside with wearable devices. These bio-signals — which include heart rate, sleep state and blood oxygen levels — can indicate whether someone is having mood swings or be used to diagnose a variety of bodily and brain disorders. It can be relatively cheap to gather a lot of bio-signal data. To teach a machine-learning algorithm to find a relationship between bio-signals and health outcomes, however, you need to teach the algorithm to recognize those health outcomes. That’s where research scientists like myself come in. (Geenjaar, 4/8)

With the RTD market booming, there's certainly no room for blending in.
""RTD is a crucial sector for us to reinforce our coffee leadership position in China,"" says Catrina Xiaoyu Wang, senior manager at Starbucks China.
Key Starbucks RTD equities remain intact, anchoring the product within the broader brand portfolio, but fresh elements elevate the experience.","Starbucks is reintroducing its much-loved Refreshers drink to Chinese consumers with a major glow-up, including an innovative bottle design and bold graphic identity crafted by global design agency Marks. The change aims to carve out fresh space in China's fiercely competitive ready-to-drink (RTD) market.

While Refreshers already enjoys cult status in the US, its role in China is strategic. Starbucks has pinpointed the drink as a key player in its plan to evolve the RTD portfolio and appeal to shifting consumer preferences—especially among a younger generation of self-expressive trendsetters. With the RTD market booming, there's certainly no room for blending in.

""RTD is a crucial sector for us to reinforce our coffee leadership position in China,"" says Catrina Xiaoyu Wang, senior manager at Starbucks China. ""As an exciting and disruptive extension to our line, Refreshers is designed to drive penetration, recruiting new users and boosting our ambition to become the most loved RTD coffee brand in the market.""

The rebrand brings a sense of freshness and flair that matches the product's personality. It's aimed squarely at what Marks identifies as 'life autonomists'—Gen Z consumers who embrace individuality, community, and aesthetics and whose drinks are an extension of personal style.

According to Danny Lye, vice president of Marks Greater Asia, the result is ""disruptive and eye-catching,"" with a distinctive visual language that blends elegance, energy, and sensory appeal.

Marks' approach was rooted in local consumer insight and cultural semiotics. The team drew on emerging design trends like expressive abstract patterns, playful illustrations, and vibrant colour cues to build a system that feels premium yet personal.

In other words, this isn't just another pretty bottle—it's a deliberate play on shelf impact and emotional connection, aligning with how China's younger generation navigates the intersection of food, fashion, and self-image.

At the centre of the redesign is a unique bottle structure that feels as good as it looks. Inspired by the texture of fresh fruit and the tactile charm of traditional coffee equipment (notably the iconic Italian Moka pot), the shape delivers both a functional and aesthetic punch.

Design-wise, the label balances familiarity with flair. Key Starbucks RTD equities remain intact, anchoring the product within the broader brand portfolio, but fresh elements elevate the experience. This includes playful hand-drawn typography for flavour names, vibrant colour systems tailored to local preferences, and expressive neck patterns that catch the eye and spark curiosity.

""Together, bottle and graphics deliver an unexpectedly refreshing visual and sensory experience,"" says Lye. ""They mark a significant investment to position the product as a disruptor in RTD beverage, offering excitement and newness in an extremely competitive environment.""

The launch is being rolled out with an e-commerce campaign titled Morning Coffee, Afternoon Refreshers—a neat nod to the product's dual appeal as a midday pick-me-up with a playful twist. It's not just about delivering caffeine; it's about delivering a moment.

This project is a clear example of what Marks does best: combining brand strategy, semiotics, structural design, and storytelling into a cohesive, culturally attuned identity. As the line between lifestyle and beverage continues to blur, Starbucks and Marks are meeting the moment with a bottle that's as expressive as the people holding it.",https://www.creativeboom.com/upload/articles/e4/e4c7c3656d8957d67f97b29991618f22ec3e7adb_800.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 12:23:42.864222

NEEDHAM, Mass. – PC shipments during the first quarter of 2025 grew 4.9% from the prior year, with global volumes reaching 63.2 million shipments, according to preliminary results from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Personal Computing Device Tracker. Looking ahead to 2025, the PC industry has several tailwinds and headwinds, which make for a challenging outlook and difficult demand planning.

“The market is clearly showing some level of pull-in in the first quarter this year as both vendors and end-users brace for the impact of US tariffs. In a first quarter still relatively untouched by tariffs, the entire ecosystem attempted to accelerate the pace of deliveries to avoid the first round of US tariffs and expected volatility for the remainder of the year,” said Jean Philippe Bouchard, research vice-president with IDC’s Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers. “Evidently, commercial demand remained strong in the first quarter, but the new round of US tariffs announced on April 2nd could have a direct inflationary impact on the PC market that could result in delayed IT spending for the remainder of the year”.

Most of the underlying demand factors for PCs, such as the installed base upgrade ahead of Windows 10 end of support, and demand for on-device AI, remain strong, as illustrated by the volumes shipped in Q1 2025. However, the uncertainty surrounding US tariffs and associated inflationary pressure and global recessionary risks will negatively impact demand for PCs in the following quarters in 2025.

“While many are still unpacking the details from the April 2nd tariff announcement, it’s safe to say most are reevaluating what the following months will look like,” said Ryan Reith, group vice president with IDC’s Worldwide Device Trackers. “So far, our supply chain checks haven’t shown any drastic shifts, but this isn’t surprising as it’s almost too volatile to make drastic business decisions. Companies are undoubtedly evaluating everything from inventory on hand, capacity to manufacture by location, possible reroute opportunities to lower import tariffs, and for some, their deal discussions with the US administration. When it comes to hardware like PCs and similar devices, we still maintain the view that most (if not all) price increases will get passed directly to the consumer.”

Recent analysis from the independent think tank Ember points out that by 2030, a significant portion of the European fossil gas capacity could be under-utilised, while diverting financial resources away from long-term investments in renewable energy and efficiency measures (6).
In all International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios, the peak demand for fossil gas, including for electricity production, is expected before 2030 (7).
Hence, building new gas plants, whose lifespan ranges from 25 to 40 years, is incoherent with this trend, especially in areas like Europe.
Local communities are warning that new gas-fired power stations pose a risk to people’s health as well as serious local and global environmental impacts, resulting in opposition at many of the planned sites.","Not one of the ten European power companies (3), analyzed for the new Power Transition Tracker, has published a clear plan to transition away from fossil fuels, and seven of the companies intend to carry on burning gas well into the future, including building new gas-fired power stations in Europe, even though the role of gas in Europe must be significantly reduced in the near future.(4)

In total, the seven utilities (EPH, ENGIE, Enel, RWE, PGE, A2A and SSE) plan to build or are already building at least 37 new gas-fired plants, with financial support from major European banks and investors including Barclays, BBVA, Société Générale, ING, NatWest and PKO Bank Polski (5). This will result in more than 25 gigawatts (GW) of new fossil gas capacity.

All but one of these planned plants are in Europe. Recent analysis from the independent think tank Ember points out that by 2030, a significant portion of the European fossil gas capacity could be under-utilised, while diverting financial resources away from long-term investments in renewable energy and efficiency measures (6).

In all International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios, the peak demand for fossil gas, including for electricity production, is expected before 2030 (7). This is especially the case in advanced economies where demand is already decreasing (8). Hence, building new gas plants, whose lifespan ranges from 25 to 40 years, is incoherent with this trend, especially in areas like Europe.

Local communities are warning that new gas-fired power stations pose a risk to people’s health as well as serious local and global environmental impacts, resulting in opposition at many of the planned sites.

EPH is planning to convert a coal-fired unit to gas in Fiume Santo in Sardinia, Italy, generating 560 MW. The project has been delayed due to questions about Sardinia’s transition, including related plans to develop a gas network and build two Floating Storage and Regasification Units (FSRU) for LNG import/export (9).

ENGIE is also facing local opposition to its plans for a new gas plant in Nijmegen in the Netherlands. The company claims the plant will eventually be converted to hydrogen, but campaigners question whether this is viable, given the limited availability of green hydrogen and the efficiency of using hydrogen to generate power (10).",https://reclaimfinance.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Power-transition-Tracker-.png,N,,2025-04-09 12:23:27.580264

While largely focused on the technical side of the Google Cloud offering, several developments speak to how brands and agencies can use AI to power marketing and customer experience applications.

“Consumer expectations are constantly changing, and this is creating pressure, both for market share and margin dynamics in the [retail] industry,” said Carrie Tharp, vice president for global solutions and industries at Google Cloud, in a press briefing in advance of the conference taking place April 9-11.

Along with what Tharp calls “crazy uncontrollables” like the Trump administration’s recently announced tariff plan, marketers must grapple with customer journeys getting longer — the average consumers has 10 touchpoints on their journey to purchase. Those journeys are also feeling more fraught: Two in three consumers delay or avoid purchase decisions when they have too much information. AI could provide a way forward.

“If consumers have confidence in the brand and the product, they are much more likely to recommend that to their customers, so how are we going to apply AI to help this overall pressure dynamic?” the executive asked.

Eight weeks into eight hours

Google Cloud news this week includes that it will add Lyria, its text-to-music model, to Vertex AI, making the platform the only one to offer generative media models across video, image, speech and music. Lyria can help create soundtracks for marketing campaigns, product launches or in-store experiences, as well as enabling the creation of sonic branding, per the company. The ability to quickly create custom music tracks saves on time and the cost of searching for royalty-free music.

Brands are already using Vertex to increase efficiency throughout the marketing process. L'Oréal Groupe is using Vertex’s Veo tool for video generation and the Imagen tool for image generation to speed up the creation of high-quality assets, which is impacting how the company views creativity.

“These models act as powerful creative partners, empowering our teams to experiment with new ideas and respond to the market. We’re expanding our qualitative video and image production across 20 additional countries and languages, all while upholding to our trustworthy AI values,” said Thomas Ménard, manager of AI center enablement at L'Oréal Groupe, in a statement.

Kraft Heinz is also using Veo and Imagen tools as part of its Tastemaker platform, bringing speed and efficiency to creative workflows — doing work that once took eight weeks in only eight hours.

“Implementing Google Cloud AI within our platform that is deeply trained on our brand intelligence, allows innovation and creative teams to rapidly prototype, test and deploy content, transforming how we bring our iconic brands to life,” said Justin Thomas, head of digital experience and growth at Kraft Heinz, said in a statement.

Boosting creative ROI

Elsewhere, Google Cloud’s Creative Agents are being used to boost creative teams in media production, marketing, advertising, design and beyond. WPP used agents as part of its Open platform, while Monks.Flow is using Google AI to help localize campaign creative and the Brandtech Group built a generative AI platform, Pencil, to help brands create ads, predict performance and optimize campaigns.

Mondelez, which in 2024 launched a new AI platform supported by Accenture and Publicis Groupe, is looking to notch a 25% ROI using generative AI for content and creative development at brands including Oreo and Cadbury.

“You are seeing many big platforms, retailers and brand, begin to dabble with what this looks like, and we have many products for them to apply,” Google Cloud’s Tharp explained. “We have large consumer packaged goods companies with very high standards and brands are now able to use image generation and video generation to get to truly one-to-one marketing.”

Papa Johns announced last week a partnership with Google Cloud to use Google data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence chatbots in its ordering and delivery processes. The pizza chain is also expected to use AI to create marketing campaigns that can deliver personalized offers, content and timing based on preferences. The Papa Johns partnership speaks to how marketers and related professionals can use a host of Google Cloud tools in tandem.

All of the positive absorption was in the warehouse category as flex absorption was negative 22,000 square feet.
On the construction front, deliveries totaled 1.8 million SF Q1, with 48% of the space leased at completion.
As CBRE noted in its report, the delivery of almost 2 million square feet in Q1 depleted the amount of industrial space under construction.
That figure declined to 609,000 SF, the lowest level registered since Q4 2017.","After a rare down quarter to close 2024, the Triad industrial market rebounded in the first quarter of 2025 with 1.3 million square feet of positive absorption and construction deliveries totaling 1.8 million square feet, according to CBRE's Q1 Industrial Market Report.

Overall vacancy rose to 8%, up 70 basis points for the quarter and 130 basis points year-over-year. While leasing activity was strong in Q1, CBRE attributed the increased vacancy rate to an influx of new speculative space in the market.

All of the positive absorption was in the warehouse category as flex absorption was negative 22,000 square feet.

The biggest new tenants for Triad industrial property were SBA Group, a Lithuanian furniture maker that took 500,000 SF of space in a former Gildan building in Mocksville in Davie County, and Lenovo, which is now occupying 200,000 SF at 6550 Judge Adams Road in Whitsett in southeast Guilford County.

Other significant new leasing deals including LeBleu taking 130,492 SF at 228 Quality Drive in Mocksville and Imperial Dade leasing 119,265 SF at 1615 Piedmont Commerce Drive in the PTI Airport submarket.

In addition, two companies renewed leases for large spaces in the PTI Airport submarket, with Mohawk Carpet keeping its 357,126-square-foot space at 6105 Corportate Park Drive and Bernards Furniture Group renewing its 298,954 SF at 5644 Hornaday Drive.

The average asking rate declined moderately to $6.57 in Q1. After 19 consecutive quarters of positive rent growth, the increase in available Class B space has dampened growth.

On the construction front, deliveries totaled 1.8 million SF Q1, with 48% of the space leased at completion. The largest delivery of the quarter was EcoLab's 850,000 square foot facility in High Point.

Other large deliveries in Q1 included a 282,652 SF building in SouthPark Commercial Center in Davie County, and buildings of 248,310 SF and 156,140 SF in the N.C. Commerce Park in Alamance County.

Real-world Geotab fleet sustainability data confirms the benefits of electrification, with some fleets reporting near-zero tailpipe emissions.
Benchmarking, Tools, and Real-World Impact To support customer progress, Geotab says it provides: Emissions calculators by vehicle type; Fleet benchmarking dashboards; and Analytics for decarbonization planning.
Geotab Fleet Sustainability Data: Expanding ESG Focus Beyond carbon reduction, Geotab made progress across broader ESG priorities.","Geotab recently released its 2024 Sustainability and Impact Report, offering a detailed view of environmental and social progress across global fleet operations. The report draws from data collected from over four million connected vehicles and the company says it aligns with internationally recognized frameworks. These include the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), CDP, the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

Geotab says the report presents some of its most detailed fleet sustainability data to date.

“We believe in the power of connected transportation to help create a better world,” said Neil Cawse, Geotab Founder and CEO. “Through data and insight, we are helping fleets transition to low-carbon alternatives while improving efficiency and safety.”

Measuring Scopes 1, 2, and 3 Emissions

Geotab’s 2023 carbon inventory totaled 1.15 million metric tons of CO₂ equivalent (MTCO₂e). The company says over 99% of that total comes from Scope 3 emissions. Those include supplier activity, product use and employee commuting.

While company growth led to a slight uptick in overall emissions, Scope 2 emissions fell as Geotab expanded renewable electricity use globally. Geotab adds that Scope 1 emissions—related to building fuel and internal fleet operations—remained minimal. The company reaffirmed its commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2040, with targets validated by SBTi.

Tracking Fleet Electrification

The report outlines rapid growth in Geotab’s EV capabilities. The platform now supports over 500,000 electric vehicles—a 70% year-over-year increase. Collectively, those EVs have traveled more than 700 million miles.

Using its EV Suitability Assessment (EVSA) and other tools, Geotab enables fleets to evaluate electric vehicle readiness, measure operational emissions, and benchmark energy efficiency. Real-world Geotab fleet sustainability data confirms the benefits of electrification, with some fleets reporting near-zero tailpipe emissions.

“We’re no longer asking whether EVs can do the job—we’re demonstrating that they are doing the job,” said Megan Allen, Geotab Senior Vice President, Sales & Marketing. “Fleets are seeing results, and that’s creating momentum for adoption.”

As EV models diversify, more fleets are finding electric solutions viable for a broader range of duty cycles, geographies, and vehicle classes.

Regional and Global Progress

The report details how sustainability adoption varies by region:

North America: Renewable electricity sourcing and public-sector collaboration

Europe: Strong policy-driven EV adoption and fuel cost sensitivity

Other regions: Growth through pilots and infrastructure expansion

Geotab also improved its own environmental performance, with 87% of electricity used in international offices coming from renewable sources in 2023.

Benchmarking, Tools, and Real-World Impact

To support customer progress, Geotab says it provides:

Emissions calculators by vehicle type;

Fleet benchmarking dashboards; and

Analytics for decarbonization planning.

Transparency remains central, with third-party reviews supporting the integrity of ESG and emissions data.

According to the report, these real-world examples help reinforce the practical value of these tools:

Geotab recorded a 39% year-over-year increase in sustainability solution deployments.

California Freight cut idling time, saving $50,000 annually—later reinvested in safety upgrades.

Germany’s DB Regio reduced CO₂ emissions by 1,400 tons and saved hundreds of thousands of liters of diesel with smarter fleet operations.

The change was a resounding success; after modifying the recipe, sales of McDonald's milkshakes increased significantly.
This case shows how a small modification in a product can drastically change sales if you understand what consumers are really looking for.","In the world of fast food, marketing strategies play a crucial role in the evolution of products. McDonald's, one of the largest chains in the world, almost suffered a failure with one of its most popular products. Although the brand is known for its innovations, this time, a small change almost ruined the sale of a highly demanded item.

McDonald's Milkshakes have been a product that many customers consume early in the morning. However, recently, the company experienced an unexpected drop in sales of this product. The brand's initial goal was to make the milkshakes healthier, but this shift was not the most suitable.

The Mistake Behind the ""Healthy"" Milkshake

McDonald's milkshake used to be a popular option for those passing through the Drive-Thru at 7 a.m. in the United States. However, the company decided to improve the recipe and make it more nutritious and juicy, which led to a decrease in sales. ""Fewer people were coming to buy those milkshakes,"" mentioned TikToker @eugeoller, who shared the story of this curious brand failure.

To better understand the drop in sales, McDonald's hired an external consultancy that analyzed consumer behavior. The conclusion was surprising: ""People weren't buying those milkshakes for how nutritious they were or just to have a quick breakfast,"" explained the consultancy. The analysis discovered that customers were hiring the milkshake not only for breakfast but as entertainment during their commute to work.

The Solution: Return to Basics and Improve the Experience

The company decided to give a twist to the milkshake recipe to better adapt to what customers really wanted. Instead of making it healthier, they opted to make it thicker, with lumps and cookie pieces.

This extended the consumption experience, turning it into a ""satisfier and entertainment,"" from McDonald's to work, as described by the consultancy. This new formula allowed customers to enjoy a milkshake that lasted longer during their commute.

The change was a resounding success; after modifying the recipe, sales of McDonald's milkshakes increased significantly. ""This hit the nail on the head and made sales of these milkshakes increase dramatically,"" stated TikToker @eugeoller. This case shows how a small modification in a product can drastically change sales if you understand what consumers are really looking for.

This event highlights an important lesson in the world of marketing: understanding the ""job"" a product has to do for the consumer is key to success. McDonald's managed to capture this need and adapted its product to meet it, resulting in an unexpected increase in sales.",https://edatv.news/filesedc/uploads/image/post/mtonaje-mcdonalds-mujer-emocionada_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-04-09 11:11:55.401208

H&M, meanwhile, has incorporated new technologies in its stores and launched more sustainable collections, although its future remains uncertain.","The fast fashion industry is experiencing turbulent times. However, few things can challenge the giant Zara and Amancio Ortega. Although sometimes it seems like the competition is going to overtake them, in the end, they manage to withstand any storm.

The same can't be said for H&M, the latest major brand to experience the consequences of a changing market. The Swedish company, which for years was one of Inditex's main competitors, has announced the closure of 28 stores in Spain. As well as the dismissal of 492 workers.

This restructuring reflects the profound impact of digital transformation, the rise of sustainable fashion, and new consumer habits. For years, H&M contested the leadership of fast fashion with giants like Zara. However, the current landscape is very different.

Amancio Ortega Sees His Competition Closing

In the third quarter of 2024, the company recorded a 30% drop in profits, with losses of 258 million euros. The pressure to reduce costs and adapt to a new commercial era has led the company to make decisions. Recent closures in locations like Elche, Orihuela, and Torrevieja are just a sample of the contraction process the brand is undergoing in Spain.

The factors explaining this crisis are multiple. On one hand, e-commerce has gained ground relentlessly, partly driven by the pandemic. Brands like Inditex have managed to adapt better to this reality, with strategies focused on larger and more digitalized stores.

Meanwhile, H&M has reacted more slowly. On the other hand, rising costs, inflation, and fierce competition from brands like Shein and Temu have further eroded its position. Additionally, the rise of the second-hand market has caused a profound change in consumer behavior.

Platforms like Vinted or Wallapop have captured a new generation seeking more affordable and sustainable fashion. All of this is taking customers away from the large traditional chains. But H&M's case is not isolated.

A New Way to Consume Fashion

Since 2020, more than 18,000 fashion stores have closed in Spain, representing a 30% drop in the number of retail outlets since 2019. Although spending on fashion grew in 2023, this trend has not been enough to stop the disappearance of physical stores. In response to this situation, major brands have accelerated their digitalization.

Inditex has opted for closing small stores to focus on flagship stores and enhance its online channel. H&M, meanwhile, has incorporated new technologies in its stores and launched more sustainable collections, although its future remains uncertain.

TORONTO, April 9, 2025 /CNW/ - New research from the Canadian Association of Financial Institutions in Insurance (CAFII) and Deloitte reveals that artificial intelligence (AI), advanced analytics, and digital-first experiences are poised to transform the Credit Protection Insurance (CPI) industry in Canada. The study, Exploring Emerging Technology & Gen AI Trends in CPI, outlines how insurers are modernizing underwriting, streamlining claims, and meeting rising consumer expectations for digital engagement—while also facing key barriers to adoption.

""This research underscores the need for the insurance industry to modernize and harness new technologies that deliver faster, more accessible, and more tailored protection for Canadian consumers,"" said Keith Martin, Executive Director of CAFII. ""While AI and automation are improving efficiencies, legacy systems and regulatory complexities remain hurdles.

Key Findings: A Snapshot of the Future of CPI in Canada

AI-Powered Underwriting is Closing Protection Gaps

AI-driven models are reducing approval times, improving risk assessment, and making insurance more inclusive. More than 60% of insurers say AI will have a high impact on underwriting and claims processing over the next 3-5 years.

Consumers Demand Digital-First, Self-Service Insurance

With more than half of CPI insurers prioritizing investments in digital customer engagement, the industry is shifting toward mobile-first experiences, real-time policy access, and digital education tools. 33% of insurers cite enhancing customer experience as a top priority for tech investment, showing a shift toward more consumer-friendly insurance solutions.

Cloud-Based Technology is Driving Agility and Security

Insurers are embracing cloud computing to enhance security compliance, improve operational efficiencies, and integrate AI-driven insights at scale. 70% of insurers identify cloud-based platforms as a key enabler of future-ready CPI services.

Regulatory Barriers & Legacy Systems Are Slowing Adoption

Despite these advancements, outdated infrastructure and fragmented regulatory policies are delaying modernization efforts across the industry. CPI remains heavily reliant on the broader lending ecosystem, creating complexities in technology adoption.

E-Land Group's ""Kim's Convenience Store"", which has been criticized for registering as a convenience store to evade regulations despite operating in the form of a super supermarket (SSM), has been confirmed to have received administrative guidance from the government to change its operating method on the 9th. ""Kim's Convenience Store"", launched with the slogan ""convenience store for fresh products"", has handled a variety of fresh foods in bulk like vegetables and fruits, similar to SSMs, but this measure is expected to restrict such sales activities. Plans to transition some stores into franchise operations, initially aimed at expanding into franchising, have effectively been halted.

The tech has been brought in to do the tedious work of scanning the books of thousands of acclaimed authors to pinpoint any Coke references. From there, WPP has come to a deceptively old-fashioned campaign that majors on a typewriter. A page of monochrome text is reproduced with the words “Coca-Cola” brought to life in a contrasting, colourful red logo.

Islam EIDessouky, global vice president creative strategy and content at Coca-Cola, said: “Coca-Cola’s presence in classic literature is a testament to its enduring cultural impact. This campaign is the embodiment of our Real Magic ethos, celebrating those magical moments in fiction where Coca-Cola is a familiar presence in timeless stories.”

Rafael Pitanguy, deputy global CCO at VML, said: “Coca-Cola has always been more than a beverage – it’s a cultural icon that naturally finds its way into the stories we love. With “Classic” we’re honouring that legacy by bringing its literary presence to life in a way that feels both nostalgic and fresh.”

WPP might have lost Coca-Cola’s media business to Publicis, but creatively it’s looking strong. They have shown a refreshing bravery when it comes to new tech and, as you’d expect, the results are mixed. The global “Masterpiece” campaign was a success, whereas the AI Christmas spot was not (at least it wasn’t with the ad community – customers may well have loved it).

This latest campaign is simple but true. If we go back to the days before we were all worrying about HFSS foods, Coca-Cola does own a place in culture, so why not turn it to their advantage? The books covered include The Shining by Stephen King, Extreme Metaphors by JG Ballard and A House for Mr Biswas by VS Naipaul.

Nostalgic and fresh at the same time. Plus it’s good to see authors as influencers.

“PC shipments experienced a surge in Q1 2025, driven by vendors accelerating deliveries to the US in anticipation of initial tariff announcements,” said Ishan Dutt, Principal Analyst at Canalys, now part of Omdia.
Following several quarters of year-on-year declines, Dell achieved 3% growth, shipping 9.5 million units in Q1.
Asus rounded out the top five rankings with 9% growth and 4.0 million units shipped.
About Canalys Canalys, now part of Omdia, is a leading global technology market analyst firm with a distinct channel focus.","According to the latest data from Canalys, now part of Omdia, total shipments of desktops, notebooks and workstations grew 9.4% to 62.7 million units in Q1 2025. Notebook (including mobile workstations) shipments hit 49.4 million units, up 10% compared to a year ago. Shipments of desktops (including desktop workstations) rose 8% to 13.3 million units. Q1 volumes were boosted by OEMs ramping up shipments to the US in anticipation of the first round of the Trump administration’s tariff announcements. As the next round of higher tariffs on more countries goes into effect, both direct and indirect impacts threaten global PC market recovery and Windows 10 End of Support induced momentum for the remainder of the year.

“PC shipments experienced a surge in Q1 2025, driven by vendors accelerating deliveries to the US in anticipation of initial tariff announcements,” said Ishan Dutt, Principal Analyst at Canalys, now part of Omdia. Lenovo and HP grew shipments to the US in Q1 by around 20% and 13%, respectively. “This preemptive strategy allowed manufacturers and the channel to stock up ahead of potential cost increases, boosting sell-in shipments despite otherwise stable end-user demand,” added Dutt. “Although similar steps are being taken regarding the broader tariffs set to kick in on 9 April 2025, subsequent quarters this year are likely to see a slowdown as inventory levels normalize and customers face higher prices.”

The impact of tariffs on consumer demand is expected to be greater, as purchasing a more expensive PC will need to be prioritized against other spending categories also facing price increases. Businesses, especially SMBs, will also face some pressure that could slow down momentum for the critical transition away from Windows 10 ahead of the October 2025 End-of-Support (EOS) date. “A Canalys (now part of Omdia) March poll of channel partners who are familiar with SMB PC refresh plans revealed that 14% say their customers are not aware of Windows 10 EoS and a further 21% say their customers are aware but have no plans to upgrade,” said Dutt. “For customers in these situations, the delay in planning means they are likely to face a higher cost environment when the time comes to refresh their PC fleets.”

From a production perspective, major OEMs already began supply chain diversification during Trump’s first term and are expected to continue moving away from China towards Vietnam, Thailand, and India, despite these countries also facing the imposition of tariffs. By the end of 2025, most major PC vendors are expected to have completed the shift of US-bound shipments out of China, aiming to enhance supply chain resilience and mitigate the impact of tariffs. For example, in their latest earnings call, HP CEO Enrique Lores stated that 90% of the company’s products sold in the US would be made outside of China by the end of this year. “Although these major manufacturing countries have been targeted with tariffs, their rates remain relatively competitive compared to China’s,” said Ben Yeh, Senior Analyst at Canalys, now part of Omdia. “Moreover, these countries have shown a willingness to negotiate, raising the possibility that the tariffs may eventually be reduced or waived, while China has responded swiftly with a new round of reciprocal tariffs. As a result, production relocation plans are still ongoing and are unlikely to change significantly before further implementation details are announced.”

In Q1 2025, Lenovo maintained its lead in the global PC market, shipping 15.2 million notebooks and desktops and achieving strong growth of 11%. Second-placed HP grew its shipments 6% annually, hitting 12.8 million units. Following several quarters of year-on-year declines, Dell achieved 3% growth, shipping 9.5 million units in Q1. Apple secured fourth place with strong shipment growth of 22%, shipping 6.5 million units and capturing 10.4% market share. Asus rounded out the top five rankings with 9% growth and 4.0 million units shipped.

The three interconnected suits concerned the infringement of Philips’ patent 218255, which was crucial to EFM+ coding in DVD systems and integral to the standardisation of DVD production.
Philips terminated the licence in 2010, but Pearl continued to manufacture DVDs and thus infringed Philips’ rights.
Applying this same test, the court held that the defendants’ DVD replication processes used the patented technology and that outsourcing production did not absolve the defendants of liability.

The three interconnected suits concerned the infringement of Philips’ patent 218255, which was crucial to EFM+ coding in DVD systems and integral to the standardisation of DVD production.

Case background

Pearl Engineering – owned by Sukesh Behl – had obtained a licence from Philips in 2005 but later claimed that it was signed under duress. Despite repeated notices, Pearl defaulted on its obligations between 2005 and 2010 by failing to submit sales reports and pay royalties. Philips terminated the licence in 2010, but Pearl continued to manufacture DVDs and thus infringed Philips’ rights. Other defendants were also found to have similarly defaulted.

The defendants argued that there was no infringement, since the EFM+ encoding was outsourced to third parties. They also filed counterclaims challenging the patent’s validity, claiming:

non-disclosure of counterpart foreign applications under Section 8 of the Patents Act;

lack of novelty due to prior art;

non-patentability of the subject matter under Section 3; and

insufficiency in disclosure.

They contended that Philips delayed filing the suit until 2012 despite having been aware of the infringement since 2005.

The Delhi High Court’s decision

The court found no deliberate suppression under Section 8 and attributed errors to the prosecuting agent. It held that the patent was valid, rejecting the defendants’ prior art and patentability arguments. The court further ruled that the defendants had failed to prove that the patent was not essential to DVD technology, affirming its status as an SEP.

In evaluating infringement, patent claims 1 to 11 were found to pertain to a method of modulation, coding or compression (namely, EFM+ coding), while claim 12 covered the tangible storage medium holding such modulated signals. Therefore, any storage medium containing signals encoded via EFM+ would infringe the SEP. To assess whether the defendants’ replication process did in fact use the patented technology, the court referred to the division bench’s judgment in Intex Technologies v Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, which discussed the test of indirect infringement (2023). Applying this same test, the court held that the defendants’ DVD replication processes used the patented technology and that outsourcing production did not absolve the defendants of liability.

Calculation of damages

Although Philips’ patent lapsed in 2015 – rendering an injunction moot – the court proceeded to assess damages. It considered:

the nature of the invention;

Philips’ standard royalty rates;

the scale and duration of infringement;

the defendants’ unwillingness to negotiate; and

the financial impact on Philips.

As established by the UK Supreme Court in Unwired Planet (2020) and the Delhi High Court in Xiaomi v Ericsson (2014), the court concluded that FRAND rates serve as the most appropriate basis for calculating damages in SEP infringement cases.

Damages were thus calculated based on Philips’ standard royalty rate for the suit patent, which was US$0.03 per unit. Philips’ evidence supported this rate. The court also found the defendants to be unwilling licensees that were acting in bad faith. Their prolonged infringement prompted the court to award interest at 12% per annum on the total damages calculated from the suit’s filing date until payment, along with aggravated damages.

The court thus issued the following instructions:

Pearl Engineering and Sukesh Behl to pay US$750,000 + 12% interest.

Siddharth Optical to pay US$195,000 + 12% interest.

Powercube Infotech to pay US$1.5 million + 12% interest.

In addition, all three parties were liable to pay aggravated damages of US$115,804. The court also granted full litigation costs to Philips, acknowledging its ordeal due to the defendants’ delaying tactics and the extension of the litigation until the patent had lapsed.

Though the delay in adjudication has attracted criticism (the litigation having outlived both the patent and the DVD industry), this judgment is detailed and well reasoned. It aligns with recent SEP decisions from Indian courts and serves as a cautionary tale for unwilling licensees.",https://d2qu5xmcgmzxnb.cloudfront.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,N,,2025-04-09 12:23:00.250977

The San Francisco-based company said its guidance for the financial year 2025 “assumes no significant worsening” of macroeconomic pressure on consumers, supply chain disruptions, increased tariffs or similar factors.

Levi sees organic revenue growth, which excludes items such as currency impact and divestments, growing 3.5% to 4.5% this year. Shares rose 2.3% in extended New York trading.

Since US President Donald Trump announced the tariffs on April 2, the stock declined 19%.

Chief financial officer Harmit Singh said in an interview it’s “difficult to forecast or plan at this stage” for the tariffs’ impact on consumers. The company created a group to analyse the tariffs while it focuses on issues it can control such as its relationships with vendors and the cost base for its products.

Chief executive officer Michelle Gass said the company is approaching the topic of tariffs with “urgency, but not being overly reactive”.

Levi is one of the first retailers to report earnings after Trump unveiled the tariffs last week. The announcement has roiled world markets, hitting apparel companies especially hard.

The company said it sources about 5% of its goods in the United States from Mexico, a mid-single digit from Vietnam and 1% from China.

It works with 130 facilities in China, 50 in Vietnam, 37 in Bangladesh and 36 in Sri Lanka, according to a company website listing partners in its supply chain. Gass said Levi sources from 28 countries.

“We’re doing our homework,” she added, without offering specifics on the measures the company is taking to counteract the tariffs.

If the company needs to raise prices it would be “surgical”, Gass said, and focused on new products that have resonated with shoppers.

Consumers are gravitating towards more premium products, Gass added during the company’s call with analysts on Monday. — Bloomberg",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/04/09/3255386.jpeg,N,,2025-04-09 14:11:34.738295

While Q2 guidance showed higher revenue expectations, EPS was slightly below forecasts. Importantly, LEVI reaffirmed its full-year guidance, which has significantly boosted investor confidence. Last quarter, LEVI had lowered its FY25 guidance, so maintaining it amid tariff and macroeconomic challenges is a positive surprise.

LEVI has reclassified its Dockers segment as discontinued operations while exploring a sale. This reclassification complicates comparisons to consensus estimates. However, LEVI surpassed expectations in sales, margins, and EPS, driven by its strategic momentum. A notable growth factor has been the popularity of loose and baggy fits, now comprising about 15% of its bottoms portfolio.

The company is making strides in becoming a Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) brand, with DTC sales growing 12% organically, driven by client growth, new openings, and e-commerce performance. In Q1, DTC accounted for 52% of global sales. LEVI sees significant growth potential in e-commerce, currently at 12% of revenues. The Wholesale business also grew 5% organically, with strong US performance.

Historically known for men's jeans, LEVI has expanded its offerings, particularly for women, with the women's segment growing double digits over the past two quarters and now representing 38% of revenues. The recent women's Cinch Baggy launch went viral on TikTok, boosting sales.

Regarding tariffs, LEVI is still assessing potential impacts, given the recent announcements. The company is planning mitigation strategies, though its full-year outlook remains unchanged, with minimal anticipated Q2 margin impact as most spring and early summer products are already in the US.

LEVI has made progress in reducing expenses, aiding margins and providing resilience against tariff pressures. It sources from 28 countries, with 20 supplying to the US. LEVI believes it has pricing power, with nearly 60% of revenue generated outside the US.

Overall, this was a strong quarter for LEVI. Investors are pleased with the EPS beat and reaffirmation of guidance, especially following recent guidance reductions. However, the newly announced tariffs remain a variable, with potential impacts to be evaluated as the year progresses.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C000026W9.png?20,N,,2025-04-09 12:22:19.463079

The aggregate market capitalization (MCap) of the top 25 global insurers grew 17% to $3.5 trillion year-on-year (YoY) during the first quarter (Q1) ended on 31 March 2025. Most of the stocks recorded a sharp growth in Q1, benefiting from the higher premium pricing amid inflationary trends, improved investment income driven by elevated interest rates, and favorable underwriting performance due to fewer large-scale catastrophic events in the period, according to GlobalData, a leading data analytics and research company.

Murthy Grandhi, Company Profiles Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “The global insurance industry showed signs of recovery in early 2024, with property and casualty insurers implementing premium increases to counter inflation and rising natural disaster claims, while life insurers continued adapting to shifting interest rate environments. The sector accelerated digital transformation efforts through AI and automation investments, expanded parametric insurance offerings for climate risks, and focused on customer experience improvements.”

PICC Property and Casualty

PICC P&C, the largest non-life insurance company in mainland China, shares registered a remarkable 40.5% growth in market value during the period, driven by strong FY2024 results on the back of strategic optimization of its motor vehicle insurance business structure with 38.8% market share in household motor vehicle insurance, coupled with accelerated growth in non-motor vehicle insurance segments and enhanced operational efficiency through technology-enabled expense management.

Consequently, the company’s market valuation also rose by 39.5%, reaching $55.1 billion by the end of Q1 2025.

Grandhi continues: “Berkshire Hathaway witnessed a 25.7% increase in market value attributed to its strong investment portfolio performance, particularly in energy and infrastructure assets, and resilient insurance underwriting results across GEICO and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Furthermore, strategic investment decisions by Warren Buffett, and investor confidence in the company’s substantial cash reserves perpetuated the stock’s upward trajectory, affirming Berkshire Hathaway’s status as a coveted asset.”

Elevance Health and The Cigna Group saw sharp YoY declines of -18.6% and -17.0%, respectively. This downturn was largely influenced by declining enrolment in individual and group health plans, elevated medical loss ratios, and ongoing antitrust scrutiny affecting sentiment. Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) also fell 15.4% due to underwhelming policy growth, weak equity market returns in India and limited foreign institutional investment.

Grandhi concludes: “Looking ahead to Q2 2025, the global insurance industry faces a nuanced outlook. The US Federal Reserve has signalled a potential pause in interest rate hikes, which could stabilize fixed-income yields and benefit life insurers’ investment portfolios. However, geopolitical developments—such as recent tariff escalations between the US and China—may pressure global trade insurance demand and raise claims risk, particularly in marine and credit insurance lines.

“Moreover, inflationary pressures in Europe and selective tightening in Asian economies could compress margins, though they also prompt upward repricing, supporting premium growth. On the positive side, increased awareness of climate and cyber risks are expected to drive further growth in specialty insurance lines.”",https://www.globaldata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PR20536.png,N,,2025-04-09 10:06:50.137248

Lurie, a Levi Strauss heir and philanthropist, was elected last fall on his promise to help the city shed its image of a cyberpunk dystopia.

“The market is clearly showing some level of pull-in in the first quarter this year as both vendors and end-users brace for the impact of US tariffs. In a first quarter still relatively untouched by tariffs, the entire ecosystem attempted to accelerate the pace of deliveries to avoid the first round of US tariffs and expected volatility for the remainder of the year,” says Jean Philippe Bouchard, research vice-president with IDC’s Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers.

“Evidently, commercial demand remained strong in the first quarter, but the new round of US tariffs announced on April 2nd could have a direct inflationary impact on the PC market that could result in delayed IT spending for the remainder of the year.”

Most of the underlying demand factors for PCs, such as the installed base upgrade ahead of Windows 10 end of support, and demand for on-device AI, remain strong, as illustrated by the volumes shipped in Q1 2025. However, the uncertainty surrounding US tariffs and associated inflationary pressure and global recessionary risks will negatively impact demand for PCs in the following quarters in 2025.

“While many are still unpacking the details from the April 2nd tariff announcement, it’s safe to say most are reevaluating what the following months will look like,” says Ryan Reith, group vice-president with IDC’s Worldwide Device Trackers.

“So far, our supply chain checks haven’t shown any drastic shifts, but this isn’t surprising as it’s almost too volatile to make drastic business decisions. Companies are undoubtedly evaluating everything from inventory on hand, capacity to manufacture by location, possible reroute opportunities to lower import tariffs, and for some, their deal discussions with the US administration.

“When it comes to hardware like PCs and similar devices, we still maintain the view that most (if not all) price increases will get passed directly to the consumer.”",,N,,2025-04-09 12:20:59.629538

""The tariffs are a blow for especially the German car makers which export hundreds of thousands of units to the US annually (749,000 in 2024) and produce many cars in the US itself which require European parts,"" Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, told CNBC in emailed comments.

""It's hard to work around the tariffs, and they seem to stay at least a while, so they need to deal with it and will have to reconsider product offerings, pricing and manufacturing footprints,"" he added.

An escalating trade war is expected to have a profound impact on the global car industry, particularly given the high globalization of supply chains and the heavy reliance on manufacturing operations across North America.

Arkansas lawmakers advance bill that could potentially eliminate CVS in the Natural State

Tuesday, lawmakers in Arkansas advanced a bill that would essentially eliminate a popular pharmacy chain in the Natural State. The Arkansas Senate Insurance and Commerce Committee heard House Bill 1150 in Little Rock on Tuesday. The bill's sponsors say it aims to prohibit a pharmacy benefits manager, also known as a PBM, from obtaining certain pharmacy permits. CVS Caremark is a pharmacy benefits manager, owned by CVS Health, which owns and operates CVS Pharmacies. ""I want to be clear,"" Rep. Jeremiah Moore said. ""House Bill 1150 does not force pharmacy closures. It forces companies that are a PBM to either choose between being a pharmacy and a drug provider or choosing to be a pharmacy benefits manager."" Sponsors say the bill simply prevents a company from being both a provider and a benefits manager. Supporters also say it would make prescriptions less expensive. After hearing from both sides, the Senate Insurance and Commerce Committee passed the bill. ""And I fully expect that we'll be put our best foot forward in the Senate tomorrow and Lord willing, we'll pass House Bill 150 and the governor will sign it,"" Moore said. CVS Health is pushing back against the bill and sent a statement to 40/29 News. ""House Bill 1150 would cripple pharmacy care access and affordability in Arkansas. It endangers Arkansans by eliminating access to vital community pharmacies, eroding patient safety, and making prescription drugs more expensive. It will cost hundreds of jobs and raise health care costs by millions of dollars per year. A vote for HB 1150 is a vote to create health care chaos for working families, seniors, and people with disabilities.""A CVS staffer spoke to state lawmakers on Tuesday. ""We're deeply embedded in the fabric of the communities we serve,"" district leader for CVS Pharmacy Ashley Ellis said. ""Providing care and guidance to 340,000 Arkansans who rely on us every year. This bill doesn't just threaten our livelihoods, it threatens the health and well-being of our patients.""The bill would take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, if it receives the full support of state lawmakers. Supporters say that would allow enough time for arrangements to be made between providers and patients.

Sponsors say the bill simply prevents a company from being both a provider and a benefits manager. Supporters also say it would make prescriptions less expensive. After hearing from both sides, the Senate Insurance and Commerce Committee passed the bill.

""And I fully expect that we'll be put our best foot forward in the Senate tomorrow and Lord willing, we'll pass House Bill 150 and the governor will sign it,"" Moore said.

CVS Health is pushing back against the bill and sent a statement to 40/29 News.

""House Bill 1150 would cripple pharmacy care access and affordability in Arkansas. It endangers Arkansans by eliminating access to vital community pharmacies, eroding patient safety, and making prescription drugs more expensive. It will cost hundreds of jobs and raise health care costs by millions of dollars per year. A vote for HB 1150 is a vote to create health care chaos for working families, seniors, and people with disabilities.""

A CVS staffer spoke to state lawmakers on Tuesday.

""We're deeply embedded in the fabric of the communities we serve,"" district leader for CVS Pharmacy Ashley Ellis said. ""Providing care and guidance to 340,000 Arkansans who rely on us every year. This bill doesn't just threaten our livelihoods, it threatens the health and well-being of our patients.""

The bill would take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, if it receives the full support of state lawmakers. Supporters say that would allow enough time for arrangements to be made between providers and patients.","https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cvs-pharmacy-april-2025-67f5decde04a6.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-04-09 08:03:33.153086
ID19,H&M,2025-04-09 08:51:11+00:00,newwavemagazine,"As H&M bets on AI, we speak with one of the photographer's they're trying to replace",Henry Tuppen,,,,,https://www.newwavemagazine.com/single-post/as-h-m-bets-on-ai-we-speak-with-one-of-the-photographer-s-they-re-trying-to-replace,"We talked about how she got her start, what keeps her going, and where she sees fashion photography heading.
RS: Fashion photography is all about expressing a creative vision through the clothes and the style.
RS: It’s definitely interesting.
RS: It’s all about networking, social media, and word of mouth.
RS: It’s fast-paced and competitive, but if you love creativity and learning, it’s a great field to be in.","Fashion, at its core, is a group project. Strip away the gloss of runways and retail, and what you’re left with is a living, breathing ecosystem powered by people - stylists, producers, photographers, set designers, assistants - each adding something to the final frame. The longer I’ve spent in this industry, the more I’ve realised that it’s the collaborations, not the clothes, that stay with you.

During our AW25 coverage at New Wave, we were pulling together a team for Paris Fashion Week - (fast-paced, overwhelming, but always worth it), and I reached out to Raphaele Sohier, a photographer whose work I’d been following for a while. There’s a rawness to her images that feels rare in the algorithm-optimised landscape of runway photography. She has a way of injecting intimacy and edge into something that can often be so formulaic.

The week came and went in a blur, as fashion weeks tend to do, but Raphaele’s work stuck with me. Her eye brought personality, warmth, a human pulse; vital to our coverage. It was the first time we worked together, and it wasn't the last.

As we all try to make sense of AI-generated models and the slow, creeping automation of creative work (H&M’s recent announcement comes to mind), I’ve been thinking a lot about the value of human connection in fashion. The best part of this job isn’t the front-row seat - it’s building something real with other people.

So I sat down with Raphaele to get a closer look at her world. We talked about how she got her start, what keeps her going, and where she sees fashion photography heading. If you’re curious about the gears turning behind the camera, this conversation is a good place to start…

NW: How did you get into photography?

RS: I started messing around with a camera when I was younger because my dad had one. I didn’t think much of it, but I loved having it with me. When I hit high school, I started charging a little bit for photos, but basketball and school were my main focus back then, so photography was more of a hobby for a while.

NW: Who/what are your main inspirations for your work?

RS: There are a few photographers I really admire, like Elizabeta Parodina with her crazy use of colour, Aidan Zamiri, and Gabriel Moses. But I also get a lot of inspiration from everyday life - the little moments you catch in the world around you that make you think.

NW: How long have you been a photographer?

RS: I’ve been doing it professionally for over two years, but it’s been a part of my life for much longer. Photography is what really fills the creative space for me, and I can see myself doing this for the long haul.

NW: What makes shooting for fashion different to other photography work?

RS: Fashion photography is all about expressing a creative vision through the clothes and the style. It’s not just about snapping a moment - it’s about conveying a feeling or idea. For me, the artistic side is key: lighting, composition, and how the model and setting come together. It's more about telling a story than just selling something.

NW: How do you feel about the recent announcement that H&M will be starting to use AI models? How do you think this will affect photographers?

RS: It’s definitely interesting. It is going to change things, but I don’t think AI will ever replace real human creativity in photography. People will still want to work with other people. It’s a little scary to see how fast things are evolving, but I think there will always be a place for the human touch in the creative process. There might be a shift, but I’m hopeful things will balance out.

NW: Are there any particular campaigns you are especially proud of?

RS: One that stands out for me was working with Vogue Arabia. That was a huge moment and really pushed me to aim higher. Also, working on a project with a Montreal-based team was special - it felt like a real collaboration.

NW: Do you have any tips for people trying to get into the industry?

RS: Just stay true to yourself. It’s about pushing yourself to get better, not just in your work but in life too. You have to be in the right mental space to create something that truly resonates with people.

NW: What are the hardest parts about working in the industry?

RS: Staying consistent is tough, and there’s this feeling of never fully being satisfied with your work. You’re always moving to the next thing, and sometimes you forget to appreciate what you’ve already achieved. That can definitely lead to burnout, and I think a lot of artists feel that.

NW: And what are the best parts?

RS: The best part is definitely working with other creatives who have the same passion and mindset as you. There’s something really inspiring about collaborating with like-minded people.

NW: What is the process of shooting like?

RS: It all starts with the concept - whether it’s something the client wants or an idea I’ve created. Then I gather the team - stylist, makeup artist, models - and we all get on the same page. On the day, it’s about setting up lighting, adjusting the camera, and making sure we get the right shot. People don’t realise how important lighting is in photography.

I remember starting out with a flashlight as my main light source, and while it worked, my current style needs lighting pushed to another level. My favourite part is definitely post-production though - that’s where I really get to bring everything together, refining the images, tweaking colours, and just experimenting. It’s a lot of trial and error, but I love that process.

NW: What other work goes into setting up a shoot?

RS: A lot of prep goes into it. You need to scout locations, figure out logistics, and talk through everything with the team. Organizing outfits with the creative director is key to making sure it all flows. Creative direction is also super important - it’s about making sure everything, from makeup to styling, works together as part of a bigger story.

NW: What does your average day look like when you’re on a shoot and when you are not but still working?

RS: On shoot days, I’m up early, going over the creative direction, and sketching out lighting ideas. Lighting can really change depending on skin tones, clothing, and the backdrop, so I do a lot of prep before we start. When I’m not shooting, I’m editing photos, sending emails, updating my portfolio, and keeping up with admin stuff. But I also try to take time to rest. If I don’t, I notice it affects my creativity. I love making mood boards and finding new sources of inspiration, too. Pinterest is great, but I’m exploring other platforms now to expand my ideas.

NW: Are there other roles that you can do to help you get into a career in photography?

RS: Definitely. Assisting photographers is a great way to learn and see how the pros work. Production roles are also a good way to understand what goes into a shoot. I actually worked in experiential production before jumping into photography again. That’s where I met my mentor, who was the photographer for a shoot we produced. He really helped me understand gear, what’s worth investing in, and shared a ton of valuable knowledge.

NW: What would you be doing if you weren’t a photographer?

RS: I’d probably be in something related to health. Kinesiology has always interested me - I even started a certificate in it. I think it comes from my time playing basketball when I was younger, always getting injured and spending time with my kinesiologist. I really admired their work.

RS: It’s all about networking, social media, and word of mouth. I reach out to potential clients, pitch my ideas, and collaborate with other creatives. In the beginning, you have to hustle to get your foot in the door, but eventually, it leads to working with your dream clients.

RS: It’s fast-paced and competitive, but if you love creativity and learning, it’s a great field to be in. The industry is always changing, so you have to be adaptable. Keep pushing and growing, and there’s always room for more.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/87e592_dab37f0fd0f84afbbfaf09be00b0eb02~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_813,h_1000,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/87e592_dab37f0fd0f84afbbfaf09be00b0eb02~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-04-09 07:00:03.638676

ID24,Levi Strauss,2025-04-09 08:23:14+00:00,New York Post,Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass says any price hikes related to tariffs will be 'surgical',Fox Business,,,,,https://nypost.com/2025/04/08/business/levi-strauss-ceo-michelle-gass-says-any-price-hikes-related-to-tariffs-will-be-surgical/,"But if we do anything, it will be very surgical,” Gass said during the call.
Gass took over the helm in 2024 as the struggling retailer announced a multiyear global productivity initiative to turn around the business and boost profitability.
However, Gass said the company’s supply chain “is more agile today than it ever has been” and that it “pivots” all the time.
“We will continue to do so as we look to address the issues both in the short, medium and long-term,” Gass said.
Business executives have warned of the potential impact tariffs could have on the U.S. economy.","Levi Strauss & Co. CEO Michelle Gass said that any price hikes the company makes due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs would be “surgical.”

Gass, on an earnings call Monday, told analysts that the situation around tariffs is “very new” and “fluid” and that the company is just “getting our arms around it.”

She stopped short of specifying what those price increases would look like, saying “as we look at pricing, we do believe that the brand, especially given the health of the brand, that there is pricing power there. But if we do anything, it will be very surgical,” Gass said during the call.

Gass took over the helm in 2024 as the struggling retailer announced a multiyear global productivity initiative to turn around the business and boost profitability.

Under the initiative, called Project Fuel, the retailer plans to optimize its operating model and structure, redesign business processes and identify opportunities to reduce costs while simplifying processes across the organization. It has since laid off dozens of workers out of its California office, and warned that more could come.

With tariffs adding to its woes, Gass told analysts Monday that the company has assembled a task force to assess “the various scenarios and identifying what levers we have to mitigate,” which could include “structural changes.”

The company sources from 28 countries, 20 of which are imported into the U.S. However, Gass said the company’s supply chain “is more agile today than it ever has been” and that it “pivots” all the time.

“We will continue to do so as we look to address the issues both in the short, medium and long-term,” Gass said.

Business executives have warned of the potential impact tariffs could have on the U.S. economy.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said on Monday that the stock market could see declines deepen due to uncertainty over Trump’s tariffs and that CEOs are telling him they think the U.S. economy is likely already in a recession.

Also on Monday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told shareholders that the levies are likely to “increase inflation” on both foreign and domestic goods, and raised concerns over what their impact will be on America’s economic alliances.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/newspress-collage-cbbak7fti-1744165113575.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1744150729&w=1024,N,,2025-04-09 13:18:48.296130

This tale of two steel plants in undivided Visakhapatnam district has become a topic of heated discussion in the two Telugu States of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
The steel plant's first phase is proposed with an investment of Rs55,964 crore to produce 7.3 million tonnes by January, 2029.
The second phase is envisaged with Rs80,000 crore to produce 20.5 million tonnes by 2033.
When RINL faced fund crunch, the Visakhapatnam Port Authority (then known as Visakhapatnam Port Trust) had come forward to develop it as a satellite port by entering into a joint venture with RINL and the State Government.","Visakhapatnam: It's a tale of two major steel plants with contrasting stories. While one is battling for a hand-to-mouth existence, another, yet to be grounded, is being showered a slew of favours even though it is at a conceptual stage.

This tale of two steel plants in undivided Visakhapatnam district has become a topic of heated discussion in the two Telugu States of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), the corporate entity of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, is a result of a prolonged people's movement under the 'Visakha Ukku Andhrula Hakku' banner claiming the lives of 32 people in police firing in November, 1966. It does not have captive mines gaining the reputation as the only major steel manufacturer in India without owning iron ore and coal mines and coughing up a heavy amount towards sourcing the raw material.

Another steel plant, proposed with a production capacity of 17.8 million tonnes in two phases with an investment of Rs1.35 lakh crore by ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel (AMNS) India at Rajayyapeta in Anakapalli district, about 70 km from here, has been granted permission as well as land at the same place to develop and own a captive port at a recent meeting of State Cabinet chaired by Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu.

The captive port's first phase is envisaged with 20.5 million tonnes and an investment of Rs5,816 crore. The steel plant's first phase is proposed with an investment of Rs55,964 crore to produce 7.3 million tonnes by January, 2029. The second phase is envisaged with Rs80,000 crore to produce 20.5 million tonnes by 2033. Incidentally, the site allotted to AMNS was earlier sanctioned for a captive port by Anrak Aluminium Limited (AAL), which set up a refinery near Makavarapalem but could not get clearance for mining of bauxite mines in the tribal areas due to opposition over violation of Samata Judgement given by Supreme Court on July 11, 1997 in the Samta Vs State of Andhra Pradesh and others. The Samata Judgement pertains to rights of tribals over the minerals in the scheduled areas as per the Regulation 1/70 of Land Transfer (Prohibition) Act.

Ironically, RINL popularly known as Vizag Steel, had plans to develop a captive port at Gangavaram on its own land to handle raw material imports and exports and save an estimated Rs1,000 crore per annum towards logistics.

The company plans to close its Ochsenfurt milk production facility in the fourth quarter of 2026.

Management stated that this decision – made despite recognising the dedication of the employees and the long tradition of the factory – is deemed necessary, to ensure long-term competitiveness in the German-speaking region.

The production will be reinforced at the Fulda site, under its ‘Renew Danone’ initiative, wherein significant investment is planned, the company added.

Operational Challenges

The decision to close the Ochsenfurt facility follows several operational challenges.

Production volumes at the facility have not grown as expected, with current utilisation at only half the level recorded in 2019.

Changes in consumer behaviour and production costs considerably above the average of other Danone plants in Europe have further impacted the site’s economic viability.

Danone believes that these factors necessitate the closure of the plant, to offset persistent unprofitability, resulting from low utilisation and high costs.

The Fulda site, employing nearly 600 staff members and specialising in products such as infant formula and medical nutrition, will be the focus of future investment and strategy, the company added.

Support Measures

The management has committed to minimising the impact on employees and the local community.

Richard Trechman, managing director of Danone DACH, stated, “In recent years, we have grown in the German-speaking region in an extremely challenging environment and are strongly positioned for the future. I am very proud of what we have achieved as a team.”

Trechman further noted that, although the decision is regrettable, efforts will be made to reassign as many affected employees as possible to positions at the Fulda site.

Danone will introduce specific retraining and upskilling programmes and collaborate with the regional Federal Employment Agency and local companies to facilitate the transition of personnel.

For employees who cannot be re-employed within the organisation, Danone plans to negotiate a fair social plan with the Works Council, taking measures such as early retirement and pension-bridging into consideration.

Additionally, the company announced that it will engage with political stakeholders and regional partners to ensure that the closure does not have significant adverse effects on Ochsenfurt and its surrounding region.",https://img.resized.co/esmmagazine/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLm1hZGlzb25wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMuZXVcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDIxXFxcLzA1XFxcLzEwMTQwOTE1XFxcL0Rhbm9uZV83MTAwODI2Ml9tLmpwZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjoxMjAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjI3LFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC9pbWcucmVzaXplZC5jb1xcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmdcIixcIm9wdGlvbnNcIjpbXX0iLCJoYXNoIjoiN2U3MDRlOTk3ZDg5N2RiMGFlMjczZTY0ZWMxYzZhNGQ2ZWE1MjM3MiJ9/danone-restructures-production-in-germany-with-planned-closure-of-milk-factory.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 08:03:35.974032

Levi Strauss & Co. Earnings Call Reflects Balanced Optimism Amid Challenges

Levi Strauss & Company kicked off 2025 on a positive note, as revealed in their recent earnings call. The sentiment was generally optimistic, highlighting significant growth in their Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) channel and international markets. However, the company acknowledged potential hurdles, such as new tariffs and challenges within the wholesale channel. Despite these concerns, Levi Strauss demonstrated a proactive stance, focusing on cost management and strategic planning to maintain a balanced outlook.

Strong Start to 2025

Levi Strauss reported a robust beginning to fiscal 2025, with organic net revenue growth reaching high single digits, marking a 9% increase for the first quarter. This growth underscores the company’s effective strategies and market positioning.

Direct-to-Consumer Growth

The Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) channel experienced a 12% growth, fueled by positive comparable growth, successful new store openings, and a strong e-commerce performance. This highlights the company’s strategic focus on enhancing customer engagement and expanding its retail footprint.

U.S. and International Revenue Growth

The U.S. business saw an 8% increase in revenue, while international markets enjoyed a 9% rise. These gains were driven by market share expansions in both men’s and women’s segments, showcasing Levi Strauss’s global appeal and brand strength.

Women’s Segment Growth

The women’s segment continued its double-digit growth trajectory, now accounting for 38% of net revenues. This growth reflects the company’s successful efforts in diversifying its product offerings and capturing a larger share of the women’s apparel market.

Record Gross Margin

Levi Strauss achieved a record gross margin of 62.1% for the quarter, expanding by 330 basis points compared to the previous year. This improvement indicates effective cost management and pricing strategies.

E-commerce Performance

The e-commerce channel grew by 16%, with notable improvements in conversion rates and customer satisfaction scores reaching their highest levels. This performance underscores the importance of digital channels in the company’s growth strategy.

Tariff Concerns

Recent changes to the tariff structure present a significant challenge for Levi Strauss, with the impacts still uncertain. The company is actively assessing mitigation strategies to address these potential headwinds.

Wholesale Channel Challenges

While the U.S. wholesale segment showed growth, Levi Strauss remains cautious, anticipating that global wholesale will remain flat for the full year. This cautious outlook reflects the company’s prudent approach in navigating market uncertainties.

SG&A Expense Concerns

Despite improvements, SG&A expenses have slightly increased, remaining a focal point for the company. Levi Strauss is committed to further cost management to enhance operational efficiency.

Forward-Looking Guidance

Levi Strauss provided a strong forward-looking guidance, emphasizing their confidence in long-term growth potential despite the dynamic macro environment. The company aims to become a DTC-first retailer and expand its denim lifestyle offering, with a focus on leveraging brand strength and market share gains in both men’s and women’s categories. The record gross margin of 62.1% and adjusted EBIT margin expansion to 13.4% highlight their strategic success.

In conclusion, Levi Strauss & Co.’s earnings call painted a picture of balanced optimism. The company showcased strong growth across various segments while acknowledging challenges such as tariffs and wholesale channel uncertainties. Their proactive approach in cost management and strategic planning positions them well for sustained growth. Investors and market enthusiasts can look forward to Levi Strauss’s continued focus on innovation and expansion in the coming quarters.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Consumer-Cylical-5-750x406.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 06:01:28.406828

HB1150 would prevent PBMs from owning pharmacies. PBMs, like CVS Health, serve as the middlemen that negotiate drug prices from companies and pharmacies.

Ashley Ellis, a district leader for CVS Health, a PBM that also operates pharmacies, said she would lose her job if the bill passes, closing 23 CVS pharmacies.

“We stand for not only our jobs, but also for the patient access and affordability for their prescriptions,” Ellis said.

John Vinson with the Arkansas Pharmacists’ Association said the bill creates a more competitive market.

While he is sympathetic to the situation, he said 65 local pharmacies have already been closing because of a loss of profit due to PBM price-setting.

“We have also had many members, hundreds of members, lose jobs over the last 10 years,” Vinson said. “The Federal Trade Commission had information that 10% of the independent pharmacies in the country have closed by these anti-competitive acts by PBMs.”

Vinson said PBMs can’t be both the price setter and the price taker.

Lucille Accetta with CVS Health believes there is a fair open market for patients to choose which pharmacies they want to use.

“All pharmacies that are in the network, that they ascribe to the PBMs, they receive higher compensation in their fee structure, so it’s open to any patient to go to any pharmacy,” Acetta said. “There is no steerage to go to our pharmacies.”

The bill’s language doesn’t force PBMs out of Arkansas, but it does force them to choose between being a PBM or being a pharmacy.

“This bill being signed into law would take away my job and the jobs of hundreds of people across Arkansas, it’s going to take away access to care,” Ellis said.

“We really, really appreciate all of our pharmacists and pharmacy technicians and the care they deliver, and we’re confident with a competitive market, currently the market is anti-competitive, but with the passage of this bill to improve competition, we think it’s pro-business, pro-competition and pro-patient,” Vinson said.

People against this bill say it’s going to decrease access to pharmacies, however, Vinson said there is other legislation to expand access.

The bill is now heading to the full Senate after passing in a Senate committee.",https://www.kark.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/85/2025/04/snapshot-52.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-04-09 10:06:28.313635

How do you ensure cybersecurity strategy aligns with your organization’s core mission and long-term business goals?
By ensuring our cybersecurity strategy is aligned with our mission helps us deliver on key business goals – both within our own organization and for our customers.
This can be accomplished by speaking in terms of business risk, not just technical vulnerabilities.
What trends are you watching most closely when it comes to the future of cyber risk at the business level?","In this Help Net Security interview, Kevin Serafin, CISO at Ecolab, discusses aligning security strategy with long-term business goals, building strong partnerships across the organization, and approaching third-party risk with agility.

How do you define cyber risk within your organization’s overall enterprise risk framework?

At Ecolab, we don’t approach cyber risk in isolation. Instead, it’s positioned as an integral component of our overall enterprise risk management framework. We define cyber risk as the potential for loss or harm related to technical infrastructure, use of technology, or management of information and, generally, we evaluate risk in a few different ways.

First, we look at operational risks which includes risks that could disrupt our ability to deliver products or services including system outages, data corruption, or impact to critical infrastructure that could affect business continuity. Second, we look at financial risks which include potential monetary losses from cyber incidents such as fraud, regulatory fines, remediation costs, or revenue impacts from service disruptions. The final prong in our framework is reputational risk.

We view these are risks that that might be more difficult to quantify but could ultimately have an outsized impact such as an incident that erodes customer trust, devalues our brand, and could even create longer-term market disadvantages.

How do you ensure cybersecurity strategy aligns with your organization’s core mission and long-term business goals?

Around the world, everything we do is rooted in our more than 100-year history helping customers drive growth through operational efficiencies while conserving natural resources. It’s our north star and core to who we are. By ensuring our cybersecurity strategy is aligned with our mission helps us deliver on key business goals – both within our own organization and for our customers. It’s foundational to delivering a successful cybersecurity program.

As Ecolab’s CISO, I chair a steering committee that regularly convenes a cross-functional group of executives including our Chief Operating Officer (COO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), General Counsel and key business leaders. Together, we discuss how our cyber initiatives can most effectively support the company’s strategic business objectives.

We’ve been sure to position the security team as consultative partners, rather than gatekeepers. We’re at the table to help find solutions not stifle new ideas. When new business initiatives are proposed, we participate from inception, collaborating on solutions that meet business needs while managing the risk appropriately.

This partnership mentality has transformed the conversations from “Can we do this securely?” to “How can we do this securely?”. The difference is subtle but important – it positions security as an enabler of innovation rather than a barrier.

How do you strike the right balance between enforcing security standards and enabling business agility with third parties?

To get this balance right, we’ve evolved from a binary “approved/denied” mentality to a more nuanced risk-based framework that considers both security requirements as well as business value. We’ve implemented a tiered assessment program that scales the assessment according to risk exposure. Critical suppliers handling sensitive data or business process undergo comprehensive assessments, while lower-risk providers may encounter a more streamlined review. This prevents unnecessary friction for business-critical relationships while allowing us to focus on reducing risk to the organization. We have also standardized our security requirements across our suppliers to create clear expectations that suppliers understand from the start.

For strategic partnerships, we’ve adopted a continuous monitoring approach rather than point-in-time assessments. This real-time visibility allows us to quickly reassess changes in a supplier’s risk profile and react accordingly. To do this we blend our own internal monitoring with various cyber risk intelligence services to provide that dynamic view of our supplier cybersecurity posture.

What has been your biggest takeaway about embedding cybersecurity into enterprise strategy?

As cybersecurity professionals, we can help shift some of the more challenging legacy perceptions of the function. It requires demonstrating how cybersecurity is more than a cost center – instead, it’s a driver of tangible business value.

Moving beyond compliance driven security to risk informed business enablement. This can be accomplished by speaking in terms of business risk, not just technical vulnerabilities. When security is positioned as an accelerator of digital transformation rather than a roadblock, it gains the strategic importance and resource support needed for optimized effectiveness. That doesn’t happen overnight, it requires intentional change management and consistent demonstration of how security investments directly support business objectives, protect revenue, maintain customer trust and create competitive differentiation.

What trends are you watching most closely when it comes to the future of cyber risk at the business level?

The global regulatory landscape continues to change rapidly. It’s something we’ve adapted to by tracking much more consistency and it’s sure to remain top of mind. This highly fluid external environment demands a shift towards continuous monitoring and a much more comprehensive compliance management program. We must be ready to adapt quickly as new laws come into play as well as ensuring our suppliers are compliant where relevant.",https://img.helpnetsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/08092511/kevin_serafin-2-ecolab.webp,N,,2025-04-09 04:05:08.252996

Those who have been scouring shelves for deep discounts have been underwhelmed, according to social media.

But that’s about to change for those in the Toronto area, as the company has revealed plans to offer deeply discounted goods at its warehouse in northern Etobicoke — at 160 Carrier Dr. — starting Thursday.

There are thousands of deals to ready to be shopped, a spokesperson told The Toronto Sun in a statement, adding bargain hunters can expect “heavily reduced” prices on furniture, mattresses, kitchen essentials and home decor, apparel, handbags, kids’ toys and other items.

The discounts are said to be up to 60% off top brand-name items. There will even be select HBC stripes items up for grabs, though selection is limited.

The warehouse will be open for business on Thursdays to Sundays until everything is sold (with the exception of April 18-20).

All products are sold as is, the company noted, and no cash — only credit and debit cards — will be accepted.

Last month, Canada’s oldest retailer announced that all but six of its locations in Canada will remain open after filing for creditor protection.

However, the financially troubled company’s restructuring proposal was rejected by an Ontario court, increasing the likelihood that lenders may seek to push the company into receivership.

Retail experts say HBC’s looming demise as a national presence would be a “historic loss” but not surprising, given the retailer’s inability to draw customers into stores.

That said, the billionaire owner of three B.C. shopping malls has declared her intent to purchase the ailing Hudson’s Bay department store chain, outlining her plan in a series of videos posted on a Chinese social network, the Vancouver Sun‘s Michael John Lo reported.

The stakes were raised even higher in the lead up, as retaliatory sparring between Beijing and the US prompted Trump to ratchet China’s tariffs up to a staggering 104 per cent. While the administration appears open to negotiations, no country has successfully bartered their tariffs down to zero yet, and reciprocal tariffs from China and the EU were set to go into effect as of Tuesday.

The situation is volatile, with questions remaining right up until midnight. How long they’ll last is unclear; that uncertainty has thrown global stock markets into disarray. After a brief rally on Tuesday morning on the notion of negotiations, the S&P 500, the Dow and Nasdaq all shed earlier gains, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.7 per cent, the Dow tumbling 300 points and Nasdaq falling 2.4 per cent as of market close.

New US tariffs throw fashion’s supply chain into turmoil

Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs could reshape the fashion industry as we know it. Here’s what’s at stake.

“What’s even more concerning than the direct impact of tariffs is the broader effect on the overall economy and consumer confidence. Even ultra-high-net-worth individuals often gauge their wealth based on stock market performance, and this uncertainty has a ripple effect that extends beyond the tariffs themselves,” says Claudia D’Arpizio, senior partner and global head of fashion and luxury at Bain & Company.

US fashion brands are facing down the prospect of increasing prices and lost profits. For luxury fashion brands – many of which are still trying to regroup from a sector-wide slowdown in 2024 – the impact could be the difference between a recovery year and another in the red.

At the start of the year, analysts predicted that growth would return to the luxury sector by the second half of 2025, growing by approximately 5 per cent this year, with green shoots emerging from a post-election US, a rallying Europe and emerging markets like the Middle East. Now, according to Reuters, one Wall Street analyst is predicting global luxury goods sales could fall by as much as 2 per cent this year. Analyst firms like Bain have not yet published new forecasts, but the outlook is darkening.

“The forecasts are for sales growth to slow. Higher prices may well push up sales values, but they will compress volumes as people buy less,” says Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. “It’s not just about prices, it is also about the confidence to buy and, on this front, consumers are uncertain and uneasy. That is not good for spending, including on luxury.”

Immediate impacts

The sweeping nature of the tariffs have ensured that no country is left untouched, except for Russia and North Korea (while Canada and Mexico were left off the list of tariffs announced 2 April, previous tariffs of 25 per cent were already levied against most goods from the countries). The ripple effect across fashion depends on where companies are located and where they source from and manufacture: European luxury brands count on the high-spending US consumer as a top market; now, any goods sent to the US will be taxed 20 per cent for the European Union and 10 per cent for the United Kingdom.

US fashion brands that manufacture goods in Asian countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia have had to stomach the idea of double-digit tariffs on each country, which will eat into margins and likely force most brands to pass on additional costs to consumers. But in comparison to China’s latest triple-digit tariff, these duties may look like a bargain.

Already, before the most recent round of tariffs went into effect, duties on goods from China, Canada and Mexico were causing price increases for apparel items sold in the US in the fourth quarter, and rising through Q1, according to Fflur Roberts, head of luxury goods at Euromonitor International, a data analytics company.

In a note sent on 4 April, HSBC estimated that soft luxury companies with big retail networks would likely raise prices by a relatively modest 3 to 6 per cent, while hard luxury prices would likely rise by the high single digits, as Switzerland tariffs sit at 32 per cent.

For luxury goods, a $300 increase on a $5,000 handbag may not make or break the decision to buy, but analysts say it’s a fine line. “Many factors are at play here. After two years of price hikes and significant inflation on luxury brands iconic products, even a modest 5 price increase could affect consumer sentiment,” says D’Arpizio.

Meanwhile, fast fashion brands (especially China-based Shein and Temu, which will see the de minimis shipping exemption for packages under $800 disappears in May) may fare better by remaining the least expensive option as all prices go up. Mid-tier brands that rely on manufacturing and sourcing partners globally, and especially in Asia, could bear the biggest brunt. US executives have put the estimated increases at roughly 15 per cent per item for items sourced from Asian manufacturing countries.

Brands can take steps like “renegotiating with suppliers, taking out costs in other areas of the business, and exploring price rises, and maybe absorbing some of the costs by taking a hit on margins,” says Saunders. “Price rises are somewhat easier for luxury as there is less price sensitivity, but volumes are already under pressure in the sector and some middle-income consumers have been deterred by a series of very sharp price increases, so this still needs to be executed with care.”

On the marketing front, brands are ramping up focus on storytelling that emphasises value, says Jhara Valentini, founder of Valentini Media Group, whose clients include Watches of Switzerland Group, which includes Rolex, Cartier and Patek. “Long term, we’re evolving both creative and media strategies to reinforce value storytelling, promote tariff-insulated inventory, and build trust across every touchpoint. We’re also putting greater emphasis on customer lifetime value—ensuring that retention, upsell opportunities, and post-purchase experiences are working harder, so we’re not relying solely on new customer acquisition in a cost-sensitive environment.”

Also determining how hard companies will be hit is where they are financially at the outset. “If retailers were already teetering at the edge, they are a lot more concerned right now,” says Deborah Weinswig, founder and CEO of Coresight Research.

Tariffs are top of mind as brands begin reporting quarterly earnings. “As we enter this period, we are coming from a place of strength,” Levi’s CEO Michelle Gass told investors during the company’s earnings call for Q1 2025 on Monday. Sales rose 3 per cent for the quarter. “We have momentum. The brand has never been stronger and we’ve achieved significant margin expansion. That said, we have a task force assembled assessing the various scenarios and identifying what levers we have to mitigate.” Gass said that any price increases will be “very surgical”.

Hiking up costs

Customers have begun reporting getting hit with hefty taxes and fees when accepting deliveries since tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico have gone into effect. With more tariffs now enacted, this could become commonplace if customers shop with retailers abroad.

Caitlin Burke, a stylist in New York, received a package that she assumes was a PR gift, sent from a distribution centre in Canada. Ahead of delivery, she received an email from UPS saying that the amount due upon receipt was $458.51 for fees and taxes. She’s not alone. Drew Michael Scott, an interior designer with 1.4 million followers on Instagram as @LoneFoxHome, posted a Reel showing a US Postal Service notice on his door saying that he owed more than $2,600 to get a Canadian-sent package delivered. A TikTok user says she was charged $345 to pick up an Canada-based Ssense package from USPS.

It’s not just brands impacted by tariffs: shipping partners from UPS, USPS, DHL and Fedex all incur import taxes and customs charges to ship packages into the US from abroad. Customers can decline payment and send packages back, but that can cause companies and distributors to deny future shipments. This could have an immediate impact on customers shopping with international retailers.

Customers could also start to see price changes on retail sales floors as soon as this week, even on goods already delivered to the US. Weinswig says that, in conversations with retailers, some have begun re-pricing items on sales floors to reflect higher prices. Others are investing in digital signage to be able to change pricing dynamically depending on how the tariffs play out.

Industry responses

If tariffs stick for an extended period of time, analysts say the US will go into a recession. This would spell bad news for international luxury brands who had looked to the US as fertile ground for growth – particularly as the economic slump in China continues. But analysts aren’t counting on that happening, predicting that negotiations and arrangements will be made in the coming days or weeks. According to the Trump administration, 70 countries have expressed interest in bargaining.

“While the new tariffs have shocked, they are not likely the end of the story,” says Saunders. “There will be negotiations and shifts. There will also be possible escalations as retaliation comes into play. This is not a settled state. It is a very dynamic situation which makes it hard for luxury brands to plan.”

The entire saga could prompt a reassessment of fashion and luxury’s supply chains, analysts say.

“When we consider the luxury and fashion markets outside of the US, it’s worth noting that protectionism was already on the rise, and it’s only likely to increase in the short to medium term on the back of the new trade deals and tariffs,” says Roberts, referring to limiting imports in order to boost domestic industries. “We may see a growing trend of ‘luxury localism’ or patriotic consumption among consumers. This could lead to a preference for British, French or Italian heritage brands that are mainly manufactured in these local markets or regions as expressions of national pride, craftsmanship and in a quasi-response to de-globalisation.”

That reinforcement of heritage also applies to marketing strategies. “Storytelling will step back into the spotlight in a big way,” says Valentini. “As pricing becomes more sensitive, brand purpose will act as the safety net. We’ll likely see a shift from performance-only messaging to richer emotional storytelling – rooted in craftsmanship, heritage, and meaning.”

Weinswig says that a silver lining out of this could be more communication between companies and employees, retailers and vendors, and brands and customers. There are a lot of inefficiencies in fashion’s supply chain, she notes, and the pandemic was going to be a galvanising event to change how the industry worked – but that never panned out.

“Every loophole that was there has gotten plugged, so that the industry as a whole has to come to the table and make it right. It’s forcing brands to rethink their approaches, put more focus on heritage and what they stand for,” says Weinswig, who says this realignment could prompt changes in suppliers and materials. “This is in some ways a positive because we have an opportunity to remind ourselves what we stand for and why we do things the way we do.”

D’Arpizio agrees. “During the Covid-19 pandemic, luxury brands excelled at listening to and engaging with their customers from a communications and marketing perspective. They must now continue this approach and invest in these efforts moving forward,”

Like the pandemic, that doesn’t mean this won’t be without pain, Weinswig adds.

“The industry is incredibly stressed. Nobody slept very much in the last five days. But at the same time there is a sort of excitement of being able to figure out a new way of working.”

The results exclude approximately $67m of net revenues from the company’s Dockers brand, which has been reclassified as discontinued operations as the company progresses with its sale. The Levi’s brand specifically was up 8% globally on an organic basis.

“While many brands aspire to be at the center of culture, we are firmly there. Since launching Reiimagine in September of 2024, the campaign has generated more than 4.3bn impressions and more than $65m in estimated earned media value, continuing to help us drive equity gains with men and women across our markets,” chief executive Michelle Gass said on a call with analysts.

A tie-up with the Bob Dylan biopic ‘A Complete Unknown’ starring Timothée Chalamet saw it launch a limited edition collection featuring Dylan's wardrobe staples. “This example is how we lean into our legacy to spark inspiration for the future, it’s further proof that we’re not a heritage brand, but instead a brand with heritage,” Gass said.

Thanks to both pieces of work, she said it gained market share for its men’s and women’s divisions in the quarter and recruited younger fans to the brand, growing share with the 18 to 30-year old demographic. Its women’s business has grown double digits over the last few quarters and now represents 38% of net revenues.

“The Levi's brand has never been stronger,” she said.

“Levi’s is staying true to its rebellious spirit and ability to tap into the current cultural context and how that context challenges gender roles and representation, once again turning the gender narrative and ideas of what is culturally appropriate on its head,” wrote Dorina DAmbrosio, founder and creative director at The Behaviours Agency, for The Drum at the time of Pool Hall’s release.

“From a behavioral point of view, Levi’s is heavily tapping into the nostalgia effect with these reworkings of its famous ads from the past – in Pool Hall, shot-for-shot in some instances. This behavioral bias explains our tendency to reminisce about the past in a positive light that leaves us wanting to spend money now. Coupled with the power of long-term consistency, this strategy has the potential to drive immediate sales.”

Sir John Hegarty, the brains behind the much-loved original ‘Laundrette’ ad, wrote in The Drum that he was “buoyed” to see the Beyoncé remake and that it demonstrated that “great ideas have more longevity than marketers realize.”

Tariffs

For all the winning talk about Beyoncé’s brand-building power, the elephant in the room during the earnings call was the looming impact of President Trump’s tariffs.

Finance chief Harmit Singh said it needed to “see where the dust settles” to accurately asses the impact, having avoided any direct blows this quarter. Clothing retailers such as Levi’s are facing a potential hike in costs as many import their products or fabric from abroad. In its 2024 annual report, Levi’s said it sourced products from manufacturers located in approximately 28 countries around the world, with no more than 30% sourced from any single country. Less than 1% was directly sourced from China (facing tariffs as high as 50%), according to Gass.

For now, it is still in the process of “scenario planning.” The chief exec said it was looking at working with suppliers to save money but raising prices wasn’t off the table. Thanks to Beyonce, customers might be amenable to it.

“We do believe that ... especially given the health of the brand, there is pricing power there,” she said. “But if we do anything, it’ll be very surgical.”

Another cause for optimism for the business is its Beyond Yoga brand, which was acquired by Levi’s in 2021 to take it into the lucrative athleisure market.

Gass boldly declared in its last market update that it would become a billion-dollar brand. She said it was up 10% in Q1 as it continues to focus on brand-building initiatives.",https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-prod/s3/screenshot_2025-04-08_154701.png?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format,N,,2025-04-09 09:03:47.272847

Retail groups in the U.S. have similarly warned that tariffs on Asian countries, where most American clothing is manufactured, will mean a steep uptick in prices ahead of the back-to-school season (new window).

While the Canadian apparel sector wasn't targeted directly by the tariffs, many companies headquartered here make their products overseas and sell to customers south of the border.

Canadian retail giants like Aritzia, Lululemon and Gildan saw their stock tumble (new window) after the tariffs were announced last week by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Access to the U.S. market is critical for brands in this country if they hope to grow past a certain point, says Emma May, founder of the Calgary-based womenswear brand Sophie Grace.

The U.S. market's amazing, it's huge, said May, who has customers on both sides of the border. We solve the same problem for the U.S. customer that we solve for a Canadian customer and there are 10 [times as many] of them.

But May is starting to reconsider some of her U.S. expansion plans.

Her clothes are made in China and warehoused in Canada, where they are shipped to U.S. e-commerce customers. On top of an additional 34 per cent tariff on Chinese goods (new window) imposed last week, the White House has also said a previous exemption, that allowed small orders from China into the U.S. without tariffs, is closing (new window).

Maybe the U.S. market is just not something we can go at because our products will end up being just far too expensive for that customer, said May.

It's unlikely the U.S. will allow loopholes for Chinese-made products that make a pit stop in Canada before being sold in the U.S., says trade lawyer John Boscariol.

The Trump administration is trying to close up any loophole or potential exemption, said Boscariol, a partner with McCarthy Tetrault in Toronto.

And while clothing is a prime example, Boscariol says many Canadian businesses are likely dealing with the same problem.

Whether you're in clothing, apparel items, toys, whatever... whether that's China, Vietnam or any other country in Asia that's now been targeted with very significant tariffs, you're going to be impacted by this in terms of your access to the U.S. market.

Why not change factories?

Jeremy Oldland, co-owner of the Montreal kids clothing company Hatley, manufactures his products in China and India. He supplies pint-sized rain boots, pajamas and jackets to department stores, boutiques and e-commerce customers south of the border.

U.S. sales make up about half his revenue, says Oldland, and he expects that imposing a new surcharge on all those orders will spur a wave of cancellations.

We're going to sell less product. It's going to hurt any way you do it, he said. And yet shifting supply chains out of Asia to North America would be difficult.

We don't have the tradesmanship, the craftsmanship, we don't have the printing techniques, we don't have a lot of things [in Canada].

GraphicsThe full list of Trump's 'reciprocal' tariffs (new window)

Aritzia, Canadian Tire, Groupe Dynamite among Canadian retailers shifting production outside China (new window)

Kirke, with the apparel federation, says the new tariffs are hitting the industry particularly hard because they seem to come out of left field.

In recent years, growing trade tensions between the U.S. and China have prompted some larger retailers to start shifting production (new window) outside of that country, a move that was also driven in part by reports of forced labour in China's Xinjiang region (new window).

But now, the U.S. is also going after smaller manufacturing hubs like Vietnam, Cambodia and Bangladesh, where companies had previously been trying to diversify their production.

That's a hard, hard thing to deal with, said Kirke.

Kirke says he is glad that the U.S. tariffs don't hit Canadian-made products, though this is a relatively small portion of the total industry.

The hope, he says, is that Trump will change course and back down on his tariff policy.

Previously Sarig co-founded and led e-commerce tech company Aterian, until 2023.
Sarig and Kahan’s emphasis on agentic AI matches the marketing industry’s current obsession with the tech.
”Agentic AI tools carry the potential to help agencies realize their vision for generative AI to increase productivity,” said Greene.
Agentic AI, Sarig said, would enable agency staffers to make decisions about client search and retail media investments faster.","It’s the latest top AI position created by an agency group in recent months. Last week, IPG’s crosstown rival Stagwell appointed IBM and Microsoft veteran John Kahan as its chief AI officer (CAIO), while Monks (formerly Media.Monks) recently made founding exec Wesley ter Haar, already the challenger group’s tech pointman, its own CAIO.

Speaking to Digiday, Sarig said his ambition was to create an AI “backbone” throughout IPG’s agency portfolio, with a particular focus on agentic applications of the tech. Previously Sarig co-founded and led e-commerce tech company Aterian, until 2023.

Agency groups have historically struggled to attract and retain top tech talent. Before AI specialists, agencies and tech giants competed to pull in data scientists, for example. According to Jeriad Zoghby, IPG’s head of commerce strategy, the holding company offered Sarig his new position following a stint consulting with the holding company, as a means of keeping him in the building. “We created the role basically to put him in place,” he said.

AI chiefs are becoming table stakes at companies competing for the kinds of big ticket accounts that make or break balance sheets. They’ve been enlisted variously as figureheads for client appeal, boardroom lieutenants driving internal change, or group-wide visionaries.

Stagwell’s Kahan said AI technology would be key for Stagwell to meet its new goal of increasing its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to $1 billion by 2030. “You don’t do that with people. You do that with technology,” he said.

According Gartner analyst Nicole Greene, “the surge in appointing ‘head of AI’ roles across agencies reflects the industry’s need to bring a holistic approach to AI.”

The positions held by Sarig and Kahan are designed to “spearhead AI initiatives … ensuring that agencies remain competitive in a rapidly evolving digital landscape,” she added.

Despite the grand titles, Sarig and Kahan will function day to day as ministers without portfolio within their respective agencies. Kahan’s role is a strategic one attached to the Stagwell Marketing Cloud, its counterpart to IPG’s Axciom or Publicis Groupe’s CoreAI units. He’ll initially lead the division until its longtime CEO Elspeth Rollert returns from maternity leave, and then focus on advising and guiding the group’s AI approach. AI agents and agentic systems are among his early priorities.

“If I’m successful, I enable our agencies to do more with less,” Kahan added.

Sarig and Kahan’s emphasis on agentic AI matches the marketing industry’s current obsession with the tech. ”Agentic AI tools carry the potential to help agencies realize their vision for generative AI to increase productivity,” said Greene.

In IPG’s case, the role is married to a practical focus on commerce. Sarig is set to operate across its agency roster, but for now is working closely with performance media shop Kinesso on a food and beverage brand and a personal care advertiser (he declined to name the clients).

In Sarig’s case, IPG’s tasked him with leading projects applying AI tech to clients’ e-commerce strategies, while integrating Intelligence Node, an e-commerce data company acquired in December, into its day-to-day marketing apparatus.

The company is able to capture vast troves of data about a brand’s e-commerce presence, that of its competitors, and user behavior on the web, Sarig said. It collects so much data that analysing and effectively using it to optimize a client’s approach would be impractical without machine assistance.

“The only way they’re going to deal with that scale is with agentic systems,” said Zoghby.

Agentic AI, Sarig said, would enable agency staffers to make decisions about client search and retail media investments faster. “The ability to have eyes on the market and make decisions about your performance in real time,” he said, “as opposed to in the rear view mirror, [is] going to change the game in my opinion.”",https://digiday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/manufactured-ai-digiday.gif,N,,2025-04-09 08:04:11.491718

President Trump to hike tariffs on China

The backstory:

President Trump on Monday announced plans to raise tariffs on China to 104% beginning on Wednesday.

The 50% increase marks a dramatic escalation in the trade war between the U.S. and China.

Trump has already imposed 20% tariffs on China in February for fentanyl trafficking. He then announced a separate 34% tariff on the country last week.

Why it matters:

Best Buy relies on China for nearly 60% of the products it sells. Even before the announcement of new tariffs, Best Buy’s stock price dropped sharply in the first week of April, falling by nearly 19% in a three-day span.

Concerns over tariffs

What they're saying:

In its annual report to federal regulators filed on Feb. 1, Best Buy executives expressed concerns that higher tariffs, saying they, ""could have a material adverse impact on our business.""

In the report, the company said new tariffs ""could increase costs, disrupt our supply chain and/or impact the availability of underlying technology critical to our operations.""

During an earnings call a month later, executives again raised the issue of tariffs, mentioning the word more than two dozen times.

Corie Barry, the CEO, said new tariffs would make price hikes ""highly likely.""

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

Higher tariffs likely mean higher prices, threat of layoffs

Expert opinion:

""Best Buy might not be able to pass along all of this to consumers, and so they might reduce some of their margins or some of their profits and that results in lower shareholder values – i.e., their stock goes down – or they might have to lay people off,"" said Tyler Schipper, an economist at the University of St. Thomas. ""The bottom line is that if you’re going into a Best Buy, and they’ve imported these products after Wednesday, they’re going to be more expensive.’

What's next:

The new tariffs on China take effect at midnight on Wednesday.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2025/04/1280/720/vlcsnap-2025-04-08-19h49m24s975.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-04-09 01:22:38.323173

“Small businesses like mine have to pay these tariffs, and it’s not a small thing.
So there’s no way to see this as something that’s good — for anybody.” The sneaker industry is a $70 billion-a-year enterprise.
A reporter asked Trump on Monday whether the American public’s “pain threshold” could handle the impact of his tariffs.
It’s unnecessary.” He said multiplying the tariffs by the number of shoes he has manufactured “adds up to a big number.","Devlin Carter created his luxury sneaker company, SIA Collective, six years ago and built it into a multimillion-dollar brand by providing fashionable, high-quality footwear manufactured mostly in China. But the Trump administration’s tariffs have raised the cost of importing goods from many countries, including China, to the United States.

And Carter is incensed.

“These are ridiculous tariffs that make no sense,” Carter said. “Small businesses like mine have to pay these tariffs, and it’s not a small thing. It’s a lot. So there’s no way to see this as something that’s good — for anybody.”

The sneaker industry is a $70 billion-a-year enterprise. And with almost no sneakers manufactured in America, the latest tariffs Trump has imposed have the industry — and the global economy — reeling, generating a ripple effect that puts the future of many small sneaker companies in jeopardy, Carter said.

“And it’s all unnecessary,” he said.

It’s not just the independent producers like Carter who are figuring out what to do next. Even sneaker behemoth Nike faces challenges, as most of its goods are produced in Vietnam, which was hit with a 46% tariff, and Taiwan, with a 32% tariff on goods sent to the United States.

Economist Peter Schiff said on X last week that it would cost Oregon-based Nike more to build production plants in the United States than it would to pay the tariffs. “The result will be fewer sneakers sold in the U.S. at much higher prices,” he said.

A reporter asked Trump on Monday whether the American public’s “pain threshold” could handle the impact of his tariffs. “I think your question is so stupid,” Trump told the reporter. “I don’t want anything to go down. But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”

The tariffs threaten economic stability in general and especially small-business owners like Carter, who relies heavily on shipments from countries like China, where 90% of his shoes are produced. His shoes go for an average of around $220 a pair, he said.

“Say I pay $100 to have a pair of shoes made in China,” he said. “With the tariffs, that shoe now costs $150 or more [to make]. And it shouldn’t. It’s unnecessary.”

He said multiplying the tariffs by the number of shoes he has manufactured “adds up to a big number. So what do you do? Most pass the difference, the increase, along to the customer. Even if you split the increase, it still can become a burden to the customer, because I know that with all the other stuff he has done — like gutting the federal government — there is consumer fear out there.”

And that fear could result in a decrease in sneaker sales, Carter said. He was able to ship more than $2 million in sneakers before the tariffs were imposed.

“People buy my shoes because they like them, but it’s a luxury item,” he said. “I don’t know how many of my supporters feel like they’re about to lose their job. They could be thinking: ‘I need to put this toward groceries. I think we’re going into a recession, so I’m not spending money.’ If you feel like your job is shaky and the economy is shaky, your way of life is shaky, you go into survival mode. And in survival mode most people don’t spend. And that comes back to hurt the small-business owner.”

Earl West, a confirmed sneakerhead, has collected more than 1,800 pairs of athletic shoes, which he stores in his home near Atlanta. That number is likely to rise much more slowly than in recent years, West said, because of the tariff-induced price increases.

“That pair of $180 sneakers is going to cost me $250 now,” he said. “So I have to be very selective on what I’m going to buy and when, because I can’t afford to spend $250 on a pair of sneakers every other week — as a collector, that’s what we do. We’re not, we’re not buying to sell.”

West mapped out his planned sneaker purchases for each year. The tariffs have upset that schedule.

“In some cases, I’m just going to do without the shoes,” he said. West often purchased in the United Kingdom, Germany and Hong Kong. “But they are all under tariffs, so now my effort in getting that shoe from over there may be severely hampered, because now I’m not going to go to the U.K. or wherever, because it’s going to cost me. Instead of $60 to ship it to me, it’s going to cost me $120 to get it here — plus the cost of the shoe. And that’s just too much.”

Sneaker resellers are taking a hit, too, West said.

“Think about it: As a reseller, you have to buy a $150 shoe at a higher rate than it’s worth. And then you have to sell it even higher to make money,” he said. “That’s going to be a problem.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250407-sneaker-store-LA-aa-522-57a780.jpg",N,,2025-04-09 03:51:45.384521

The overall Greater Cincinnati grocery market increased by 3% to $8.7 billion.
The 10 supermarkets with the largest Greater Cincinnati grocery market share","Kroger Co. continues to dominate Greater Cincinnati’s grocery scene even as its market share has dipped in the past year.

Downtown Cincinnati-based Kroger (NYSE: KR), the nation’s largest operator of traditional supermarkets, generated a 50% share of grocery sales in Greater Cincinnati over the past year through March, according to newly released annual data from Tampa, Fla.-based retail data provider Chain Store Guide.

That gives Kroger an enormous lead over Walmart, which ranks second with a 17.2% share.

Meijer is third at 8.1%.

Kroger’s local market share dipped from 50.1% a year ago, according to Chain Store Guide’s data. Slight declines were common among this year’s top players. Still, Kroger’s 0.14 percentage-point drop was the biggest among the top 10. Five of the top 10 experienced small declines. All but Kroger's were less than 0.1 percentage points.

Meijer, whose share inched up to 8.11% from 8.07% a year ago, was one of four store operators in the top 10 to gain local market share, although none rose as much as 0.1 percentage points. One held steady.

Part of the reason for the slight declines: The Trader Joe’s store in Crestview Hills is included in Chain Store Guide’s local market calculations for the first time this year. That lowered shares for other stores a bit. Trader Joe's, which has two locations in the region, showed up in the 11th spot, with a 1.05% market share.

Kroger’s total local grocery sales rose 2.3% to $4.35 billion, according to Chain Store Guide’s data. It was at $4.25 billion last year. And it achieved that growth despite its local store count declining by one, to 70 Greater Cincinnati locations.

The overall Greater Cincinnati grocery market increased by 3% to $8.7 billion.

Analyst: Results proof of Kroger's strong brand loyalty locally

Kroger is doing the right things in Greater Cincinnati and elsewhere to hold a strong market share position, James Lewis, senior equity analyst at downtown-based Bartlett Wealth Management, told me.

“Kroger’s dominance locally indicates consumer loyalty is possibly strengthening,” Lewis said. “The value proposition Kroger is offering is resonating with shoppers as management’s digital strategy is playing out. In short, execution as well as acceptance is high.”

The trend of slight declines in market share among the top companies isn’t surprising, Lewis said. They reflect intense competition and a broader lack of customer loyalty.

“Competition is coming from various retailer outlets like warehouses, online retailers, dollar stores, supercenters and European grocers (like Aldi),” Lewis said. “In addition, consumers base their decisions on price as well as convenience.”

The key to the Greater Cincinnati grocery industry is unit sales and dollar sales, both of which rose for the top local players, Burt Flickinger III, a veteran retail consultant who is managing director of New York-based retail and consumer industry consulting firm Strategic Resource Group, told me.

“Shoppers are shifting from fast food to grocery,” Flickinger said. “They (supermarket operators) are building a strong private label and value program to prepare for more competition. Private label is going to be a key weapon in that war, and Kroger and Costco have built the best private label.”

Next year's Greater Cincinnati market share numbers could look different as Publix comes on the scene. The Florida-based chain opened its first local store March 26 and plans at least four more in Northern Kentucky.

Market share has been a hot-button issue for Kroger Co. in the past year as it tried, and ultimately failed, to get its $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons Cos. Inc. approved by regulators. That deal was rejected on antitrust grounds based on concerns the combined company would hold too much market share and reduce competition in many markets.

But that wasn’t a factor in Greater Cincinnati. Albertsons has no stores in the region.

Kroger is aiming to further boost its market share, both locally and across its 2,721-store operation in 35 states, by opening more stores this year.

Kroger plans to invest $130 million in Greater Cincinnati in 2025 in opening three new stores and four fuel centers, renovating 16 stores and making maintenance and energy upgrades at numerous locations, Kroger Cincinnati/Dayton Market President Ann Reed said last week in a news release.

That’s far more than the $86 million it invested last year and more than four times the $30 million it invested in local stores in 2023, Kroger spokeswoman Jenifer Moore told me.

Kroger began accelerating new store openings across the company last year and will continue that this year, interim Chief Financial Officer Todd Foley said on the company’s conference call to discuss earnings March 6. It completed 29 major store projects last year and plans to do another 30 this year.

In the previous three or four years, Kroger spent much of its extra capital to invest in expanding its digital operations.

At the end of the quarter, the D2C business accounted for 52% of the apparel company’s total global net revenues, according to a Monday (April 7) earnings release.

That figure was up 2 percentage points from a year earlier and, as it accounted for more than half of revenues, marked a milestone in the company’s transformation into “a D2C-first company,” Michelle Gass, president and CEO of Levi Strauss, said Monday during a quarterly earnings call.

“Direct-to-consumer continues to be the primary growth driver, up 12%, fueled by positive comp growth, successful new openings and strong eCom performance,” Gass said.

The shift to D2C will result in “more productive and profitable doors,” Gass said, adding that the company expects to build several hundred more stores in the future.

Levi Strauss aims to have D2C account for 55% of its business over the longer term, even as it expands its wholesale business as well, she said.

The wholesale business was up 5% during the quarter, driven by door expansion, more space at existing stores and a wider lifestyle assortment.

“Consistent with our strategy to diversify our channels of business, U.S. department stores now represent just 7%, which is less than half of what it was 10 years ago,” Gass said.

In another change, Levi Strauss announced in the earnings release that it reclassified its Dockers business as “discontinued operations” in the first quarter. The company disclosed during the fourth quarter that it plans to sell the Dockers business, and it said in the Monday earnings release that it aims to complete a sale during the current fiscal year.

Asked about the impact of tariffs, Gass said during the call that Levi Strauss is well positioned to navigate this challenge because almost 60% of its revenue is generated outside the U.S. and it has an “agile global supply chain” and deep vendor relationships.

Harmit Singh, chief financial and growth officer at Levi Strauss, said during the call that the company has already imported to the U.S. most of the product it needs for the spring and early summer.

Singh added that in terms of share of product imported into the U.S., China accounts for 1%; Mexico, 5%; and Vietnam, mid- to high-single digits.

Gass said during the call: “I’d say our supply chain is more agile today than it ever has been. We make pivots all the time. We will continue to do so as we look to address the issues both in the short, medium and long term.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Levi-Strauss-4.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 23:02:29.434654

Costco initially developed a wide range of names for its private labels across categories.
We decided we need to get one name.” A single private label may be more appropriate for the warehouse club model supported by membership fees and limited assortments.
Costco offers around 4,000 items in-store in contrast to 140,000 offered at other major retailers, according to Sinegal.
With only one or two brands per category, adding private labels created a fierce negotiating tool for Costco.","As Kirkland Signature marks its 30th anniversary, the private label has become a powerhouse, accounting for a third of Costco’s annual revenue — surpassing even industry giants like Procter & Gamble and Kraft Heinz. Given its success, why haven’t more retailers consolidated their store brands under a single name?

According to a videoed case study from the Wall Street Journal exploring Kirkland’s success, the only other major retailer employing a similar strategy is rival Sam’s Club, which consolidated its 20 proprietary brands into Member’s Mark in 2017.

WSJ’s case study pointed out that using a single name went against best practices at the time, illustrated by Sears’ success in hard lines with Kenmore, Craftsman, and DieHard but also the continued use of multiple labels across grocers, department stores, home improvement, and other channels.

Having multiple private labels enables retailers to tailor names to categories, such as Target’s use of Good & Gather for food & beverages, All in Motion for activewear, Cat & Jack for children’s apparel, and Brightroom for home organization.

One risk is that a bad experience with the brand in one category may cause the consumer to lose trust in the brand across categories. Claudine Adamo, Costco’s EVP and COO of merchandising, said in the video, “If they don’t trust the brand in the golf ball, they don’t trust the mixed nuts.”

The motivation to develop its own private label offering came after Jim Sinegal, co-founder and former CEO, read a 1991 Forbes article that showed Europeans were increasingly buying products manufactured directly by stores. At the time, national brands were increasing prices despite costs coming down to meet Wall Street’s demands for growth.

Costco’s move was designed to preserve margins. With its focus on value, Costco caps its markups at 14% for outside brands and 15% for store brands.

Costco initially developed a wide range of names for its private labels across categories. The decision to consolidate all of Costco’s private labels under the Kirkland name came after Sinegal found a warehouse manager who didn’t know a legal tablet the retailer was selling under the Pinnacle name came from Costco.

Sinegal said, “It was like a bell. Hell, if we don’t understand within the organization what we’re doing with our label, how are the customers going to? We decided we need to get one name.”

A single private label may be more appropriate for the warehouse club model supported by membership fees and limited assortments. Costco offers around 4,000 items in-store in contrast to 140,000 offered at other major retailers, according to Sinegal.

With only one or two brands per category, adding private labels created a fierce negotiating tool for Costco. National brands may be forced to reduce prices or upgrade the quality of their offering or be kicked off Costco’s shelves.

Sarah George, SVP of food merchandising, said in the video, “I think the limited-SKU environment is a very misunderstood or under-understood secret of a lot of things about Costco, including private label.”",https://retailwire.com/wp-content/uploads/Kirkland-Signature-kasasagiproductions@yahoo.com-Depositphotos.com_-scaled-e1744157981726-1024x645.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 22:10:53.567491

Vietnam vital Vietnam has developed specialised factories producing everything from high-tech running shoes to track suits.","[LONDON/NEW YORK] Clothing and accessories retailers across the US are delaying orders and freezing hiring ahead of tariff hikes that take effect on Wednesday (Apr 9) on products imported from Vietnam and China.

These businesses, much like Nike and Lululemon, face an impossible choice: offset the cost of tariffs by raising prices by some 40 per cent – potentially cratering sales – or absorb the cost increase and further strain already-thin profit margins.

Unlike their bigger rivals, however, the smaller clothing and shoemakers lack vast supply chains, making them highly dependent on Vietnam and China.

Ian Rosenberger, CEO of Day Owl, a six-year-old New York company that makes backpacks in Vietnam, has paused future orders. Unless there’s a deal to significantly lower Vietnamese tariffs, Rosenberger estimates Day Owl has 30 days before it folds.

But with a production cycle of about 100 days, waiting much longer risks missing the crucial back-to-school shopping season. “The damage is already significant enough to be an existential threat,” he said, adding that his seven employees have been asking if they should prepare to be out of a job.

Rosenberger said tariffs would increase his duty to US$22 from from US$5, prompting him to increase the price of his top-end bag to US$212 from from US$155.

Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America – whose members include Nike, Walmart, Skechers, and Deckers – calculated that a US$155 running shoe made in Vietnam would have to be marked up to US$220 in US stores to offset the 46 per cent tariff.

Vietnam vital

Vietnam has developed specialised factories producing everything from high-tech running shoes to track suits. It is the second-biggest source of clothes and shoes imported to the US after China, and a key manufacturing hub for Nike, Adidas and others.

Vietnam has asked for a 45-day delay in the imposition of US tariffs, and said it would buy more American goods, after Trump and Vietnamese leader To Lam agreed on Friday to discuss a deal to remove the levies.

Nike shares have dropped 14 per cent since markets closed on Apr 2, the day Trump announced tariffs, while Adidas shares lost 16 per cent, Puma shares are down 18 per cent, and North Face-owner VF Corp shares fell 31 per cent.

These big companies work with factories around the world, providing them with some negotiating clout to split tariff costs with suppliers. VF Corp is “well diversified across our supply chain to manage tariffs,” a spokesman said.

Small businesses, such as Seattle, Washington-based women’s running brand Oiselle, have less capacity to absorb the cost, and fewer resources to plan alternatives.

Arielle Knutson, CEO of Oiselle, has asked her 14 full-time employees to work on two or three tariff contingency plans, on top of their usual jobs.

Oiselle, which sources leggings, sports bras and running tops from Vietnam, has delayed spring 2026 orders that would ordinarily be going out now.

Ordering the right amount of product – and not being stuck with too much cash tied up in inventory – is key. “It’s an almost impossible needle to thread,” Knutson said.

Ketchum, Idaho-based outerwear brand Wild Rye sources ski jackets and mountain biking pants from suppliers in China, which will be subject to an additional 34 per cent tariff starting Wednesday.

“This is going to create a huge amount of strain on the business,” said founder Cassie Abel. She has frozen hiring and any raises for her 11 employees, and said the business would have to absorb part of the tariff increase to avoid hiking prices by 40 per cent.

Day Owl, Oiselle, and Wild Rye said they had previously tried to produce domestically but quality was poor, so moving production to the US is not practical.

New kids on the block: Startups could bear the brunt of the harm of rising costs of parts induced by tariffs, according to Dodd.
Firms are also eager to understand in which country parts are manufactured—and where there are vulnerabilities to tariffs.","The weeks-long will they, won’t they on tariffs was finally answered last week when the Trump administration imposed 10% baseline tariffs on all goods imported to the US.

More details: The White House imposed higher tariffs on dozens of trading partners, including a 34% tariff on China (on top of an earlier 20% markup) and a 20% fee on the European Union.

Nations are continuing to implement retaliatory tariffs in response. On Friday, China announced its own 34% tariff on goods imported from the US would begin on April 10. That action sent the stock market into a tumble.

The space effect: It’s too soon to predict any direct impact on the space industry, which is set up to be highly regulated around specific, slow moving government regulations. That’s at odds with the discussion about tariffs, which have been happening for just a couple of months.

“In the aerospace industry, costs get passed along into the marketspace…Is the market going to bear that cost increase? Right now, it’s a lot of philosophical kinds of uncertainty,” said Ed Dodd, VP of business development at Cofactr, a procurement and logistics management startup. “We’re 60 days into the tariff discussion. The industry is not set up to move that fast.”

Defense programs are already largely required to rely on domestically made parts. However, supply chains are deep and many companies work with nations such as Canada and Europe—long-time trusted partners of the US that now face tariffs.

New kids on the block: Startups could bear the brunt of the harm of rising costs of parts induced by tariffs, according to Dodd. While legacy primes can absorb these costs into cost-plus contracts with government customers, startups generally work with the government under fixed-price contracts.

“They’re going to be faced with a choice. They either complete the contract on a loss…or back out of the contract,” Dodd said of startups. “In the government world, past performance is king…If I back out of a contract, will I get the next one?”

The good news: The certainty loving aerospace industry can now at least begin to plan for the tariffs, which have been on-again, off-again for much of Trump’s presidency.

“Instability is a nightmare. If you don’t know what’s happening, you can’t plan, you can’t execute,” Phillip Gulley, Cofactr’s cofounder and chief strategy officer, told Payload. “Feeling the pain and making the change, even if that pain is horrible, is actionable.”

Gulley also said companies are more open to meeting with new vendors to keep their options open. Firms are also eager to understand in which country parts are manufactured—and where there are vulnerabilities to tariffs.

Doom and gloom: What’s the worst that could happen? “Existential threat,” according to Gulley.

He spelled out a series of events that could lead to big trouble for the US industrial base—and for America’s competitiveness in space and national security more broadly.

A company’s costs of production go up.

The company raises its prices for its hardware.

The customer (largely the government, in this sector) refuses to pay the higher price.

The company stops making its product.

“There’s a threshold where the business model for this very direct product doesn’t work anymore,” he said. “It’s an existential threat and the company goes away.”",https://payloadspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/inauguration-day-article-1140x684-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 22:11:02.569368

We have posted complete Q1 financial results in our earnings release on the IR section of our website investors.levistrauss.com. The link to the webcast of today’s conference call can also be found on our site.

Today’s call is scheduled for one hour, so please limit yourself to one question at a time to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed. And now I’d like to turn over the call to Michelle.

Michelle Gass: Thank you, and welcome everyone to today’s call. I’m pleased to share that 2025 is off to a strong start, and our shift to becoming a DTC first company is driving both strategic and financial value. In Q1, we exceeded expectations across sales, margins and EPS, driven by the momentum of our strategies. We again achieved high single-digit organic net revenue growth, up 9%. Direct-to-Consumer continues to be the primary growth driver, up 12%, fueled by positive comp growth, successful new openings, and strong e-com performance. Our wholesale business delivered another quarter of positive growth, up 5%. Our U.S. business further accelerated, up 8%, while international was strong as well, up 9%, and we extended our market leadership with share gains across both women’s and men.

I am proud we were able to deliver these strong results while fundamentally changing the way we work as part of our hard pivot towards becoming a best-in-class omnichannel retailer. Given last week’s tariff announcement, we’re dealing with a dynamic macro environment. However, I’m confident in our ability to navigate these rapidly evolving times. As an iconic brand with more than 170 years of history, we’ve weathered challenging times before. We have a playbook that begins with leveraging the strength of our brand and our deep connection with consumers. We know, especially during times like these, people turn to the brands they know and trust and prioritize value and quality, and that’s what Levi’s has always stood for. Today, almost 60% of our revenue is generated outside the U.S. We have scale with an agile global supply chain, deep vendor relationships, and a strong balance sheet, all of which position us well to navigate this time of uncertainty.

I’ll now walk you through highlights from the quarter in the context of our strategy. Note that all numbers that Harmit and I will reference are on an organic basis and exclude Dockers, which as you saw in our release, has been moved to discontinued operations as we explore a sale of the brand. Let’s start with our first strategy being brand-led. The Levi’s brand was up 8% for the quarter and continues to reach new levels of strength all over the world. While many brands aspire to be at the center of culture, we are firmly there. You can see that through our partnership with the most influential artist of our generation, Beyonce. Since launching REIIMAGINE in September of 2024, the campaign has generated more than 4.3 billion impressions and more than $65 million in estimated earned media value, continuing to help us drive equity gains with men and women across our markets.

As another proof point in our ongoing efforts to drive brand heat, this last quarter, the Levi’s brand was featured in A Complete Unknown, a highly celebrated biopic of Bob Dylan starring Timothee Chalamet. Bob Dylan, known for his love of Levi’s, has shaped and defined culture across many decades. To commemorate the film’s release, we launched a limited-edition collection featuring some of Bob Dylan’s wardrobe staples. This example of how we lean into our legacy to spark inspiration for the future is further proof that we’re not a heritage brand, but instead a brand with heritage. We are also partnering with authentic, locally influential icons to drive brand heat and anchor the brand at the center of culture across the globe. Earlier this month, we expanded our partnership in India with Punjabi Superstar Diljit Dosanjh and launched a new campaign in Germany with Stefanie Giesinger, strengthening our appeal with consumers in both of these important markets.

And as a testament to the strength of the Levi’s brand, we gained market share in men’s and women’s in the quarter, further solidifying our number one position in denim across both categories. And consistent with our strategy to recruit younger fans to the brand, we also grew share with our 18 to 30 year-old target consumer demographic. These consumers transacted a higher AUR and purchased more frequently than our average consumer. Moving to product. While our history is built on jeans, our future will be built around lifestyle, always rooted in denim. For most of our history, we’ve been known as a men’s jeans business, but to achieve our bold aspirations, we need to be more. Over the last couple of years, we have significantly expanded our head-to-toe offering, especially with women, while maintaining our dominance with men.

This enables us to further expand our already large total addressable market. And as a result, women’s continue to accelerate, growing double digits over the last two quarters and now represents 38% of net revenues. Tops represents more than 20% of our business, which has more than doubled over the last 10 years. Inspired by denim lifestyle, newer categories such as dresses, skirts, and outerwear continue to grow at a faster pace than the rest of the business. And while we’re the leader in jeans, our portfolio beyond denim bottoms now comprises 35% of our total sales. As we diversify our product portfolio, we also remain laser-focused on our core Levi’s bottoms business. And in Q1, bottoms were up 9%, driven by strength in both men’s and women’s.

The continued success we’ve achieved in bottoms is attributable to our fit diversification strategy. We have a style for everyone, for every occasion and for any time of year. Loose and baggy fits, which make up roughly 15% of our total bottoms portfolio, continue to be a significant growth driver. For her, we’re building on the trend with new fits. A great example is our launch of the Cinch Baggy available across both DTC and wholesale, which went viral on TikTok and created tremendous interest with search volumes surpassing 200 million. And with men, we’ve been focused on expanding this trend through new fit launches like the 568 Loose Straight and the 578 Baggy. While there is so much fuzz around the Loose and Baggy trend, slim and skinny styles remain a wardrobe staple and comprise more than 20% of both our women’s and men’s bottoms businesses.

We continue to infuse innovation and newness into these styles with a robust pipeline of new fits, finishes and fabrics. Our men’s Classic 511 Slim Fit is a great example now offered across a range of fabrics, washes and colors as well as part of our new tech series earning us more space in this closet. As part of our denim lifestyle strategy, tops remain a key growth category for us. And in the quarter, tops grew 7%. We’re seeing stronger growth in our Direct-to-Consumer channel up low double-digits where we offer our broadest assortment. There is a long runway for growth in our tops business and the strong demand we’re seeing in our DTC channel give us great confidence that this will scale to be a meaningful part of our business over-time.

Our pipeline of newness and innovation remains robust, and I’m confident this will continue to drive impact and resonate with our fans. We continue to see an opportunity to further premiumize the brand with the global launch of the Levi’s Blue Tab collection. Introduced in Asia earlier this year, Blue Tab paired our iconic Levi’s aesthetics with the quality and sensibility of Japanese craftsmanship. Our most elevated expression of denim leadership to-date, the collection features iconic denim staples along with new tops, skirts, and outerwear. And building on the success of our lightweight denim collection, we’re excited to introduce our newest innovation, linen and Denim, combining the authentic feel of blue jeans with soft light linen. Now shifting to our strategy to be DTC-first.

Our global Direct-to-Consumer business delivered another quarter of double-digit growth, up 12% and posting its 12th consecutive quarter of positive comp. AURs in the channel were up mid-single-digits as customers are gravitating to more premium products as well as an intentional reduction in promotion in our stores. DTC productivity actions, including improving the front-of-house consumer experience and back-of-house efficiency are driving growth across key metrics, including strong conversion and traffic trends, fueling significant margin expansion in this channel. I speak firsthand how our strategies and actions are driving these results when I walk our stores and get feedback from our team. Our stores today reflect a more robust head-to-toe offering compared to when we were mainly a men’s denim bottoms destination, and we’re now showcasing a broader denim lifestyle assortment through top dresses, outerwear skirts in both denim and non-denim bottoms.

Our inventory levels are healthier with better in-stock availability and we’re equipping our stylist with enhanced product knowledge and improved selling techniques. The results of all of this work are more productive and profitable doors, increasing our conviction that we can build several hundred more stores in the future. And we are on that path today. In Q1, we continued executing our retail expansion plans. Notable openings include Rome, on Via Cola di Rienzo, one of the most renowned shopping streets in Italy and continued expansion across Mexico and India as we grow our retail footprint in these important markets. We have abundant opportunity to increase our DTC presence in major markets all around the world, including here in the U.S..

Our efforts to accelerate our performance in our e-commerce business are working, with the channel up 16% in Q1 on top of 13% in the prior year. Over the last couple of years, the team has been focused on three core areas to fuel momentum in our e-comm channel, including fixing the fundamentals, evolving the assortment and elevating the consumer experience, creating a much more premium and engaging destination for the full Levi’s experience. We have upgraded the content on our site with higher quality imagery that focuses on our lifestyle assortment and enhanced storytelling. We’re featuring more use of videos on our product detail pages, which allow our consumers to see our product in motion. And we’re seeing a strong response from our consumers with customer satisfaction scores for the U.S. e-comm business rising to its highest level ever.

Today, comprising just 12% of our total company net revenues, we believe that e-commerce represents another significant engine for growth. DTC ended the quarter at 52% of total global net revenues, up 2 points to last year, accounting for over half of our total revenue, a milestone as we transform into a DTC-first company. We are also encouraged by the performance in our global wholesale channel, up 5%, driven by strong growth in the U.S.. U.S. wholesale exceeded our expectations in the quarter, up 9%, in part driven by door expansion and more space with our broadened lifestyle assortment. Our Levi’s women’s business was a particular bright spot, up 17%. Consistent with our strategy to diversify our channels of business, U.S. department stores now represent just 7%, which is less than half of what it was 10 years ago.

Signature, our value brand, also grew this quarter, up 19%, driven by strength in our seasonal fit. And as we look to the balance of the year, we remain prudent as respect to global wholesale. We continue to expect the channel to be flat for the full year on an organic basis, and this continues to be an important profitable channel for us. Now turning to our third strategy, powering the portfolio. Our international business represents close to 60% of our total business today, up 9% in Q1, driven by growth in Mexico, the UK, France, and Germany. International growth remains an important opportunity for us long-term and we continue to believe that we are underpenetrated. Beyond Yoga was up 10% in Q1. We are continuing to focus on brand-building initiatives to drive awareness and profitable growth.

Customers are responding to our broadened assortment of color waves and styles as well as new products like our LuxeFleece collection, expanded outerwear assortment and our lifestyle status trouser. And comp sales in our small but growing network of stores were positive for the quarter. In closing, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. We recognize that the environment around us continues to have uncertainty and we’re focused on the things we can control. Our first quarter performance demonstrates how our transformation into a best-in-class lifestyle retailer is accelerating both the top-line and the bottom-line. Our key strategies are being brand-led, DTC-first and powering our portfolio, along with our efforts to rewire our company to be faster and more consumer-obsessed are working and are gaining momentum.

Our team is focused on executing with excellence and I’m grateful to our employees around the globe for their commitment to the change underway and for their unwavering dedication to consistently deliver for our fans. I am confident we have the right foundation to capture the opportunity ahead and deliver profitable long-term growth for all of our shareholders. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Harmit to provide financial overview of the quarter and our expectations for the year. Harmit?

Harmit Singh: Thank you, Michelle. We have started the year with momentum. Our financial results were better-than-expected and our transformation to a DTC-first lifestyle business is making real progress. As you saw in this morning’s press release, Dockers has been reclassified to discontinued operations. As you will notice, while Dockers was a positive contributor to sales, our gross and operating margin structure is higher, excluding Dockers, thereby improving the structural economics and profitability of our remaining business. Our focus on structural economics is reflected in the fact that net revenues, margins, expenses, and EPS were all better-than-expected. While global wholesale net revenues were up for the second consecutive quarter, our Direct-to-Consumer business continues to lead our growth with net revenues up 12% as we consistently execute the three things that matter most in this channel, what I call a trifecta, positive comp sales, opening high-performing stores and growing e-commerce profitably.

Besides the double-digit top-line growth, our Direct-to-Consumer EBIT margins grew 500 basis points in the quarter, contributing to the company’s overall margin expansion. This is helping drive sustainable sequential progression across our P&L. Q1 ’25 organic net revenues accelerated to 9% versus flat in Q1 ’23 and ’24. Gross margin was a record at 62.1% this quarter versus 58.2% in Q1 ’24 and 56.5% in Q1 ’23. Given our expense discipline in Q1, we were also able to leverage adjusted SG&A margin by 70 basis points, all of which drove 400 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion to 13.4% versus 9.4% in Q1 ’24 and 11.5% in Q1 ’23. Now turning to a brief review of our results. 9% top-line growth was driven by better-than-expected performance in both Direct-to-Consumer and wholesale channels.

Two-third of the growth was driven by units and a third by higher AURs. Turning to margins, we continue to see expansion in both our gross and operating margins. Gross margin for Q1 was 62.1% of net revenues, a new record. Gross margin expanded 330 basis points relative to last year, driven primarily by the continued benefit of lower product costs, favorable channel and brand mix and higher full price selling. Adjusted SG&A expenses in the quarter were up 2% versus prior year to $744 million from higher distribution expenses, driven by a transition to a hybrid 3PL structure. We were pleased to see our adjusted SG&A rate of 48.7% improve after last quarter’s elevated levels, leveraging 70 basis points versus prior year. Gross profit dollars growth outpaced the adjusted SG&A dollar increase, delivering a flow-through of 84%, driving adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 400 basis points to 13.4%.

Adjusted diluted EPS came in at $0.38, well ahead of our expectations and up 52% to prior year. We ended the quarter with reported inventory dollars up 7% to the prior year. We feel comfortable with the level and composition of our inventory and have secured the majority of inventory required to meet U.S. orders for quarter two. In the quarter, as planned, we closed 21 net stores as a system. However, this consists of 30 new-store openings, primarily full price Levi’s brand stores, and 51 closures, which were mostly underperforming franchisee stores in China. Our disciplined fleet review process ensures that the doors we are opening are productive and only the most profitable with the highest return opportunity remain open. In the quarter, we returned $81 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, which were up 12% to prior year.

In quarter two, we have declared a dividend of $0.13 per share, an increase of 8% versus prior year. Now, let’s review the key highlights by segment. The Americas net revenues were up 11%, fueled by double-digit growth across both Direct-to-Consumer and wholesale. In the U.S., net revenues were up 8%, driven by high single-digit growth in both channels. Our business in Mexico was up 6% from increased traffic in our stores as well as e-commerce growth. For the segment, strong gross margin and SG&A leverage led to operating margin of 21.7%, improving 370 basis points to prior year. Europe was positive for the third consecutive quarter. Net revenues were up 3% in Q1, led by double-digit growth in key markets like the UK and Germany. Direct-to-Consumer continued to accelerate this quarter, up 11%, supported by comp stores, e-commerce and more full price sales.

While wholesale shipping was down in the quarter, given the transition of our distribution center in Germany, we expect wholesale in this segment to return to growth in quarter two and have strong pre-book orders, up mid to high single-digits for spring and summer. Gross margin expansion drove operating margin to leverage 120 basis points versus prior year to 25.6%. Asia net revenues increased 10% compared to prior year. Direct-to-Consumer net revenues were up 14%, led by double-digit growth in key markets like Japan, Korea, and Turkey. Our South Asia, Middle-East and Africa business, which includes India, was also up double-digits this quarter as improved in-store retail experiences drove higher UPT and better conversion rates in addition to growth in wholesale.

This quarter, our China business was flat to prior year, and we continue to have modest expectations in ’25 as our work to reset this market is underway. Operating margin of 18.8% was up 200 basis points to last year from stronger gross margins. Now, turning to our full year and quarter two guidance. We had a strong first quarter with broad-based strength across segments, channels and categories, delivering a notable beat for the quarter, and we saw solid trends continue through March. However, as you all know, there were changes to the tariff structure announced a few days ago. Given that the situation is fluid and unprecedented, the impacts are uncertain. We are in the process of scenario planning and determining different mitigation strategies.

We recognize this is a quickly evolving macro situation and we have to see where the dust settles to give you the guidance that is going to be as helpful to you as possible. For now, our full year outlook remains unchanged and includes no impact from the proposed tariffs. Our Q2 outlook remains consistent with our internal plan. The impacts of tariffs will have a minimal impact to our margin structure in the quarter as most of the product for spring, early summer is already in the U.S.. As a reminder, Q2 is seasonally our lowest quarter for revenue and margins in the year. For quarter two, we expect organic net revenue growth from continued operations of 3.5% to 4.5%. This excludes approximately 2 points of foreign exchange headwind and 1.5 points attributable to the exit of Denizen and our footwear business, which implies being flat to up 1% for the quarter on a reported basis.

Gross margin is expected to be up between 80 basis points to 100 basis points, and adjusted EBIT margin is expected to be in the range of 5.5% to 6%. This translates to an adjusted diluted EPS of approximately $0.11 to $0.13, which includes around $0.03 headwind from foreign exchange and a higher tax rate versus prior year. With this expectation, our profitability assumptions will be significantly higher, up approximately 20% versus H1 ’24. In closing, I will leave you with three thoughts. First, while the tariffs announced last week pose a significant challenge for us and the industry, our business and our brands have endured for 170 years, proving our resilience. Today, the Levi’s brand is stronger than ever with diversified global revenue, solid margin structure, agile sourcing base with deep vendor relationships and a strong balance sheet.

We are well positioned to manage through this uncertain time. Second, we delivered strong first quarter results and we’re starting the year with momentum. Our new products are resonating and driving market share gains. We have a robust product pipeline that will fuel growth in our denim and non-denim business for the rest of ’25 and beyond. We are making incredible progress on growing the Direct-to-Consumer channel to a longer-term goal of 55% of our business while also growing wholesale. Third, we are both transforming our business while delivering strong financial results and improving our structural economics as we continue on our path to becoming a $10 billion company with 15% operating margins. I will now open up the line for Q&A.

Q&A Session

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Laurent Vasilescu of BNP Paribas. Your line is open, Laurent.

Laurent Vasilescu: Good afternoon, Michelle and Harmit. Thanks for taking our question. With tariffs front and center on everyone’s mind, can you provide a percentage breakdown of sourcing by key countries for the investors on this call? What are your suppliers saying about providing potential concessions? And then on passing some of the tariffs down the value chain, how much — when do you think you can raise pricing? Thank you very much.

Michelle Gass: Yes. Hi, Laurent. Thanks for the question. So, let me just take a step back for a minute and obviously the news on tariffs is very new. It’s fluid. This was just a couple of days ago, and I think we, like the industry, are getting our arms around it. I would say that as we enter this period, we are coming from a place of strength. We have momentum on the business. The brand has never been stronger and we’ve had — we’ve achieved significant margin expansion. That said, we are — we have a task force assembled assessing the various scenarios and identifying what levers we have to mitigate. And you’ve named a couple of them, but I’d first start with the structural changes, cost structure that we can make. As part of our transformation initiatives, as you know, we’ve made significant progress.

You see it again in Q1 with margin expansion. So we will look there first on how we can accelerate further margin and cost opportunities. Point number two is, yes, we will work with all of our stakeholders, that includes our vendors, it includes our customers as we assess and look at what opportunities we have. As it relates to our vendors, I mean, we’ve got long, deep relationships with many suppliers around the world. We source from 28 countries, 20 of which are countries that we source into the U.S., I’ll speak to some of the countries in a moment. So that is definitely an area that we’re investigating, but we’re in the very early days on that, Laurent. So I’d say more to follow. And then similarly, on pricing. As we look at pricing, we do believe that the brand, especially given the health of the brand that there is pricing power there.

But if we do anything, it will be very surgical. As you saw even this past quarter, our average unit retailer AURs were up again. So the consumer is actually increasing price as they buy up into more premium product. So that’s an opportunity. We’ve also been pulling back, especially in our DTC channel and some promotion. We had more full-price selling. So that whole area is an opportunity. So I would just say more to come. But really we’re looking at those three areas, the cost structure, kind of the end-to-end stakeholder and supply-chain and then surgical pricing. And then specific to the supply-chain, as I said, we have a global long tenured on supply-chain. We source from over 28 countries. And the places that we source from are the places you’d expect from the industry.

Some of the key countries for us in no particular order are places like Bangladesh, Cambodia, Egypt, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, that — those I’d say, our top vendors. But it’s broad. And our — I’d say our supply-chain is more agile today than it ever has been. We make pivots all the time. We will continue to do so as we look to address the issues both in the short, medium and long-term.

Harmit Singh: And I think what we’ve disclosed, Laurent, into the U.S. from China approximately 1%, into the U.S. from Mexico approximately 5% and from Vietnam in the mid to high single digits into the U.S..

Laurent Vasilescu: Very helpful. Thank you very much for your thoughts.

Michelle Gass: Thank you.

Harmit Singh: Thanks.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dana Telsey of — from the Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead, Dana.

Dana Telsey: Hi, everyone. Nice to see the progress. As you think about inventory levels, Harmit, how are you planning inventory levels going forward on wholesale orders? What are you seeing from the accounts? And Michelle, given the Beyonce campaign and some of the other activations and collaborations, women’s business, men’s business, how are you thinking of the denim market growing and what should we be looking at given the linen and denim and new things coming and how you’re thinking about pricing? Thank you.

Harmit Singh: Dana, a couple of things. Inventory at the end of Q1 was up 7%. The composition of the inventory is healthy. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, for the U.S., we have products for spring and summer. And so that’s why we gave a guidance on quarter two. The other thing is, our quarter two includes March and the trends in March are stronger than how we exited February. So that’s a perspective on that business. We’ve been prudent in inventory planning. As we think about the year, as you think about inventory, the three things and now the fourth that we’re keeping in mind that was getting product in for spring and summer, largely because the tariff clouds were — there was an overhang even a couple of months ago.

The second for Europe is Red Sea disruption and the third was generally our thinking about the year. So being very prudent. As a reminder for everybody, we sell a lot of coal, right? So, a lot of our product is seasonless and we can carry it through seasons. And our balance sheet is fairly strong. We talked about the cash position at the end of the quarter and the access to liquidity. So we are in a good spot in a lot of ways. But we’ve been prudent. To your question about wholesale orders, global wholesale was up 5%, U.S. wholesale was up 9% organically. This was the second quarter where we have seen both global wholesale and U.S. wholesale up. And, so as we think and as we are understanding right now, there’s been no change to orders in from wholesale customers.

Inventory or trade inventory is very similar to 2019 levels. Just now, let me shed a little bit of a perspective on wholesale in Europe. Wholesale in Europe was down in quarter one. Essentially, as I said, because we are ramping up our distribution center, we expect wholesale to return to growth in quarter two. The best indication of wholesale demand in Europe is pre-book, which for spring and summer is positive and for fall is positive right now. And I think the second question, Michelle, as she asked you about the denim category?

Michelle Gass: Yes. So, Dana, thanks for the question. And I think to echo what we said in our remarks, we’re really pleased with the start of the year and the Levi’s brand has never been stronger. So, the Levi’s brand was up 8% in the quarter. And I think to your question, we’re seeing gains in both men and women, both in market share and in equity. So specific to the Beyonce campaign, 4.3 billion press impressions, more than $65 million in media value alone. But I think importantly, it’s having — it’s creating a nice tailwind to everything else that we’re doing. Specific to as we think about our transformation, we must preserve and drive the leadership position in men’s. But our intention has been to accelerate with women’s because we’re under shared there.

Women’s is now 38% of our business. Q1 was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Like I said, we are now firmly in the number one position market share in the U.S. and we’re growing that, which is really exciting. Women’s was up 12% overall across all channels and geographies. And then if you look at DTC, which is really the leading indicator, up 16% in the quarter and really delivering on that head-to-toe lifestyle. So as we pivot from jeans to becoming DTC, becoming head-to-toe, we’re seeing that in our DTC results up 12% and we’re seeing that in women’s and in lifestyle. So like I said, women is up 16% in both bottoms and tops growing. The team is really nailing it in terms of driving trends and fashion fits. Diversifying the fit opportunities to strength and losing value continues, but our core remains strong.

Western Wear continues to trend, the list goes on. But even in times like these, when it’s turbulent, we’re going to lean-in and please our fans with delivering the highest quality product at the great value and deliver that innovation.

Dana Telsey: Thank you.

Michelle Gass: Thanks, Dana.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Matthew.

Matthew Boss: Great. Thanks, and congrats on a nice quarter.

Michelle Gass: Thanks, Matt.

Harmit Singh: Thank you.

Matthew Boss: So, Michelle, could you elaborate on key drivers of the 9% organic growth, maybe consumer demand and market share trends that you’re seeing in the Americas? And, Harmit, if you could maybe speak to the cadence of gross margin in the second quarter relative to the back-half?

Harmit Singh: Sure.

Michelle Gass: Right, so I can start. I mean one of the things, Matt, that we’re really proud of the team’s efforts this quarter is really across the board, we saw strength. So if you take our geographies as an example, so our total organic revenue is up 9%. We saw strength in the Americas, in Europe and in Asia and Beyond Yoga, I would say as well as that carries forward another quarter of double-digit growth. The channels, both channels were positive, DTC up 12%, 12th quarter of positive growth, I can speak to that in a moment as well as our wholesale business up 5%. And I’d say its particular strength in U.S. wholesale. And then if I really double-click under DTC because that, the 9%, clearly the 12% is what’s fueling the majority of that.

It’s now 52% of our business. As you know, our long-term goal that we’ve put out there is to be at least 55%. So we’re making great progress. But if you think about DTC and look at some of the KPIs, the key metrics there, as it relates to our owned and operated stores, positive comp sales, we saw positive traffic. We saw positive conversion and we saw positive AURs. E-commerce up 16%, again, positive traffic, conversion and AURs. And so when you think about this, the growth is healthy and it’s sustainable. We’re seeing both it coming through volume and units, which accounted for about two-thirds of the business and we’re also seeing AURs up, which is about up a third. So, this, as we look at the trends, we feel like it’s sustainable and it’s all coming off of the back of our key strategies.

When we say DTC-first, denim lifestyle winning with women, we’re seeing that across the board. And then your second part of your question was around market share. And as I think I mentioned even in my earlier remarks, we’re really pleased to see the growth we are seeing there. Both men’s and women’s grew market share in the U.S. this past quarter. Number one in both positions across both genders. And the other piece that we’re seeing nice momentum and growth is growing market share with you — that 18 to 30 year-old target customer as well as the premium consumer. So, there’s just a lot to like and a lot of momentum we’re seeing across all of our segments of the business.

Harmit Singh: And, Matt, to your question of gross margin, which to me is a great indicator of what the brand is doing, record gross margins in quarter one at 62.1%. So I think the best way to think about it is, half is driven by product costs, which are not truly just trade vendor negotiations. As part of our transformation efforts, we’ll — we’re taking a hard look at SKUs, we’ve reduced our SKUs. We’re taking a hard look at assortments that are not as productive as well as our newer innovations are great margins. So that’s one piece of it. And the other half, I would say, is a combination of mix, which is higher women’s, higher DTC, higher international, higher full-price selling that Michelle referred to, there’s a real focus given that our products are hitting home, we drive higher full-price selling and we had favorable FX given our hedging strategy.

Similar in — for Q2. So Q2 reflected margins will be up 80 basis points to 100 basis points, again driven by this. And a full year basis, 100 basis points. To your question about cadence, first half versus second half, the first half is really strong. The second half because our margin structure was very strong a year ago, the second half will be muted, still up, but, much lower than the first half. And, obviously, we are focused on driving more full-price selling. It’s something that is difficult to predict. That’s why we can — we continue to beat margins, I mean, and the other reason that’s driving higher margin is the wonderful DTC business is higher gross margin.

Matthew Boss: Great color. Best of luck.

Michelle Gass: Thanks, Matt.

Harmit Singh: Thank you, Matt.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Sole of UBS. Please go ahead, Jay.

Jay Sole: Great. Thank you so much. Maybe just on the guidance for Q2. Can you give us a sense of that organic net revenue growth, how you see that by region?

Harmit Singh: Yeah. So similar, Jay, I would say, the U.S. low to mid-single-digit as you think about Q2. Europe, probably mid-single-digit, with one difference, wholesale should return to growth given what I indicated in Asia, again, mid-single-digit. If you think of channels, DTC, I would say high single-digit and global wholesale, flat to slightly up is the general thinking at this stage.

Jay Sole: Got it. All right. Great. Thank you so much.

Harmit Singh: Thank you, Jay.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Ike.

Ike Boruchow: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Harmit, I think two for you. Just can you walk us through the expense deleverage that looks to be implied in the 2Q after getting some pretty good leverage in 1Q and then it looks like the back-half should go back to kind of getting nice leverage to flattish. Just what exactly are the spending dynamics kind of taking place in the second quarter? And then bigger picture for you, it sounds like there’s no revenue issues for the business at all right now, but at least over the past couple of weeks, it might be helpful. Could you talk about the brand overseas? I think there’s some growing narrative about anti-American response to U.S. brands that there is a risk to what’s going on geopolitically. Would love to hear if you’re seeing any of that or if there’s any noteworthy developments that you’ve come across in the past couple of weeks? Thank you.

Harmit Singh: Right. So, Ike, I’ll try and do this in a speedrun. Right now, international business is fairly strong. We are not seeing any impact internationally. From our perspective, we’ve been here for a long, long time. Internationally, as a business, we’ve been around for over 80 years. So we’re not seeing it. We’re entrenched with the local consumers connecting really well and our new product offers that Michelle referred to are generally doing well. To your question about the quarter two guidance, so quarter two, just as a reminder, is largely — is our lowest volume quarter just from the seasonality. First quarter has a December holiday, third quarter has back-to-school and the fourth quarter has the beginning of holidays, the second quarter.

So seasonally it’s the lowest quarter. In terms of SG&A increase, the first quarter was up 2%. We expect the second-quarter to be up 3%. SGA — SG&A as a rate is in the mid-50s. It was around under 50. We still expect SG&A for the year to be around 50%. And this is prior to any actions that we take as Michelle referred to mitigate actions on tariff, et cetera. And the EPS decline relative to last year is primarily driven by the foreign exchange and higher tax. Even though foreign exchange rates have improved a little from the last quarter, they’re very volatile. They go up and down. And so our perspective is FX and higher tax will probably impact EPS adversely by about $0.03. But structurally, the business is in good standing. Gross margins, we expect to be up and organic rate to be up 3.5%, 4%.

Think of our reported revenue, reported revenue in quarter two, I said is flat to slightly up. And so that’s what the deleverage in terms of EBIT percentage.

Michelle Gass: Yeah. The only thing I would add to what Harmit saying is just you think about the whole year, we’re obviously, think about our strategy is to drive the top-line. We’ll get some leverage there and drive margin expansion, both in gross margin over the year and in EBIT margin. And as you know we saw progress from 2024 over 2023, and we’ve guided the year to see another level of expansion there as well. All of this, of course, does not yet reflect the tariffs.

Ike Boruchow: Got it. Thanks a lot.

Harmit Singh: Thanks, Ike.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Nardone of BofA. Please go ahead, Chris.

Chris Nardone: Great guys. Good afternoon. Just a couple of follow-ups. First on U.S. wholesale, can you just clarify whether your guidance is implying positive or negative growth for the remainder of this year? And then, looking out, it sounds like you benefited from expanding into some newer wholesale distribution points in the first quarter. How big is this opportunity over the medium term? And do you need growth in U.S. wholesale to reach your medium-term EBIT margin targets?

Harmit Singh: So, Chris, we’ve had two great quarters on wholesale. U.S. and the team, big shout-out to them. They’ve delivered U.S. wholesale growth in the first two quarters. I indicated, I think in the earlier question, Q2 globally, we expect wholesale to be flat to slightly up. Our expectation in U.S. wholesale right now, we continue to be prudent. And so we think a flat number is a good number at this stage. Obviously, if we’re another quarter under the belt, we’ll talk about the full year from that perspective. On the distribution, you are right. Our opportunities on distribution in the U.S. is primarily around the categories we are growing DTC. We think we have an opportunity in women’s. We think we have an opportunity on tops.

And as you know, after the exit of Denizen and Target, we are working with our customers, in this case Target, to try and grow our Levi’s business and that’s making a difference. So as we think about opportunities of distribution and wholesale, there are opportunities around the company, especially as we grow the categories and both gender, women and men’s as Michelle referred to and the different categories as we pivot to a denim lifestyle company.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Oliver Chen of TD Cowen. Please go ahead, Oliver.

Oliver Chen: Hi, thanks, Michelle and Harmit. In the past, what are your thoughts around frameworks around pricing and also when you look at tariffs in the past, what percentage did you absorb versus share with customers in different ways? And as we look forward, if you — if pricing has been something that you’ve adjusted in the past recently in terms of being — prices being too high. So would you take lower margins in terms of offering the consumer a good value? I know there’s a very dynamic situation here with tariffs and inflation.

Michelle Gass: Yes, Oliver, I’ll take that. Thanks for the question. I mean, I think the word you just said is that, it’s very appropriate, which is it is very dynamic right now. I mean, we’re literally in this, this whole situation is just a couple of days old, as you know. And I think as both Harmit and I mentioned, we’ve got a really talented team right now who is dissecting the problem and looking at all the levers that we have to address the issue, one of — two of which you just hit on, which is we will work with our vendors, with our customers to understand the best way forward. And then pricing is a potential lever, I would say. As we think about it, we will very much think about any pricing if we do take pricing very surgically.

Number one, one of the things we’ve seen our consumer do is they’re actually driving price up. You saw our AURs again this quarter increase as they gravitate to more premium products. So we expect that to continue. There could be more pricing power in our more premium products. So we’ll look at that. Promotions, we have been surgically pulling back more in DTC, I would say, on promotions and achieving more full-price selling. So that is something that we’re going to example — that we’re going to examine. We can test pricing in our DTC channel. That’s something that we can more easily do and understand the elasticity. We have recent experience, for example, in Mexico, where we successfully took some price adjustments based on the tariffs there.

And then what I would say overall, as we think about the Levi’s brand, we address today a broad range of price points. If you start at the core of our products, we’re at a very accessible price point in that $40, $50 range. Then we do compete in the value segment with Signature, that’s largely offered in some of the mass channels that’s doing really well. We were up 19% this quarter. And then we go high-end all the way from like, I’ll call it our Tier 2, which is in our mainline storage. You’re seeing more and more on that of e-comm, that’s where we’re in the $90, $100 range. And then even upwards of $200, $300 with Tier 1 and our new Blue Tab. So I share that in the spirit of we have a lot to work with here to determine what is going to be our right path forward, but it’s going to be really important for us to be super sensitive to the consumer and make sure that we’re on the right path.

Oliver Chen: Okay. And, Harmit, can you get inventory faster like now in order to address what’s happening or what happened with the inventory you have on-hand relative to the win and the methodology for inventory valuation that we should know about with timing of prices relative to the cost of goods sold?

Harmit Singh: Yeah. I mean, Oliver, we are looking at all options right now. I’m sure a lot of our partners and vendors have been called. And so we’re looking at options. We have been able to successfully air freight in the past when we were chasing product. The fact that we have inventory for spring and summer is a good indication. We’re also working on a faster go-to-market calendar, especially for the newer products. So, we’re doing everything that we can within our means. And to your question about cost accounting and depending on where tariffs, it totally depends where tariffs settle. It’s such a fluid situation and so we’re working through it.

Oliver Chen: Okay. Thanks. Best regards.

Harmit Singh: Thanks, Oliver.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Please go ahead, Paul.

Paul Lejuez: Hey, thanks, guys. Can you tell me how you’re thinking about the various macro backdrops of the major regions that you operate in and also how you’re looking at the competitive landscape currently? If you’re seeing any changes in terms of promotions either increasing or decreasing and just sort of what is the backdrop that you’re thinking about by your major regions? Thanks.

Harmit Singh: Yeah. So the good news, Paul, is Q1 is a good indication of the momentum in the brand. The growth was broad-based. All regions were up. Europe was up only 3%, but on an organic basis, but because that was driven by the ramp-up in our distribution center. And so as we think across the world, you know, Europe third consecutive quarter of growth, U.S. fifth consecutive quarter of growth, Mexico, second consecutive quarter of growth, Asia up double-digits. So generally, the momentum is strong from that perspective being global and 60% international, I think will make a difference at least from that perspective. Consumer generally resilient across the world. They’re responding to our new products. Our products offer great value as Michelle referenced. So we’re feeling generally good from that perspective.

Paul Lejuez: Any changes on the promotional front that you’re seeing?

Harmit Singh: Yeah. And promotions, actually, we are tightening promotions. I mean, that’s why the focus on full-price sales, you can see it in margins. So we’re not necessarily going the other way at this stage because the consumer is not giving us a reason for a change. And because inventories are generally in a good spot, there’s no reason to push that down faster or push price down faster.

Paul Lejuez: Great. Thanks, Harmit. Good luck.

Harmit Singh: Thanks, Paul.

Operator: [Technical Difficulty] comes from Brooke Roach of [Technical Difficulty]

Brooke Roach: Good afternoon, and thank you for taking our question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your playbook should the macro-environment worsen? What’s the cost structure of your business today? How much is fixed versus variable? And how much additional SG&A leverage can you drive this year to offset higher product costs if the macro-environment worsens materially? Thank you.

Harmit Singh: It’s all being planned right now, Brooke. I think the best proxy, unfortunately, but the best proxy recently is 2020 and ’21, which was COVID. At that point, our view was fixed and variable, I’d say between 65 and 70 fixed, the rest variable and variable had also ad incentives are variable, for example, but the last thing you want to touch, especially when there’s so much momentum in the brand, I’ll put it there. I think as you think about our stores, very similar cost structure, but even then, we actually grew our store base. We kept adding stores. And so we’re thinking through it. We’re putting everything on the table right now as we think through the three levers, which is cost initiatives without compromising the long-term stakeholder management discussions, which is customers and our vendor partners.

And the third is pricing options or initiatives. And so we are looking at all options Brooke. And then we have an international business that’s very strong, right, that could also be — we can drive some momentum there to offset some softness, if any, in the U.S..

Brooke Roach: Great. Thanks so much. Best of luck.

Harmit Singh: Thank you.

Michelle Gass: Thank you, Brooke.

In a major move to strengthen its position in data-driven marketing, WPP has announced the acquisition of InfoSum, a leading data collaboration platform known for enabling privacy-centric data integration. The acquisition is part of WPP’s broader strategy to deepen its investments in AI and enhance the targeting precision available to its clients.

Founded in 2015, InfoSum has gained recognition for its cross-cloud infrastructure that allows businesses to securely connect and activate data across multiple platforms without compromising privacy. While financial detail of the deal were not disclosed, the acquisition signals a clear intention by WPP to shift further into a first-party data-driven future.

Through this acquisition, WPP will now gain access to InfoSum’s expansive ecosystem, spanning data from global media companies like Netflix and Samsung Ads, along with retailers and identity partners. This will provide a strong foundation for clients to train AI models, refine targeting strategies, and extract richer marketing insights in real-time.

According to WPP CEO Mark Read, the deal marks a significant milestone in the company’s tech-forward evolution. “Bringing InfoSum into WPP is a major step forward for our data capabilities and the results we can deliver for our clients,” he said. “It allows clients to stay in complete control of their first-party data, while also giving them access to vastly greater quantities of high-quality, privacy-complaint data.”

InfoSum will now operate under GroupM, WPP’s media investment division, and its technology will be integrated into WPP Open, the holding company’s propriety AI-powered operating system. This collaboration is expected to enhance interoperability and unlock more value from existing and emerging data streams across the marketing landscape.

The move also comes at a time when marketers are under increasing pressure to pivot from third-party cookies and identity-based targeting, especially following data privacy reforms such as Apple’s AppTrackingTransparency and broader shifts in regulatory environments. InfoSum’s infrastructure offers an alternative, enabling brands to build custom data partnerships without sharing raw data.

Brian Lesser, GroupM CEO and former CEO of InfoSum, emphasized the long-term vision: “This isn’t just about enhancing identity resolution, it’s about unlocking a new era where data collaboration fuels smarter AI models, better audience insights, and greater campaign impact.”

InfoSum’s CEO, Lauren Wetzel, will continue to lead the company and also take on the role of Chief Solutions Officer at GroupM, where she will work on cross-functional innovations that leverage InfoSum’s tech to create solution tailored for both WPP and GroupM clients.

As WPP works to regain its competitive edge and drive innovation in a rapidly changing media landscape, this acquisition reflects a calculated step towards future-proofing its offerings with scalable, privacy-first solutions.",https://marketingedge.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-1.png,N,,2025-04-08 22:10:42.526806

Even a little store like Economy Candy.
For a business with a name like Economy Candy, he wants to remain affordable but fears how high some prices may have to climb in the coming months.
“If we’re putting tariffs everywhere, it is going to go up.” Stepping into Economy Candy feels like a time warp.
But it was already feeling the weight of surges in prices of cocoa and other ingredients before tariffs were layered on.","NEW YORK — Economy Candy’s shelves brim with sweets from around the world – gummies from Germany, lollipops from Spain, chocolates from Japan and a panoply of candies from across the U.S.

Standing amid it all, columns of bright jellybeans to his left and exotic Kit Kats to his right, owner Mitchell Cohen is quick with his assessment of how many of this shop’s 2,000-plus items are affected by the historic round of tariffs announced by President Donald Trump.

“I think all of them,” Cohen says at his store on New York's Lower East Side.

Few corners of the American economy are untouched, directly or indirectly, by the sweeping tariffs being imposed by Trump. Even a little store like Economy Candy.

Cohen had just begun to feel a barrage of inflation-driven price increases from suppliers ease when the tariff threats arrived. For a business with a name like Economy Candy, he wants to remain affordable but fears how high some prices may have to climb in the coming months.

“I think it’s gonna be another round of this hyperinflation on some items,” says 39-year-old Cohen. “If we’re putting tariffs everywhere, it is going to go up.”

Stepping into Economy Candy feels like a time warp. Its name is emblazoned on a sign in a vintage, blaring red script, and crossing below its green-and-white striped awning, past the bins of Smarties, butterscotches and Lemonheads in the front window, an indecipherable sweetness fills the air, oldies music sounds overhead and customers mill around stacks of candy bars they forgot still existed.

It represents just a blip in the country’s $54 billion candy industry. But it was already feeling the weight of surges in prices of cocoa and other ingredients before tariffs were layered on.

Candy and gum prices are up about 34% from five years ago and 89% from 2005, according to Consumer Price Index data. Price, according to the National Confectioners Association, has become the top factor in consumers’ candy purchase decisions, outweighing a buyer's mood.

About a third of Economy Candy’s products are imported, crowded on shelves and tables near the store’s rear. There aren’t just “more German Haribo varieties than the Haribo store in Germany,” as Cohen claims, but gummies the brand makes in France, Austria and Britain.

They have every Milka bar they can find in Switzerland, every type of Leone hard candies that Italy churns out and as many exotic Kit Kats from Japan as they can fit.

On products like these, the tariffs’ toll is obvious.

Pistachio Snickers bars are from India, now subject to 26% tariffs, while passion fruit mousse Snickers are from Portugal, now under the 20% European Union levies.

But even an American-made Snickers isn’t immune.

While the bars may roll off conveyors in Texas, they rely on ingredients from around the globe. Sourcemap, which tracks supply chains, says Snickers bars include chocolate from Guyana and sugar from Brazil and are wrapped in packaging from Canada. All are now subjected to varying levels of tariffs.

“There’s a lot of ingredients in there that have to come from other countries,” says Andreas Waldkirch, an economics professor at Colby College who teaches a class on international trade. “Unless you’re talking about something very simple from your local farmers market, almost every product relies on ingredients from elsewhere. Those indirect costs are really what’s going to drive up prices.”

The story repeats with American candies across the store – the boxes of Nerds and bags of Sugar Babies and rolls of Smarties are all inextricably tied to the global supply chain.

A table teeming with those domestic delicacies takes center stage near Economy Candy’s entrance. Cohen took over the store from his parents, who took it over from their parents before. He got his first haircut in the store. He was behind the register as a child. He took his wife by on their first date.

As a kid, everything on the store’s centerpiece table of American treats cost 59 cents. By 2020, the price was $1.29, but customers who bought a whole box paid a discounted rate of $1 per piece.

Now, Cohen can’t even get them wholesale at that price.

Today, he sells the items on the table for $1.59. Cohen calls the selection a “loss leader” but thinks it's important to showcase his store's affordability. Once the tariffs are fully implemented, he’s not sure he’ll be able to put off price increases.

“When your margins are coming down and your dollar doesn’t go as far at the end of the day, you really start to feel it,” he says. “But I don’t want anyone to come into Economy Candy and not think that it’s economical.”

The biggest-ticket implications of the tariff blitz understandably gain the most attention – the thousands of dollars a car’s price tag may grow, the tens of thousands that disappear from a retirement account in a single day. But here among the root beer barrels and licorice strands, you're reminded that small-dollar items are affected too, and so are the families selling them.

At its birth, the business Cohen’s grandfather started focused on shoe and hat repairs. But in the wake of the Great Depression, when few in a neighborhood of crowded tenements had money for such fixes, the business pivoted.

Candy, once relegated to a cart out front, took over the store.

In the 88 years since, business hasn't always been Chuckles and Zagnuts. The Sept. 11 attacks kept tourists away and had sales sagging and the pandemic closed the store and forced it to pivot to online sales.

If tariffs upend things, Cohen isn’t sure how he might adapt again. He sells products that aren’t made in America and he sells American products made with ingredients from across the globe. He had just been making headway on beginning international sales, but the web of tariff rules may make it impossible.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/richmond.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/7b/27b747ea-d91a-53f6-bf60-1b0bcb448df0/67f519bb89718.preview.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-04-08 22:10:48.200964

ID5,AXA,2025-04-08 23:36:26+00:00,impact.economist.com,Deepfake Fraud: How Organisations Can Protect Against This Emerging Cyber Threat,Not Available,,,,,https://impact.economist.com/projects/deepfake-fraud,"They just have to do something that causes its share price to fall,” explains Ms Chia.
Companies need to plan for deepfake risk mitigation, according to Vanessa Leemans, AXA XL’s head of cyber, UK & Lloyd’s.
“The question is not how fast you run, but how fast you run relative to attackers,” Ms Chia advises.
Ms Chia believes that the perpetrators of many types of fraud will start to use deepfakes.
The emergence of deepfake fraud could herald a period where adversaries run faster than defenders, who must play catch-up.","In early 2024, a Hong Kong-based employee of the UK engineering firm Arup transferred a total of US$25m to five separate bank accounts, before discovering that they had fallen victim to an elaborate fraud. The employee had been duped into making the payments as a result of a conference call in which all other participants, including someone purporting to be the company’s chief financial officer, were deepfakes — their voices and likenesses had been digitally cloned and manipulated with AI by fraudsters.

Although the scam heralded a new frontier in crime, Michelle Chia, chief underwriting officer for cyber, Americas, at AXA XL Insurance, a leading provider of insurance for businesses worldwide and part of the global insurance group AXA, stresses that this was an old crime committed with new technology. “Employees often receive emails purporting to be from their CEOs, requesting they move money into a bank account, which the vast majority have learned to ignore. This fraud was the same type of crime, but rather than email, it was conducted via a video call employing new techniques that capitalise on a lack of vigilance caused by perceived technological limitations. What is worrying is that deepfakes are now more realistic — and harder to detect — and that is only going to get worse,” says Ms Chia.

Deepfakes are not limited to impacting an organisation financially; they can also be used to destroy reputations. For example, deepfakes can be employed to imitate a company’s CEO saying bad things about their products, organisations or competitors. What is worse, reputational attacks can be carried out without breaching a company’s firewall.

“Fake news is a powerful weapon that adversaries can monetise without compromising an organisation’s multi-factor authentication controls. They just have to do something that causes its share price to fall,” explains Ms Chia.

Companies need to plan for deepfake risk mitigation, according to Vanessa Leemans, AXA XL’s head of cyber, UK & Lloyd’s. “Organisations can better prepare themselves before, during and after a deepfake attack, so they are better able to identify deepfakes, understand how to respond to a deepfake attack, and how to recover. But they must create and test these plans now,” she warns.

Employees are a vital part of the identification process. Most organisations have in place training to combat phishing emails. Ms Leemans recommends that this training should also include deepfakes. “If all employees are trained to detect and report deepfakes, an organisation broadens the protective net it can cast.”

The same practices in general cybersecurity also apply to managing deepfake exposure. Zero-trust user validation processes are especially useful to prevent deepfake video calls. Multi-factor authentication to access a video call stops adversaries in their tracks.

Although software is an important tool in the fight against deepfakes, it cannot prevent all deepfake attacks, especially reputational attacks. Ms Leemans explains that a deepfake attack is like any other PR threat. “Organisations must develop a clear, concise message about what has happened, and quickly share the company's position to nip it in the bud.”

While deepfakes are becoming harder to spot, their future impact remains uncertain. As with other cybersecurity risks, attackers and defenders are on a constant treadmill. When defenders improve their detection methods, adversaries improve their deepfakes. “The question is not how fast you run, but how fast you run relative to attackers,” Ms Chia advises. “Sometimes defenders will be winning. Other times, it will be the attackers. One is always chasing the other. It's an arms race.”

It is almost impossible to anticipate what the next fraud trend will be, so the best organisations can do is to proactively manage risk. However, even the best-designed programmes cannot mitigate risk entirely. This is where insurers like AXA XL step in.

Ms Chia believes that the perpetrators of many types of fraud will start to use deepfakes. She cites the example of the recent, eye-catching incident that targeted a luxury food retailer, where fraudsters used fake credentials to steal £300,000 worth of product. This is just the type of fraud that deepfakes could make more convincing. “We offer crime policies to cover this type of loss. The question is whether a firm has taken appropriate precautions to make sure they have identified where they might suffer financial loss, and how they manage that. The insurance industry works hard to keep up with the evolving risks our clients face, and provide the risk transfer our clients need.”

But, as her colleague Ms Leemans is keen to point out, insurers do not just provide a risk transfer service. AXA XL monitors what happens across a broad portfolio and identifies new trends as they occur. As a consequence, they can recommend to their partners on the most appropriate risk mitigation factors and controls to help them to reduce their risk exposure. “In the face of rising risk from deepfakes, cyber insurers play an important role by sharing insights to help organisations improve their risk awareness and protect themselves from these evolving risks,” she explains.

The emergence of deepfake fraud could herald a period where adversaries run faster than defenders, who must play catch-up. That race cannot be won alone — it will be a team effort.",https://images.ctfassets.net/9crgcb5vlu43/1p3NqrFLnXQReIIWu5oUGG/aa886b5477512e05d643db3212329047/Banner_image_article_2_AXA_screen_resolution.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 20:04:59.494067

(Reuters) -CVS Health on Tuesday tapped former UPS executive Brian Newman for the role of finance chief, as new CEO David Joyner strengthens management ranks in his bid to turn around the company.

After taking the helm in October, Joyner laid out cost-cutting plans and named a new insurance head to help the company navigate one of the most challenging periods in its six-decade history.

CVS, which has faced financial struggles and investor pressure in the past few years, missed its earnings targets for the first three quarters of 2024.

""A major piece of the CVS stock recovery story revolves around restoring management credibility,"" said James Harlow, senior vice president at CVS investor Novare Capital Management. He said bringing in an outsider with major company experience as CFO was a positive step in that direction.

CVS Health shares rose over 8% and were also boosted by bigger-than-expected increase in the U.S. government's reimbursement rates for Medicare Advantage plans in 2026 that lifted shares across the sector.

Newman, who played a major role in guiding United Parcel Service through the COVID-19 pandemic, stepped down as CFO last year to focus on his health. The 56-year-old executive spent about three decades with PepsiCo in numerous finance leadership roles before joining UPS in 2019.

He replaces Thomas Cowhey as CFO and will receive a base salary of $1 million. Cowhey will become a strategic adviser to Joyner, effective May 12, after little over a year as CFO.

CVS expects its 2025 financial results ""will meet or exceed"" its previously issued forecast. Harlow said this indicated that ""the management has a better handle"" on the business.

CVS had said in February that it expects to earn an annual adjusted profit of between $5.75 and $6.00 per share. Analysts expect an annual per share profit of $5.91, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Embracing the rise of social commerce, Best Buy has begun inviting influencers to join its “new curated shopping experience,” a program in which creators earn commissions from tech products they sell to Best Buy customers via digital storefronts.

Customers can find creators’ personal “Storefronts” on creators.bestbuy.com, where creators are able to present collections of their favorite Best Buy products to customers, with links to their social media accounts.

According to the retailer, this “one-stop shop” highlights tech items already featured in their social media content and allows creators to earn a commission on sales referred through the storefront. There is no commission cap.

The program -- powered by marketing platform Impact.com -- has launched with three popular tech influencers, including Linus Sebastian (of Linus Tech Tips), who has over 16 million YouTube subscribers and 8 billion total video views, as well as tech reviewer Judner Aura (UrAvgConsumer), and Jenna Ezarik, a tech and lifestyle creator.

Through creator recommendations, Best Buy hopes storefronts collections will help customers seek out products with more confidence and ease. For example, if a customer is looking for products related to their wellness routines, a health and fitness influencer's storefront will suggest specific products they’ve already featured in their videos.

The creator program is another way to persuade influencers to showcase more Best Buy products across social media platforms, as the company competes with retailers like Amazon and Walmart, who have also launched influencer programs.

Ecommerce sales comprise 12% of total Levi Strauss net revenue.","Levi Strauss & Co., known for its denim brand Levi’s, continued its ecommerce sales growth momentum in its fiscal Q1, which ended March 2.

Levi Strauss reported $1.49 billion in Q1 total net revenue, with Levi’s accounting for the vast majority, at $1.43 billion in the quarter. Remaining revenue came from its Levi Strauss Signature ($56.5 million) and Denizen brands ($2.3 million). The retailer said its financial results were “better than expected.”

Levi Strauss direct-to-consumer sales, which include ecommerce, accounted for 52% of total global net revenue. President and CEO Michelle Gass called that “a milestone as we transform into a DTC-first company” in the retailer’s April 7 earnings call with investors. Meanwhile, Levi Strauss’ wholesale channel grew 5%, which she attributed to strong growth in the U.S. (up 9%).

The retailer’s portfolio “beyond denim bottoms” now comprises 35% of total sales, Gass added. Still, sales of the retailer’s bottoms grew 9% year over year in Q1.

Levi Strauss is also exploring the sale of its Dockers brand, which it has classified under “discontinued operations.” Chief financial and growth officer Harmit Singh said that although Dockers positively contributed to sales, the retailer’s gross and operating margin structure is higher excluding the Dockers brand. A sale of the Dockers brand would improve “the structural economics and profitability” of Levi Strauss business, Singh said.

Benefit of Levi Strauss international sales amid tariffs

Gass also mentioned that Levi Strauss international sales represent “close to 60%” of the retailer’s total business. That’s up 9% year over year in its fiscal Q1. She attributed the growth to sales in Mexico (up 6% as a result of increased store traffic and ecommerce), France, Germany and the U.K.

Since the announcement of a new tariff structure on what President Donald Trump referred to as “Liberation Day,” the U.S. administration has again made changes to its tariff structure.

“Given that the situation is fluid and unprecedented, the impacts are uncertain,” Singh said. “We are in the process of scenario planning and determining different mitigation strategies. We recognize this is a quickly evolving macro situation and we have to see where the dust settles to give you the guidance that is going to be as helpful to you as possible. For now, our full year outlook remains unchanged and includes no impact from the proposed tariffs.”

He said although the tariffs announced on “Liberation Day” pose “a significant challenge for us and the industry,” Levi Strauss has shown its resilience as a 170-year-old company. As far as inventory planning goes, Singh said the retailer’s is healthy. He cited “Red Sea disruption” as a result of Yemeni Houthi attacks on cargo ships as affecting year-over-year inventory changes.

“Given last week’s tariff announcement, we’re dealing with a dynamic macro environment,” Gass said. “However, I’m confident in our ability to navigate these rapidly evolving times.”

In the U.S., Levi Strauss net revenue grew 8% in Q1.

She added that Levi Strauss has “scale with an agile global supply chain, deep vendor relationships, and a strong balance sheet, all of which position us well to navigate this time of uncertainty.”

Levi’s ecommerce sales

In Q1, Levi’s grew ecommerce sales 16% year over year. That follows 13% ecommerce sales growth in the prior Q1.

Ecommerce sales comprise 12% of total Levi Strauss net revenue. Gass told investors that the channel represents a “significant engine for growth.”

Levi Strauss is No. 156 in the Top 2000 Database. The Top 2000 ranks North America’s online retailers by their annual ecommerce sales.

“Over the last couple of years, the team has been focused on three core areas to fuel momentum in our e-comm channel, including fixing the fundamentals, evolving the assortment and elevating the consumer experience, creating a much more premium and engaging destination for the full Levi’s experience,” Gass said.

Among its changes, Gass said, Levi’s has upgraded the content on its site with higher-quality imagery. It has also featured more videos on its product detail pages.

Singh said Levi Strauss consistently executes on what he calls a trifecta:

Positive comparable sales

Opening high-performing stores

Growing ecommerce profitably

That came from increased traffic, conversion, and average unit retail (AUR), Gass said.

“The growth is healthy and it’s sustainable,” Gass said. “We’re seeing both it coming through volume and units, which accounted for about two-thirds of the business and we’re also seeing AURs up, which is about up a third.”

By absorbing hundreds of skilled Liberians into its workforce, ArcelorMittal Liberia is directly contributing to national development through job creation, technical training, and the reduction of dependency.
AML Chief Executive Officer Michiel Veandermerwe thanked the management of the AML training Academy, and said ""your team, hats off to you... who made this possible from a higher level in the company?
Speaking earlier at the event, Mr. Anthony P. Kochen, ArcelorMittal Liberia's Chief Operating Officer, praised the graduates and underlined the company's high expectations.
The AML Training Academy, located in Yekepa, has become a national benchmark in technical and vocational education, producing world-class technicians, artisans, and operators.","Yekepa — ArcelorMittal Liberia, the country's largest foreign investor, has ushered in a new generation of local talent into its mining operations, formally recognizing 236 young Liberians who have completed intensive training and are now fully employed by the company.

It was a spirited and emotionally charged ceremony on Friday, as the company celebrated 128 graduates of the ArcelorMittal Liberia Training Academy (AMLTA) and 108 Process Operator Learners (POL), whose successful transition from trainees to full-time employees marked a major step in the localization of Liberia's mining and industrial workforce.

The event, held in Yekepa, was attended by senior AML executives and headlined by a surprise appearance from Mr. Kleber Silva, ArcelorMittal's Global Vice President and Chief Executive Officer for Mining, who flew in from the company's headquarters to personally welcome the new employees and affirm the company's long-term commitment to Liberia.

""This is not just a job. It is the beginning of a lifelong journey to transform your lives, transform this company, and help transform this country,"" Mr. Silva said, his voice firm but inspired. ""What you have achieved is not ordinary. You are now a part of something bigger--a mining operation that is respected around the world.""

Mr. Silva described Liberia as having one of the talents in the world, including the young people who have stepped up to help transform the country.

""He encouraged the young workers to be proud of their achievement but remain humble, focused, and safety-conscious.

""Mining is not just about extracting ore. It's about building nations. It's about dignity of labor. It's about service. And what you've learned here, discipline, teamwork, excellence will not only make you better workers, it will make you better citizens,"" Silva added.

""This is just the beginning,"" he said. ""Each day, a dream comes true. And together, with safety, passion, and pride, we will build something that will serve Liberia, serve its people, and inspire the world. You are not just operators, you are builders of a better future.""

As the crowd erupted in applause, the newly inducted employees stood tall not only as ArcelorMittal's newest recruits but as a rising generation of skilled Liberians determined to take their rightful place in shaping the nation's future.

For the new employees, this moment represents more than a career move, it is a life-changing opportunity. Many come from rural communities with limited job prospects, and their employment opens doors to financial stability, skill advancement, and long-term career development.

The employment of 236 young Liberians also holds broader socio-economic implications. Each new hire means a new household with income, new children who can stay in school, and new possibilities for the next generation. This ripple effect of opportunity cannot be overstated.

Moreover, this initiative plays a key role in reversing the trend of youth unemployment, which remains a major development challenge in Liberia. By absorbing hundreds of skilled Liberians into its workforce, ArcelorMittal Liberia is directly contributing to national development through job creation, technical training, and the reduction of dependency.

AML Chief Executive Officer Michiel Veandermerwe thanked the management of the AML training Academy, and said ""your team, hats off to you... who made this possible from a higher level in the company? I think this is very, very special, not only in Liberia, but in the industry.

He added ""It's very rare that you find this kind of investment in the industry, as Rebecca says. And it's really well appreciated. And it gives me a warm feeling in my heart when I see our people appreciate this so much"".

""So, well done, ladies and gents. We're immensely proud of you. And this is only the beginning"".

""Let's go and start that concentrator and do it and get it going. This is the beginning of a great future for all of you. Thank you for your hard work."", added

COO Kochen: ""You Are Trained. You Are Ready.""

Speaking earlier at the event, Mr. Anthony P. Kochen, ArcelorMittal Liberia's Chief Operating Officer, praised the graduates and underlined the company's high expectations.

""When I look around this room, I don't just see workers--I see the future of our operations and the future of this country,"" Kochen said. ""You are not only skilled and certified; you are ready to take responsibility for one of the most ambitious mining projects on this continent.""

Kochen emphasized the importance of teamwork, safety, and trust.

""Our operation cannot grow without your skill and your commitment. We are giving you the best, and in return, you are giving us your best. That's the partnership we want to build,"" he noted.

He recounted the enthusiastic feedback already coming in from AML teams working with the new recruits on-site.

""Some of you have already started contributing in the concentrator, and the reports have been outstanding. People are talking about your energy, your discipline, your passion. It's really fantastic. You're proving that Liberians can deliver excellence in any environment,"" Kochen added.

The employment of these 236 Liberians is directly linked to AML's Phase II Expansion Project, a multi-billion-dollar investment that includes the construction of a state-of-the-art iron ore concentrator and expansion of rail and port infrastructure. The project is expected to increase AML's production capacity and generate more employment opportunities in both direct and indirect roles.

The new employees will play a vital role in the construction and commissioning phases of the concentrator, a core part of AML's value addition strategy that will shift iron ore processing from raw material export to higher-value exports, retaining more benefits within Liberia.

The AML Training Academy, located in Yekepa, has become a national benchmark in technical and vocational education, producing world-class technicians, artisans, and operators. Many of the new hires were trained on internationally benchmarked curricula and are now positioned to pursue long-term careers in mining, engineering, mechanics, and operations.

For the families of the new employees, the moment was nothing short of historic. For the country, it's a tangible demonstration of how foreign direct investment, when properly aligned with national goals, can build local human capacity and transform natural resource wealth into shared prosperity.",https://cdn.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,N,,2025-04-09 04:04:25.671153

Travellers face economic uncertainty

US tariffs up almost three times

While the lowest oil prices in four years may translate into lower jet fuel costs for airlines, slower economic growth in Europe and Asia could dampen international travel demand for Gulf carriers, analysts say.

At Dubai’s Emirates, for example, jet fuel represented the company’s largest single cost in its fiscal year to March 31, 2024 – AED34.2 billion ($9.3 billion) or one-third of its total operating expenses – at a time when oil prices were hitting $90 per barrel and above.

Since last week, however, the price of benchmark Brent crude has plunged almost 15 percent from $75 per barrel to $64 per barrel, amid concerns that Donald Trump’s global tariff war could prompt a global recession.

Around the world stock markets have crashed on lower expected corporate profits.

“Gulf carriers especially benefit here, as fuel efficiency gains bolster long-haul competitiveness,” said Linus Bauer, managing director of Singapore-based aviation consultancy BAA & Partners.

This could be offset by rising costs and inflation, linked to higher tariffs, sustained interest rates and lower consumer confidence, dampening demand for international travel.

“A prolonged trade war or inflationary pressures could stifle outbound travel from price-sensitive markets in Asia,” Bauer said.

East Asia and Australasia made up more than a quarter of Emirates’ revenue in its last fiscal year, and West Asia and the Indian Ocean region another 10 percent.

Even as early as February, data from the International Air Transport Association suggested a slowdown in passenger demand growth, from 10 percent year on year in January to 3 percent in February.

US policy rattles Middle East aviation industry

Middle East fails to escape Trump’s tariffs

US tariffs render Middle East trade deals worthless, say analysts

That was before Trump announced on April 2 a near tripling in US effective tariff rates from 9 percent to 25 percent, the highest in more than a century.

The effective tariff rate – which is tariffs as a percentage of total US imports, taking into account different rates on different products and on different countries – was 2.5 percent before Trump’s election.

“While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected,” Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve said on April 4.

The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth, Powell said.",https://www.agbi.com/tachyon/2025/04/refuelling-plane.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 06:01:07.897526

“However, some global employers will undoubtedly have to tread a difficult line between avoiding divergence with US counterparts and meeting the expectations of UK stakeholders.”","JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup have also changed their approach to the subject, while Accenture, the consultancy firm, said in February that it was “sunsetting our global employee representation goals” that it established in 2017. Deloitte made a similar announcement.

However, new research from the Institute of Directors found that the majority of UK businesses said they were not planning to alter their DEI policies in response to Trump’s stance. Seventy-one per cent of UK business leaders do not plan to change their organisation’s approach despite Trump’s move, a survey by the employers’ group found.

Alex Hall-Chen, principal policy adviser for employment at the Institute of Directors, said: “Particularly for employers with no US presence, the prevailing view among British businesses is that decisions made by the US government and US companies will have little to no bearing on investment in their own programmes.

The committee passed House Bill 1150 by Rep. Jeremiah Moore, R-Clarendon, and Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, by a voice vote. Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, voted no.

The bill passed the House on April 3 by a count of 89-4, with three not voting and four voting present. The bill now heads to the full Senate.

Pharmacy benefit managers manage prescription drug benefits for health insurers and other payers. By processing drug claims, they effectively set the rates at which pharmacies are reimbursed for their services, as well as provide the reimbursements.

The four largest PBMs control 70% of the market, according to the American Medical Association. CVS Health controls 21.3%, OptumRx controls 20.8%, Express Scripts controls 17.1%, and Prime Therapeutics controls 10.3%.

They also are “vertically integrated” in that they operate their own retail establishments that compete against the independent pharmacies they reimburse. CVS operates 23 pharmacies in Arkansas.

THE DEBATE FOR AND AGAINST

Hammer told the committee that PBMs are steering patients to their out-of-state pharmacies while inflating prices. He said the bill “simply says you can’t be a PBM that both sets the price for themselves and their competition.”

John Vinson, Arkansas Pharmacists Association CEO, said Arkansas has had a net loss of 65 pharmacies in Arkansas as a result of PBMs’ anti-competitive practices. A pharmacy in Pine Bluff closed last week.

Greg Reybold with the American Pharmacy Cooperative, which represents more than 80 Arkansas independent pharmacies, said a Mississippi audit found one PBM had paid its pharmacies more than competitors in 75,000 claims.

“I would go so far as to say that today, Arkansas is the center of the pharmacy universe, because you guys are on the verge of pushing forward a solution that will be comprehensive, and it will be complete,” he said.

Irvin expressed frustration that the Legislature has tried in the past to address the issue, saying the state cannot fix what the policymakers at the federal level will not fix. She said the government is picking winners and losers and shutting out competition.

Randy Zook, president and CEO of the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce, testified in opposition to the bill, saying lawmakers have passed legislation to regulate PBMs, and if there is a problem, the law needs to be enforced. He said vertical integration is common and often used by large organizations, and the bill’s purpose was to remove competition from the marketplace.

He said consumers may like the convenience of mail order pharmacies or of shopping at a particular location.

Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, expressed surprise that the chamber would side with the “oligarchs,” arguing the Arkansas Constitution says monopolies “are contrary to the genius of a republic.” Sen. Reginald Murdock, D-Marianna, said pharmacy patients are not as free to choose another provider as they are to choose a fast food restaurant.

CVS Pharmacy District Leader Ashley Ellis, a pharmacist and Greenbrier resident, testified she would lose her job if the bill passes, as would hundreds of her colleagues. She said passing the bill would reduce options for patients.

“We are not just professionals behind the counter,” she said. “We are your neighbors, friends and family members. We are deeply embedded in the fabric of the communities we serve, providing care and guidance to 340,000 Arkansans who rely on us every year.”

In his closing remarks, Hammer expressed sympathy for those who might lose their job. However, he said he also has sympathy for those who have already lost their job.

His district had a CVS that closed suddenly and another large local pharmacy that closed because of cash flow issues. Local pharmacies along with Walgreens, Walmart and Harps Foods Stores picked up the slack. Furthermore, local pharmacies invest in their communities, he said.

Senators could consider HB 1150 as early as Wednesday in the full Senate. If approved, it would go to Gov. Sarah Sanders for signature or veto.",https://talkbusiness.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/pillbottle-medicine.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 18:07:57.468537

“Despite market shifts, mobile gaming in APAC remains on a strong growth trajectory,” said April Tayson, Regional Vice President for INSEAU at Adjust.
In APAC, the Philippines and Indonesia led in gaming app install and session growth.
The Philippines saw a 4% increase in installs and 9% in sessions, while Indonesia recorded 21% growth in installs and 6% in sessions.

Mobile game installs in the region rose 4% YoY in 2024, despite a 3% dip in sessions, signaling opportunities for marketers to refine retention strategies and maximize long-term player engagement.

“Despite market shifts, mobile gaming in APAC remains on a strong growth trajectory,” said April Tayson, Regional Vice President for INSEAU at Adjust. “As mobile-first adoption accelerates, it’s developers and marketers focusing on long-term player engagement — rather than short-term gains — who will be best positioned to thrive. Leveraging the power of AI-driven personalization and hybrid monetization, to name a few, will be key in building sustainable success in this dynamic industry.”

Globally, the report highlights a mixed outlook. While LATAM (+8% installs, +7% sessions) and MENA (+10% installs, +5% sessions) saw strong momentum, North America (-11% installs, -14% sessions) and Europe (-1% installs, -6% sessions) faced engagement challenges, underscoring the need for strategic adaptation.

Gaming sessions and installs increase globally, with the Philippines and Indonesia at the forefront of APAC

Adjust data shows that in 2024, hyper casual games led global installs (27%) but accounted for only 11% of sessions, highlighting high churn. In contrast, action games, with just 10% of installs, drove 21% of sessions and the longest average playtime (45.15 mins), indicating strong retention. Strategy apps saw the highest YoY install growth (+83%), while casino (+32%) and arcade (+23%) apps led in session growth, reflecting high engagement.

In APAC, the Philippines and Indonesia led in gaming app install and session growth. The Philippines saw a 4% increase in installs and 9% in sessions, while Indonesia recorded 21% growth in installs and 6% in sessions. Meanwhile, other markets showed mixed results: India saw a 2% rise in installs but a 1% drop in sessions, while Vietnam experienced a slight 0.3% uptick in installs but a sharp 18% decline in sessions.

In terms of regional session lengths, APAC had a slight increase with users logging in 34.84 minutes per session in 2024 compared to 34.32 minutes in 2023, and longer than the global average of 30.75 minutes per session. Indonesia recorded the longest gaming sessions in 2024, at an average of 44.31 minutes, with the Philippines (43.4) and Singapore (39.14) following closely. Thailand and South Korea remained strong – both exceeding 35 minutes.

ATT opt-in rates are seeing incremental growth globally, especially APAC

Gaming App Tracking Transparency (ATT) opt-in rates increased slightly in Q1 of 2025 to 40% from 38% in the same quarter of 2024. Big contributors to this growth are attributed to India (from 43% to 44.2%), Indonesia (from 54.2% to 58.6%), Malaysia (from 46.9% to 51.9%), Philippines (from 41.6% to 47.4%), Singapore (from 26% to 29%) and Thailand (from 49.7% to 51.4%)

Globally, arcade games saw the most significant growth, with opt-ins jumping from 42.4% to 59.3%. Sports (54.1%), casino (38.3%), and action (45.9%) games also saw gains, while hyper casuals experienced a slight drop.

Key overall shifts Adjust observed in the mobile gaming industry globally in 2025 include:

AI-driven personalization enhancing player engagement: AI is revolutionizing in-game experiences and predictive retention strategies.

Hybrid monetization is on the rise: Developers are increasingly blending in-app purchases (IAP), ads, subscriptions, and battle passes to diversify revenue streams.

Cross-platform play expands: Seamless transitions between mobile, PC, and console are increasing retention and lifetime value (LTV).

New UA frontiers emerge: Connected TV (CTV), influencer marketing, and alternative app stores are reshaping game discovery.

“With APAC’s sustained momentum, marketers need to stay agile in adapting to evolving player behaviors,” April added. “Success will depend on embracing diverse monetization models, optimizing user acquisition across new channels, and continuously refining engagement strategies to keep players invested in the long run”.",https://www.adobomagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Adjust-Report-APAC-powers-hero.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 17:06:36.007866

Completion of Strategic CapEx Projects and New Senior Hires Driving Robust Revenue and Margin Growth

EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ, April 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mama's Creations, Inc. (Nasdaq: MAMA), a leading national marketer and manufacturer of fresh deli prepared foods, has reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 2025.

Financial Summary:

Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 & Subsequent Operational Highlights:

Secured new customers and product launches including Wal-Mart, all Albertsons' regions, all 8 Costco regions, a first item into Kroger's HomeChef division, Lidl, BJ's, a major C-Store launch at Sheetz, and new Meals for One via Amazon Fresh.

Secured the Company's first-ever fixed-price protein contracts for both beef and chicken, hedging commodity cost risks for at least 50% of the Company's projected FY 2026 volume.

Completed build-out of industry-leading senior management team with the appointments of end-to-end supply chain leader Skip Tappan to the role of Chief Operating Officer and of veteran CPG and Retail executive Chris Darling as Chief Commercial Officer.

Invited to present at leading investor conferences nationally, including the 2025 ICR Conference, 37th Annual Roth Conference, Raymond James Small Cap Summit, 15th Annual Craig-Hallum Alpha Select Conference, 13th Annual ROTH Deer Valley Event and the 2025 Planet MicroCap Showcase.

Cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2025 were $7.2 million, as compared to $11.0 million as of January 31, 2024. The change in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by $5.1 million in capital investments and $3.6 million of debt paydown during the fiscal year.

Management Commentary

""The fourth quarter of 2025 was highlighted by a robust 25.7% revenue growth, to a record $33.6 million, and the highest quarterly gross margin for the fiscal year at 27.0%, with the completion of CapEx investments to double our grilled chicken throughput, positioning us for the next leg up in growth, as reflected in the market share gains we saw this quarter,” said Adam L. Michaels, Chairman and CEO of Mama's Creations. ""Construction-related disruptions at our Farmingdale facility that had been impacting gross margins were firmly behind us in September, putting us back on track toward our near-term target in the high 20% range. While commodities and tariffs continue to put pressure on the macroeconomic environment, we have positioned ourselves well in anticipation of potential future macro headwinds. With over half of our expected protein needs for the new fiscal year locked in via fixed-price agreements, we are better prepared than ever to weather any macro headwinds.

""Emphasis on our 4 Cs - Cost, Controls, Culture and Catapult - during the quarter was supported by continued automation and operational efficiency improvements across the organization. This included the aforementioned CapEx investments that were completed in September, as well as labor cost savings through a new lower overtime staffing model that was fully implemented in January, and additional procurement efficiencies and recent upgrades to our existing grills that will drive meaningful improvements in throughput. We continue to focus on selling new products that leverage the entire chicken breast, which allows us to trim more often, creating a cycle of higher gross margins through significant cost savings. By mid-year, we expect to trim most of our chicken in-house, from a small minority today.

""Taken together, we believe we now have the world-class operational asset base and team in place to fully optimize operations, execute on our Catapult growth plan and identify, acquire and integrate future M&A opportunities. With these strong fundamentals, we believe we are well-positioned to emerge as a dominant player and a consolidator in the prepared foods space. Our marketing has grown to capture new customers, cohorts and occasions, and our team is selling with confidence and fulfilling pent-up demand. This has driven the robust 19.4% growth we saw in fiscal 2025, nearly double last year's growth, all while building the foundation for an even stronger fiscal 2026,” concluded Michaels.

Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 Financial Results

Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 25.7%, to $33.6 million, as compared to $26.7 million in the same year-ago quarter. Revenue for fiscal 2025 increased 19.4% to $123.3 million, as compared to $103.3 million in the prior year. The increase was largely attributable to volume gains driven by same-customer cross-selling of new items, high ROI trade promotions to drive higher velocities in existing customers and new customer door expansion. Targeted pricing actions were successfully put in place and implemented to ensure the Company maintained gross margin targets.

Gross profit increased 16.1%, to $9.1 million, or 27.0% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to $7.8 million, or 29.3% of total revenues, in the same year-ago quarter. Gross profit increased 0.7% to $30.5 million, or 24.8% of total revenues, in fiscal 2025, as compared to $30.3 million, or 29.4% of total revenues, in the prior year. The difference in gross margin was primarily attributable to commodity cost increases from historical averages as well as a non-recurring impact from construction surrounding the now-completed installation of strategic CapEx projects at the Company's Farmingdale, NY facility.

Operating expenses totaled $7.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to $5.9 million in the same year-ago quarter. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses decreased in the fourth quarter of 2025 to 21.3% from 21.9%. Operating expenses totaled $25.7 million in fiscal 2025, as compared to $21.4 million in fiscal 2024. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses remained flat in fiscal 2025 at 20.8% of sales. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter benefitted from increased operating leverage, partially offset by strategic new hires to build capabilities, as well as a 93% year-over-year increase in marketing spend across the entirety of the fiscal year - an area of historical underinvestment - to help drive repeatable and profitable growth.

Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 increased to $1.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $1.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the same year-ago quarter. Net income for fiscal 2025 totaled $3.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $6.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the prior year. Fourth quarter net income totaled 4.8% of revenue, as compared to 5.3% in the same year-ago quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 8.7% to $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to $2.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $9.2 million in fiscal 2025, as compared to $11.7 million in the prior year.

Cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2025 totaled to $7.2 million, as compared to $11.0 million as of January 31, 2024. The change in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by $5.1 million in strategic capital investments and $3.6 million of debt paydown year-to-date, partially offset by working capital improvements. As of January 31, 2025, total debt stood at $5.1 million, as compared to $8.7 million as of January 31, 2024.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release includes the following non-GAAP measure - adjusted EBITDA, which is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance. The company believes this non-GAAP measure, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. However, this non-GAAP measure has significant limitations in that it does not reflect all the costs and other items associated with the operation of the company's business as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the company's non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently and are therefore not comparable to similar measures by other companies. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP. For a definition and reconciliation of EBITDA to net income, its corresponding GAAP measure, please see the reconciliation table shown in this press release below.

Last quarter, McDonald's global same-store sales grew 0.4%, compared to the 0.91% decrease that Wall Street expected.
Its US same-store sales were down 1.4% year over year, as an E. coli outbreak offset momentum in late October.
For its Q1 results, total same-store sales was down 4% year over year.
International same-store sales fell 4%, and China sales dropped 6%.","As companies scramble to respond to Trump's wide-ranging reciprocal tariffs, anti-American sentiment towards US brands is emerging as another concern.

A baseline tariff of 10% went into effect on April 5, while higher reciprocal tariffs are set to begin on April 9.

For food chains, the headwind from tariffs on commodity imports is relatively small, as many ingredients are domestically grown and most imports from Canada and Mexico are exempt under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). But brands like McDonald's (MCD), Yum! Brands (YUM), Starbucks (SBUX), and Domino's (DPZ) have exposure to international markets that could hurt them as customers pull back, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said.

""The bigger issue, in my mind, is the anti-American pushback in these countries on Western or US brands ... we'll see ... what companies say when they start reporting in the next couple of weeks, if they're starting to see that already,"" Saleh told Yahoo Finance.

Goldman Sachs estimates that foreign boycotts overall will cut US GDP by 0.1% to 0.3% this year, meaning a hit of roughly $28 billion to $83 billion.

Major fast food players were only beginning to turn the tide in their international business after the pandemic. China's ""zero-COVID policy"" lasted for three years, far longer than US policies. The stringent, prolonged shutdown had major implications for international sales.

Last quarter, McDonald's global same-store sales grew 0.4%, compared to the 0.91% decrease that Wall Street expected. Its US same-store sales were down 1.4% year over year, as an E. coli outbreak offset momentum in late October.

McDonald's international-owned stores saw positive same-store sales growth in the Middle East, which CFO Ian Borden attributed to the lapse of the impact of the Israeli conflict, plus growth in Japan and ""encouraging signs of stabilization"" in China.

Starbucks is still struggling to see a rebound in its international business. For its Q1 results, total same-store sales was down 4% year over year. International same-store sales fell 4%, and China sales dropped 6%.

Starbucks is facing a stagnant domestic economy and fierce local competition in China. CEO Brian Niccol said he visited and saw firsthand ""how dynamic the market is and the opportunities ahead.""

Prior to Niccol joining, the team said it was in the ""very early stages"" of exploring joint ventures and strategic partnerships in technology, real estate, and supply chain in the country.

For Yum China (YUMC), which separated from the US operation back in 2016, fourth quarter same-store sales fell 1% for KFC and 2% for Pizza Hut. CEO Joey Wat called it a ""challenging environment"" with ""value-minded consumers.""

Domino's global retail sales grew 4.4% in its latest quarter. CFO Sandeep Reddy told investors, ""As we look ahead to 2025, we continue to believe that global retail sales growth should be generally in line with 2024.""

International growth is a key component for fast food players, which have seen flagging foot traffic and appetite in the US as competition from fast casual players like Chipotle (CMG) ramp up.

McDonald's put forth aggressive growth plans at the end of 2023, including expanding to 50,000 global restaurants by 2027, the fastest pace of growth in its 68-year history. That same year, it agreed to buy back Carlyle's minority ownership stake in its China business for a reported $1.8 billion.

By 2025, Starbucks said it wanted to have 9,000 stores in China. As of the last quarter, the US and China make up 61% of the company's portfolio, with 17,049 and 7,685 stores in the two countries, respectively.

Chipotle (CMG) is also expanding its footprint. In 2023, it announced a development agreement to open restaurants in the Middle East and accelerate its international expansion efforts.

Yum! Brands' Taco Bell called international its ""next growth engine"" at its investor day last month, with plans to increase international store count to more than 3,000 by 2030, from 1,153 in 2024.

But there could be a major speed bump ahead.

""If the governments in those countries start to view US brands more negatively, they can slow-roll their approval process. They can deny them in certain areas, make it much more difficult for US brands to grow,"" Saleh said.

He added that it's ""hard to assess"" when it'll be the case.

""There could be some ... call it guilt by association,"" Tematica Research chief investment officer Chris Versace told Yahoo Finance. ""The appetite for certain US brands could be diminished as a result of what we're seeing play out on the global economic and trade front.""

He added, ""Take a look at what we're seeing with Elon Musk and Tesla, where people are ... openly protesting, people returning their Teslas."" He posed the question, ""Could we see something similar unfold with other well-known US brands in foreign markets?""

Health insurers operating Medicare Advantage plans have long faced scrutiny for allegedly improperly reporting patient diagnoses through a method known as “upcoding” that qualifies them for higher payments.
Significant coding differences between Medicare Advantage plans and traditional Medicare were evident in diagnostic categories such as vascular disease, major depressive disorder and diabetes with chronic complications, the paper says.
The study analyzed data from nearly 700 Medicare Advantage contracts managed by nearly 200 health insurers.
The study notes that UnitedHealthcare is the Medicare Advantage market share leader, but concludes that doesn't account for its disproportionate benefit from coding intensity.","Medicare Advantage insurers pocketed more than $33 billion in extra payments in 2021 by using billing codes that portrayed members as unhealthy to generate additional revenue, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Tuesday.

UnitedHealth Group subsidiary UnitedHealthcare profited the most from its ""coding intensity"" strategy, collecting $13.9 billion, or 42%, of the total, followed by Humana with $6.3 billion, Elevance Health with $2.1 billion, CVS Health subsidiary Aetna with $2 billion and Kaiser Permanente subsidiary Kaiser Foundation Health Plan with $500 million, researchers from the University of California, San Diego, and Actuarial Research Corp. found.

Underlying those extra payments were higher risk scores under Medicare Advantage compared with fee-for-service Medicare, the researchers determined using Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data.

The average risk score for Medicare Advantage members was 1.26 in 2021, while the risk score for people with traditional Medicare was 1.07, the study says. The average risk score for UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage policyholders was 1.35.

“Differential coding resulted in an estimated increase in revenue of $1,863 per member at UnitedHealth, substantially greater than the industry average of $1,220 per member,” the paper says.

Health insurers operating Medicare Advantage plans have long faced scrutiny for allegedly improperly reporting patient diagnoses through a method known as “upcoding” that qualifies them for higher payments. The Justice Department is pursuing litigation against UnitedHealth Group over its coding practices and congressional leaders have demanded insurers turn over information on reporting protocols.

The researchers determined that diagnoses added during patient chart reviews and health risk assessments were main contributors to inflated payments. Significant coding differences between Medicare Advantage plans and traditional Medicare were evident in diagnostic categories such as vascular disease, major depressive disorder and diabetes with chronic complications, the paper says.

The study analyzed data from nearly 700 Medicare Advantage contracts managed by nearly 200 health insurers. The authors acknowledge that demographics of plan members and patient health status may influence differences in risk scores, and potential under-coding in traditional Medicare may partially explain differences in coding practices.

The study notes that UnitedHealthcare is the Medicare Advantage market share leader, but concludes that doesn't account for its disproportionate benefit from coding intensity.

UnitedHealth Group rejected the study’s findings.

“This study is similar to others, relying on inaccurate assumptions and incomplete beneficiary information while ignoring the fact that Medicare Advantage serves an increasingly diverse, lower-income and clinically complex population,” UnitedHealth Group said in a statement. Humana, Elevance Health, CVS Health and Kaiser Permanente did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Better Medicare Alliance likewise criticized the findings. “It overlooks known under-coding in fee-for-service Medicare and does not adjust for clinical or demographic differences between Medicare Advantage and fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries, an essential step for fair comparison,” Kaitlyn Saal-Ridpath, vice president of policy and research, said in a statement. “Meanwhile, the underlying data is outdated and does not reflect recent risk-adjustment changes.”",https://s3-prod.modernhealthcare.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/medicare%20cards%20money%2024.png,N,,2025-04-08 16:04:27.723253

The healthcare behemoth is in the midst of a major transformation, streamlining operations and further expanding its diversified portfolio. The company is preparing to report results for the first three months of fiscal 2025.

Johnson & Johnson has hiked its dividend regularly over the past several years and currently offers a yield of 3.2%, which is well above the S&P 500 average. After a mixed performance last year, the stock entered 2025 on a positive note. However, the momentum waned in recent weeks and JNJ is currently trading at the levels seen 12 months ago.

Q1 Report on Tap

The first-quarter report is scheduled for release on April 15, at 6:20 am ET. On average, analysts following the business predict earnings of $2.6 per share and revenues of $21.6 billion for the March quarter. In the comparable quarter of 2024, the company earned $2.71 per share on revenues of $21.38 billion. Johnson & Johnson holds the distinction of consistently beating quarterly earnings estimates for over a decade. In the most recent quarter, revenue also topped expectations, marking the third beat in a row.

Last year, the company set aside around $50 billion for research and development and M&A, including the $14.6-billion deal to acquire Intracellular Therapies. Recently, it announced manufacturing, R&D, and technology investments of more than $55 billion in the US over the next four years. According to the management, earlier deals including the acquisition of Shockwave, V-Wave, and Ambrx enabled it to further shift the portfolio to address unmet needs in high-growth and high-innovation markets.

“Turning to 2025. And, as previously guided back at the end of 2023, we expect to deliver operational sales growth of 3% overcoming headwinds associated with US biosimilar entries for STELARA and the impact of the Part D redesign and continued macroeconomic pressures in China. Perhaps, even more impressive, we are planning for adjusted operational earnings per share growth of nearly 9%. I cannot think of any other company that would be able to deliver growth through the first year of losing exclusivity of a multibillion-dollar product,” the company’s CEO Joaquin Duato said in the Q4 earnings call.

The drugmaker expects acquisitions and divestitures to favorably impact operational growth by about 50 basis points in FY25. The management maintains a positive outlook, despite anticipating headwinds from the sales slowdown in China and biosimilar competition for one of its lead products – for blockbuster drug Stelara, biosimilars have been approved and are expected to be launched in the US and Europe soon.

Mixed Q4

In the December quarter, net earnings decreased 17% year-over-year to $3.4 billion or $1.41 per share. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share decreased 11% to $2.04. Meanwhile, Q4 sales increased 5.3% from last year to $22.5 billion, with Innovation Medicine sales and MedTech sales growing 4% and 7% respectively. Operational sales growth was 6.7% in the fourth quarter. The management said it expects fiscal 2025 reported sales to be in the range of $89.2 billion to $90.0 billion and adjusted earnings per share between $10.50 and $10.70.

(LEVI) beat expectations in the first quarter, delivering stronger-than-expected profits and expressing rare confidence in the face of Trump’s new tariffs.
Revenue rose 3.1% to $1.53 billion, excluding $67 million from Dockers, which has been reclassified as a discontinued operation.
Trump's tariffs had no effect on Levi's guidance Despite economic uncertainty and fresh U.S. tariffs, Levi’s is sticking with its full-year guidance.
“We’re trying to put in place a mitigation plan where the impact to the consumer is minimal,” Singh said.
“In our experience, the U.S. consumer gravitates to brands they can trust during times like these.”","Levi Strauss & Co. (LEVI) beat expectations in the first quarter, delivering stronger-than-expected profits and expressing rare confidence in the face of Trump’s new tariffs.

The denim giant reported a profit of $135 million for the quarter ended March 2, a sharp turnaround from a $10.6 million loss in the same period last year.

Adjusted earnings per share came in at 38 cents, crushing Wall Street's estimate of 28 cents, according to FactSet.

Revenue rose 3.1% to $1.53 billion, excluding $67 million from Dockers, which has been reclassified as a discontinued operation.

The increase was driven largely by a 6% gain in Levi’s core Americas region. Direct-to-consumer sales surged 9%, while wholesale revenue slipped 3%.

“The Levi’s brand is stronger than ever, and we will continue to fuel this momentum through a robust product pipeline and by keeping the brand firmly at the center of culture across the globe,” said CEO Michelle Gass.

Analysts had projected revenue of $1.54 billion. Shares jumped 4.8% to $14.15 in after-hours trading Monday.

Trump's tariffs had no effect on Levi's guidance

Despite economic uncertainty and fresh U.S. tariffs, Levi’s is sticking with its full-year guidance.

Chief Financial and Growth Officer Harmit Singh told investors most of Levi’s spring and early summer inventory has already arrived in the U.S., softening the tariff impact for the current quarter.

“We’re trying to put in place a mitigation plan where the impact to the consumer is minimal,” Singh said. “The tariffs have just happened, and so it’s a 24/7 job for the company.”

According to The Wall Street Journal, Levi’s has already formed a team to assess the implications of former President Trump's new tariffs.

Looking ahead, Singh said Levi’s expects “minimal impact” on second-quarter margins. He added that the company’s strong balance sheet and global footprint position it well to manage any disruptions.

Levi’s 2025 forecast excludes potential fallout from macroeconomic shocks, inflation, supply chain issues, and retaliatory tariffs.

The company sources its products from around 30 countries, with no more than 30% coming from any single nation. Fewer than 1% of its U.S.-sold products are made in China.

“It’s early days, but we’ve seen the consumer remain generally resilient,” Singh said. “In our experience, the U.S. consumer gravitates to brands they can trust during times like these.”",https://media.investorsobserver.com/images/featured-big/2025/04/levis-stock.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 20:05:17.592241

Levi's sees growth potential amid new tariff environment

Shares of Levi Strauss (NYSE: LEVI) rose Tuesday but swiftly came back to earth a day after the San Francisco-based denim giant reported better-than-expected first-quarter profit and gave a relatively optimistic outlook on the Trump administration's new tariffs. After the bell Monday, Levi's reported quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $0.38, above the $0.28 consensus forecast of analysts. The company also generated $1.53 billion in revenue, in line with estimates. Bloomberg reports that Levi's said its guidance for fiscal 2025 “assumes no significant worsening” of macroeconomic pressure on consumers, supply-chain disruptions, increased tariffs or similar factors. Levi also sees organic revenue growth of 3.5% to 4.5% this year. Shares rose as much as 16% — the biggest gain in a year — but that quickly evaporated Tuesday morning, later hovering around 1% above where it started the day. Overall, Levi's stock is still down more than 16% over the past five days.

In its annual report regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, Kroger reported that it spent $684 million in 2024 on “merger related costs,” which included “third-party professional fees (outside experts, such as lawyers) and credit facility fees (borrowing costs).” The failed merger, which was originally announced in October 2022, cost Kroger $316 million in 2023 and $44 million in 2022, according to a Cincinnati Enquirer report.
In late March, meanwhile, Kroger filed a legal response to Albertsons’ earlier lawsuit against it, which claimed that Kroger failed to exercise “best efforts” and to take “any and all actions” to obtain regulatory approval of the companies’ proposed merger deal.
Kroger is now claiming that while it was working to seek regulatory approval and close the merger, Albertsons was engaging in a secret campaign alongside C&S Wholesale Grocers to pursue its own regulatory strategy, which ultimately undermined Kroger's efforts.

The alleged misconduct included incoming Albertsons CEO Susan Morris’ “secret communications with C&S's CEO and others, utilizing personal emails and cell phones to advance Albertsons's strategy.”

Albertsons contends that it was steadfastly committed to completing the merger, stating that “Kroger’s weak claims are a deliberate tactic to distract from its own ongoing executive leadership issues; blatant and recurring failures to carry out its contractual obligations under the merger agreement; and avoid paying the damages it owes to Albertsons.”",https://progressivegrocer.com/images/v/16_x_9_480/files/2024-12/kroger-albertsons_teaser.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 16:04:06.805620

“We know shoppers love to be inspired and discover innovative tech from their favorite content creators,” said Jennie Weber, Best Buy’s chief marketing officer. “We’re excited to launch the Best Buy Creator program and empower creators to turn their passion and authenticity into a shoppable retail experience that’s fun, inspirational and convenient.”

Best Buy had hinted at the launch of this program last month during its quarterly earnings call.

“Influencers and creators will be able to build their own branded digital storefronts on Best Buy’s website, which we expect to drive increased traffic, engagement and sales,” CEO Corie Barry said at the time.

Meanwhile, recent PYMNTS Intelligence research has found that while influencers do live up to their name in convincing shoppers to make purchases, the picture is more complicated.

The report “Generational Pulse: Just How Influential Are Influencers?” found a considerable percentage of consumers make some purchasing decisions based on the recommendations, comments or links provided by influencers.

However, that share falls significantly in terms of regular purchases, with only 1 in 8 consumers reporting that they follow the lead of influencers when it comes to being incentivized to make frequent purchases.",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Buy.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 16:04:18.479617

The auction comes nearly a year after Redbox filed for bankruptcy in June 2024, a downfall accelerated by the pandemic’s shift to streaming and compounded by alleged mismanagement.

According to a court filing released Monday, the sale, scheduled for April 23 in New York, marks the latest chapter in Redbox’s dramatic collapse, which saw the company go from a billion-dollar business to bankruptcy in less than a decade, as reported by FastCompany.

The auction comes nearly a year after Redbox filed for bankruptcy in June 2024, a downfall accelerated by the pandemic’s shift to streaming and compounded by alleged mismanagement. The filing details a fire sale of intellectual property, including Redbox and Crackle trademarks, patents, and rights to hundreds of films and TV shows from Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment’s Screen Media Films subsidiary. Titles up for grabs range from cult classics like Jeepers Creepers to quirky Nicolas Cage starrer Willy’s Wonderland. While exact valuations remain uncertain, earlier filings suggest interest in the film catalogs has topped $100 million.

This comes as Crackle recently started to work again, as first reported by Cord Cutters News.

Notably absent from the sale are Redbox’s iconic red kiosks, once numbering 27,000 outside stores like CVS and Albertsons. Many have already been junked or sold for parts on eBay after retailers, fed up with unpaid fees and power bills—like Albertsons’ $184,000 monthly tab—won court approval to dispose of them. The filing doesn’t specify why the remaining machines aren’t included, but their fate seems sealed.

Redbox’s demise is a tale of missed opportunities and corporate chaos. At its peak in 2018, the company raked in over $1 billion, banking on a streaming pivot that never materialized. The pandemic slashed its revenue to $250 million by 2021, and a 2022 acquisition by Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment for $375 million—laden with $325 million in debt—only deepened the hole. The parent company’s rosy forecasts of a DVD rental rebound proved “wildly unrealistic,” per the bankruptcy trustee, who last month sued former executives and board members, alleging they treated the firm as a “personal piggy bank” through exorbitant fees to the Chicken Soup book publisher.

The lawsuit claims these fees, peaking at $18.4 million annually post-acquisition, drained Redbox even as it couldn’t afford DVDs or employee health insurance. By early 2024, cash was so scarce that technicians couldn’t fuel company vehicles. The trustee aims to claw back these funds, with proceeds—along with auction earnings—likely funneling to primary lender HPS, owed $500 million.

For Redbox, a brand that once symbolized affordable entertainment, April 23 will close the book on a turbulent saga. As streaming giants like Netflix thrive, the auction offers a final chance for its legacy to live on—albeit without those familiar red boxes dotting parking lots nationwide.",https://cordcuttersnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/shutterstock_1369138847-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 18:07:36.213019

Newman will replace Thomas Cowhey, who has held the role since January 2024.

Newman will assume the position on April 21. Cowhey will transition to a strategic advisor role to CVS Health President and CEO David Joyner, effective May 12.

CVS also announced the appointment of Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips as executive vice president and chief medical officer, starting May 19. She replaces Dr. Sreekanth Chaguturu, who was promoted in November to executive vice president and president of Health Care Delivery for CVS Health.

The leadership changes are part of an ongoing executive restructuring led by Joyner, who was named CEO of the company in October 2024 as CVS works to rebound from a challenging financial year.

Despite the shakeup, CVS said it expects to “meet or exceed” its previously issued financial guidance for 2025. In February, the company reported projected cash flow from operations of approximately $6.5 billion for the full year. CVS said total revenue rose 4.2% to $97.7 billion during the fourth quarter.

The company had missed earnings targets for the first three quarters of 2024 and withdrew its annual forecast in October.

“As I continue to build out my leadership team, I am confident that Brian and Amy will help us continue the momentum we have built over the past several months as we execute on our strategy to deliver better health care to the 185 million Americans we are privileged to serve,” Joyner said in a statement. “Their collective and individual experience and expertise are well suited to CVS Health and we welcome them both to our leadership team.”

Joyner also praised Cowhey’s leadership, noting he “stepped up during a challenging year and helped position our enterprise for long-term growth opportunities.”

Newman most recently served as executive vice president and CFO at United Parcel Service. Before that, he spent 26 years in executive roles at PepsiCo.

Compton-Phillips was most recently chief physician executive at healthcare performance improvement company Press Ganey. A board-certified internist, she previously held leadership roles at Providence Health & Services and Kaiser Permanente.

Prior to his March 31 start at The Children’s Place, Szczepanski was CFO at Vince Holding Corp., a global retail company headquartered in New York City.
Like many other specialty retailers, The Children’s Place has evolved its brick-and-mortar approach amid the rise of e-commerce.
The Children’s Place also made two other leadership appointments recently: Kristin Clifford as senior vice president, head of sourcing; and Smeeta Khetarpaul, senior vice president, head of marketing.
Clifford rejoined The Children’s Place from Vineyard Vines, where she most recently served as senior vice president of sourcing.","The Children’s Place is making some changes to its executive leadership team.

The Secaucus-based children’s retailer recently added John Szczepanski as chief financial officer. In his new position, Szczepanski oversees finance, accounting, financial planning & analysis, tax, treasury, procurement, investor relations, internal audit and real estate, the company said.

Prior to his March 31 start at The Children’s Place, Szczepanski was CFO at Vince Holding Corp., a global retail company headquartered in New York City. His background also includes more than 18 years in various roles at luxury fashion brand Ralph Lauren.

Szczepanski succeeds interim CFO and chief accounting officer Laura Lentini, who stepped in after Sheamus Toal left the company in December 2024.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission at the time, The Children’s Place said the decision to part ways was not the result of any disagreement. Toal began in October 2022 as chief financial officer and senior vice president. In August 2023, he also took on the role of chief operating officer.

“Today marks an exciting new chapter for our company as we welcome John to be our CFO,” said Muhammad Umair, who was named interim CEO in May 2024 following the departure of longtime CEO Jane Elfers.

“During this critical time in our planning and implementation of new business strategies, John brings a wealth of finance experience in retail and manufacturing that will help guide us through our company’s future development,” he said. We are delighted to have him join our team as we continue to build strong and efficient business operations and drive a financial strategy that can lay the groundwork for the company’s long-term success.”

Other team changes

The Children’s Place – whose brands include Gymboree, Sugar & Jade and PJ Place – has been busy trying to turn its business around. After warning of liquidity concerns in February 2024, the retailer saw a change in control when Mithaq Capital became its majority shareholder.

As part of a strategy shift, the company has made changes across its leadership teams as it looks to cut costs and pay down debt.

Like many other specialty retailers, The Children’s Place has evolved its brick-and-mortar approach amid the rise of e-commerce. As part of a shift from the traditional store concept into a digital-first business, it permanently closed more than 700 locations in the past decade. The company’s footprint now stands at roughly 500 stores in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico.

The Children’s Place also made two other leadership appointments recently: Kristin Clifford as senior vice president, head of sourcing; and Smeeta Khetarpaul, senior vice president, head of marketing.

Both report to Claudia Lima-Guinehut, brand president of The Children’s Place.

Clifford rejoined The Children’s Place from Vineyard Vines, where she most recently served as senior vice president of sourcing. Before that, she was vice president of global sourcing at The Children’s Place until 2020.

The overall powersports industry average ILE score remained the same over the last year, both with ILE scores of 44.
There are two different key areas of improvement for powersports dealers, depending on their current performance levels.","Polaris Inc.’s Indian Motorcycle dealerships ranked highest in the 2025 Pied Piper PSI Internet Lead Effectiveness (ILE) Powersports Industry Study, measuring dealer response to internet sales leads coming through dealership websites. Following Indian were Harley-Davidson, BMW, and BRP’s Can-Am Off-Road dealers.

Pied Piper submitted customer inquiries through 2,523 powersports dealership websites representing 27 brands. Each inquiry asked a specific question about a vehicle in inventory and included a new customer name, email address and local telephone number. Pied Piper then evaluated the speed and quality of dealership responses by email, telephone, text message and chat over the next 24 hours. Each brand’s overall ILE Score is a combined average of their individual dealer ILE performances. ILE evaluations consist of over 20 differently weighted measurements, based upon best practices that are mathematically most likely to generate sales, combining into an overall ILE score ranging from 0 to 100.

Indian Ranked Highest for 3rd Consecutive Year: What Sets It Apart?

2025 marks the third year in a row the Indian brand achieved the top score in the annual ILE powersports industry study. The Indian brand improved its average score by one point for 2025, reaching an average ILE score of 56.

Answering customers’ questions more often: Indian dealers this year answered their customers’ questions by email/text 67% of the time on average, improving six points over last year and 17 points higher than the 2025 industry average.

Higher rate of phone response: Compared to the industry overall, Indian dealers maintain an eight-point lead in the rate of phone response to customer inquiries, occurring 58% of the time on average.

“Did both” for more inquiries: Indian dealers “did both” (answering an inquiry by email/text and also phoning, improving the odds of a response reaching the customer) 46% of the time on average, eight points higher than last year and 20 points higher than the industry average.

“The Indian motorcycle brand has maintained industry leading web-response behaviors during a challenging time in the powersports industry,” said Cameron O’Hagan, Pied Piper’s vice president of metrics and analytics. “Two years ago, when market conditions were more favorable, dealers could easily afford to expand their staff and refine operations. Today, however, tougher conditions have many dealers battling just to keep the lights on.”

How Did the Industry Perform Over the Past Year?

The overall powersports industry average ILE score remained the same over the last year, both with ILE scores of 44. Powersports dealers in 2025 improved phone behaviors and rate of response, but also experienced declines in other important areas, resulting in no overall change in total ILE Score

Behaviors That Improved

Powersports dealers in 2025 performed better in phone and text response, and the rate of dealers failing to respond occurred less often:

More phone response: Dealers this year were five points more likely to respond to online customer inquiries by phone, occurring 50% of the time on average.

Better use of texting: Customers were more likely to receive a text response answering their question, increasing five points to an overall rate this year of 30%.

Fewer failures to respond: Dealers failed to respond to online inquiries less often this year, occurring only 9% of the time on average.

Behaviors in Decline

There were two notable declines in behavior that held back overall industry score improvement:

Fewer emails answering questions: Dealers answered customers’ questions by email 27% of the time on average in 2025, down from 35% last year.

Not offering appointments as often: Only 10% of customers in 2025 received a response that included an offer to set up an appointment, in contrast to last year where it occurred 13% of the time on average.

What is the ’80/40 Rule’ and How Does it Relate to the Powersports Industry?

In the 2025 powersports industry study, 13% of all dealerships measured scored above 80 (providing quick and thorough personal responses), while 42% of dealerships scored below 40 (failing to personally respond to website customers). The “over 80” and “under 40” segments each shrank by 1% since last year, with a larger pool of dealers performing in the space between both categories.

“The effort to improve from the under 40 bucket into the over 80 is worth it,” said O’Hagan. “Historically, we have found that dealers who improve their ILE performance from scoring under 40 to scoring over 80 on average sell 50% more units from the same quantity of website customer leads.”

What is the Powersports Industry’s Greatest Opportunity for Improvement?

There are two different key areas of improvement for powersports dealers, depending on their current performance levels. One in four powersports dealerships currently fail to personally respond to website customer inquiries. For this group of dealers, the sole focus should be a commitment to always personally respond to online customers at least once each day.

“Just as you wouldn’t lock up at the end of the day with a physical customer still wandering around the showroom, don’t leave your digital customers hanging overnight in your digital showroom waiting for your reply,” said O’Hagan.

For the rest of the dealers, the step with the greatest opportunity is to embrace a reliable multi-channel communication strategy, rather than responding to customers using only email, only phone or only text. In this year’s study, powersports dealers failed to use multiple paths 74% of time, leaving many of their responses susceptible to communication breakdowns beyond the dealer’s control.

“Emails can land in spam/junk and be missed, customers often ignore calls from an unknown number and don’t listen to voicemail, and even texts can be lost or ignored among the large volume of messages many people receive per day,” said O’Hagan. “A consistent multi-pronged response to every customer is critical since you never know in advance which communication method will be most effective at reaching a specific customer. Then, once contact is established, adopt the successful method for future interactions with the customer.”

2025 Brand Performance Compared

Response to customer web inquiries within a 24-hour period in 2025 had large variations by brand, as shown by these examples:

“Answered Question”: How often did the brand’s dealerships email or text an answer to a website customer’s question?

More than 65% of the time on average: BMW, Moto Guzzi, Indian, Ducati

Less than 35% of the time on average: Roxor, Kymco, Tracker (Bass Pro Shops)

“Phoned Customer”: How often did the brand’s dealerships respond by phone to a website customer’s inquiry?

More than 50% of the time on average: Harley-Davidson, Indian, Honda, Can-Am

Less than 30% of the time on average: Arctic Cat, Roxor, Moto Guzzi, Cub Cadet

“Offered an Appointment”: How often did the brand’s dealerships offer to set an appointment for specific date/time?

More than 15% of the time on average: Can-Am, Indian, Polaris, Segway

Less than 1% of the time on average: John Deere, Tracker (Bass Pro Shops), Cub Cadet

“Did at Least One”: How often did the brand’s dealerships email or text an answer to a website customer’s question and/or respond by phone?

More than 80% of the time on average: BMW, KTM, Moto Guzzi, Harley-Davidson

Less than 50% of the time on average: Roxor, Cub Cadet

“Did Both”: How often did the brand’s dealerships email or text an answer to a website customer’s question and also phone the customer?

More than 30% of the time on average: Indian, Harley-Davidson, Triumph

Less than 10% of the time on average: Kymco, Tracker (Bass Pro Shops), Cub Cadet

Why Was This Study Conducted?

“Customers today visit dealer websites first, and how dealers respond to those customers drives today’s sales success,” said O’Hagan. “The trouble is that website customers can be invisible in day-to-day operations which makes them too easy to overlook.”

For more than 15 years, Pied Piper has independently published annual industry studies that rank the omnichannel performance of brands and dealer groups. These studies track how industry performance changes over time and let clients understand how their own performance compares.

Pied Piper clients order ongoing Prospect Satisfaction Index (PSI) measurement and reporting — internet, telephone or in-person — for their dealerships as tools to improve and maintain omnichannel sales and service effectiveness.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DTC and Wholesale channels is pegged at $794 million and $749 million, respectively, for the fiscal first quarter.

In the Americas, revenues increased 6% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic basis, backed

by double-digit growth in both DTC and wholesale channels. Within the Americas, revenues in the United States rose 8% on an organic basis, fueled by the high single-digit increase in both channels. In Mexico, revenues were up 6% on higher traffic in the stores and e-commerce growth. In Europe, revenues fell 5% on a reported basis but rose 3% on an organic basis.

In Asia, revenues were up 7% on a reported basis and 10% on an organic basis. DTC revenues rose 14%, driven by double-digit growth in the major markets such as Japan, Korea and Turkey. The company’s business in South Asia, the Middle-East and Africa, including India, grew double-digits on better in-store retail experiences, improved conversion rates and growth in wholesale units. Its business in China was flat year over year and management anticipates modest expectations in the current fiscal year as progress to reset this market is ongoing.

LEVI’s Margins & Expenses

The gross profit increased 8.9% year over year to $947.6 million. The gross margin expanded 330 basis points (bps) to 62.1% in the fiscal first quarter. This growth was primarily buoyed by lower product costs, including savings from Project Fuel initiatives, a favorable channel mix and brand mix.

Operating margin was 12.5%, up from 0.04% in the year-ago period. Adjusted EBIT margin jumped 400 bps to 13.4% compared with 9.4% in the last year, driven by gross margin expansion.

Adjusted SG&A edged up 1.7% to $744 million, reflecting increased distribution expenses. However, as a percentage of revenues, adjusted SG&A leveraged 70 bps to 48.7%.

Levi’s Other Financial Snapshots

Levi’s ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $574.4 million and total liquidity of $1.4 billion. As of March 2, 2025, long-term debt and total shareholders’ equity were $987.4 million and $2.03 billion, respectively. Total inventories jumped 7% on a dollar basis.

In first-quarter fiscal 2025, net cash generated from operating activities was $52.5 million and adjusted free cash flow was $14.1 million.

In the fiscal first quarter, the company returned nearly $81 million to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, up 12% year over year. This included dividends of $51 million, representing a dividend of 13 cents per share and approximately $30 million in share repurchases, retiring 1.6 million shares. At the quarter end, LEVI had $560 million remaining in its existing share repurchase authorization, with no expiration date.

Management has announced a cash dividend of 13 cents per share, totaling roughly $51 million. This is payable on May 9 to its shareholders of record of Class A common stock and Class B common stock as of April 24, 2025.

What to Expect From LEVI in FY25?

The outlook for fiscal 2025 is based on the continuing operations, with the Dockers business now reported as discontinued operations. We note that the company’s guidance for the current fiscal year is unchanged except to reflect the Dockers business in discontinued operations. Management is prudent with respect to the global wholesale and anticipates the channel to be flat in fiscal 2025 on an organic basis. International growth is also a significant opportunity for the company.

LEVI’s fiscal second-quarter guidance remains consistent with its internal plan. The fiscal second quarter is seasonally the company’s lowest quarter for revenues and margins in the year. The tariff impact is likely to have a minimal impact on the margin structure in the impending quarter. For the fiscal second quarter, it projects organic net revenue growth from continued operations of 3.5-4.5%, excluding nearly 2 points of foreign exchange headwinds and 1.5 points related to the exit of Denizen and footwear business.

Gross margin is expected to be up between 80 bps and 100 bps, and adjusted EBIT margin is likely to be in the band of 5.5-6%. Adjusted EPS is envisioned to be 11-13 cents, reflecting about 3 cents of headwind from foreign exchange and a higher tax rate year over year.

Considering such expectation, the company’s profitability assumptions will be significantly higher, approximately 20% compared with the first half of fiscal 2024. For fiscal 2025, reported net revenues are still expected to decline 1-2%, while organic net revenues are anticipated to grow between 3.5% and 4.5%. Gross margin is now predicted to expand 100 bps to 61.6%. Adjusted EBIT margin is now anticipated to expand to 11.4-11.6%, up from 10.9-11.1% guided earlier. This shows an expansion of 70-90 bps from a 10% base. It expects a tax rate of about 23%. Adjusted earnings per share are forecasted in the band of $1.20 to $1.25, incorporating an estimated 20-cent impact of foreign exchange and a higher tax rate.

Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 14.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 30.4%.

Now in its sixth year and fifth growing season, the company, founded by Purdue graduate Kyle Albertson, uses drones to provide crop health mapping, pesticide spraying, and insect control, doubling its coverage each year. With a goal of managing 10,000 acres in the upcoming season, Albertson Drone Service highlights the growing role of Drone Technology in modern farming.

Drone Capabilities and Specs

Albertson Drone Service’s drones can spray 30 to 40 acres per hour, a significant improvement over traditional methods. While specific drone models weren’t disclosed in the Inside Indiana Business report, agricultural drones in this category, such as the DJI Agras T40, typically offer a flight time of 10-15 minutes per battery cycle when fully loaded, a range of 1.2 miles (line-of-sight), and a payload capacity of 88 lbs (40 liters) for liquid pesticides.

These drones use GPS and automated flight paths to ensure precision, avoiding obstacles like trees and power lines—challenges Albertson noted as non-issues for his operations. For exact specs on the Agras T40, refer to DJI’s official product page. Albertson’s ability to cover hard-to-reach field edges adds roughly 20 acres per field that traditional equipment might miss, enhancing overall yield potential.

Market Context and Competition

The agricultural drone market is expanding rapidly, driven by the need for precision farming. Companies like DroneDeploy and PrecisionHawk offer similar services, focusing on data analytics for crop health, while XAG and Yamaha provide competing spraying drones. Albertson Drone Service stands out in Indiana as the first licensed operator, giving it a regional edge. However, larger players with broader service portfolios and established client bases pose a challenge. The global agricultural drone market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 31.4% from 2023 to 2030, per industry reports, signaling fierce competition as more entrants adopt drone technology.

Regulatory Compliance

Operating agricultural drones for spraying requires strict adherence to FAA regulations. Albertson spent time in the FAA and 4-H programs before launching his business, ensuring compliance with Part 137 certification for aerial application and Part 107 for commercial drone operations. These certifications mandate pilot licensing, equipment registration, and adherence to airspace restrictions. Indiana’s regulatory environment supports such innovation, but operators must also comply with state pesticide application laws, which Albertson’s licensing covers.

Infrastructure Impact

Drones reduce the need for heavy machinery in fields, minimizing soil compaction—a common issue with traditional tractors like the John Deere model shown in the Inside Indiana Business feature. This allows for more sustainable farming practices, especially in Benton County’s corn and soybean fields. However, drone operations require charging stations, battery management, and pesticide refilling infrastructure, which Albertson likely manages from a mobile base. Scaling to 10,000 acres will demand robust logistics, including additional drones and trained pilots, which the company plans to address by hiring two Purdue interns this summer.

Industry Implications

Albertson Drone Service’s success underscores the potential of drones to address labor shortages and rising costs in agriculture. By covering 30-40 acres per hour, drones offer a faster, more precise alternative to manual spraying, reducing pesticide waste and environmental impact. This efficiency is critical as farmers face pressure to increase yields amid climate challenges. The company’s growth also highlights the role of ag-tech Education—Albertson’s Purdue background gave him a head start, and his internship program could inspire a new generation of ag-tech innovators.

Future Outlook

Looking ahead, Albertson Drone Service aims to double its 2024 coverage to 10,000 acres, a goal that will test its operational capacity. Advances in drone technology, such as longer flight times and higher payloads, could further boost efficiency. However, regulatory hurdles, like potential changes to FAA rules or pesticide restrictions, may pose challenges. As the ag-tech sector evolves, Albertson’s focus on local expertise and sustainable practices positions it well to lead in Indiana’s farming landscape, potentially setting a model for other regions to follow.

“If we’re putting tariffs everywhere, it is going to go up.” Stepping into Economy Candy feels like a time warp.
But it was already feeling the weight of surges in prices of cocoa and other ingredients before tariffs were layered on.","NEW YORK — Economy Candy’s shelves brim with sweets from around the world – gummies from Germany, lollipops from Spain, chocolates from Japan and a panoply of candies from across the U.S.

Standing amid it all, columns of bright jellybeans to his left and exotic Kit Kats to his right, owner Mitchell Cohen is quick with his assessment of how many of this shop’s 2,000-plus items are affected by the historic round of tariffs announced by President Donald Trump.

“I think all of them,” Cohen says at his store on New York's Lower East Side.

Few corners of the American economy are untouched, directly or indirectly, by the sweeping tariffs being imposed by Trump. Even a little store like Economy Candy.

Cohen had just begun to feel a barrage of inflation-driven price increases from suppliers ease when the tariff threats arrived. For a business with a name like Economy Candy, he wants to remain affordable but fears how high some prices may have to climb in the coming months.

“I think it’s gonna be another round of this hyperinflation on some items,” says 39-year-old Cohen. “If we’re putting tariffs everywhere, it is going to go up.”

Stepping into Economy Candy feels like a time warp. Its name is emblazoned on a sign in a vintage, blaring red script, and crossing below its green-and-white striped awning, past the bins of Smarties, butterscotches and Lemonheads in the front window, an indecipherable sweetness fills the air, oldies music sounds overhead and customers mill around stacks of candy bars they forgot still existed.

It represents just a blip in the country’s $54 billion candy industry. But it was already feeling the weight of surges in prices of cocoa and other ingredients before tariffs were layered on.

Candy and gum prices are up about 34% from five years ago and 89% from 2005, according to Consumer Price Index data. Price, according to the National Confectioners Association, has become the top factor in consumers’ candy purchase decisions, outweighing a buyer's mood.

About a third of Economy Candy’s products are imported, crowded on shelves and tables near the store’s rear. There aren’t just “more German Haribo varieties than the Haribo store in Germany,” as Cohen claims, but gummies the brand makes in France, Austria and Britain.

They have every Milka bar they can find in Switzerland, every type of Leone hard candies that Italy churns out and as many exotic Kit Kats from Japan as they can fit.

On products like these, the tariffs’ toll is obvious.

Pistachio Snickers bars are from India, now subject to 26% tariffs, while passion fruit mousse Snickers are from Portugal, now under the 20% European Union levies.

But even an American-made Snickers isn’t immune.

While the bars may roll off conveyors in Texas, they rely on ingredients from around the globe. Sourcemap, which tracks supply chains, says Snickers bars include chocolate from Guyana and sugar from Brazil and are wrapped in packaging from Canada. All are now subjected to varying levels of tariffs.

“There’s a lot of ingredients in there that have to come from other countries,” says Andreas Waldkirch, an economics professor at Colby College who teaches a class on international trade. “Unless you’re talking about something very simple from your local farmers market, almost every product relies on ingredients from elsewhere. Those indirect costs are really what’s going to drive up prices.”

The story repeats with American candies across the store – the boxes of Nerds and bags of Sugar Babies and rolls of Smarties are all inextricably tied to the global supply chain.

A table teeming with those domestic delicacies takes center stage near Economy Candy’s entrance. Cohen took over the store from his parents, who took it over from their parents before. He got his first haircut in the store. He was behind the register as a child. He took his wife by on their first date.

As a kid, everything on the store’s centerpiece table of American treats cost 59 cents. By 2020, the price was $1.29, but customers who bought a whole box paid a discounted rate of $1 per piece.

Now, Cohen can’t even get them wholesale at that price.

Today, he sells the items on the table for $1.59. Cohen calls the selection a “loss leader” but thinks it's important to showcase his store's affordability. Once the tariffs are fully implemented, he’s not sure he’ll be able to put off price increases.

“When your margins are coming down and your dollar doesn’t go as far at the end of the day, you really start to feel it,” he says. “But I don’t want anyone to come into Economy Candy and not think that it’s economical.”

The biggest-ticket implications of the tariff blitz understandably gain the most attention – the thousands of dollars a car’s price tag may grow, the tens of thousands that disappear from a retirement account in a single day. But here among the root beer barrels and licorice strands, you're reminded that small-dollar items are affected too, and so are the families selling them.

At its birth, the business Cohen’s grandfather started focused on shoe and hat repairs. But in the wake of the Great Depression, when few in a neighborhood of crowded tenements had money for such fixes, the business pivoted.

Candy, once relegated to a cart out front, took over the store.

In the 88 years since, business hasn't always been Chuckles and Zagnuts. The Sept. 11 attacks kept tourists away and had sales sagging and the pandemic closed the store and forced it to pivot to online sales.

If tariffs upend things, Cohen isn’t sure how he might adapt again. He sells products that aren’t made in America and he sells American products made with ingredients from across the globe. He had just been making headway on beginning international sales, but the web of tariff rules may make it impossible.

McDonald’s says its lemonade became a fan-favorite after it was tested in select local markets beginning in March 2023.

“What is the difference between premium lemonade and regular lemonade?” wrote the original poster, along with an image of instructions on how to serve the new drink.

“I think the premium one has pulp and is trying to be ‘freshly squeezed,’” replied one Reddit user.

“About seven letters and a space,” wrote another.

It should be noted that McDonald’s hasn’t completely broken up with Minute Maid, as it still has the brand’s orange juice on its menu.

Travis Knight is the son of Phil Knight, the man who revolutionized the sportswear industry through Nike. Travis is carving out his own legacy as the President and CEO of Laika the award-winning stop-motion animation studio.

Did Phil Knight Found Laika?

No, Phil Knight did not found Laika. However, he played a significant role in the company’s establishment. In 1998, Phil Knight and Travis Knight (then a 25-year-old animator) helped finance Laika as it was born out of a predecessor company, Will Vinton Studios. Travis Knight eventually took the reins at Laika and led it to international acclaim, particularly with films like Coraline, ParaNorman, and Kubo and the Two Strings.

Who Owns Laika?

Laika is owned by the Knight family, with Phil Knight being the primary shareholder. However, Travis Knight holds a prominent role in the company as its CEO and President, making strategic decisions and overseeing the creative direction of the studio. The family’s involvement in Laika reflects their commitment to supporting the creative arts and expanding their influence beyond the world of sports.

Is Laika Owned by Nike?

Despite the Knight family’s connection to Nike, Laika is not owned by Nike. While Phil Knight's wealth from Nike helped fund Laika’s early stages, the two companies operate independently. Laika’s focus is on creating exceptional stop-motion animated films, a world apart from the sportswear industry that Nike dominates. The collaboration between the two entities comes through the Knight family’s influence, but they remain separate, with Laika making its mark in Hollywood.

Laika’s Creative and Financial Success

Under Travis Knight’s leadership, Laika has earned a reputation for producing critically acclaimed animated films that push the boundaries of stop-motion animation. The company has enjoyed both financial success and industry recognition, with several of its films earning Academy Award nominations. Laika’s turnover has varied by year, depending on the success of its films, but it remains a well-funded, privately held company supported by the Knight family’s financial backing.

More About Travis Knight

Before becoming CEO of Laika, Travis Knight was an accomplished animator and the lead animator on several of Laika’s early films. His directorial debut, Kubo and the Two Strings (2016), received critical praise and an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Feature. His involvement with Laika has been instrumental in shaping the studio’s distinctive style and creative direction.

Today, Travis Knight continues to build on his father’s legacy, proving that creativity and business acumen can come together to forge a unique path in the entertainment industry.

Conclusion

Travis Knight has undeniably built Laika into the powerhouse it is today, delivering innovative, critically acclaimed films that have redefined stop-motion animation. However, it’s impossible to ignore the fact that his success didn’t come in isolation. The Knight family name alone gave Travis a major leg up, with Phil Knight’s wealth and support providing crucial early-stage backing. While Travis’s creative vision and leadership have certainly driven the studio forward, the financial foundation and network afforded by his father’s legacy undeniably played a role in Laika’s ascent.",https://www.ceotodaymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ceo.png,N,,2025-04-08 14:11:31.236138

Specialty coffee beans might eventually cost consumers 10% to 35% more than before the tariffs, bean buyers predicted.
Since the pandemic, grocery stores have been expanding their lines of lower-priced private-label products.","Grocery shoppers are likely to feel the impact of the Trump administration's sweeping new tariffs before April is over. And the first place they'll feel it is in parts of the store where the inventory has to move fast.

In the produce aisle, food analysts said Thursday, expect small price increases on everyday purchases like bananas from Guatemala and grapes from Peru, countries whose exports to the United States will incur 10% tariffs with the new fees, which went into effect April 5. A separate round of reciprocal tariffs on 57 countries will follow April 9.

The seafood counter may hold even worse surprises. Grocery stores sell a lot of shrimp from Vietnam, which President Donald Trump hit with a 46% reciprocal tariff, and India, with a 26% tariff.

Soon, analysts say, price hikes will arrive for staples like sugar and coffee, which is already priced at a historic high. Specialty coffee beans might eventually cost consumers 10% to 35% more than before the tariffs, bean buyers predicted.

Since the pandemic, grocery stores have been expanding their lines of lower-priced private-label products. Customers loved them as a way to navigate inflation, but tariffs will drive up costs.

""It was a bit of a refuge for consumers,"" said Keith Daniels, a managing partner at investment bank Carl Marks Advisors, who focuses on the food and grocery sectors. ""Now that's not going to be there.""

Still, he and some food executives said that because so much food on shelves in the United States is processed overseas or contains ingredients and packaging from several countries, predicting how tariffs will change food prices is difficult, if not impossible.

Some of the cost of the tariffs is likely to be absorbed and not passed on to consumers, as retailers reevaluate pricing strategies and determine how long the inventory they already have in the country might last.

Still, the opportunity for price gouging or other forms of manipulation are high, said Errol Schweizer, a veteran of the grocery industry who publishes The Checkout Grocery Update, a newsletter.

""Consumers won't know if things are priced correctly or they are getting ripped off,"" he said.

At all levels of the food business, just figuring out the additional paperwork will take time. Walmart requires suppliers to give advance notice of price increases and clear documentation for them. But some businesses have yet to set up systems for recording and paying tariffs.

""It will take a year for all those costs to ripple through, but in 12 months you will absolutely see higher prices across the board,"" said Jeff Dunn, executive chair of Generous Brands and Bolthouse Fresh Foods.

Big food producers like Mondelez and Kraft Heinz are better equipped to absorb the impact of tariffs than smaller companies with relatively thin operating margins are. For those smaller players, staying afloat with the new tariffs will likely involve some fast, creative and strategic cost-cutting.

Last week, Paleovalley, a Colorado company that makes meat sticks and other products, was scrambling to mitigate the potential impact of the tariffs on imported monkfruit puree, an ingredient that is hard to source.

Ethan Frisch is the co-founder and co-CEO of Burlap & Barrel, which imports spices from 30 countries and buys exclusively from small producers. It has a shipment of cinnamon already coming on a ship from Vietnam. The farmers and the shipping company have all been paid. He has no idea if he will have to pay a tariff.

Because of uncertainties like that, he has decided to scale back on other goods the company was planning to introduce later in the year, like an Advent calendar filled with spice samples from around the world tucked into festive packaging manufactured in China.

Yun Hai, a specialty food shop in New York City, buys directly from rice farms, soy sauce breweries and mills in Taiwan, then ships the goods over in bulk, supplying grocery stores and restaurants across the country. The new tariff on those foods, most of which have no local substitute, is 32%.

""We're on the front line because we're the importer,"" said the company's CEO, Lisa Cheng Smith, whose most recent shipment of goods arrived a day before the tariffs were announced. She plans to examine creative ways to reduce other costs by 32% without losing her business.

""We're not going to panic and just raise our prices right away,"" she said.

In the meantime, it might not be a bad idea to stock up, said Sam Silverstein, a reporter for trade publication Grocery Dive.

""It's harder to stockpile avocados than cans of soup,"" he said, ""which is another reason to grab something on the shelf if it's offered at a good price.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/103611920_209568732-aeaaa5cf38364618a_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-04-08 14:11:13.236096

The biotech on Monday appointed Sarbani Chaudhuri as its new chief commercial and medical affairs officer, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Chaudhuri comes to Rocket from Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, where she served at the VP level as head of hematology in the global commercial strategy organization. Throughout her three years there, she helped build out the business that includes multiple myeloma blockbuster Darzalex and rising star CAR-T therapy Carvykti, among others.

Chaudhuri spent nearly 20 years at several other Big Pharmas before joining J&J. At AstraZeneca, she was the global head of the breast cancer business unit and the Enhertu franchise, and in her six years at Pfizer, she held a handful of leadership roles across segments within the oncology and rare disease portfolios. Prior to that, she spent almost a decade on Novartis’ sales and marketing team, culminating in a stint leading the evolution of the U.S. oncology customer model.

In a LinkedIn post last week, Chaudhuri shared several photos to commemorate her “incredible journey at Johnson & Johnson” and to celebrate her colleagues and their shared accomplishments.

“I am incredibly proud of what we achieved together,” she wrote, adding, “At the end of the day, success is about more than just the science—it’s about the people who make innovation possible. I will carry forward the experiences, leadership lessons, and deep sense of purpose that I have gained here as I step into my next chapter.”

Chaudhuri is joining Rocket as it inches closer to a potential U.S. approval for Kresladi, a gene therapy to treat severe leukocyte adhesion deficiency-I.

Rocket initially submitted the therapeutic to the FDA for review in late 2023, with a decision expected the following spring. The agency pushed back that deadline to June 2024, around which time it sent a complete response letter (CRL) asking for additional information about Kresladi’s manufacturing.

In its full-year earnings release in February, Rocket confirmed that the FDA is now reviewing that supplemental info and that the company is expecting to be able to submit a full biologics license application (BLA) for Kresladi to resolve the CRL this year.

Meanwhile, Rocket is also advancing its RP-L102, aimed at treating the rare genetic disorder Fanconi anemia. Rocket said in the February release that the gene therapy is currently under review in Europe and that it has initiated a rolling BLA with the FDA for RP-L102, with the final submission slated for sometime this year.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/GettyImages-1480578223.jpg?VersionId=sWIwXcl2tbc39NpNszKrzqYUYPj3vwpa,N,,2025-04-08 16:04:32.568179

The grocery chain hasn’t specified which locations are likely to be affected, but the closure process could reportedly extend over several years.
Kroger With nearly 2,800 stores nationwide, Kroger is pretty much a grocery powerhouse, but like other grocery chains on this list, Kroger has also begun closing underperforming locations.
The grocery store confirmed that it would close two of its stores located in California and Virginia.
The announcement was met with an outpouring of community support, demonstrating how these local grocery stores often become important fixtures in their communities.","As economic pressures mount and consumer habits evolve in 2025, the American grocery scene is undergoing quite a transformation. From retail giants to regional favorites, supermarket chains across the country are strategically reassessing their physical footprints, closing underperforming locations while aggressively pursuing growth in promising markets.

This shifting terrain reflects not just financial challenges, but deeper changes in how Americans shop for food in an increasingly digital marketplace. To that effect, here’s an in-depth look at nine major grocery retailers shutting down locations, the reasoning behind these decisions, and what these changes mean for communities nationwide.

Walmart

Walmart might seem untouchable with approximately 4,600 stores across the United States, but even the retail giant is feeling the economic pressure. The multinational corporation that’s been ranked as the world’s largest company in terms of consolidated revenue is closing several stores all through 2025, with locations in California, Georgia, and Ohio already shutting their doors.

The good news is that this isn’t a sign of Walmart’s demise. The retailer has ambitious plans to build or convert more than 150 stores over the next five years while remodeling many existing locations. Still, if you’re a regular at certain Walmart locations, you might want to check if your local store is on the chopping block.

Albertsons

Albertsons has been through a rollercoaster ride recently. After announcing a $24.6 billion merger with Kroger in 2022, the deal was ultimately blocked in court over concerns about market domination. The chain is now having to face the consequences alone.

In an earnings call in January 2025, Albertsons’ leadership revealed plans to close numerous stores as part of a streamlining effort, noting that their portfolio was “outsized” in certain areas. The grocery chain hasn’t specified which locations are likely to be affected, but the closure process could reportedly extend over several years.

The company is also looking to open stores in other areas as part of its restructuring strategy, signaling a strategic shift rather than a retreat.

Kroger

With nearly 2,800 stores nationwide, Kroger is pretty much a grocery powerhouse, but like other grocery chains on this list, Kroger has also begun closing underperforming locations. Stores in Nashville, Tennessee, and The Woodlands, Texas, for example, are shutting down due to redevelopment projects. The retail company’s 800 Monroe Street location in Nashville will temporarily close in May 2025 for a $22 million remodel.

In late January, Kroger announced the closure of its Belle Meade Plaza store in Nashville due to redevelopment plans in the area. Additionally, Kroger’s Sterling Ridge location in The Woodlands, Texas, will cease operations on May 6, 2025. The company cited changing shopping habits and competition as the primary reasons for this closure and announced that staff at affected stores will be reassigned to other locations.

Winn-Dixie

The beloved Southeastern chain Winn-Dixie has undergone significant changes since its 2023 acquisition by Aldi. Initially, Aldi focused on consolidating operations, announcing closures of four Alabama stores (two in Mobile, one in Phenix City, and one in Vestavia Hills) and a Georgia location. They also revealed plans to convert approximately 220 Winn-Dixie and Harvey’s Supermarket stores to the Aldi format by 2027.

However, a pivotal shift occurred in February 2025: A private investor group led by CEO Anthony Hucker acquired 170 Winn-Dixie and Harveys stores back from Aldi. This move ensured the survival of the Winn-Dixie brand in five key states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi). Southeastern Grocers now plans to modernize these remaining stores and expand their offerings.

Safeway

Safeway is experiencing a particularly tough year, with multiple locations set to close in California and Maryland due to safety concerns and financial pressures. In February, the chain shuttered its Webster Street store in San Francisco’s Fillmore District after 40 years, citing “ongoing concerns about associate and customer safety as well as persistent issues with theft”. Despite reporting strong sales in recent quarters, Safeway’s decision reflects broader challenges facing urban grocery retailers.

More store closures are on the way, including the Vallejo store on Admiral Callaghan Lane in the Bay Area, which is scheduled to close in April. The company is also closing its Appian 80 location in Pinole after serving the community for over five decades. This follows a failed redevelopment plan and expired entitlements under new property owners.

Shaw’s

Shaw’s, which operates 125 stores across the region, recently announced the closure of two locations in 2025. Stores in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and Concord, New Hampshire, will also be shutting their doors, though exact closing dates haven’t been specified.

“Like all retailers, we’re constantly evaluating the performance of our stores,” a Shaw’s spokesperson said in a statement. “Closing a location is always a tough decision, but we’re focused on continuing to provide the products and services our customers value most”. Employees from these locations will be reassigned to nearby stores, but it’s a concerning sign for the regional supermarket chain.

The company stated these decisions were based on underperformance but reassured customers that nearby locations would remain operational.

Amazon Fresh

Despite Amazon’s seemingly unlimited resources and market dominance, its brick-and-mortar grocery concept, Amazon Fresh, is struggling to find its footing. The grocery store confirmed that it would close two of its stores located in California and Virginia.

These stores had only been operating for a couple of years before closure, raising questions about whether Amazon Fresh’s “frictionless” technology, which allows customers to simply walk out without scanning items, is actually appealing to shoppers. Some have already begun referring to these locations as “zombie stores”. While Amazon insists it remains committed to the Fresh concept, these closures suggest the e-commerce giant is still trying to figure out the right formula for physical grocery retail.

What is interesting to note is that while it is scaling back in the U.S., Amazon Fresh has expanded aggressively in India, reaching 170+ cities with 50% year-over-year growth.

Piggly Wiggly

Despite having perhaps the most charming name in the grocery business, Piggly Wiggly isn’t immune to 2025’s challenging retail environment. The iconic Southern chain is closing several stores this year due to lease expirations and declining profitability.

In March, a beloved Piggly Wiggly in Columbia, South Carolina, known as “The Social Pig,” announced it would be closing after 50 years of operation. Store operator Darrell Miller explained in a Facebook post that their lease had expired, and they were unable to negotiate terms that would allow the store to continue operating as a Piggly Wiggly. The announcement was met with an outpouring of community support, demonstrating how these local grocery stores often become important fixtures in their communities.

Dollar General

While primarily a discount retailer, Dollar General sells enough grocery items to make this list, and the chain is making some dramatic moves in 2025. In a Q4 2024 investor call, Dollar General announced it had conducted a “store portfolio optimization review” (corporate speak for checking which stores aren’t profitable enough) and would be closing 96 locations by early 2026.

The company is also converting six of its pOpshelf stores to Dollar General outlets and closing additional pOpshelf locations. For many communities, especially in rural areas, Dollar General provides essential access to groceries and household items at affordable prices, making these closures potentially impactful for local residents.

However, since the chain plans to open between 575–600 new locations in 2025, resulting in a net gain of 600 stores, this news shouldn’t be too concerning.",https://geekspin.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-exterior-of-a-Walmart-store.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 13:09:29.085716

In addition to the CFO shakeup, CVS announced that Amy Compton-Phillips, M.D., will join the company as executive vice president and chief medical officer.
Joyner became CEO of CVS Health in mid-October following the departure of Karen Lynch.
Former UnitedHealthcare CEO Steve Nelson was named as president of Aetna, while Mike Pykosz, who previously led Oak Street Health, departed CVS.
“Their collective and individual experience and expertise are well-suited to CVS Health and we welcome them both to our leadership team.”","CVS Health Chief Financial Officer Tom Cowhey will depart the role, in yet another leadership shuffle at the company.

The healthcare giant is seeking to right the ship after a series of financial challenges, particularly at its Aetna health plan division. Cowhey will vacate the CFO chair as of May 12, and will shift to serving as a strategic adviser to CVS CEO David Joyner, according to an announcement from the company.

Brian Newman, who most recently served as the chief financial officer for the United Parcel Service, has been tapped as executive vice president and CFO-designate, which will take effect April 21. Before his five years at UPS, where he played a key role in steering the company through the COVID-19 pandemic, Newman spent 26 years in financial leadership roles at PepsiCo.

Joyner said in a statement that he and the company ""wish [Cowhey] all the best in the future.”

""I am personally grateful for the leadership Tom has shown in his time at CVS Health, and before that, Aetna,"" Joyner said. ""He stepped up during a challenging year, and helped position our enterprise for long-term growth opportunities.""

In addition to the CFO shakeup, CVS announced that Amy Compton-Phillips, M.D., will join the company as executive vice president and chief medical officer. Compton-Phillips will step into the CMO role on May 19, and was most recently Press Ganey's chief physician executive.

Compton-Phillips also held clinical leadership positions at Providence and Kaiser Permanente, according to the announcement.

Joyner became CEO of CVS Health in mid-October following the departure of Karen Lynch. Since then, the company has made a number of leadership shifts as Joyner builds out his team.

CVS Health, the heavily diversified health care company whose CEO David Joyner is leading a highly publicized $2 billion cost-cutting effort, has hired former United Parcel Service CFO Brian Newman as the company’s new finance chief and executive vice president.

Newman replaces Tom Cowhey, who was appointed full-time CFO in early 2024 after serving as interim CFO since October 2023. Newman takes over on April 21, and Cowhey will transition to an executive advisory role to Joyner on May 12.

CVS is also dealing with activist investor Glenview Capital, which acquired a 1% stake in CVS — worth about $700 million — in late September 2024. In mid-November, CVS announced the appointment of four new board members from Glenview, including the firm’s CEO, Larry Robbins. Glenview’s push came amid concerns over CVS’s performance and strategic direction.

Glenview’s impact was felt almost immediately at CVS. Its pressure led to the departure of former CEO Karen Lynch shortly after Glenview came on board and played a major role in the hiring of Joyner as CEO.

Newman’s hire likely stems from his experience steering UPS through the COVID-19 pandemic, a major union negotiation and the implementation of the company’s “1+2 strategy,” which aimed to grow revenue, cut costs and improve margins while navigating significant internal and external change. His background in managing large-scale logistics operations is also notable, as CVS Health aims to expand its health care delivery offerings while trimming expenses simultaneously.

Kearney Global Luxury Industry Outlook Reveals Key Trends Shaping the Future of the Market

The 21-page report, “Why stability is the new growth,” includes a detailed look at how brands have evolved over the past 30 years to meet changing consumer demands. In this post-pandemic period, brands are approaching growth much differently than they did in the 1990s and 2000s — an era of mass consumerism where the focus was on a back-end infrastructure capable of pushing out as much product as possible.

The researchers said brands are taking a hybrid model approach where they leverage wholesale for stability, direct-to-consumer for customer engagement and use marketplaces for supplemental reach, which reflects a shift toward a more methodical and resilient approach.

The report’s authors found that while 57 percent of brands surveyed are investing in retail relationships, “only 34 percent plan to enter new geographic markets. Growth strategies emphasize customer loyalty and sales diversification over pure optimization.…Key drivers include geographic and product expansion and omnichannel investments.” Meanwhile, the research showed that operational improvements (such as new warehouses or production facilities) “are a lower priority, reflecting a shift toward customer-facing growth rather than back-end infrastructure development.”

The report’s authors said wholesale continues to play a crucial role in stabilizing markets, shifting from a growth driver to a tool for optimizing distribution and controlling costs. Brands are prioritizing controlled growth, predictable pricing and stronger retail partnerships over rapid scaling via marketplaces or digital transformation.

In a cautious economic landscape, efficiency and relationship-focused strategies are taking precedence over risky expansion. Supply chain resilience remains a priority, emphasizing supplier collaboration, demand forecasting and contingency planning rather than structural changes like nearshoring. Meanwhile, B2B e-commerce platforms present untapped potential for deeper operational automation and integration.

Chris Akrimi, general manager for B2B at NuOrder said the new priority for many brands “is achieving sustainable growth while maintaining a strong focus on financial performance. Strategic, measured expansion is now a key consideration for both existing and new clients, a trend we see consistently across our portfolio.”

Akrimi said brands are doubling down on strengthening wholesale and retail relationships and optimizing distribution while expanding their networks, but they’re doing it with a more calculated approach. “They are seeking flexibility in pricing, contract terms and inventory commitments to navigate ongoing economic uncertainties that unfold daily,” he explained. “Rather than chasing broad distribution, brands are prioritizing ‘quality over quantity,’ choosing retail partners that offer long-term, sustainable growth. They are aligning with retailers that invest in brand storytelling, focus on sell-through and protect brand image, ensuring a balanced and profitable partnership.”

The report also looked at how AI can be leveraged by brands to increase operational efficiency and increase personalization. But the authors of the report said brands have been slow to implement the technology. The report said the current evolution of B2B e-commerce “will not reach its full potential without deeper investments in digital transformation and AI-driven efficiencies.”

Andrea Luna, client success team lead at NuOrder, said despite the clear value of B2B e-commerce platforms, many brands struggle, not due to technical limitations, but because they haven’t fully embraced a digital-first mindset. The real challenges lie in operational inertia, fragmented adoption and underutilization of existing tools. Too often, digital platforms are treated as supplemental rather than transformational, leading to missed automation opportunities and inconsistent buyer experiences.”

Luna said success requires more than just onboarding users; “it means equipping teams to leverage the platform’s full capabilities — building campaigns, creating custom lists and working seamlessly across devices. Brands that lead in digital transformation integrate intelligent, automated workflows that drive adoption and enhance efficiency at every stage.”

How can retailers stay competitive while ensuring they meet these expectations and stay competitive? Global technology leader in supply chain and omnichannel commerce Manhattan Associates recently launched its 2025 Unified Commerce Benchmark for Specialty Retail, co-sponsored by Google Cloud and conducted by Incisiv, to evaluate how 220 North American retailers are demonstrating exceptional omnichannel commerce maturity and delivering highly personalized experiences to their customers, both in-store and online.

The biggest takeaway? Only 5% of retailers achieved ""Leader"" status, demonstrating the ability to consistently deliver the much desired personalized experiences.

Learn from the Leaders

The overall Leaders of the 2025 Unified Commerce Benchmark study were: Apple, Best Buy, Boss, Dick's Sporting Goods, IKEA, Lululemon, Neiman Marcus, Nike, Ralph Lauren and Sephora. On average, these Leaders achieved 31% lower fulfillment costs and 24% higher customer satisfaction.

A key finding was that from 2023 to 2025, the bar for unified commerce has risen dramatically. One-third (33%) of the capabilities that differentiated Leaders in 2023 are considered basic requirements today, while an all new set of unique capabilities defines Leadership in 2025:

Shopping experience: Today's consumers move seamlessly across channels and touchpoints. Multi-channel shoppers spend 15% more per order as they blend shopping across social media, online marketplace and brick-and-mortar stores. Leading stores understand this shift (which influences up to 34% of all digital discoveries) more than 1.5 times the industry average.

Checkout experience: Checkout must be reimagined to seamlessly blend operational efficiency with deeper engagement and personalization. 70% of Leaders offer intelligent cart experiences that sync and adapt across channels, compared to just 31% of others. Retailers treating checkout as a strategic touchpoint — optimized for today's generation of tech-savvy shoppers — see 20% lower cart abandonment rates than the industry average.

Fulfillment experience: Today's consumers — accustomed to same-day delivery, real-time tracking and flexible pickup options — are redefining fulfillment expectations. 50% of industry leaders empower customers to modify their orders and delivery preferences post-purchase, compared to just 13% of others, setting new standards for convenience and flexibility.

Service experience: Consumers don't see channels, they see relationships. They expect every interaction to build seamlessly on the last without repeating themselves, no matter who they're speaking to. 90% of Leaders have unified customer service touchpoints to ensure smooth transitions between store, digital and phone support. The result? They witness half as many support escalations, particularly related to orders, compared to their peers. Additionally, their rapid adoption of GenAI self-service agents should reduce support calls even further.

""Every aspect of unified commerce is a driver of business success, and true leadership requires unwavering focus on every stage of the customer journey — from shopping and checkout to fulfillment and service,"" says Ann Ruckstuhl, SVP and CMO at Manhattan.

As the commerce ecosystem transforms at a blistering pace, retailers must continuously evolve their unified commerce capabilities to move forward. Unified commerce integrates all aspects of retail operation, from online and in-store sales to inventory management, order fulfillment and customer data, into a seamless, unified system capable of meeting consumer demand.

Factors making the difference

Businesses succeeding in this complex retail ecosystem are leveraging the latest technology to enhance shopper experiences. The conventional wisdom that operational excellence requires trading off efficiency for customer experience is being upended. When done right, customer-centric innovation actually drives operational advantages across every metric.

Optimizing GenAI: While 77% of retailers deploy chatbots for self-service, only 5% harness GenAI to elevate that experience. These technologies can scale personalization, streamline complex decisions and extend human expertise across channels with unprecedented efficiency.

For example, GenAI can use a customer's purchase and preference history to fix problems — like missing items or returns — before they even complain. Agentic workflows can check inventory and process returns without staff intervention, helping streamline processes.

These technologies don't simply connect channels; they solve complex challenges that previously limited unified commerce potential. As these capabilities improve, faster adoption will redefine what's possible in connecting physical and digital retail.

Solving inventory challenges: Real-time inventory visibility drives revenue. Digital integration improves inventory visibility so retailers know exactly where their sellable inventory is — helping them overcome any disruptions and ensuring products they need are in the right place at the right time.

""The outsized impact of inventory on top-line revenue growth is evident. Inventory visibility, availability and seamless shipping have become critical levers for driving business performance in today's competitive retail landscape,"" explained Ruckstuhl.

Maximizing customer relationships: The 24% higher customer satisfaction rate among Leaders demonstrates that operational excellence results in loyalty. In fact, operational excellence and customer experience aren't tradeoffs anymore — they amplify each other and are redefining loyalty. Today's multi-channel shoppers don't draw distinctions between channels. They blend discovery, purchase and service, including returns, across channels, demanding consistent expertise at every touchpoint.

Customers who witness consistently convenient, trouble-free experience are more likely to remain loyal to those brands, whenever and wherever they shop.",https://d372qxeqh8y72i.cloudfront.net/3a4b1f6d-82db-47e8-bd31-c50f4f767417_wide.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 16:05:23.547302

Yet, much of that tech, whether the finished product or the component parts, is made overseas and shipped to the US. This is especially true for the chips and processors powering all our devices and AI advancements.

As a result, the Trump administration's latest round of tariffs against international trade partners promises to impact the prices of your tech.

Also: If you're planning to upgrade your phone, you might want to buy one now - here's why

If you're in the market for some tech products, you're likely concerned about when the right time to buy is, when prices will increase, and how much they will increase. ZDNET scoured reporting from across the web that should help provide some clarity on your next steps.

The tariff impact

Because tariffs will impose higher prices on goods imported into the US, companies importing parts or devices from overseas will pay higher prices. How that trickles down to the consumer is a matter of how the company chooses to handle the additional costs.

Higher costs for goods typically leave companies with several options: absorbing the cost themselves, raising the prices of the items to offset the increased costs, or some combination of both approaches.

Some tech companies have already issued statements expressing their intent to increase prices for buyers. For example, in a February interview with The Telegraph, Jason Chen, the chief executive and chairman of Acer, said the company would raise its prices by 10% to cover the cost of the tariffs. In a March earnings call, Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said price increases for American consumers would be ""highly likely.""

Other companies are shifting business operations to accommodate the tariffs. For example, Nintendo announced it was delaying its preorders for its upcoming Switch 2 in the US days after launching it to the public. The console is manufactured overseas, so the company is likely reevaluating pricing and costs.

A Wall Street Journal report claimed Apple was planning to send more iPhones to the US from India because of the high tariffs imposed on China. Since that report was published, Trump has passed sweeping tariffs across many more countries, including India. Vietnam, which also hosts major manufacturing plants for Apple, was also inflicted with tariffs in this latest wave.

Also: Why Temu's bargain prices are about to hit a tariff wall

As these examples show, price hikes for tech products are nearly inevitable. How much they will increase is to be determined, but some reports give us an idea.

A $2,300 iPhone?

You may have seen the headline about a $2,300 iPhone. Although Apple itself has not confirmed that -- or any -- iPhone price increase, the Reuters article that number came from does give users a clear understanding of how it reached that number -- and why it may be a viable reality.

Analysts from Rosenblatt Securities told Reuters that if Apple passes on increased component prices to consumers, the price of an iPhone could rise by as much as 43%. That would place Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Max, with a 6.9-inch display and 1 terabyte of storage, the top-of-the-line iPhone, at $2,300 if a 43% increase were added to the current $1,599 price.

Also: Android phones just got a major Gemini upgrade for free - Samsung models included

To give another example, a research analyst at TechInsights told The WSJ that the iPhone 16 Pro's hardware (256GB) costs around $550, and the phone is sold to consumers for $1,100. The new tariffs could raise the hardware cost to $850; if the same profit margins are maintained, the overall price could increase accordingly -- by around $300.

Customers interested in new iPhones are already flocking to Apple Stores to make the purchases before the tariffs impact prices. A new Bloomberg report found that Apple Store employees across the country said that their stores were filled with customers panic-buying iPhones over the weekend.

Beyond iPhones, tariffs are bound to permeate other tech products and industries more broadly. To help conceptualize the impact, CBS News put together a price tracker with graphs depicting how much the impact could be across products most impacted by tariffs. Right now, it includes fruits and vegetables, cars and trucks, and raw materials, such as aluminum, which is often used in tech products.

Should you buy tech now?

Ultimately, the decision to buy tech is a personal one that includes many factors, such as your personal needs and disposable income. Based on the information above, it is safe to say that prices are expected to rise. So, if you really need something, now could be a good time to buy.

CVS Health named a new CFO Tuesday as the healthcare giant continues to shake up its leadership team.

Brian Newman, most recently CFO of shipping and logistics firm UPS, will start at CVS on April 21. Tom Cowhey, who took on the permanent CFO position at CVS early last year, will become a strategic advisor to CEO David Joyner, effective May 12.

In addition to the leadership change, CVS said it expects financial results for 2025 to meet or exceed its previously issued guidance. In February, the company reported expected adjusted earnings for the year between $5.75 and $6 a share.

Dive Insight:

Newman will receive a base salary of $1 million, and his target annual equity award compensation will be $7 million, CVS said in a securities filing.

Cowhey will step down from the finance chief position about a year and half after he first took on the interim role.

He started at CVS in 2022, and then took on the interim CFO job in October 2023 after previous finance chief Shawn Guertin left due to family health reasons.

Cowhey will serve as strategic advisor and assist with transitioning his work until he leaves the company on a date that hasn’t yet been determined, according to a securities filing.

CVS also named Amy Compton-Phillips, previously chief physician executive of survey and patient experience firm Press Ganey, as chief medical officer, beginning May 19. She replaces Sree Chaguturu, who was named president of CVS’ healthcare delivery business in November, the company said in the filing.

The latest appointments come as CVS has made a number of recent leadership changes in recent months while it navigates a challenging financial environment.

The company’s profits were nearly cut in half last year as CVS’ insurance unit, Aetna, weathered heightened medical costs, particularly in government healthcare programs like Medicare Advantage and Medicaid.

Joyner took up the chief executive post in October, replacing Karen Lynch as the firm pulled earnings guidance due to elevated expenses at Aetna. Weeks later, the company named Steve Nelson, previously the CEO of value-based primary care company ChenMed, as president of the insurer.

Amy Compton-Phillips, M.D., is the company’s new executive vice president and chief medical officer, effective May 19, also reporting to David Joyner.

Based on year-to-date results through February, the Company currently expects financial results will meet or exceed its previously issued guidance for full year 2025. Our financial closing procedures for the first quarter of 2025 are not yet complete and, as a result, expected results for the full year may change due to such financial closing procedures, final adjustments, management’s review of results, and other developments that may arise between now and the time our financial results for the first quarter of 2025 are finalized.

“As I continue to build out my leadership team, I am confident that Brian and Amy will help us continue the momentum we have built over the past several months as we execute on our strategy to deliver better health care to the 185 million Americans we are privileged to serve,” said Joyner. “Their collective and individual experience and expertise are well suited to CVS Health and we welcome them both to our leadership team.

“I am personally grateful for the leadership Tom has shown in his time at CVS Health, and before that, Aetna. He stepped up during a challenging year, and helped position our enterprise for long-term growth opportunities. I wish him all the best in the future.”

“It is an honor to join CVS Health, its leadership team, and the Finance organization at such an important time in health care,” said Newman. “I am confident in our continued success and growth potential, and I look forward to putting my experience to work as we help our clients, customers, and colleagues succeed.”

Managers at the US arm of the British lender will no long have to consider how new hires and promotions advance the careers of women and people from minority ethnic backgrounds, who have traditionally been overlooked in the banking sector.

The bank’s chief executive, CS Venkatakrishnan, made the decision after a review, which started late last year, into its approach to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).

A Barclays spokesperson said that the review was “still under way” and that “in the meantime, we have taken the decision to no longer have specific US representation ambitions. Our representation ambitions for the rest of the group will continue, and are being considered as part of the review.”

They added: “We remain committed to a culture which values inclusiveness and equality of opportunity across Barclays.”

The spokesperson clarified that the review, run by its head of DEI, Natalie Hattrell, began before Trump won the presidential election in November.

While Barclays had not set US-specific targets, its 11,600 US staff, including those in offices in New York, Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware, were expected to adhere to global targets. Those included the goal of 33% of director and managing director roles being held by women by the end of 2025. Staff from under-represented ethnicities were also due to make up 50% of those senior positions.

Barclays is maintaining targets for the rest of its roughly 91,260 global staff, including the 43,180 it employs in the UK.

Venkatakrishnan said in the memo, first reported by Bloomberg: “The group executive committee has been carefully considering the changed environment in the US. As a global organisation, we have always complied with the local requirements in the jurisdictions in which we have operated. In doing so, we have remained faithful to our workplace culture.”

The US rollback comes two months after Venkatakrishnan, who was born in India, told journalists that Barclays had an “enduring commitment to a culture of inclusivity in the bank. It’s enduring and unwavering”.

“If you want to get the very best people, by necessity, you get a very diverse workforce,” he said during a full-year earnings call in February. “We want to provide equality of opportunity, and we want to create that inclusive environment in which people really can shine, excel and contribute to this bank. So that’s our approach, and we will continue to run the business and run the company in that way.”

Trump used executive orders after returning to the White House in January to reverse DEI policies in the federal government. While the orders did not directly apply to the private sector, he called on companies to follow suit, and asked the US attorney general’s office to consider how the rules could be more widely enforced.

It started a wide-ranging reversal, with several large US corporations, including Walmart, McDonald’s, Ford and Amazon, announcing plans to scrap or scale back their DEI schemes.

Barclays is the latest UK company to drop some of its DEI targets, with others, such as the pharmaceutical company GSK, going as far as pausing diversity activities for UK workers.

Last month City regulators at the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority controversially announced they were not planning to introduce new diversity and inclusion rules for financial companies and would instead support “voluntary industry initiatives”.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce589aab64301fc9823769f54385e5e1e9178382/0_318_5601_3361/master/5601.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e5f737bcbfb7ae47c3a8c25b5f7735d4,N,,2025-04-08 13:09:33.918914

After shifting sourcing from China to countries like Vietnam and Cambodia during Trump’s first term, brands now face another spike in costs as President Trump introduces new tariffs on the latter countries, sending shockwaves through the global fashion supply chain.

Trump has introduced a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods, but the fashion industry is far from dealing with just that.

For about two dozen countries where the US runs a trade deficit, those tariffs are much steeper. Vietnam, a cornerstone of the global athletic footwear supply chain, is among the hardest hit. A new 46% tariff now applies to Vietnamese goods headed to the US, compounding the 20% duties already in place for textile-topped athletic shoes.

That’s a serious issue for the likes of Nike, which makes 50% of its footwear in Vietnam, and On, a Swiss sportswear company which manufactures a staggering 90% of its shoes there.

Vietnam is the world’s second-largest apparel exporter to the US after China, which itself is now subject to a 54% tariff, including earlier duties. Cambodia faces a 49% tariff, Bangladesh 37% and the European Union 20%.

The impact is already visible. In after-hours trading, shares of Lululemon fell more than 10%, Nike and Ralph Lauren dropped 7% and Tapestry, Capri and PVH Corp saw a dip of around 5%.

Fashion companies have little room to manoeuvre. Moving manufacturing out of Vietnam is no quick fix.

Production relocation: Easier said than done

Trump wants to bring production back to the US, but the fashion industry says it’s not feasible.

American factories lack the specialised equipment and skilled labour needed to make running shoes at scale. Nike, which first started manufacturing in Vietnam in 1995, now works with 130 supplier factories in the country. Adidas makes 39% of its footwear there too.

This week's tariff hike hits brands hard. Nike shares have dropped to their lowest in nearly eight years, weighed down by rising costs and competitive pressure from brands like On and Hoka.

While Nike hasn't commented directly, its latest quarterly report mentions ""several external factors that create uncertainty and volatility in the operating environment, including, but not limited to, geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, tax regulation and fluctuating foreign exchange rates.""

Supply chain ripple effects will be wide

The strain goes beyond big-name brands. The US Fashion Industry Association put it bluntly: “We are deeply disappointed by the Trump Administration’s decision to impose new tariffs on all imports. This action will particularly affect American fashion brands and retailers.”

From suppliers in Vietnam to textile makers and farmers worldwide, the entire chain will feel the pressure. Walmart, among others, has said it will negotiate with suppliers to lower costs, but many factories already operate on tight margins. The squeeze is set to intensify.

Retailers face a dilemma: absorb the higher costs or pass them onto shoppers already hit by inflation. With consumer confidence in the US already at its lowest since the pandemic, fashion brands are treading carefully.

And if costs are passed to consumers, expect more selective shopping habits and fewer impulse buys, which could dent profits further.

Washington Prime Group, according to a WARN notice filed with the state, will cut 139 jobs at its 4900 E. Dublin Granville Road headquarters.

A spokesperson for the company said the business has been downsizing as it sells assets in its portfolio – approximately half of which were sold last year with the remainder still on the market or soon to be.

Washington Prime owns more than 70 properties across the U.S. Its Ohio portfolio includes Polaris Fashion Place, Great Lakes Mall in Mentor, The Mall at Fairfield Commons in Beavercreek and the Lima Center in Lima.

But the company also is losing its office space through no fault of its own.

Its Dublin Granville Road headquarters also is the former Big Lots Inc. headquarters.

That building was acquired in February by OhioHealth.

According to court documents in Big Lots' ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, Washington Prime was notified in February the lease would be terminated. It moved into that building in 2023. It previously was downtown at the Continental Plaza.

Washington Prime declined to comment on whether it is fully eliminating its Central Ohio office presence and neither the WARN notice nor its statement to Columbus Business First acknowledged the lease termination.

The company also has corporate offices in Indianapolis.

The local cuts begin in June and could take until March 31, 2026 to complete, according to the notice.

Union workers have argued that mail delivery is a vital public service that shouldn't necessarily turn a profit.","Changes are coming to how mail is delivered across the United States as the U.S. Postal Service continues to find itself in the crosshairs of a Trump administration determined to slash federal spending and increase efficiency.

President Donald Trump's federal cost-cutting efforts, led by billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, have not spared an agency that otherwise operates and funds itself independently.

The changes hitting USPS this month, which took effect April 1, are part of a 10-year plan, dubbed “Delivering for America."" Ultimately, the plan includes cutting jobs, adding a new fleet of electric delivery trucks to replace existing trucks that keep breaking down and slowing delivery for many rural customers.

The changes also come amid growing protests from postal workers and supporters opposed to service reductions, which USPS says will help save the organization $36 billion over a decade.

Here's what to know:

What is the USPS?

The United States Postal Service, older than the U.S. itself, delivers to 165 million addresses six times a week.

Although the postal service is technically an independent agency, Congress maintains close control.

But some critics who have long wanted to see the agency overhauled have pointed to the significant challenges the USPS has faced as Americans send fewer letters, Christmas cards and wedding invitations. Last year, the service handled more than 116 billion pieces of mail, with most of that being presorted mailers, solicitations, or other items that many people would consider ""junk"" mail.

Last year, the postal service lost $9.5 billion as private companies like FedEx and UPS outcompete it for some parcel deliveries.

10,000 jobs to be cut; postmaster strikes deal with DOGE

Postmaster General Louis DeJoy stepped down after inking a deal in March with billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency.

DeJoy said the deal with DOGE, which has torn through the federal government to slash spending in the name of reducing waste, will ""assist us in identifying and achieving further efficiencies.""

The deal came after the USPS announced in January a voluntary early retirement initiative expected to result in about 10,000 jobs being cut. More than 75% of the postal service's budget goes to paying its roughly 635,000 workers, and those 10,000 job cuts reflect only a 1.5% staffing reduction.

According to a news release from the American Postal Workers Union, workers who opt to retire early are eligible for a one-time $15,000 incentive paid in two parts.

Appointed during the first Trump presidency, DeJoy said in a letter to Congress that DOGE would help usher a “historic level of transformational change"" by reducing costs.

How will mail delivery be different?

The changes that went into effect this month will affect millions of customers across the country. While the moves are designed to improve efficiency and cut costs, some people may notice slower delivery.

According to the USPS, service standards will be ""refined"" for:

First-class mail.

Periodicals.

Marketing mail.

Package services (bound printed matter, media mail, and library mail).

USPS Ground Advantage.

Priority mail.

Priority mail express.

Delivery of first-class mail is expected to take no more than five days, while the 2-5 day range for USPS Ground Advantage will also stay the same, the postal service said. Certain postage like marketing materials, periodicals and other packages may even be delivered faster, according to the USPS news release.

The majority of first-class mail, 75%, should notice no change to their first-class mail delivery services, the postal service said. However, 14% will be upgraded to a faster standard, while another 11% of first-class mail will be delivered slower, though still within the 1-5 day deliver window.

For more precise expectations, the USPS is now using 5-Digit ZIP code pairs, rather than current standards that are based on 3-Digit ZIP code pairs.

USPS already has a map online that will let customers see how long it will take to deliver mail from one ZIP code to another.

More changes coming

The next changes are set to take effect July 1. More information will be released closer to that date.

Trump suggests merging USPS with Commerce; Musk wants it privatized

Trump, who has long been critical of the USPS and its declining deliveries, has in the past floated the idea that it be merged into the Commerce Department. Such a move would bring the now-independent postal service under Trump's authority.

“It’ll remain the Postal Service, and I think it'll operate a lot better than it has been over the years,” Trump said on Feb. 24. “It's been just a tremendous loser for this country.""

Musk has also suggested privatizing the agency, as many other countries have done. Such a move would likely require congressional approval.

Rural communities could be unequally impacted

Unlike the postal service, private companies do not have the same service obligations requiring delivery to rural or sparsely-populated areas – even at a loss. Companies like FedEx and UPS can charge higher prices for harder deliveries in such area, or simply not deliver to them at all.

Instead, those companies are more likely to focus services on areas with more people, more places and more profit.

In contrast, the postal service is required to deliver to virtually every address in the country, regardless of how much it costs. Some mail carriers even still use mules or horses to deliver to Supai, Arizona, a remote Havasupai tribal village in the Grand Canyon of Arizona, or float planes to serve fishing villages off the Alaskan coast.

Under a privatized system, mail outgoing and incoming to rural regions would likely be delayed. Service could become much more expensive or be cut off entirely.

Postal workers rally after DOGE threatens to dismantle USPS

News that Musk's DOGE team would be scouring the service for savings sparked recent protests across the U.S.

Thousands of unionized postal workers and their supporters rallied across the nation in late March to protest proposals to dismantle the U.S. Postal Service. Union workers have argued that mail delivery is a vital public service that shouldn't necessarily turn a profit.

Social media can be daunting for a business, from keeping up with trends to creating content to continuously posting across platforms. But, much like retail media, social media is becoming a must-have for grocers as one of the most effective ways to earn the loyalty and attention of Generation Z customers, sources say.

Gen Z shoppers already represent a significant portion of the market and are only growing. As of 2024, Gen Z shoppers made up 21% of the U.S. population and possessed $984 billion in spending power, according to Kantar Retail IQ.

Nearly 60% of consumers discover new products via social media, making social media the top channel for social commerce, according to a report from Inmar Intelligence. In addition, 78% of consumers consider a brand’s reputation on social media to be very important.

Most grocers post on multiple social media platforms, including the ones that are the most popular among Gen Zers, Instagram and TikTok. But while grocers are active on these platforms, an analysis of eight major grocers found that no one is posting consistently high-performing content. Likes, views and interactions vary largely from post to post, signaling that these companies haven’t found ways to build a loyal, engaged follower base.

Grocers continue to struggle to gain a consistent, loyal traction on social media

Grocers' follower and like counts on TikTok and Instagram, respectively, as of April 8, 2025

Based on a scroll through each grocer’s Instagram and TikTok profiles, it’s clear that these retailers tend to stick to videos that show off their products. Whether these posts are cooking demos, ingredient bundles or creative food hacks, they typically mimic influencer-style videos. Though this strategy makes sense, grocer’s posts still receive limited traction.

There’s a solution to this, however: Let full-time influencers and content creators themselves take the lead in grocers’ social media marketing, according to Ranjana Choudhry, senior vice president of media and data platforms for Inmar Intelligence.

If you can’t beat them, join them

Why try to become an influencer when you have a grocery business to run?

Influencer partnerships, including giveaways, sponsorships, product reviews and collaborative content creations, are expected to become more popular in the overall marketing landscape.

Already, 59% of marketers reported plans to partner with more influencers this year compared to 2024, sister publication Marketing Dive reported using data collected by Sprouts Social. Business-to-consumer brands, which include grocers, tend to engage in a higher volume of influencer partnerships compared with the average.

To resonate with shoppers through social commerce, retailers must create an environment that “revolves around meaningful, discovery-driven interactions” that pair entertainment with the path to purchase, according to Inmar’s report. While grocers can begin to build this on their social media pages, influencers offer a more direct path.

More than 80% of consumers purchase items based on creator recommendations, according to Inmar. Even if the influencer has a limited following, 80% of surveyed consumers reported they would buy something on social media based on “a random piece of creator content, regardless of follower size,” Inmar found.

Influencers also allow for more flexibility in the social commerce space. TikTok is all the rage — hence why even neighborhood grocery stores are making videos on the platform — but the platform’s 12-hour shutdown in January caused marketers to see a “significant drop in their reach and engagement,” according to the report. While audiences may not refollow their go-to grocery company on another social media platform, they are likely to follow their favorite creators and communities “wherever they go,” Inmar said.

“For the first time, brands and retailers can actually combine this creator-authentic content and authentic following with very clear targeting to retail customers,” Choudhry said. “So there is a lot of affinity that [retailers] can drive.

Creating authenticity, measuring impact

Authenticity is something that can only come from influencers, because even if a retailer posts so-called relatable content, viewers will still see it as a traditional advertisement rather than content, according to Inmar, adding that 73% of consumers trust creators as much or more than traditional advertisements.

However, there is a way to translate this authenticity — and that’s where retail media networks come into play.Grocers can use their retail media networks to scale creator content made for their company across digital platforms. This would enable companies to more accurately measure the impact and performance of an influencer’s content as well as allow them to tap into a creator’s “trust factor” across their follower base, Inmar said.

This more tangible feedback on creator content performance and impact will also help retailers know which influencers are best to partner with, as it will allow them to select creators whose follower base is likely to drive sales performance.

Without this technology and the ability to connect audiences to purchase power, retailers would be forced to assume or guess, Choudhry said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/-Rjqfr0495DEaoNWWLIWPzz11Ehry2GYERo-2mIZtRE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMjI3OTUyMzY0XzFfWG9GSW0wYi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-04-08 12:23:30.818195

Age: 86 (born February 24, 1938)

Height: 5 ft 9 in (175 cm)

Business: Co-founder and former CEO/Chairman of Nike, Inc.

Net Worth: Approximately $40 billion (as of 2025)

Spouse: Married to Penny Knight

Few names are as synonymous with modern sportswear and brand dominance as Phil Knight. What began as a modest idea in the mind of a University of Oregon track athlete eventually became Nike, one of the most recognized and profitable companies in the world. Knight’s journey wasn’t just about building a shoe company — it was about transforming global athletic culture.

The Humble Beginnings: Blue Ribbon Sports

In 1964, Knight teamed up with his former track coach Bill Bowerman to start Blue Ribbon Sports, originally a distributor for Japanese running shoes from Onitsuka Tiger (now ASICS). Knight sold the shoes out of his car at track meets while balancing an accounting job — an image that would soon contrast sharply with the billion-dollar empire Nike would become.

The Birth of Nike

In 1971, after parting ways with Onitsuka, the partners launched Nike, Inc., named after the Greek goddess of victory. The iconic Swoosh logo was created by a graphic design student for just $35 — a branding move that would become one of the most valuable trademarks in history.

Knight’s early focus was on performance and innovation — lightweight shoes with improved cushioning and traction. But it was bold marketing (think: ""Just Do It"") and celebrity athlete partnerships (like signing Michael Jordan in 1984) that catapulted Nike into the stratosphere.

The Mastermind Behind the Brand

Phil Knight served as CEO of Nike from 1964 to 2004, and remained Chairman until 2016. During his leadership, Nike grew from a scrappy startup to a $180+ billion global powerhouse, dominating the market in footwear, apparel, and equipment.

Knight is known for his unconventional, fiercely competitive business style — blending intuition with strategic risks. His memoir Shoe Dog reveals many of the hurdles and near-failures Nike overcame on its way to global domination.

Does Phil Knight Still Own Nike?

Yes, Phil Knight still owns a significant portion of Nike. Through Swoosh LLC, a holding company, Knight and his family own about 22% of the company, making them the largest individual shareholders. His son, Travis Knight, also holds substantial shares and is involved in the family’s business interests.

Who’s the Biggest Shareholder in Nike?

Individual: Travis Knight (via trust) – approx. 17.8%

Institutional:

The Vanguard Group – approx. 7.1%

BlackRock – approx. 5.5%

The Knight family still exerts considerable influence over the company, despite Phil having stepped back from an active leadership role.

How Long Was He CEO?

Phil Knight served as the CEO of Nike for an impressive 40 years, leading the company from its founding in 1964 until his retirement in 2004. Even after stepping down as CEO, Knight remained deeply involved with the company, serving as Chairman of the Board until 2016.

Shoe Dog: The Story Behind the Swoosh

If you want an unfiltered look into the trials, triumphs, and sheer chaos behind building a global brand, Shoe Dog is a must-read. In this candid memoir, Phil Knight shares the gritty, behind-the-scenes journey of launching Nike from selling sneakers out of the trunk of his car to facing financial ruin and navigating global success. It’s not just a business book, it’s a story about passion, risk, resilience, and chasing a crazy dream.

What Does the Nike CEO Make Now?

As of 2024, Elliott Hill has taken over as the new CEO of Nike, stepping into one of the most high-profile roles in the sportswear industry. Hill’s annual compensation package is estimated to be around $27 million, which includes a combination of base salary, performance bonuses, and stock options. His earnings are slightly below those of his predecessor, John Donahoe, who earned approximately $29.1 million in 2023. Despite the shift in leadership, Nike continues to reward its executives generously, reflecting the company’s ongoing global influence and profitability.

Phil Knight’s Legacy

Phil Knight didn’t just build a company he built a culture. From innovation in footwear to game-changing marketing and brand loyalty, Knight’s vision helped make Nike not just a product, but a global symbol of ambition, athleticism, and edge. His journey remains a blueprint for entrepreneurs across industries.

He transformed a small footwear brand into a global empire that spans across high fashion to everyday consumer wear.

Why ‘Raising Prices Is The Most Viable Path Forward’ Morgan Stanley Research said that “raising prices” for products” is the “most viable path forward” for hardware companies it covers.
For instance, “there is little flexibility to pull forward/stockpile inventory, and diversifying supply chains takes too long,” Morgan Stanley Research said.
These companies could consider redirecting products to markets without tariffs, “but it would depend on the usable infrastructure available,” Morgan Stanley Research said.","The research arm of Morgan Stanley explains why President Trump’s across-the-board tariffs could prompt hardware companies such as Apple, Dell Technologies and HP Inc. to raise prices and why it’s ‘unlikely’ for these vendors to ever shift production to the U.S.

The research arm of global banking giant Morgan Stanley called President Trump’s across-the-board tariffs a “lose-lose” situation for hardware companies such as Apple, Dell Technologies and HP Inc., saying that “raising prices” for products is their “most viable path forward.”

Morgan Stanley Research delivered the assessment in a research note last Thursday, a day after Trump announced so-called “reciprocal tariffs” ranging from 25 percent to 54 percent for goods coming out of roughly 60 countries and regions, which he said are meant to boost the U.S. economy and “protect American workers.”

[Related: ‘Confusion,’ ‘Uncertainty,’ ‘Pain’: Solution Providers Grapple With Trump’s Tariff Regime]

These new tariffs are set to go into effect Wednesday, with goods from Asian manufacturing hubs such as Vietnam, Taiwan and Thailand expected to face tax rates of 46 percent, 32 percent and 36 percent, respectively.

Since the report came out, Trump has warned that he will impose an additional 50 percent tariff on Chinese goods, which would bring total import taxes to 104 percent for such things, in response to China’s counter-tariffs on U.S. products.

While some of the targeted countries and regions have said they are seeking new trade deals with the U.S. to remove tariffs, China said Tuesday it would “fight to the end” and continue countermeasures in response to Trump’s latest threat, the Associated Press reported.

Trump has indicated he is open to striking trade deals, saying on Tuesday that he spoke with South Korea’s acting president about a potential deal while saying that China “wants to make a deal, badly, but they don’t know how to get it started.”

Dell, HP Say They Have ‘Agile’ And ‘Resilient’ Supply Chains

A Dell spokesperson told CRN on Monday that the Round Rock, Texas-based company is “reviewing and assessing the impact of the tariffs announced last week.”

“Dell has a strong track record of leading through any environment with our globally resilient and agile supply chain,” the representative said in a statement.

In a statement to CRN, an HP spokesperson said Tuesday that the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company “has an agile and resilient supply chain that helps us adapt to the evolving economic landscape to ensure we deliver for our partners and customers.”

“Our strong relationships with supply chain partners around the world allow us to remain agile and responsive to changes, as we are not tied primarily to company-owned infrastructure or factories in countries heavily impacted by tariffs,” the representative said.

“We will continue to monitor developments and have the ability to adjust operations as needed,” the HP spokesperson added.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

Why And How Tariffs Will Hit Apple, Dell And HP

Morgan Stanley Research said the tariffs “add to the growing list of concerns” it has for the hardware companies it covers, which include Apple, Dell and HP. Other companies in the firm’s coverage that will be impacted by tariffs include Logitech, Sonos, Garmin and GoPro.

“As we highlighted last week, policy uncertainty, deteriorating business/consumer sentiment, and worsening macro data have resulted in slowing enterprise hardware spending growth and persistently negative consumer electronics spending intentions since late February,” the firm wrote.

“Yesterday's reciprocal tariff announcements will likely amplify these headwinds,” it added.

That’s because companies like Apple, Dell and HP “rely on extensive international manufacturing, with the large majority of finished goods sold into the U.S. assembled in [southeast] Asian Nations, making them [the] worst positioned” among the companies it covers, according to Morgan Stanley Research.

Many of these hardware companies, including Apple, Dell and HP, started reducing their reliance on manufacturing in China in 2018 during the first Trump administration, the firm said. Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple, for instance, has moved roughly 15 percent of iPhone production to India since then, and all its MacBooks for the U.S. market are now made in Vietnam.

Dell and HP, on the other hand, “diversified U.S.-bound notebook production to Vietnam and Thailand, respectively,” Morgan Stanley Research added.

While shifting production outside China was previously seen as a way for these vendors to lower their exposure to tariffs, this is no longer the case, the firm said.

That’s because Trump has cast a wide net with his latest round of tariffs, hitting countries like Thailand and Vietnam that were previously seen as safe for U.S. vendors to use as manufacturing hubs, according to Morgan Stanley Research.

“With yesterday's reciprocal tariff announcement, there becomes very little differentiation in friend shoring vs. manufacturing in China—if the product is not made in the U.S., it will be subject to a hefty import tariff,” the firm wrote.

Given Apple’s exposure to tariffs due to its reliance on Asian manufacturing hubs, the iPhone giant would face an estimated additional cost of $33 billion annually, which would represent 26 percent of its earnings before interest and taxes, according to Morgan Stanley Research.

For Dell and HP, “the added tariff cost could equate to nearly the entirety of their expected net [incomes] in 2025,” the firm added.

Why ‘Raising Prices Is The Most Viable Path Forward’

Morgan Stanley Research said that “raising prices” for products” is the “most viable path forward” for hardware companies it covers.

That’s because the widespread nature of the tariffs makes most of their other mitigation tools “ineffectual,” according to the firm.

For instance, “there is little flexibility to pull forward/stockpile inventory, and diversifying supply chains takes too long,” Morgan Stanley Research said.

As for absorbing the extra costs created by tariffs, this would guarantee a “significant margin headwind” for impacted vendors, the firm added.

These companies could consider redirecting products to markets without tariffs, “but it would depend on the usable infrastructure available,” Morgan Stanley Research said.

As a result, the firm considers the tariffs a “lose-lose” situation for hardware vendors.

“Raising prices is the most likely mitigation tool, in our view (all imports now face tariffs, so the playing field has been somewhat leveled), but it's inflationary and guaranteed to negatively impact demand, given the severity of some pricing increases,” it wrote.

Could Shifting Production To The U.S. Be The Answer?

Morgan Stanley Research said it’s “unlikely” that hardware companies would ever shift production to the U.S., citing cost, time and resources as well as expertise and policy uncertainty as “barriers to entry.”

The firm said it would cost “hundreds of billions of dollars” to stand up manufacturing plants in the U.S., “not even counting the wage disparities between [southeast] Asia and the U.S.” For example, Apple supplier Foxconn spent more than $1.5 billion, inclusive of perks like lower power costs and subsidies as well as tax breaks, to build a manufacturing complex in China that produces roughly 50 percent of the world’s iPhones, it said.

“Standing up a manufacturing facility in the U.S. would take, at the very minimum, 9 months with a running start and labor availability. Most likely, it would take years. And then there is the question of available labor in the U.S.,” the firm said.

“We'd presume that even with automation/humanoids/robots, there aren't enough skilled workers in the US with expertise in tooling,” it added.

The uncertainty over U.S. policy will also hold back companies from investing in domestic manufacturing capacity, according to Morgan Stanley Research.

That’s because with Trump in his second term as president, policy “could be vastly different” in four years, the firm said.

“For an industry facing hundreds of billions of dollars in costs to set up shop in the U.S. [versus] tens of billions in tariffs, tariffs still feel like the less bad choice,” it wrote.",https://www.crn.com/news/computing/2025/media_102796514d0be18e650a772ece46277cdf28ce3be.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2025-04-08 12:23:13.018260

“The last two recessions the pharma industry has fared pretty well,” Arthur Wong, senior director of corporate ratings, healthcare, at S&P Global Ratings, told BioSpace.
“Before we go overboard, [pharma’s] still recession resistant,” Wong said.
Jefferies said that the macro uncertainties due to the tariffs “have triggered a continued flight to safety,” on the markets.
“We have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade-offs within our own companies,” Ricks explained.","With GLP-1s making the pharma industry more exposed to consumer spending than ever, the tariff chaos could break pharma’s recession-resistant reputation.

And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. If the world does indeed fall into a recession following the widespread tariffs put into place by President Donald Trump—as many indicators are suggesting it will—pharma could be particularly vulnerable. With the U.S. population growing older and suffering from more chronic diseases, personal healthcare expenses are on the rise for everyday people who could be forced to make difficult decisions like skipping medications.

The most significant recession in recent memory was the 2008 financial crisis, which was spurred by the collapse of the housing market and financial systems in the U.S. More recently, a shorter recession cropped up due to the pandemic. In both cases, pharma was largely immune. You have to buy your medicines even if the economy is tanking.

“The last two recessions the pharma industry has fared pretty well,” Arthur Wong, senior director of corporate ratings, healthcare, at S&P Global Ratings, told BioSpace. “People can’t really skip their prescriptions.”

According to Jefferies, pharma outperformed the S&P 500 through both recessions and in the years immediately following, because the industry is “overall a more defensive beneficiary of money flow in economic downturns.”

In the case of COVID, biopharma even enjoyed an influx of funds as investors poured money into the industry as it raced to develop vaccines and medicines that could stymie the rampant global outbreak. Jefferies said that pharma outperformed the S&P 500 by about 10-20% during that recession.

But this time around, things are different, experts say. Since those two events, GLP-1s have risen precipitously, but insurance coverage has not followed as neatly. That means the market has been defined by consumers, with many more patients pocketing the costs of GLP-1 medicines themselves. Trump also just nixed an executive order from his predecessor Joe Biden that expanded Medicare coverage for the therapies, cutting off another avenue for access—at least for now.

Wong told BioSpace he expects GLP-1s to take a hit if a recession does settle in. “You’ll still see growth,” he predicted, “it’s just that you will see a slowdown in adoption with things like this,” as patients back off paying out-of-pocket for weight loss medications.

Moreover, healthcare has grown as a larger portion of the GDP since the early 2000s, Wong noted. The population has aged, meaning more of them have chronic health conditions and are taking prescriptions for longer. Healthcare is becoming a larger part of people’s personal budgets. It remains to be seen how they will weather a recession.

“Depending on when the next recession hits, how deep it is, is it going to have a bigger impact?” Wong asked. “I would guess yes.”

Paying Up Front

Before the recession fears, insurance companies had faced increasing pressure to open up coverage of obesity medications. Wong said he thinks that now is not the right time to try to convince insurance companies to shoulder the cost because they are facing the same macro headwinds as any other industry and are beholden to their shareholders.

“The health insurers are all struggling and trying to control their medical-cost ratios,” he said.

The argument posed by companies like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, the GLP-1 market leaders with tirzepatide and semaglutide, respectively, has been that their products can eliminate downstream health challenges. Both have pursued indications beyond just weight loss. Semaglutide, approved as Wegovy for weight loss, has been approved for reducing cardiovascular risk and for kidney disease, while Lilly nabbed an FDA nod for sleep apnea for Zepbound. Insurers just will not see this as the right time to make that down payment, Wong said.

“I think they can agree that they see savings down the road, but are they willing to pay for it up front? And is there money in the budget right now to pay upfront?” Wong asked. “They buy into [the idea of these drugs]. It’s just at what level of adoption [and] how aggressively can they provide coverage in this current environment.”

Even with covered drugs, the out-of-pocket expenses can be high. While it’s easy to assume that people will continue taking their medicine, Wong said that during the previous recessions, there were reports of “pill-splitting,” when people cut doses to make their prescriptions last longer or delay refilling.

“Before we go overboard, [pharma’s] still recession resistant,” Wong said. “I don’t think it was ever recession proof, but it is still recession resistant. I think it becomes less recession resistant as we go on, just because healthcare spending is a bigger part of the pie in terms of people’s budgets.”

The Tariff Threat

This moment for GLP-1s also comes as pharmas are directly battered by tariff uncertainty,, which Wong says the industry has “sidestepped”—for now.

Shares of Eli Lilly, now the largest pharma by market cap, have declined 12% in one month from a high of $864 apiece on March 24, wiping out $95.4 billion in market value. Novo, which takes the fourth slot below Johnson & Johnson and AbbVie in terms of market cap, has lost $72.4 billion in market value in the same time period, with shares falling 26% in one month to $63.64 at close Monday.

Jefferies said that the macro uncertainties due to the tariffs “have triggered a continued flight to safety,” on the markets.

“We expect macro to have the steering wheel,” the firm said.

Lilly CEO David Ricks told the BBC last week of the tariffs that “it’ll be hard to come back from here.” While much of the innovation in pharma is done in the U.S., Ricks said that the industry relies on global locations for production, including active pharmaceutical ingredients.

According to a recent survey from the industry group BIO, nearly 90% of all U.S. biopharma companies rely on imported API for FDA-approved products. If tariffs were imposed on Europe, half of companies would have to find new research and manufacturing partners, while 79% with Chinese contracts would be greatly impacted if that country is levied with huge tariffs.

“We have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade-offs within our own companies,” Ricks explained. Those trade-offs would include layoffs and reductions in R&D first and foremost, which Ricks called “a disappointing outcome.”

One expert who spoke to Truist Securities called the panic an overreaction and instead insisted that it’s a great time to be investing in biopharma. This person “sees this whole process of tariffs as a ‘revolution,’” to bring assets back to the U.S. to guard against unforeseen events like a war or another pandemic.",https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/d1fe95c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/985x554+8+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff7%2Fee%2F3149943c4100a14a46aaeed7a311%2Funtitled-1000-x-563-px-2.png,N,,2025-04-08 16:05:28.014530

Can guidance be guidance right now if it does not include the impact of tariffs?
Yes, the tariffs, uh, that were imposed have created more uncertainty.
So I know that you've also as part of that introduced a tariff task force internally.
Not entirely, only because if you think of our supply chain, yes, so first, we have got a task force.","Let's get a check in on Levi's shares. Continuing their move to the upside this morning after topping first quarter earnings expectations and maintaining full year forecasts. The jeans maker excluding the effects of President Trump's tariffs, the executive saying they anticipate a minimal impact near term. Still, the company says it may be required to modify sourcing practices which could impact product costs. Joining us now, Harmeet Singh is Levi Strauss's chief financial and growth officer. Harmeet, it's great to speak with you. So you are keeping your forecast, but you said that it assumes no deterioration in the macro environment. Can guidance be guidance right now if it does not include the impact of tariffs?

Good morning. Thanks for having me here. Um, as you know, we reported a very strong start to the year, our quarter one beat top line and bottom line expectations. Revenue, organic revenue accelerated and we were up 9%. Our EBIT margins expanded and we're up 400 basis points and EPS was up 50, uh you know, 52%. So overall, real strong start to the year. Our transformation strategies are working as we pivot to a DDC first lifestyle company. Um you know, our DDC results, which is direct to consumer, which includes our stores and e-commerce, uh you know, it was up 12%, 12 consecutive quarter of growth and what I like to call a tri-fecta, which is, you know, we're growing compsales, we're adding profitable new stores and we're growing e-commerce. And so, you know, a real strong start to the year and good momentum. To your question about guidance, medicine, um, it's uh, it's early days. Yes, the tariffs, uh, that were imposed have created more uncertainty. We are best positioned to navigate it. Uh, the situation is very fluid. Um, and the way we think of guidance is it's important to give expectations when we are clear, uh, about uh the expectations. We were very clear about quarter two and we guided quarter two, which is again, uh, you know, growing 3 and a half to 4 and a half percent on an organic basis. Gross margins continue to improve and we guided our EPS expectations. Uh, and so that's the reason we stuck with the full year guidance. Uh, you know, uh, just before the announcements of tariffs, given the results we had in Q1, we were debating whether we should take up full year guidance. Uh, but given that it's just the beginning of the year, and then the announcement of the tariffs, we felt prudent at this day to maintain our full year guidance.

Understood. So I know that you've also as part of that introduced a tariff task force internally. Our sourcing indicates that some items that you have could increase their costs by as much as 100%. Does that feel accurate to you?

Not entirely, only because if you think of our supply chain, yes, so first, we have got a task force. The task force is working 24/7. It's how we have managed other, uh, you know, previous crisis and we've actually, being a company has been around 170 years, we have navigated through them and emerged stronger post the crisis. Uh the task force is really looking at all options. They're looking at cost management options, they're looking at how we manage and talk to our different stakeholders, customers, our vendors who we have long tenure relationships and also looking at pricing options, you know, from that perspective. Uh, to your question about a diversified supply chain, uh, you know, we source from 28 different countries, uh, and not any country makes up more than 25% of, uh, you know, what we source from into the US. We source from 20 countries. We have the product already for spring and summer and that's why, you know, we were very clear about expectations for quarter two.

Harmeet, this is Nancy Tengler. I'm a native San Franciscan, so Levi holds a very special place in my heart, but I'm wondering if you anticipate any retaliatory demand issues from, from some of our trading partners.

Nancy, we haven't seen any retaliatory, you know, pushback from consumers. As a brand, we have been present internationally for over 80 years. Uh, we have deep connections with the consumers, you know, we're an American brand with a global presence and 60% of our business is overseas. Um, and so you know, as far as we are seeing international as an example was up 9% into 75% of the apparel market is outside the US and we are connecting really well with the consumers globally.

All right, Harmeet, we have to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us. Really appreciate it.

InfoSum will become a part of Choreograph, the global data company that itself sits within GroupM, WPP’s media investment business.
WPP acquires InfoSum to power WPP Open.
Handing data over, moving data, leakage of data: it’s not good for privacy.
Forget whether you own data or not, asking your clients to ‘please send me your data’ – it just has to stop.","So, a real, tangible point of difference between marketing’s monoliths is a tasty dish for the industry’s commentariat to feast on. Look closely and you’ll find the holdcos’ biggest such difference in an unlikely spot: how they source and share data.

In short, some want to own robust data sets that resolve into identity-matched profiles of real people. Some want to build platforms to connect others’ data sources as quickly and safely as possible.

British holdco WPP, firmly in the latter camp, solidified its position by acquiring fellow London-founded InfoSum last week. The latter is a specialist in data clean room technology – a category that Lauren Wetzel, chief executive of InfoSum, tells The Drum the company “created and defined” with its “different way of doing data collaboration,” which prioritizes data safety.

Reports of the price WPP paid for InfoSum have not been confirmed, but former owners, investment group Chrysalis, posted reports of $63m in cash gains on the day of the sale.

The move follows WPP’s acquisition of Stability AI, the generative AI developer of Stable Diffusion, last month and the gradual folding-in of agency T&Pm last year, all in service of a much-vaunted $300m investment in its AI platform WPP Open this year.

InfoSum will become a part of Choreograph, the global data company that itself sits within GroupM, WPP’s media investment business. It’s the final keystone in that approach to data that diverges markedly from WPP’s competitors, Evan Hanlon, global chief executive of Choreograph, tells The Drum. “Now, we have all the pieces.”

The war on identity: A primer

Many commentators have been quick to point out how unsurprising the move is: GroupM chief executive Brian Lesser spent four years at the helm of InfoSum from 2020 to 2024. And beyond any personal ties, Lesser has been loudly beating a drum for an approach to big data that he has called “a shift from ID to AI,” under which “we believe that data connectivity is more important than simply owning a database… No matter how many traditional IDs you own, it will never be enough.”

The line was a jab at WPP’s competitors, which are investing heavily in the ‘identity-based’ approach to big data that prizes owning vast supplies of data sources that can resolve the identities of internet users to deliver personalized messaging. WPP shares that final goal but not the method. Its divergent approach instead prizes connecting disparate data sources and providing an environment that is not reliant on any particular set of the ‘profiles’ that identity-based approaches yield.

Almost on cue after Lesser’s identity-bashing speech, WPP’s biggest competitor, Publicis Groupe (which had recently leapfrogged it to become the world’s biggest ad company), went public with its acquisition of data shop Lotame, adding 1.6bn profiles to its sack and doubling down, hard, on identity. Scott Hagedorn, chief solutions architect for the group, told The Drum at the time: “Without an identity footprint, marketers can’t really do modern marketing.”

He added: “The problem is, when you become dependent on syndicating identity, you’re going to get charged every time you use that identity. That’s why we’ve been able to make identity and AI work for our clients: because we’ve made investments to own it and not rent it.”

In the rarefied air of marketing’s holding company world, this is the equivalent of a flame war. On one side, WPP is rejecting identity as the center of any sensible data approach, while on the other, Publicis (alongside newly merged Omnicom and IPG with their equivalent to Epsilon, Omni) is insisting that identity is modern marketing’s very core.

“The pattern is clear,” says Jay Pattisall, principal analyst at Forrester: “Omnicom acquires IPG in part for Acxiom to power Omni. Publicis acquires Lotame to bolster CoreAI. WPP acquires InfoSum to power WPP Open. In the near future, clients will no longer buy the agency, but rather the agency’s algorithm for advertising, media and experience activation.”

‘Intelligence beyond identity’

Choreograph’s Hanlon acknowledges an element of “intellectual sparring” in the air as the two approaches butt heads. But InfoSum-bolstered WPP is doubly bullish on its ‘intelligence beyond identity’ strategy.

The argument is two-fold: that acquiring data to develop understandings of identity alone is insufficient for the marketing environment and that what WPP is building – capped off by the InfoSum acquisition – helps marketers plug the gaps of identity with whatever their most salient data sources are at the time.

First, the negative element. Identity alone, Hanlon says, is a “very good data set – but it’s not the only one and it’s less and less useable today,” with increases in privacy protection, cookie opt-outs and untrackable browsers. Worse, he says, identity alone is inherently backward-looking. “If you’re only focused on the data that you can acquire, you’re going to miss-serve your clients because you’re looking at a very narrow slice of the world – one that is frequently archaic, using antiquated technologies, that gives you a really great look back at what has happened but doesn’t give you a lot of predictive power about what is going to happen in the future.”

The answer, Hanlon says, is AI, data connectivity and building an environment to do that data connection quickly and securely – enter InfoSum. “Look at the challenge and the opportunity of what AI lets us do – which is to associate lots of different data domains, data types and data models for apples-to-apples comparisons in ways that we couldn’t before (fast and slow data; big and small data; panel and census data; US data and UK data), in ways that are privacy safe, leaving the data where it sits. It was clear to us that we needed a technology like InfoSum to help us move to the speed at the speed that we need to.”

Amid all the talk of identity, this reintroduces a pair of concepts, not long ago dominant, that are talked about less when providers are looking to amass as many identity-resolved ‘profiles’ of real people as possible: data privacy and safety. For InfoSum’s Wetzel, this is the true core of her company. “The mission we’ve been on is acknowledging and calling out the way data has been used to power, generically speaking, data-driven advertising. It has just never been the right method. Handing data over, moving data, leakage of data: it’s not good for privacy. It’s awful for security. And it needs to be rearchitected. Forget whether you own data or not, asking your clients to ‘please send me your data’ – it just has to stop. And being closed about the value has to stop.”

She adds: “It needs to be open and transparent. The tenets of privacy protection are critical because it’s just not going to go away. It doesn’t matter if there’s regulation or not. Consumers care. Brands take a long time to build trust with their consumer and they can lose it in a second. I find our agenda being warmly embraced by CMOs who just don’t want to take any of that risk on.”

As for Publicis’s comments about the inefficiencies of renting over owning data: “I would check the receipts,” says Wetzel. “[Publicis] is going to prove the value of acquiring Lotame and Epsilon and it absolutely is passing that charge back. It is packaging it with media and the data that it owns and probably some consulting services and a handful of other things, but it is absolutely passing that cost and pocketing the money for it”.

So, the respectful disagreement between the identity school and the intelligence school doesn’t look likely to end soon. And as Nicole Greene, vice-president and analyst specializing in AI at Gartner, tells The Drum, AI’s still-early-days spread into every corner of the marketing ecosystem will only intensify the great data debate: “AI requires quality data, so it’s no surprise that holding companies are racing to position themselves for the AI-enabled advertising future. The battle lines are drawn around privacy, security and the depth of consumer insights, with each company tooling up to meet the demands of an increasingly data-driven, privacy-centric advertising landscape.”",https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-prod/s3/opinion/355641/wpp_infosum.png?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format,N,,2025-04-08 12:24:28.886724

The overhaul will see Barclays drop its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) quotas in the US after Donald Trump declared war on “woke” in corporate America.

C. S. Venkatakrishnan, Barclays’ chief executive who is also known as Venkat, said the move followed a review of its policies in the wake of Mr Trump’s electoral victory late last year.

The bank will retain its diversity targets in the UK and other markets.

A Barclays spokesman said: “We started reviewing our overall approach in late 2024 and that review is still underway. In the meantime, we have taken the decision to no longer have specific US representation ambitions.

“Our representation ambitions for the rest of the group will continue, and are being considered as part of the review.”

The changes will see Barclays scrap ambitions to have 33pc of its director and managing director roles held by women by the end of this year, as well as plans to increase the number of ethnic minority executives by 50pc.

In a memo seen by Bloomberg, Mr Venkatakrishnan said: “The group executive committee has been carefully considering the changed environment in the US.

“As a global organisation, we have always complied with the local requirements in the jurisdictions in which we have operated. In doing so, we have remained faithful to our workplace culture.”

Barclays’ decision comes just months after Mr Venkatakrishnan in February told reporters the British bank was committed to creating an “inclusive environment”.

Speaking on the bank’s fourth-quarter earnings call, the Barclays boss said: “If you want to get the very best people, by necessity, you get a very diverse workforce. We want to provide equality of opportunity, and we want to create that inclusive environment.”

The reversal follows the Trump administration’s far-reaching campaign against corporate DEI initiatives that has seen the US president ban all diversity programmes in the US federal government.

Top banks including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup have watered down their own DEI programmes in response to the Trump administration’s pushback.

JP Morgan rebranded its own DEI initiatives under the name Diversity, Opportunity and Inclusion (DOI) last month.

Major British firms including Deloitte have also scrapped their DEI programmes in the US while keeping them in place in Britain, in response to President Trump’s attacks.

At the end of 2023, 30pc of Barclays’ executives were women, while 5.1pc of its staff in Britain and 21pc of its employees in the US were from “under-represented minorities”, according to the bank’s most recent DEI report.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2025/04/08/TELEMMGLPICT000355798800_17441247866040_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-04-08 12:22:07.007382

The labels for argenx’s Vyvgart, in its intravenous and subcutaneous forms, state the safety of delivering ongoing doses less than 50 days apart hasn’t been established. The figure for UCB’s Rystiggo is 63 days.

J&J, which acquired nipocalimab in its $6.5 billion takeover of Momenta Pharmaceuticals, has made the case that its FcRn blocker should be safer than rival molecules because it is highly specific to the IgG binding site without overlap on the albumin binding site. Consistent nipocalimab dosing could support sustained disease control, strengthening J&J’s play for the gMG market and other indications.

However, the company will face a well-established rival in gMG. Argenx won approval in 2021 and later launched a subcutaneous version. The biotech has pointed to the established safety profile of Vyvgart as a factor that could help it hold off competition.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/GettyImages-183536286_0.jpg?VersionId=oagu4K16lMogfjbq8j5qRmH2EYY3sKha,N,,2025-04-08 14:11:06.654058

The McDonald’s McRig doesn’t drive itself, and it certainly doesn’t cook its own burgers.","Why was McDonald’s McRig Created?

The McRig was created with one goal in mind: to show up when people need it most. When disaster strikes and communities are left picking up the pieces, this fully equipped mobile kitchen rolls in, bringing hot meals and a sense of normalcy to those who need it. Whether it’s hurricanes, wildfires, or local events, the McRig is ready to lend a helping spatula.

The McDonald’s McRig is equipped with state-of-the-art kitchen facilities, allowing it to prepare and serve a wide range of McDonald's menu items. The truck is also designed to be self-sufficient, with its own power and water supply, allowing it to operate in areas with limited infrastructure.

How Does McDonald’s McRig Support Local Communities?

When deployed, the McRig is run by local franchisees in the impacted areas to provide immediate support after disasters. Each meal donation that the McRig offers underscores McDonald's commitment to supporting local communities.

One of its standout moments came in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian in 2022. In collaboration with its local Florida franchisees, the McDonald’s McRig delivered 17,000 free hot meals to residents in Southwest Florida. Over four days, the McRig, provided freshly prepared grab-and-go meal delivery, including cheeseburgers, McNuggets, French fries, apple slices, and bottled water.

The McDonald’s McRig doesn’t drive itself, and it certainly doesn’t cook its own burgers. It’s powered by an incredible team of logistics pros, operations, and community members who ensure that everything runs smoothly.

The team is responsible for ensuring the McRig is always ready to deploy at a moment's notice. This includes regular maintenance, stocking the truck with necessary supplies, and coordinating with local authorities and organizations.

The operations team oversees the actual deployment, ensuring the McRig is set up and functioning efficiently at the disaster site.

Community members play a crucial part in identifying areas where the McRig's support is needed most. They work closely with non-profit organizations and government agencies to ensure the McRig's efforts are aligned with the needs of the affected population. This collaborative approach ensures that the McRig can provide the most support possible.

The McRig is a reminder that in tough times a warm meal can make all the difference and embodies our commitment to leaving a positive impact on the communities we serve.",https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/logo/mcd_corp_social_feed_default.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 12:24:08.110183

The Tech in the UK 2024 report from Barclays Eagle Labs shows where high-growth businesses (such as scaleups and academic spinouts) are concentrated outside London, highlighting how these are contributing to their local economy. It uses Gross Value Added (GVA) as a comparable measure of the economic contribution of businesses to these regions.

The report shows that local areas with 100+ high-growth companies boast an average Gross Value Added (GVA) per business of £294k, compared to just £27.5k for those with less than 100. Manchester benefits the most from its businesses, which contributed £30bn to the area in 2022.

Edinburgh is home to 450+ high-growth tech companies, where Scottish Enterprise plays a key role in commercialising research for carve outs. 198 deals were signed here between 2020-24.

Bristol also benefits from efforts between universities, such as Brunel Centre, a joint data hub between the University of Bath and UWE. Last year investment was up 10% at £167m, with Bristol’s wider deeptech cluster “Silicon Gorge” now spanning Bristol, Gloucester and Swindon.

However, boosting local economies isn’t simply down to higher numbers. Cambridge and Leeds are each home to 280 high-growth companies – in Cambridge, whilst every £1 spent by businesses contributed to £8 of economic impact, businesses in Leeds contributed quadruple the impact due to its broader base of industries.

Investment in Cambridge last year passed half a billion, whilst the wider Yorkshire & Humber region (with Leeds) received just £179m. Continuing to invest in diverse economic hubs across the North of England can be seen as a priority on this basis.

Access to finance remains key for these high growth businesses across the UK, although almost 7 in 10 (68%) report they are aware of all the financing options relevant to them.

Sam's Club and Costco: What Will They Do?
With Sam's Club and Costco closing on Easter Sunday, consumers who need to make quick purchases might turn to Albertsons.
Sam's Club and Costco specialize in wholesale sales, but consumers can't always wait for their stores to open after Easter Sunday.","With Easter just around the corner, Albertsons has made a strategic decision that could change the market dynamics. The supermarket chain has announced that its stores, including brands like Safeway, Vons, Jewel-Osco, Tom Thumb, and ACME, will be open on Easter Sunday, April 20, 2025. This move is a blow to its competitors, like Sam's Club and Costco, which usually close on holidays.

A Key Move to Attract Customers

Easter Sunday is a crucial date for shopping, especially for those who need fresh products and essential items for family celebrations. While many large chains close their doors, Albertsons has decided to open to offer more convenience to consumers. This move aims to attract those who need to make last-minute purchases.

Albertsons stands out for its strategy of opening on key holidays, which puts it in an advantageous position against its competitors. Sam's Club and Costco, known for their low prices and bulk products, usually limit their hours or close completely during holidays like this. This can cause frustration among consumers who rely on these stores at critical times.

Albertsons: Flexible Hours Depending on Location

Although most Albertsons stores will be open, the company has warned that hours may vary depending on the location. Customers will need to check their local store hours, as these may be adjusted according to local regulations or demand in each area. This flexibility is key to ensuring that consumers can access products without complications.

Opening on Easter Sunday also shows Albertsons's commitment to customer convenience. In an increasingly competitive market, where online shopping is rapidly growing, offering physical shopping options is an advantage that not many competitors can offer on holidays.

Sam's Club and Costco: What Will They Do?

Albertsons's announcement comes at a key moment. With Sam's Club and Costco closing on Easter Sunday, consumers who need to make quick purchases might turn to Albertsons. Both competitors, despite offering attractive prices, have a policy of closing on these days. This behavior could put Albertsons in a dominant position.

Sam's Club and Costco specialize in wholesale sales, but consumers can't always wait for their stores to open after Easter Sunday. Therefore, Albertsons's decision to keep its doors open represents a clear advantage over these retail giants.

Convenience as a Key Factor

Convenience is a crucial factor in shopping. On dates like Easter Sunday, consumers are not only looking for low prices but also the ability to access fresh and essential products. Albertsons's opening during this holiday allows them to gain the preference of those who need to shop without complications.

This approach also reinforces Albertsons's image as an accessible supermarket chain, willing to adapt to consumer needs. At a time when shopping habits are changing, decisions like this could be key.

Long-Term Impact for Albertsons

Albertsons's move has a potential long-term impact. Opening on holidays can result in an increase in sales, which in turn strengthens the relationship with consumers. People who benefit from this flexible schedule might feel more inclined to choose Albertsons for future purchases.

Moreover, this opening strategy can be an example for other supermarket chains that traditionally choose to close on important holidays. If Albertsons achieves good results with this measure, it is likely that other brands will be motivated to follow their example.",https://edatv.news/filesedc/uploads/image/post/exterior-albertsons-tienda_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-04-08 12:22:02.329828

While serving 18 million customers across 24 markets in Asia and Africa, a leading APAC insurer identified an opportunity to enhance efficiency by integrating and automating its systems. However, doing so would require modernizing the organization’s Singaporean operations.

The insurer’s legacy business process management system forced employees to navigate multiple applications for essential tasks. This included viewing allocated tasks, accessing medical and non-medical documents in content manager, and reviewing underwriting decisions in their existing tool. In addition, users had to track case statuses and histories, including audit trails, in a separate policy administration system. The company envisioned a one-stop solution to simplify key activities like risk assessment, policy issuance, and claims management and eliminate inefficiencies.

To realize this vision, the insurer partnered with Capgemini, leveraging its extensive experience in similar transformations and its technical expertise to deliver a seamless solution.

Building a new workflow application

Capgemini and the insurer collaborated through a series of workshops spread out over three months which provided an opportunity to analyze key processes, such as new business, policy servicing, and claims, and identify where automation could most effectively support additional efficiency.

The solution involved developing a low-code/no-code cloud-based workflow application to streamline operations and reduce reliance on legacy systems. Leveraging its partnership with IBM, Capgemini implemented a BPM workflow with a customized UX/UI aligned to the insurer’s enterprise architecture. A laser focus on change management ensured a smooth transition, while a flowchart-style rules engine and automation tools enhanced decision-making and operational efficiency overall.

Scalable efficiency

The scalable platform, with key features like case segregation based on underwriting (UW) and straight-through processing (STP) decisions, and automatic allocation to user groups based on customer segments, UW decisions, and plan types, were developed during this transformation. This has significantly reduced policy issuance timelines. A unified dashboard set up, now consolidates all relevant information, ensuring a seamless user experience and supporting further digital transformation.

To significantly reduce reliance on multiple applications and cutting turnaround times, the system also introduced the auto distribution feature, which enabled load balancing while accounting for employees’ availability and defined case parameters. This allows the processing of hundreds of policies daily.

The transformation enabled a 60% increase in end-to-end straight-through processing for new business by integrating multi-channel application submissions, automated data extraction, classification, and a unified UW workbench. For policy servicing, it automated simple transactions, eliminated back-office dependencies, updated core systems for renewals, and streamlined standard non-financial services.

Additionally, claims operations benefited from the introduction of STP with electronic submissions, rule-based assignments, and skill-based workflows. This enabled a data-driven and automated workflow approach, now improving processes across new business, policy servicing, and claims, improving efficiency and operational outcomes.

Capgemini continues to maintain the application, with plans to scale the transformation further. As a next step, the insurer is set to roll out these solutions in other Asian regions, extending the benefits of the initiative. As the partnership evolves, Capgemini remains committed to supporting the insurer’s efforts to optimize services and claims processes.",https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Leading-APAC-insurer-client-story-web-preview-image.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 14:10:55.603182

Analysts' assessment points toward 'Revenue- Securities Services- Total revenue' reaching $2.26 billion.
The consensus among analysts is that 'Revenue- Investment and Wealth Management- Total revenue' will reach $840.26 million.
According to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Total Capital Ratio (Standardized Approach)' should come in at 14.9%.","The upcoming report from The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $1.49 per share, indicating an increase of 15.5% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $4.74 billion, representing an increase of 4.6% year over year.

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has undergone a downward revision of 1.4% in the past 30 days, bringing it to its present level. This represents how the covering analysts, as a whole, have reassessed their initial estimates during this timeframe.

Prior to a company's earnings release, it is of utmost importance to factor in any revisions made to the earnings projections. These revisions serve as a critical gauge for predicting potential investor behaviors with respect to the stock. Empirical studies consistently reveal a strong link between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.

While it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.

Given this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific The Bank of New York Mellon metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.

The combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Revenue- Market and Wealth Services- Total revenue' will likely reach $1.60 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +5.6% year over year.

Eli Lilly, uh, talking about 27 billion for four manufacturing, uh, uh, buildouts in the in the coming years.
We do know that any additional manufacturing like, uh, that already exists here, any capacity that already exists here is really going to benefit getting, you know, that windfall from anyone scrambling to to get their, uh, manufacturing going.","Shares of Walgreens sticking higher this morning after the company reported an earnings beat for the second quarter, as it prepares to go private. Walgreens was the worst performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2024, but has recovered some ground in 2025. Here with more on everything happening around Walgreens Boots Alliance, we've got Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Where do you want to start on, because we've got the earnings, we got the company going private, there's a lot swirling.

Yeah, I know. It's a lot. I'll start with the company going private because that actually shifts how we're gonna be covering earnings, of course, once they go private, but also for right now they've completely cut us off. No, I'm kidding. They don't have an earnings call today. So I don't have additional context for you other than what the numbers say, and that's something, um, that we're gonna have to deal with moving forward. They've also pulled 2025 guidance, and that has not seemed to impact the stock negatively, as you noted it is up today. But let's take a look at the numbers and what they said, beat on the revenue, expected 38, beat with 36 38.6 billion. And then not just did earnings per share at 63 cents rather than 53. Now, wanna look at some of the other numbers, cuz we know that they're still in a cost management mode. So while they have reduced the loss since the quarter last year, uh, CEO Tim Wentworth sent a statement that the strategy to reduce cost is still in play and will take some time and so that's what we're looking at. Uh, loss per share, uh, in total $3.30 versus Q2 of 2024, which was $6.85. So that's something to keep in mind. Meanwhile, um, looking at the decrease, um, in the revenue this year had a little bit to do with tax rate front-end slow stores, slow sales at front of store, but then also, uh, a hit through legal settlements. So 969 million of legal payments, and that is from an old case with Everlywell, a COVID testing company that they had, uh, some disagreements with on how they partnered. And then an and then opioid related settlements still weighing on the company. So that's something to keep an eye on as they continue their trajectory into privatization.

It's, I can't think of a better time to have the excuse of privatization to be able to cut your forward guidance that really works out for Walgreens in this moment. I I do wanna get your take on Julian and another story in your beat that we are monitoring, which is CVS making some leadership changes this morning. What can you tell us?

Yeah. So that's an interesting one, because, um, going from one company to the other, CVS the last one standing in this really large retail drug space, um, the last ryan and having to deal with its own moves. We know that they had to shift through their CEOs, they had a shake up there now, David Joyner is CEO. And so now they're bringing in Brian Newman as the new CFO replacing, uh, Tom Cowey. And so Brian has been at UPS and other retail companies. So that's an interesting fit there, even though we know CVS has done a lot more in the health delivery space. They have a CFO in the retail space there. And then a new executive vice president and Chief Medical Officer, Amy Compton Phillips. Uh, looks like she's gonna be taking over that role from uh, Sricharu who's also taking on who also has another role as, uh, president of healthcare delivery. So a little shift there. So interesting moves right now, as we know the company is, uh, you know, dealing with some of the same pressures that Walgreens was facing in terms of, you know, weakness in front of store sales and just all the changes that are coming down the pike with prescriptions, PBMs, etcetera. So should be interesting to see how this pans out.

You know, investors have heard us talk a lot about healthcare at the start of this year and and and here from fact set is perhaps one of the most important markers of why. Healthcare sector expected to report the highest year of year earnings growth rate of all 11 sectors at 35.8%. You think about the industry and the sector right now, US drug manufacturers, they're planning a lot of shifts right now too. How are they planning for shifts under President Trump's tariffs as well though that are moving for?

We saw this before the tariffs were even announced. We have major companies like Johnson and Johnson, Eli Lilly and Merck announcing multi-billion dollar projects for shifting manufacturing to the US. You can see on your screen the numbers there, Johnson and Johnson with that 55 billion. Eli Lilly, uh, talking about 27 billion for four manufacturing, uh, uh, buildouts in the in the coming years. All of this is a long-term process though. And so in the meantime, in the interim, while these tariffs start to take place, we know that the manufacturing of drugs wasn't heavily hit by tariffs, but there are going to be announcements of, uh, terrorists that do affect pharma and so that's what they're expecting. And so in that interim, these companies have sort of ahead of the curve, tried to make announcements and and curry favor with the administration. We do know that any additional manufacturing like, uh, that already exists here, any capacity that already exists here is really going to benefit getting, you know, that windfall from anyone scrambling to to get their, uh, manufacturing going. It's also interesting to note that, uh, it is very company specific, um, and also pharma subsector specific, because medical devices are still going to be impacted by those tariffs, and that's an a subsector that is trying to work with the administration to come out of impact as well.

Health care giant Johnson & Johnson is one of the most well-known and respected brands, and its response to the 1982 tampering of Tylenol bottles that killed seven people is held up in business schools as a model.

But in “No More Tears: The Dark Secrets of Johnson & Johnson,” veteran reporter Gardiner Harris uses his investigative skills to scrutinize the legacy of the company, as well as that of federal regulators. What he unveils is a damning portrait.

It’s a story that Harris writes “has been hiding in plain sight for a very long time,” but his comprehensively reported and researched book goes much further.

Harris takes a deeper dive in looking at Johnson & Johnson’s history, including the story behind the litigation against the company that it settled for billions of dollars over its baby powder containing talc powder.

He details a litany of controversies involving the company ranging from the effects of its anti-psychotic drug Risperdal to the company’s role in the nation’s opioid crisis.

But Harris doesn’t spare others from scrutiny or criticism with his book. Namely, he focuses on what he calls the false mythology of the Food and Drug Administration, detailing times when the agency fell short of protecting consumers.

He also trains his eye on the American media itself, noting ways that reporters at times portrayed the FDA’s actions against drugmakers as tougher than they really were.

Similarly, Bolt was working on a balloon catheter when it accepted Boston Scientific’s offer.
The use of balloons makes the investigational devices potential competitors to J&J products such as Shockwave C2.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Dive Brief:

Johnson & Johnson said Monday it has enrolled the first patient in a pivotal study of a device for clearing “difficult-to-cross” coronary arteries.

Like other products made by J&J’s Shockwave Medical, the Javelin intravascular lithotripsy catheter uses sound pressure waves to break up calcium deposits that are blocking blood flow.

The device is differentiated from other Shockwave products, and rival catheters from Abbott and Boston Scientific, because it emits waves from its tip. Other devices send waves from a balloon catheter that must cross the blocked part of the artery to be effective.

Dive Insight:

Shockwave revealed the Javelin device at an investor event in October 2023, months before accepting a $13.1 billion buyout bid from J&J. The company developed Javelin after recognizing that balloon-based catheters are unable to pass through some vessels. If physicians cannot get a balloon across a vessel, they cannot use Shockwave’s other IVL devices to remove calcium deposits.

By miniaturizing its IVL technology, Shockwave developed a catheter capable of emitting waves from its tip. Rather than crossing the artery and then emitting waves from the balloon, the device sends out IVL pulses from the tip to clear deposits and allow the catheter to advance along the vessel.

The Food and Drug Administration cleared a Javelin device for use in peripheral vessels last year, opening up more of the below-the-knee market. The new study will enroll up to 158 patients across around 35 sites in the U.S. and U.K. to generate data to unlock more of the coronary market.

J&J’s investment in Javelin technology could provide a point of difference versus companies that are mounting challenges for the IVL market. Boston Scientific recently entered the space by agreeing to pay $443 million upfront for Bolt Medical. Abbott acquired an IVL program in 2023 as part of its $890 million takeover of Cardiovascular Systems and received approval to start a trial in the U.S. last month.

Abbott’s device uses a balloon to widen parts of the arteries that are narrowed by calcium. Similarly, Bolt was working on a balloon catheter when it accepted Boston Scientific’s offer. The use of balloons makes the investigational devices potential competitors to J&J products such as Shockwave C2.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/MaOYX5e0YyLMdtsLierlo-ryQchxIJMACDO_iSEmRhg/g:nowe:0:0/c:1732:978/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzczMjYxMzY1LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-04-08 12:23:50.237552

The poll of 3,023 workers across the U.S. focused on perks and benefits that drive employee retention. While competitive pay continues to draw headlines, the results show that generous leave policies, health care offerings and lifestyle benefits are equally — and sometimes more — important in keeping employees engaged.

In New Jersey, Johnson & Johnson secured the top spot for its robust family support offerings. The company provides 18–20 weeks of paid maternity leave (based on tenure), 12 weeks for all new parents, and up to $20,000 per child for adoption or surrogacy. Other benefits include on-site fitness centers, global mental health support and dual-career assistance — all helping it stand out among working parents and employees at every life stage.

Nationally, the top five employers based on perks and benefits were:

Google (California)

Famous for its over-the-top workplace culture, Google still offers perks like free gourmet meals, nap pods, laundry services and on-site gyms. More importantly, it provides generous family leave, fertility assistance and premium health benefits. While some of the flashier perks have been scaled back in recent years, the company continues to lead in employee experience.

The Coca-Cola Co. (Georgia)

Atlanta-based Coca-Cola offers a rare combination of a traditional pension plan with a 401(k) match, along with solid health insurance, tuition reimbursement and adoption support. Its “Total Rewards” approach ensures that both financial and personal well-being are covered.

Ben & Jerry’s (Vermont)

In South Burlington, Ben & Jerry’s blends social values with standout perks: six months of paid parental leave, livable wages and a famously sweet benefit — three free pints of ice cream a day. The company’s relaxed culture and emphasis on personal freedom make it a favorite in Vermont.

Hawaiian Airlines (Hawaii)

As Hawaii’s largest airline, Hawaiian Airlines gives employees — and their families — unlimited standby flights, 20 guest passes a year, and profit-sharing bonuses. The company’s culture of hospitality extends to its internal team, with a focus on loyalty and long-term support.

Nike (Oregon)

Nike emphasizes work-life balance through generous PTO, flexible schedules, and sabbaticals for long-tenured employees. Wellness programs, tuition reimbursement and career advancement paths reinforce its commitment to employee growth. Perks also include discounts on Nike and Converse gear, early product drops, and daycare options at some locations.

“These findings show that salary alone doesn’t seal the deal,” said Raymond Lee, president of Careerminds. “Companies that invest in holistic employee experiences — from mental health to long-term financial planning — are building the workplaces where people want to stay and grow.”",https://images.roi-nj.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/leadership_business_goals_challenges_success.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 12:23:54.195144

“Partnerships with tourism boards, festival organizers, local government or cultural institutions can enhance destination appeal and encourage repeat visits,” he added.

JetPac is also doubling down on peak-season readiness by incentivising affiliate partners with competitive commissions and exclusive offerings.

“We [also] offer lounge access at discounted rates whenever a customer purchases a travel e-sim with JetPac,” said Jun Kai, Commercial Lead at JetPac. “We also offer free lounge access if your flight is ever delayed.”

Furness stressed that affiliate and influencer marketing are critical channels during high-traffic seasons. “By partnering with travel-focused content creators and affiliates… brands can stay top of mind and drive repeat bookings through trusted recommendations,” he said.

Data also plays a key role in adjusting peak season strategies on the fly.

“The most successful businesses are leveraging first-party data… integrating that into emerging technologies so they can anticipate travelers’ needs at every touch point,” Furness said. “Machine learning models can predict peak booking periods, adjust pricing, promotions, marketing strategies.”

Jun added that understanding seasonality by geography is critical. “When in Singapore, the Japanese season is just spiking, but it’s very different in the US… so offers have to be really targeted to each individual customer.”",https://www.cmgassets.com/s3fs-public/styles/favicon_192/public/domain_logo/favicon-sbr.png.webp?itok=VZs7ZfhD,N,,2025-04-08 12:23:18.576161

A multi-pronged brand refresh is a core part of this.","After a streak of dull sales, hair care brand Olaplex is hoping an effort to go back to the roots—literally—will help revitalize it.

Olaplex was founded in 2014, starting in the professional channel at salons before expanding into retail. The company launched on DTC and into specialty retailers like Sephora in 2018, and went public and expanded into Ulta stores in 2021.

The brand has had its struggles since going public, including a since-denied class action lawsuit and slipping sales, particularly in the professional channel. Former Supergoop CEO Amanda Baldwin took over as chief exec in December 2023 to begin a turnaround. In its most recent earnings reported in March, net sales dropped 9.8%, with professional sales down 27.1%, though specialty retail rose 5.7%. On that earnings call, Baldwin introduced the brand’s new “Bonds and Beyond strategic vision,” comprising three pillars: shifting its products and messaging beyond treating damage to “foundational hair health,” fostering its professional business, and creating an “emotional connection” with consumers.

A multi-pronged brand refresh is a core part of this. While Olaplex’s products were designed and marketed to treat damage from hair coloring, CMO Katie Gohman told Retail Brew, lately the company has found that “the visual identity wasn’t really representing everything that the brand could do for both stylists as well as consumers.”

“A great brand has an emotional territory in a world that consumers aspire to be a part of,” Gohman said.

Split ends: This refresh has been in the works for about a year, Gohman said. She joined Olaplex last July, after serving as CMO at Marc Jacobs (her retail résumé also includes Ralph Lauren, Coach, and L’Oréal), and began building out its marketing team, focused on digital, media, and analytics, she said. The company brought on Andrew Reuben, another Ralph Lauren alum, as VP of global digital marketing and media in January, with other recent hires including a director of global digital marketing and media and a digital designer of global creative, per LinkedIn.

“How do you then bring the brand to life and to market? That was a muscle that hadn’t really been built here,” Gohman said.

With the refresh, Olaplex has changed “almost all consumer-facing communication touch points,” she said. That includes a new visual identity with an updated logo, a new website unveiled in February (with user experience and interface redone), and a relaunched social presence.

It has also rolled out updated in-store merchandising with both retail and professional partners, as Gohman said Olaplex had received feedback that its product line was “extremely confusing and people didn’t understand how to shop it.” Now, at retail partners, the first shelf highlights the focus on foundational hair health including its latest product innovation N°0.5 Scalp Longevity Treatment. The next shelves zero in on the wash routine—shampoo, conditioner, and masks—followed by a shelf for styling products like hair oil.

“We worked on what we call internally a product architecture but really is, ‘How does the consumer navigate the line?’ she said. “It was all about really making that journey easier for the consumer.”

Framing the face: That all culminated in a brand campaign released last week featuring the tagline “Designed to Defy,” with a spot featuring actress Nicola Coughlan, fashion designer and former J. Crew president and creative director Jenna Lyons, and Olympic sprinter Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone alongside Olaplex pro stylists emphasizing the “confidence” and “endless possibilities” a good hair day presents. This represents a new effort to center stylists in its communications, Gohman said, noting they “help tell our story the best.”

It’s also extending this campaign into an IRL experience—an element younger generations of consumers “demands,” Gohman said—which has come in the form of the Olaplex Bond House in New York City on April 4, a series of events for consumers including a digital hair analysis scan.

With the campaign, beyond just sales, KPIs Gohman is zeroing in on include earned media value (how much people are talking about the brand in media), search interest, and—longer term—brand health (measuring perception and awareness), to ensure the brand is “making progress on our values and on the emotional territory in the spaces that we want to grow.”

The Designed to Defy campaign is a step in creating that emotional connection Baldwin had referenced, Gohman said. The company learned that connection was lacking through field research, asking consumers questions like “What does the brand make you feel?” and recognizing those scores came up short, though she said there was no negative feedback about the products’ efficacy.

“As a marketer and even just a consumer in general, I think you know the brands that you feel something when you see their work or you aspire to be a part of that world, and those that you don’t,” she said.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/18a37dc42391399c35275ce9a8e5f8b798c4bc25-6289x6590.jpg?rect=0,1644,6289,3302&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-04-08 12:25:00.064026

The company expects its gross margin to expand by 100 basis points (bps), reaching approximately 61.6 per cent, up from a base of 60.6 per cent. The adjusted EBIT margin is projected to rise to between 11.4 and 11.6 per cent YoY, revised upward from the original guidance of 10.9 to 11.1 per cent, which was based on a 10.2 per cent base.

Levi Strauss & Co expects FY25 organic net revenue growth of 3.5–4.5 per cent, with gross margin projected at 61.6 per cent and adjusted EBIT margin at 11.4–11.6 per cent.

The adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) is projected between $1.20 and $1.25, including an estimated $0.20 impact from foreign exchange (FX) and a higher tax rate. The updated outlook excludes any potential impact from the recently announced tariffs, Levi Strauss said in a press release.

In the first quarter (Q1) of 2025, the company generated revenue of $1.5 billion, marking a 3 per cent increase on a reported basis and 9 per cent growth on an organic basis compared to Q1 2024.

The Levi’s brand was up 8 per cent globally on an organic basis. The gross margin increased 330 bps to 62.1 per cent from 58.8 per cent in Q1 2024 primarily driven by lower product costs and favourable channel and brand mix.

In Europe, net revenues decreased 5 per cent on a reported basis and increased 3 per cent on an organic basis.

Net revenues from e-commerce grew 13 per cent on a reported basis and 16 per cent on an organic basis. DTC comprised 52 per cent of total net revenues in the first quarter. Wholesale net revenues decreased 3 per cent on a reported basis and increased 5 per cent on an organic basis.

The operating margin of the company in Q1 2025 was 12.5 per cent compared to 0.04 per cent in Q1 2024. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 400 bps to 13.4 per cent from 9.4 per cent last year on a reported basis primarily due to higher gross margin.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $749 million compared to $756 million in Q1 2024. Adjusted SG&A was up 1.7 per cent to $744 million compared to $731 million last year. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A was 48.7 per cent compared to 49.4 per cent last year.

The company’s net income from continuing operations was $140 million compared to net loss from continuing operations of $10 million in Q1 2024.

Balance Sheet Review as of March 2, 2025

Cash and cash equivalents were $574 million, while total liquidity was approximately $1.4 billion.

Total inventories increased 7% on a dollar basis. We have secured the majority of inventory required to meet U.S. orders for Q2.

Shareholder Returns

The company returned approximately $81 million to shareholders in the first quarter, a 12% increase over prior year, including:

Dividends of $51 million, representing a dividend of $0.13 per share.

Share repurchases of $30 million, reflecting 1.6 million shares retired.

As of March 2, 2025, the company had $560 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization, which has no expiration date.

The company has declared a dividend of $0.13 per share totaling approximately $51 million. The dividend is payable in cash on May 9, to the holders of record of Class A common stock and Class B common stock at the close of business on April 24.

Fiscal 2025 Guidance

Guidance for 2025 is based on continuing operations, reflecting the Dockers® business being reported in discontinued operations. Financial results for prior periods have been recast to exclude discontinued operations.

The company’s fiscal 2025 guidance remains unchanged other than to reflect the Dockers® business as a discontinued operation and does not reflect any impact from the recently announced tariffs.

This outlook also assumes no significant worsening of macro-economic pressures on the consumer, inflationary pressures, recessionary concerns, supply chain disruptions, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions taken in response to such tariffs, or currency impacts. Adjusted diluted EPS is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and the rules of the SEC. To supplement its financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital to provide investors with additional useful information about its financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operating decision-making. The company presents these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing its financial performance from management's view and because it believes they provide an additional tool for investors to use in computing the company's core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. The tables found below present Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital and corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Certain items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company’s actual financial condition and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management in determining how they are formulated. Some specific limitations include but are not limited to, the fact that such non-GAAP financial measures: (a) do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or liabilities including pension obligations, post-retirement health benefit obligations and income tax liabilities; (b) do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital requirements; and (c) do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business. See “RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES” below for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-currency

The company reports net revenues in accordance with GAAP, as well as on an organic net revenues basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our revenues which excludes the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates from the change in reported net revenues, net revenues derived from business acquisitions or divestitures impacting the previous 12 months of the reporting date and the estimated impact of any 53rd week. The company reports certain operating results in accordance with GAAP, as well as on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.

The term foreign currency exchange rates refers to the exchange rates used to translate the company's operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar into U.S. Dollars. Because the company is a global company, foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on its reported results. In general, the company's financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. Dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. Dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which it conducts its business. References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency translation fluctuations.

The company calculates constant-currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the prior-year period at actual foreign currency exchange rates for the current period. Constant-currency results do not eliminate the transaction currency impact, which primarily includes the realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized from the measurement and remeasurement of purchases and sales of products in a currency other than the functional currency and of forward foreign exchange contracts.

The company believes disclosure of organic net revenues and Adjusted EBIT constant-currency, Adjusted EBIT Margin constant-currency and Adjusted Net Income constant-currency results are helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of its results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. However, organic net revenues and constant-currency results are non-GAAP financial measures and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should be read in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have limitations in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2025

The following information relates to non-GAAP financial measures, and should be read in conjunction with the investor call held on April 7, 2025, discussing the company’s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the quarter and year ended March 2, 2025. Because the results of our Dockers® business are classified as discontinued operations, those results are not reflected in our non-GAAP measures.

We define the following non-GAAP measures as follows:

Adjusted SG&A:

The following table presents a reconciliation of SG&A, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted SG&A for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Net Income:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted net income for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share:

The following table presents a reconciliation of diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted diluted earnings per share for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow:

Adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, includes net cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment from continuing and discontinued operations. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available after capital expenditures for operational expenses and investment in our business. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is useful to investors because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet, invest in future growth and return capital to stockholders.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted free cash flow for each of the periods presented.

Return on Invested Capital:

We define Return on invested capital (""ROIC"") as the trailing four quarters of Adjusted net income before interest and after taxes divided by the average trailing five quarters of total invested capital. We define earnings before interest and after taxes as Adjusted net income plus interest expense and income tax expense less an income tax adjustment. We define total invested capital as total debt plus shareholders' equity less cash and short-term investments. We believe ROIC is useful to investors as it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business.

Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric Adjusted net income. Although ROIC is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROIC. As a result, the method we use to calculate our ROIC may differ from the methods used by other companies. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP.

The table below sets forth the calculation of ROIC for each of the periods presented.

Wastewater management is a critical yet complex challenge for pet food processors. High organic loads, fats and cleaning chemicals create a difficult-to-treat wastewater stream, requiring a combination of physical and biological processes. At the same time, regulatory pressures continue to evolve, increasing compliance costs and adding another layer of complexity to wastewater treatment strategies.

As sustainability goals take center stage, manufacturers are turning to advanced treatment technologies to improve efficiency, reduce costs and minimize their environmental impact. From dissolved air flotation (DAF) systems to digital monitoring tools and water reuse strategies, processors are optimizing wastewater treatment to meet both operational and regulatory demands.

Common challenges

“Pet food processing facilities often encounter a range of wastewater treatment challenges, including proposed regulations mandating nutrient reduction or removal, surcharges that can reduce profitability, and escalating costs for labor, chemicals, as well as energy,” explained Chris Knodel, professional engineer, industrial wastewater manager, Burns & McDonnell, Kansas City, Mo. “Additional hurdles include fluctuating wastewater flows from cleaning cycles, high pollutant concentrations, and the limitations of aging infrastructure.”

Beyond regulatory and infrastructure challenges, operational inefficiencies further complicate wastewater management. These inefficiencies increase wastewater volumes, drive up treatment costs and create additional compliance hurdles. Identifying and addressing them is essential for improving wastewater management and sustainability.

“Common wastewater challenges often stem from improper management of plant-level issues,” said Kunal Mehta of Ecolab.

“Common wastewater challenges often stem from improper management of plant-level issues,” said Kunal Mehta, senior global account manager, enterprise solutions, Ecolab, Saint Paul, Minn. “Valve failure, uncontrolled product losses and excessive water use can all lead to compounding wastewater problems downstream. For example, let’s say the protocol for handling spilled product within a facility is to wash it down the drain. This increases the amount of chemistry required to treat wastewater and risks increasing transportation costs (and emissions) related to transporting effluent and byproducts. In this way, one cleaning and sanitation protocol can directly affect a number of wastewater and other sustainability priorities.”

In addition to these operational inefficiencies, the composition of wastewater itself presents a significant challenge. Pet food processing generates a complex wastewater stream that contains high levels of organic matter, including fats, oils and greases (FOGs), total suspended solids (TSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). These pollutants require specialized treatment before the wastewater can be safely discharged or reused.

“The biggest challenge is rendering and mixing, as well as using other organic ingredients to produce a finished product in pet food facilities similar to other food processing plants,” said John Richert, industrial sales manager, JWC Environmental, Santa Ana, Calif. “This generates a complex wastewater stream high in TSS, BOD/COD, FOGs, ammonia, and other chemical byproducts that must be treated before they can be sent to a municipal system or released to a surface water source.”

“The biggest challenge is rendering and mixing, as well as using other organic ingredients to produce a finished product in pet food facilities similar to other food processing plants,” said John Richert of JWC Environmental.

Fluctuating wastewater volumes introduce additional challenges to treatment efforts. Cleaning cycles and production variability can create inconsistent flow rates, making it difficult for treatment systems to operate efficiently. Many facilities are also relying on aging wastewater infrastructure that was designed for lower production capacities, which can lead to inefficiencies and increased compliance challenges.

“Plant production demands are very dynamic in the pet food industry, so robust and agile systems must be in place throughout the operation to minimize disruption,” said Eric Bradley, business development director, Hawkins, Inc., Roseville, Minn. “Wastewater infrastructure and equipment are often designed for a different operational pace from five or more years ago. Capital projects are usually slower than a current problem demands and more costly than the business desires.”

Effective treatment solutions

To address these challenges, pet food processors are implementing a range of wastewater treatment technologies designed to improve efficiency and maintain compliance.

“Flow equalization helps regulate fluctuating wastewater volumes, while screening efficiently removes large particles,” Knodel said. “Dissolved air flotation (DAF) is highly effective at eliminating oils and suspended solids. Advanced biological treatment systems, such as membrane bioreactors (MBR), moving bed bioreactors (MBBR) and sequencing batch reactors (SBR), provide efficient nutrient removal. Additionally, dewatering equipment minimizes sludge volume and hauling expenses, while asset management and capital planning strategies enable facilities to budget for component replacements and upgrades effectively.”

A key component of these treatment strategies is the use of Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) systems, which help remove FOGs and other suspended solids from wastewater streams.

“Wastewater containing very high levels of FOGs can be pretreated with a grease trap to remove free-floating grease. After one (or both) of these pre-treatment methods, the waste stream is sent to a DAF system for further treatment,” explained John O’Hehir, regional sales manager, Kemco Systems, Clearwater, Fla. “Kemco’s DAF is designed to give the maximum operator flexibility and maximum removal of oils, greases, skimmings and solids. Kemco’s DAF technology offers a centrifugal DAF pump. The multi-phase air saturation pump provides maximum air flotation with minimum maintenance cost and upkeep. The Kemco DAF system is available with chemical coagulant/flocculant mix systems designed to optimize the effectiveness of treatment chemicals.”

In addition to physical and biological treatment, digital monitoring tools are playing an increasing role in wastewater management.

“In the area of cleaning and sanitation, digital monitoring products can help facilities optimize the amount of chemistry they’re using to clean and sanitize core equipment,” Mehta said. “Among other things, this optimization directly impacts the quality of wastewater, which can help streamline the facility’s water management strategy and keep them compliant.”

Sustainability benefits

Effective wastewater treatment not only ensures regulatory compliance but also supports broader sustainability initiatives.

“Wastewater treatment solutions help minimize water usage, reduce nutrient discharges to the environment, and support resource recovery by capturing valuable byproducts such as oils, biogas and reusable water,” Knodel said. “Additionally, advanced technologies and automation systems lower power consumption, further bolstering sustainability initiatives.”

Many processors are implementing wastewater treatment strategies that align with their sustainability objectives. Some focus on meeting discharge requirements, while others invest in water reuse technologies to maximize efficiency.

“Sustainability can be measured in varying ways,” O’Hehir said. “For some processes, the ability to achieve local publicly owned treatment works (POTW) discharge limitations utilizing DAF or ceramic membrane filtration (CMF) technologies allows the processor to provide an acceptable effluent. For other processors where reuse is a goal, the CMF/RO combination removes FOGs, suspended solids, viruses and bacteria, microplastics, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and colors and odors. Because this combination of systems relies on physical processes, it can reduce facilities’ chemical costs. Coupled with thermal stability lessening the demand on boilers and reducing natural gas consumption, the CMF/RO combined system is both an economical and environmentally friendly solution for pet food processing wastewater by recycling both water and energy.”

Advanced digital monitoring solutions are also playing a role in sustainability efforts by improving visibility into water management performance. By tracking key metrics in real time, processors can proactively address wastewater issues and optimize cleaning and sanitation practices.

“Ecolab’s 3D TRASAR Technology for CIP (3DT CIP) helps pet food processors achieve sustainability goals while simultaneously supporting better efficiency,” Mehta said. “By arming facility leadership with better visibility into core cleaning and sanitation and water use metrics, 3DT CIP enables them to respond to potential wastewater issues before they become unmanageable.”

Reducing and reusing

As water costs rise and environmental regulations tighten, pet food processors are looking for ways to minimize wastewater and maximize water reuse. Reducing overall water consumption not only helps control operating expenses but also aligns with sustainability goals and regulatory expectations.

“Pet food processors can take several practical steps to reduce wastewater volume and improve water reuse,” Knodel said. “These include making operational changes to cleaning processes, exploring water reuse opportunities such as irrigation, boiler feed and cooling towers, as well as adopting new technologies like reverse osmosis, evaporation and crystallization. These measures can significantly lower the overall water footprint of pet food processing facilities.”

Identifying the right water reuse opportunities starts with evaluating each stage of processing. Understanding where water can be repurposed within the facility helps processors optimize usage while ensuring compliance with quality and safety standards.

“The challenges presented with reusing water are typically determined by where in the overall process reuse of water would be acceptable,” O’Hehir said. “As pet food processors evaluate the overall use of water and generation of wastewater within each stage of processing, they can identify opportunities for internal reuse within the same stage if the water cannot be reused further downstream.”

Reducing wastewater at the source is just as important as finding ways to reuse it. By preventing unnecessary contaminants from entering the wastewater system, pet food processors can lower treatment costs and improve overall efficiency.

“Three contaminants are universally present in the pet food industry and are the primary drivers of cost to treat: fats, oils, and grease (FOG), total suspended solids (TSS) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD),” Bradley said. “Additional contaminants, such as phosphorus, chlorides, selenium and bacteria load, may also be relevant depending on the site and discharge parameters. Processors should take a fresh look at their systems to find ways to reduce these contaminants before they enter the wastewater stream.

“Reclaim water wherever possible to minimize water volume purchased and wastewater treated,” he added. “Water only needs to be as clean as the use application requires. There may be locations in a plant where one-use water may be fit for a second use, or treated wastewater can be used instead of ‘new’ water.”

Innovations and advancements

As wastewater regulations evolve, pet food processors are turning to automation, digital monitoring and advanced treatment technologies to stay ahead. Investing in these innovations will help optimize efficiency, enhance sustainability, and ensure compliance with stricter environmental standards.

“Innovations and advancements shaping the future of wastewater treatment in the pet food industry include the development of new, cost-competitive technologies for nutrient removal and water reuse, increasing opportunities for resource recovery and emerging incentives to adopt sustainable practices,” Knodel said. “Additional collaborative efforts with stakeholders are also paving the way for more integrated and efficient wastewater management solutions.”

With evolving regulations and increasing environmental concerns, wastewater treatment in the pet food industry will continue to evolve. As compliance standards become more stringent, processors will need to adopt new technologies to meet discharge requirements while maintaining operational efficiency.

“The regulatory landscape drives innovation in this market, and right now there’s a focus on de-nitrification and phosphorus removal,” Richert said. “This will require technologies that are not necessarily new but are new to the industry. Besides these, there will be more demand for further chemical removal associated with pharmaceuticals, for example.”

The next phase of wastewater treatment will focus on solutions that are more efficient, adaptable, and responsive to regulatory and economic pressures. Processors that stay informed about industry advancements and build strong partnerships with suppliers will be best positioned to navigate these changes.

“For the next five years, the demands of the pet food industry will drive focus to a few key factors in wastewater treatment chemistry: impact, versatility and safety,” Bradley said. “The most useful advancements will accomplish more with less and respond quickly to operational, regulatory and economic dynamics. To maximize the value of suppliers supporting an operation, develop a deeper compliance partnership with each key supplier to a wastewater plant.”",https://www.petfoodprocessing.net/ext/resources/Articles/2025/04April/040825_Wastewater-treatment_Lead.jpg?height=635&t=1744113770&width=1200,N,,2025-04-08 13:10:26.326220

Market Update

In response to the Fed’s rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has been gradually trending down from its post-pandemic peak, trending closer to the Fed’s 2% target. Despite higher borrowing costs, the economy has avoided flashing recessionary signals. This is the much-desired soft landing that many investors hoped for. The recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November 2024) have bolstered the stock market, making 2024 a strong year for equities. Donald Trump’s presidential win in November sparked additional market gains, sending indices to record highs in the days following his victory. However, debates continue over possible tariffs and corporate tax adjustments, raising questions about economic stability in 2025.

Figures from information provider Dealogic suggest that investment banking fees earned globally by UBS have fallen 23% in year-to-date 2025 versus the same period of 2024. At Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs, they're up 5% and 6% respectively over the same period.

UBS's investment banking performance wouldn't look great in any circumstance, but it looks even worse in the context of the Credit Suisse acquisition, which reportedly resulted in the addition of 200 ""senior dealmakers."" The new bankers don't appear to have made much difference, yet.

UBS's poor banking performance comes as investment banking activity falters in the wake of Trump's tariffs. Even before the tariffs were imposed, Dealogic says investment banking fee revenues fell 3% year-on-year globally in the first quarter, with the biggest drops in Europe and Latin America (-15% and -21% respectively), and increases in North America and South East Asia (up 2% and 12%).

Job cuts are likely to ensue. UBS isn't commenting, but as we reported first last week, the Swiss bank is planning a new round of cuts later this month. Insiders at UBS, told Bloomberg that lists are already being drawn up of whom to let go. Insiders tells us they're based on recent performance appraisals, in which people were marked down unusually harshly. There are claims that ex-Credit Suisse people seemed to come off worse.

As revenues stagnate, though, the hope is that some UBS people will simply walk away. ""The ideal is for people to leave of their own accords,"" says one insider, adding that ""a deliberately uncomfortable work environment,"" is one way of prompting this.

Another option is to offer voluntary redundancy payments, which some at UBS say would be perfect now. ""A lot of people have lost their motivation,"" says one insider at the bank, who complains of a ""bad vibe."" He says he would accept voluntary redundancy if it were offered: ""I'd like to leave soon, as these kinds of cuts isn't what I signed up for.""

CVS Health has appointed Brian Newman to the role of chief financial officer, effective April 21, and said that it expects to meet or exceed its latest guidance for the year.

Newman brings to the health solutions company a wealth of experience, most recently serving as executive vice president and CFO of United Parcel Service.

Prior to his time at UPS, Newman was at PepsiCo where he spent the majority of his career. He served for 26 years in finance leadership roles across Europe, Asia and South America, and was executive vice president for PepsiCo's global operations and as chief strategy officer.

Newman takes over the reins from Tom Cowhey, who will transition to a strategic advisory role, supporting Chief Executive Officer David Joyner, effective May 12.

Newman is expected to receive an annual salary of $1 million and will be eligible for a bonus of 150% of his salary based on performance. He's also set to receive an equity award of $7 million made up of a mix of performance stock units, restricted stocks units and stock options.

Additionally, CVS has appointed Amy Compton-Phillips to the role of chief medical officer, effective May 19. Compton-Phillips was most recently chief physician executive of health care performance improvement company Press Ganey, and before that, chief clinical officer at Providence Health & Services, a health care system.

In November of last year, CVS shuffled its top executive, bringing in Joyner to head the company in place of Karen Lynch in response to a push for changes by Glenview Capital Management, a major hedge fund, and a board review of strategy that included the option of breaking up the company.

At the time, the company also warned again that its earnings for the year would miss expectations.

On Tuesday, CVS said that it now CVS said it currently expects financial performance will meet or exceed its most recent guidance for full year 2025 based on year-to-date results through February. In February, the company set guidance for adjusted earnings of $5.75 to $6 a share for 2025.

Analysts polled on FactSet expect adjusted earnings of $5.90 a share.

Regionally, the Americas and Asia experienced growth in net revenues by 6% and 7% respectively, while Europe saw a decline in net revenues by 5%.

The company’s direct-to-consumer channels contributed positively with a 9% ascent in net revenues. Wholesale channels faced a downturn with a 3% reduction in net revenues.

A significant turnaround was evident in the company’s profitability, with net income from continuing operations reaching $140m in Q1 FY25, compared to a net loss of $10m in the same period of the previous year.

The rebound was reflected in earnings per share from continuing operations, which stood at $0.35, up from a diluted loss per share of $0.03 in Q1 FY24.

Levi Strauss’ operational efficiency improvements were underscored by an expansion in operating margin to 12.5% and an increase in gross margin of 330 basis points to 62.1%.

The growth in gross margin was attributed mainly to reduced product costs and an advantageous mix of channels and brands.

Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin also saw a substantial improvement, climbing by 400 basis points to reach 13.4%, propelled by the enhanced gross margin.

Levi Strauss saw a marginal drop in selling, general and administrative expenses to $749m over the quarter from $756m reported in the first quarter of the previous year.

“The Levi’s brand is stronger than ever, and we will continue to fuel this momentum through a robust product pipeline and by keeping the brand firmly at the centre of culture across the globe. While we recognise that we are operating in an uncertain environment, our global footprint, strong margin structure, and agile supply chain position us to navigate the balance of the year and beyond.”

Levi Strauss has maintained guidance for fiscal 2025 based on continuing operations, excluding the impact of the recent tariffs.

The company anticipates a slight decline in reported net revenue, ranging between 1% and 2%.

Expectations for gross margin are nevertheless optimistic, with an anticipated expansion of 100 basis points to 61.6%.

Tariffs this, tariffs that. Sneakerheads and runners are just wondering how much more their shoes are going to cost because of them.

According to the senior vice president of a federal footwear trade organization, a $155 running shoe could jump to as much as $220. But don’t unlace those runners yet, because other projections are a bit softer, projecting that a Nike Pegasus 41, currently $140, could go up to $157.

Regardless of exactly how much more expensive shoes will be, the hefty tariffs on the countries that manufacture the majority of the country’s footwear come at a less-than-desirable time for the industry leader, Nike.

Nike needs its fans to buy a lot of shoes in the coming months, and even without tariffs, Nike customers were already going to be seeing higher prices than what they were used to for the last few years.

The world’s largest coffee chain posted a £35.2m ($44.8m) loss before tax in the UK for the 12 months ended 29 September 2024, compared to a £16.9m ($21.5m) profit the year previously. Starbucks also reported a 9% fall in gross profit and a 4% year-on-year fall in UK revenues to £525.6m ($668.9m).

In commentary accompanying its results, Starbucks said a challenging trading environment, including high raw material costs, softer consumer spending and ‘widely discussed misperceptions’ about the chain’s stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict, had negatively impacted its performance.

Starbucks also highlighted the UK’s ‘highly competitive’ branded coffee shop market as a factor in reduced footfall to its stores, with increased investment in domestic specialty coffee chains challenging the local trading landscape.

World Coffee Portal’s Project Café UK 2025 report shows specialty operators WatchHouse, Black Sheep Coffee, Knoops, Redemption Roasters and BEAR all raised investment over the last 12 months to fund UK expansion.

The UK remains Starbucks’ largest market in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. The Seattle-based coffee chain ended the year with 1,240 stores, an addition of 100 net new sites, and has since acquired its largest UK franchisee, 23.5 Degrees, adding a further 113 stores to its company-owned UK estate.

Starbucks expects to open a further 80 net new UK stores by the end of September 2025, retaining a focus on key drive-thru and high-footfall city centre locations.

“It has been a difficult period for the sector. We navigated significant macro-economic pressures including inflationary headwinds which have also had an impact on consumer confidence. Despite this, we achieved our goal of opening 100 new stores in the UK. We remain committed to further expanding our presence and are today announcing that we will open an additional 80 stores in the UK this year,” said Duncan Moir, President, Starbucks EMEA.

Starbucks UK profits during the period were also impacted by ongoing investments in technology, social media and its Starbucks Rewards loyalty programme, as well as increases in staff wages.

“We are focused on regaining momentum by strengthening and scaling how we integrate technology across the business, building on the popularity of our Starbucks Rewards programme, and further optimising our menu to ensure we continue delivering on our core offering every time,” Moir added.",https://www.worldcoffeeportal.com/getattachment/58493c2d-8c46-4e85-a42e-ab038493ebfe/Starbucks_UK_focused_on_‘regaining_momentum’_after_posting_£35.2m_loss.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 10:06:59.670461

These developments are shaping the landscape for CVS Health and its industry peers, with implications for future operations and investor considerations.","WOONSOCKET, R.I. - CVS Health (NYSE: CVS), a healthcare giant with $370.66 billion in revenue and an $80.5 billion market capitalization, today announced significant changes to its executive team and provided an optimistic outlook for its 2025 financial performance. Brian Newman has been appointed executive vice president and chief financial officer designate, effective April 21, and will take over from the current CFO, Tom Cowhey, on May 12. Amy Compton-Phillips, M.D., will join the company as the new executive vice president and chief medical officer on May 19.

Brian Newman, the incoming CFO, previously served as the CFO of United Parcel Service (UPS) and brings a wealth of experience from a nearly three-decade career at PepsiCo. Newman’s leadership at UPS during the COVID-19 pandemic and his tenure in various global finance roles at PepsiCo position him as a strategic addition to the CVS Health leadership team. According to InvestingPro analysis, CVS currently appears undervalued, with multiple analysts recently revising their earnings expectations upward for the upcoming period.

Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips arrives with a distinguished background in healthcare management, most recently as the chief physician executive at Press Ganey. Her prior roles include president and chief clinical officer at Providence Health & Services and various positions at Kaiser Permanente. Her appointment underscores CVS Health’s commitment to clinical excellence and patient care.

The company also signaled confidence in its financial trajectory, expecting to meet or exceed its previously issued guidance for the full year of 2025. With a healthy 4.17% dividend yield and strong recent market performance, CVS has demonstrated resilience in the healthcare sector. It is important to note that the financial closing procedures for the first quarter are not yet complete, and final figures may be subject to change.

David Joyner, president and CEO of CVS Health, expressed gratitude to Tom Cowhey for his contributions and welcomed the new executives, emphasizing their potential to propel the company’s strategic vision. Newman and Compton-Phillips also shared their enthusiasm for their new roles, highlighting their commitment to the success and health outcomes of CVS Health’s clients and customers.

These leadership transitions come as CVS Health continues to expand its healthcare services, which include a vast network of retail pharmacy locations, medical clinics, pharmacy benefits management, and health insurance products. For deeper insights into CVS Health’s valuation and growth prospects, investors can access comprehensive analysis and additional ProTips through InvestingPro’s detailed research reports, which are available for over 1,400 US stocks.

The information for this article is based on a press release statement from CVS Health.

In other recent news, CVS Health has announced a quarterly dividend of $0.665 per share, payable on May 1, 2025, to shareholders of record by April 22, 2025. This decision highlights the company’s commitment to delivering value to its investors. Additionally, Mizuho Securities has increased its price target for CVS Health to $70 from $58, maintaining an Outperform rating. The analyst, Ann Hynes, cited the company’s ""embedded earnings power"" as a factor in the revised target, reflecting confidence in CVS Health’s financial strength.

In a broader industry context, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced a 5.06% increase in Medicare insurer payment rates for 2026, benefiting companies like CVS Health. This rate adjustment is expected to generate over $25 billion in additional revenue for the healthcare insurance sector. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is set to resume its lawsuit against pharmacy benefit managers, including CVS Health’s CVS Caremark, over insulin pricing practices. The case had been paused due to the recusal of FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, who has now reversed his decision, allowing proceedings to continue.

Lastly, the FDA has authorized Visby Medical’s at-home test for three sexually transmitted diseases, with CVS among companies offering similar at-home testing kits. These developments are shaping the landscape for CVS Health and its industry peers, with implications for future operations and investor considerations.

Combined, Kroger and Albertsons operate nearly 5,000 stores and employ hundreds of thousands of workers across the United States.
Meanwhile, both Kroger and Albertsons have quietly begun reducing headcount, further highlighting the instability created by the failed merger.
“The real tragedy of this failed merger is that the logic behind it was sound,” said one retail consultant.
“Without scale, supermarkets like Kroger and Albertsons may slowly lose ground to more agile, tech-savvy competitors.” What’s Next for Kroger?","In a move that has stunned retail analysts and rattled the grocery industry, Kroger has disclosed it spent over $1 billion in a failed bid to acquire rival supermarket chain Albertsons — an ambitious merger that regulators ultimately blocked, yet one whose ripple effects continue to be felt across the U.S. food retail landscape.

The Cincinnati-based retail giant revealed in a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that the proposed $25 billion merger with Albertsons, first announced in October 2022, has cost the company dearly. The breakdown of the billion-dollar loss shows $684 million spent in 2024 alone, primarily on third-party legal and advisory fees, alongside $316 million in 2023 and $44 million in 2022.

A Costly Gamble on Consolidation

The failed merger was one of the most expensive attempted consolidations in recent grocery retail history. The strategic rationale behind Kroger’s bid was clear: uniting with Albertsons would create a supermarket powerhouse capable of competing with giants like Walmart and Amazon. Combined, Kroger and Albertsons operate nearly 5,000 stores and employ hundreds of thousands of workers across the United States.

But regulators weren’t convinced. Antitrust lawsuits filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and attorneys general from multiple states argued the merger would reduce competition, potentially increase grocery prices, and result in widespread job losses. Court proceedings stretched from Seattle to Portland throughout late 2024, culminating in two separate court rulings in December that blocked the deal. Albertsons officially terminated the merger a day later.

More Than Just Legal Fees

Kroger’s billion-dollar bill was not limited to lawyer invoices. The grocer had also secured expensive credit facilities to finance the deal and had entered into agreements with C&S Wholesale Grocers, which had planned to purchase nearly 600 stores as part of a divestiture plan to appease regulators. Following the collapse, C&S filed a lawsuit in Delaware, demanding a termination fee.

Albertsons, for its part, wasted no time retaliating — suing Kroger for damages, alleging the Ohio-based chain failed to secure regulatory approval in good faith.

Leadership Shake-Ups and Job Cuts

The fallout hasn’t just been financial. In March, Kroger’s long-serving CEO Rodney McMullen resigned amid an internal investigation into conduct that reportedly violated the company’s code of ethics. Former Staples CEO and Kroger board member Ron Sargent has stepped in as interim chief while a permanent replacement is sought.

Meanwhile, both Kroger and Albertsons have quietly begun reducing headcount, further highlighting the instability created by the failed merger.

A Merger Still Needed for Long-Term Survival?

While the merger is legally dead, analysts warn that its economic and strategic necessity remains very much alive. Both Kroger and Albertsons face growing pressure from online players like Amazon Fresh, warehouse giants such as Costco, and discount-driven newcomers like Aldi and Lidl. The grocery sector is undergoing seismic change, and consolidation is seen by many insiders as not just a growth strategy, but a matter of survival.

Some experts argue that without consolidation, traditional supermarket chains may struggle to keep prices low while managing razor-thin margins in a high-inflation environment.

“The real tragedy of this failed merger is that the logic behind it was sound,” said one retail consultant. “Without scale, supermarkets like Kroger and Albertsons may slowly lose ground to more agile, tech-savvy competitors.”

What’s Next for Kroger?

As Kroger begins picking up the pieces of its abandoned merger, it remains to be seen how the company will redirect its resources. With over 409,000 employees nationwide and 76 stores in Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky alone, the grocer still has a significant national footprint.

However, with a billion-dollar hole in its balance sheet and mounting legal costs, strategic missteps are no longer affordable.",https://internationalsupermarketnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-cropped-isn_corporation_logo-1-32x32.webp,N,,2025-04-08 08:04:44.801575

According to the company’s report, the Osun-based brewer saw its losses balloon to N113.6 billion in 2024 from N70 billion it recorded in the previous year, rising by 62.5 percent.

The brewer had been on a losing streak since 2018 when it recorded a loss of N3.87 billion. And the loss jumped almost five-fold to N27.79 billion in 2019 and contracted to N16.08 billion in 2020. The company’s loss slightly rose again to N17.66 billion in 2021 and even higher to N21.63 billion in 2022.

The recurring losses stem from the brewer’s exposure to foreign exchange which became volatile after the government unified the exchange rate and devalued the naira, leading to about a 70 percent slump of the currency.

Meanwhile, revenue continues to shoot up, reaching a nine-year high and almost doubled in the financial year ended 31 December 2024, indicating strong revenue growth.

Its revenue grew from N260.5 billion in 2023 to N488.9 billion last year, highlighting how the firm has been able to adjust to the shocks witnessed in the last two years.

“While continually delivering strong revenue growth, our inability to source adequate foreign exchange due to market illiquidity impacts profitability, as we incurred significant FX losses on our foreign currency-denominated debt and liabilities,” the beer maker said in its financial statement.

“To address this, the company successfully raised fresh capital through a rights issue and settled the outstanding loan liability. Going into 2025, the company expects to return to profitability in the absence of any significant non-operating foreign currency exposure,” it added.

The firm continues to grapple with FX-induced losses as its unrealised foreign exchange loss for the year stood at N128.4 billion while the brewers realised foreign exchange loss jumped to N294.1 billion from N14.3 billion in 2023.

Beer makers make use of raw materials such as barley, hops which are largely imported. This meant sourcing and scarce FX, leading to higher input cost in terms of raw materials.

The firm spent more than double to source raw materials in 2024 as cost surged from N25.6 billion in 2023 to N58.14 billion last year.

Obi Achebe, chairman of the board of directors at International Breweries Plc, said in a statement that the repayment of the company’s foreign exchange-denominated loans would propel the firm back to the path of sustainable profitability.

“We are proud of the strides we have made in strengthening our business foundation and positioning for sustainable growth. The repayment of our outstanding $379.9 million loan, enabled by our parent company, AB InBev has bolstered our financial position.

“This recapitalisation not only strengthens our balance sheet but also sets the stage for long-term profitability and growth. We are now better equipped to drive innovation, improve operational efficiency, and seize new opportunities.”

International Breweries opened its N588 billion rights issue programme on May 21, 2024, where the brewer seeks to issue 161,172,395,100 new ordinary shares of 2 kobo each at an offer price of N3.65 per share.

According to a recent statement by the brewer, Achebe also commended the company’s progress, particularly after its rights issue, which enabled the repayment of its forex-denominated loan, which had impacted the company over the years.

“The elimination of our FX exposure will improve IBPLC’s cash flows and will support the company’s return to profitability. The offer was supported by our core shareholder, Anheuser-Busch InBev who followed their rights in full. This is a strong indication of AB InBev’s commitment and belief in the Nigerian market opportunity and overall Nigerian economy,” Achebe said.",https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-20.png,N,,2025-04-08 08:04:39.636039

The company has officially launched its Denza brand in Europe, aiming to grow its footprint in the region and challenge established luxury manufacturers. The first model to hit European streets will be the Z9 GT, with sales expected to begin by the end of the year.

Denza was originally formed as a joint venture between BYD and Mercedes-Benz back in 2011. But despite the star power behind it, the brand struggled to gain traction, selling just 23,000 vehicles in its first decade. Mercedes-Benz began scaling back its involvement in 2022, reducing its stake to just 10 percent before fully exiting the partnership last year. Denza is now entirely under BYD’s control.

Read: BYD’s Denza Z9 GT Rivals Porsche’s Panamera And Taycan For A Fraction Of The Price

The Chinese maker launched the Denza brand at a special event in Milan, Italy, earlier this week. According to BYD’s special advisor for Europe, Alfredo Altavilla, Denza will target traditional premium car buyers and younger customers with a keen focus on technology.

Back in China, BYD operates Denza alongside two other premium sub-brands, Fang Cheng Bao and Yangwang. According to ArenaEV, BYD plans to consolidate Fang Cheng Bao into the Denza lineup for Europe, starting with the Fang Cheng Bao Leopard 5, which will be rebadged as a Denza. It remains unclear whether Yangwang models will also be brought under the Denza umbrella for the European market.

Denza has not announced prices for its European lineup. However, while speaking with Reuters, Altavilla said the Z9 GT will be followed up by the luxurious D9 van at the end of the year. Both models will be built in and exported from China, even though the automaker plans to start building cars at its new plant in Hungary from October.

On paper, the Z9 GT is aimed at the likes of Porsche’s Taycan Sport Turismo, though it beats the German EV on size. It’s over 7.8 inches (200 mm) longer and rides on a wheelbase that’s 8.8 inches (225 mm) longer. Power comes from three electric motors producing a combined 952 horsepower, fed by a 100.1 kWh lithium-iron phosphate battery pack. In China, the company also offers a PHEV version that combines a 2.0-liter turbo engine and three electric motors for 858 hp.

The Z9 GT’s performance numbers may place it in the same conversation as Porsche’s offerings, but its pricing in China suggests a very different customer base. There, Denza’s model is priced between 334,800 and 414,800 yuan (roughly $45,800 to $56,800), while Porsche’s comparable models, like the Panamera Sport Turismo and Taycan Cross Turismo, start around 1,008,000 yuan ($138,000) and stretch well beyond 1,500,000 yuan ($205,000), depending on trim and powertrain.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Denza-Z9-GT-01.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 12:23:25.306233

UK FY24 Operational Updates:

Modest decrease in revenue due to various macro-economic and consumer headwinds. This, coupled with inflationary pressures from commodities such as dairy and cocoa, and investment in our partners’ wages, has created a challenging trading environment.

Despite this, the Company opened 100 new stores, demonstrating a commitment to the region. The Company also plans to open an additional 80 new stores in FY25 in the UK.

The Company invested in digitalization and technology and enhanced its loyalty program by running innovative and engaging campaigns, such as collaborations with the Harry Kane Foundation and Stanley cup. These campaigns contributed to 35% growth in the program’s active members.

The Company’s long-term strategy in the region is aligned to the Global Back to Starbucks strategy, which will see it refocusing on what has always set Starbucks apart — being a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather, and where we serve the finest coffee, handcrafted by our skilled baristas.

Duncan Moir, President Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa, commented:

“It has been a difficult period for the sector. We navigated significant macro-economic pressures including inflationary headwinds which have also had an impact on consumer confidence. Despite this, we achieved our goal of opening 100 new stores in the UK.

“We remain committed to further expanding our presence and are today announcing that we will open an additional 80 stores in the UK this year.

“We are focused on regaining momentum by strengthening and scaling how we integrate technology across the business, building on the popularity of our Starbucks Rewards program, and further optimising our menu to ensure we continue delivering on our core offering every time.

“Our success starts and ends with our green apron partners. We would like to thank our over 48,000 partners across EMEA for their hard work in continuing to exceed customer expectations. Together, we are working on delivering growth and ultimately, getting Back to Starbucks.”

UK Overview

The UK remains the Company’s largest market in EMEA. UK operations are captured in the accounts of Starbucks Coffee Company (UK) Limited.

The Company ended the year with a total of 1,240 stores in the UK. Of these, 378 were company-operated stores and 862 were run by licensees – a 30/70 split approximately, which is flat on last year.

The macro-economic and consumer environment dampened consumer demand and Starbucks saw a 4% decline in revenue. Revenue for the period was £525.6m (2023: £547.7m). The Company experienced inflationary pressures on margins from increased input costs such as commodity prices and wage inflation. This led to an operating loss of £27.5m (2023: profit of £21.7m) for the period.

UK Market Trends

The UK coffee market experienced significant headwinds in the financial year which resulted in many consumers adjusting usual spending habits. The cost-of-living pressures accelerated during the period as persistent inflation and higher interest rates left consumers with less disposable income. Widely discussed misperceptions about the brand relating to events in the Middle East impacted footfall in some locations in the first half of the year. The UK coffee market has also become highly competitive with new entrants and localised specialty coffee houses investing in new stores.

While the coffee inflationary pressures we observed in 2023 somewhat eased during the fiscal year, higher cost impacts on dairy and cocoa were felt in FY24 which continued to put pressure on margins. Profitability was also impacted by wage inflation as the Company continues to invest in its partners.

Making Starbucks the best job in retail is core to the Back to Starbucks strategy. The Company remains confident that it is heading into FY25 in a strong position to attract and retain key partners for its stores. Further incentives and benefits were provided in the year, including but not limited to salary increases, bonuses and tenure pay. The Company launched a new bonus scheme for store supervisors and baristas, which allows green-apron partners to share in the Company’s success on a more sustainable basis.

During the period, the Company continued to place a strong emphasis on digitalization and technology, enhancing its loyalty program by running innovative and engaging campaigns including collaborations with the Harry Kane Foundation and Stanley cup. These activations led to an increase in customer spend and 35% growth in the program’s active members. The Company will continue to build upon this in 2025 through the rollout of further digital initiatives.

The Company has responded to changing consumer preferences and economic conditions by actively managing its menu offerings and pricing strategies. The trial of freshly baked in-store food products has proved promising and will continue to be rolled out across more stores into FY25 to support consumer convenience. Selected strategic price increases were taken in line with rising input costs.

The Company continued its expansion strategy, delivering on its commitment to open 100 new stores in the UK. New store openings were targeted in key drive-thru and city locations with high traffic and footfall counts.

UK Corporation Tax

The Company reported a UK corporation tax charge of £1.0m (FY23: £7.2m). This reduction reflects the weaker financial performance for the period.

UK FY25 Updates

On the 14 October 2024, Starbucks Corporation acquired 23.5 Degrees Limited, the brand’s largest local licensing operator in the UK, bringing an additional 113 stores under Company Operated Ownership in the UK. This acquisition supports the brand’s growth strategy in the UK and reflects the continued confidence in the market’s long-term outlook. It is anticipated that these stores will be integrated into the Company in due course.

Further to this, the Company plans to open an additional 80 stores in the UK in FY25. Company operated growth in FY25 will prioritize new smaller store format innovation in town locations, drive-thrus, as well as high traffic count locations stores across the United Kingdom.

EMEA Overview

Starbucks EMEA Ltd is the main reporting entity for all Starbucks activities in EMEA – excluding the UK business, which is reported separately, as outlined above.

At the year end, there were 4,862 stores in 42 markets across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) (2023: 4,582 stores).

Starbucks continues to pursue its core strategy of a mostly licensed and franchised operating model in the EMEA region, meaning most of its revenues come primarily from royalty payments. Revenue decreased by 8.8% in the period to $388.0m (2023: $425.4m), driven by the challenging macro-economic backdrop and misperceptions about the brand relating to events in the Middle East.

This was compounded by a slight increase in administrative costs to $152.3m (2023: $147.2m), driven by increased headcount, additional activity supporting expansion across EMEA such as marketing, technology and digital support costs, and unfavorable foreign exchange movements.

Profit after tax for the period was $77.1m (2023: $104.7m). This consists of a profit before tax of $114.6m (2023: $141.1m) and a UK corporation tax charge of $37.5m (2023: $36.4m).

EMEA Market Trends

In support of its broader strategy, the Company continued to grow in the region. During the period, it opened 421 new stores. The Company will continue to expand its presence in the region in support of further growth, with plans to open 150 stores in the region (excluding the UK) next year.

As outlined by Brian Niccol in February 2025, the Company expects to work with its partners in the Middle East to open approximately 500 new stores over the next five years.

EMEA corporation tax

Starbucks EMEA Limited reported a UK corporation tax charge of $37.5m for the year, compared to $36.4m for the same period last year.

President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs have raised worries about sudden price increases for goods like apparel and footwear as well as a worldwide recession.

The business stated in January that it would be able to cross-source products thanks to a varied supply chain spanning 25 nations.

Levi’s officials have said that the company only imports around 1 per cent of its goods straight from China into the United States, compared to roughly 5 per cent for Mexico. According to President and Chief Executive Michelle Gass, one of the mitigating steps the company is considering is raising prices, which was described as “surgical.”

Demand for slim and wide-legged jeans has held steady, following competitors like Abercrombie & Fitch and Gap, even if consumers are frugal with their discretionary spending.

The company also stated that it was examining the effects of tariffs and what it could do to lessen those effects in its quarterly filing with regulators.

The company stated that it expected the new tariffs to have a material impact on the results of operations in the 2025 fiscal year. Additionally, it stated that production and distribution could be impacted by the environment.

If these disruptions continue, it might be necessary to change present sourcing procedures, which could affect product costs and, if left unchecked, could have a materially negative impact on the company’s operations and business outcomes, it stated.

ID25,McDonald’s,2025-04-08 09:22:20+00:00,The Nation,McDonald's Made a Commitment to Prevent Sexual Harassment—What Happened?,"Steve Brodner, Ben Schwartz, D.D. Guttenplan, Jodi Dean, The Nation, Mychal Denzel Smith, www.thenation.com, Bryce Covert",,,,,https://www.thenation.com/article/society/mcdonalds-sexual-harassment-brand-standards/,"She called the McDonald’s corporate human resources hotline to complain that she had been fired for reporting sexual harassment.
Four years ago, McDonald’s promised to take action after allegations emerged of stunningly high rates of sexual harassment at its restaurants.
Neither training mentioned sexual harassment by customers, she alleges, or what to do if it happened.
While mandatory sexual harassment training via computer tutorials or videos has become common, experts say these trainings generally don’t stick with employees.
“I think McDonald’s is probably the worst when it comes to sexual harassment.” Making sure employees feel safe reporting sexual harassment is essential to combating it, experts say.","Rosalia Manuel had worked for McDonald’s for more than 20 years when she was suddenly fired in 2022. Until then, she had been considered “the best employee,” she said, and had worked her way up to shift manager at a location in Saratoga, California. It was a role she took seriously.

That March, after a coworker confided to her that a different shift manager had been following her around, making suggestive comments, and coming on to her, Manuel reported the behavior to the store manager above her. Manuel had never been trained on how to respond to incidents of sexual harassment, she said, but she felt that it was her responsibility to do something.

The shift manager who had been harassing Manuel’s coworker never appeared to receive any discipline. Instead, in July, the store manager suspended Manuel for a week for allegedly failing to take her lunch break on time. When Manuel returned to work, she was told she was being fired for insubordination, according to a complaint she filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Manuel had a different theory. She called the McDonald’s corporate human resources hotline to complain that she had been fired for reporting sexual harassment. She was told they would investigate, she said, but she never heard back.

The harasser, however, kept working for McDonald’s. In the fall of 2022, at another McDonald’s location in San Jose, the woman began telling Sindy Pamela Mejia, a new employee, that she had a nice body. According to a complaint Mejia has filed with the California Civil Rights Department, she would simulate sex acts, talk about her sex life, and say things like “Ay, qué rico”: How delicious. She quizzed Mejia about whether she had a husband or a boyfriend, Mejia told me. When Mejia rebuffed her, the woman started bullying her, she said, making fun of her for speaking Spanish and for being Honduran.

Mejia didn’t know what she was supposed to do. When she started working at McDonald’s, she was required to watch several onboarding videos. Two of the videos, each about a minute long, advised employees not to touch each other and to say “Excuse me” if they accidentally bumped into somebody—but they didn’t specify any procedures for responding to sexual harassment, Mejia said.

In December, Mejia decided to report the behavior to her manager. But nothing was done, she said; the harasser once again appeared to escape repercussions. Instead, in January 2023, Mejia’s manager reduced her schedule from 40 hours a week to nearly half that, and then to just 13 hours by March—retaliation for reporting the harassment, Mejia said in her complaint.

Mejia decided to report the harassment again in August 2023, this time to an HR representative, but the situation only grew more unbearable in the months that followed, she said: Her harasser was emboldened and told Mejia that the lack of discipline meant she could do whatever she wanted. She started denying Mejia breaks, even to use the bathroom, and refusing to put in her lunch order so she could eat, Mejia said. Mejia was so disturbed that she would skip meals during her shifts and cry in her car instead.

“Nobody seemed interested in helping me with this situation,” Mejia said in Spanish through an interpreter. The harassment stopped only when the woman left the San Jose McDonald’s in May 2024.

McDonald’s did not respond to requests for comment on the specifics of Manuel’s or Mejia’s allegations. Manuel’s EEOC complaint was settled in March 2023. The California Civil Rights Department has not yet issued a ruling on Mejia’s complaint.

Mejia still works at the McDonald’s in San Jose; it’s difficult to find another job that allows her to pick her children up from school. But as a single mother of two who is now working fewer hours, she said, she has struggled financially, and has taken out loans to pay her rent, buy groceries, and pay her bills. “No puedo sobrevivir“—I can’t survive—she said.

Four years ago, McDonald’s promised to take action after allegations emerged of stunningly high rates of sexual harassment at its restaurants. A 2020 survey had found that three-quarters of female nonmanagerial employees had experienced sexual harassment. The company had faced not just a historic nationwide strike over the problem but dozens of lawsuits accusing it of failing to prevent and address harassment. That same year, The Nation published its own investigation based on a review of 24 legal complaints and conversations with restaurant workers who described rampant verbal and physical harassment, including being grabbed, groped, and threatened with rape. The CEO of McDonald’s at the time, Steve Easterbrook, was fired and then sued by the company later that year for engaging in multiple sexual relationships with subordinates against company policy.

In response to the bad press, McDonald’s announced in April 2021 that it would implement “global brand standards” to create “a culture of physical and psychological safety for employees and customers through the prevention of violence, harassment and discrimination.” The standards would apply, for the first time ever, to franchised as well as corporate-owned restaurants—a significant development given that, globally, 93 percent of McDonald’s locations are franchised. In the past, the company had declined to enforce corporate rules at its franchises and argued that it couldn’t be held liable for sexual harassment at such locations.

Under the new standards, the company said it would require restaurants to establish policies and provide trainings to combat sexual harassment, as well as reporting processes and annual employee and manager surveys. The standards were rolled out over the course of 2021 and took effect in January 2022. All McDonald’s locations were meant to be “assessed and held accountable” to the standards by that date.

Despite the company’s claims that the new standards would fix the problems, an investigation by The Nation and Type Investigations found that little changed in many McDonald’s locations after the standards went into effect. According to legal complaints from 20 workers in California, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Texas, not only has sexual harassment continued in these places, but when employees have reported it in the hopes that the company would address the situation, nothing was done. Instead, in several cases, workers like Manuel and Mejia said they were punished for coming forward by having their hours cut or even losing their jobs.

There is a likely reason why little has changed, experts say: The global brand standards have been inadequate to the task of preventing sexual harassment.

McDonald’s has not shared the details of the global brand standards publicly. Despite its efforts to keep them secret, however, The Nation and Type Investigations obtained an internal corporate document titled “2022 U.S. People Brand Standards Visit” that provides insights into what the standards consist of. This document details the criteria used by McDonald’s to evaluate whether its restaurants and franchises were in compliance with the brand standards after they were implemented, revealing how McDonald’s enforces its new solution. What this document suggests is that, while the requirements adhere to a certain logic for how to prevent and address sexual harassment, they are too broad and vague to be effective.

Eve Cervantez, a lawyer who is leading a class-action lawsuit against McDonald’s, said, “I have not seen that there has been any diminishment in complaints of sexual harassment at McDonald’s, and I have not seen any better response to allegations of sexual harassment since January 2022.” She added, “There’s no way the standards could have fixed the problem, because they’re not really addressing the problem.”

A McDonald’s spokesperson declined to provide details of the global brand standards to The Nation and Type Investigations. In response to a detailed list of questions about the global brand standards and sexual harassment in its restaurants after the standards went into effect, McDonald’s reiterated that it was committed to safeguarding workers and preventing abuse.

“Even one allegation of sexual harassment is too many. McDonald’s believes that every single individual who works under the arches deserves to experience a safe, respectful, and inclusive workplace,” the company said in a statement. “To support our commitment to these values, we offer strong guidance aimed at preventing discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. At our company-owned restaurants, this includes conducting trainings for all employees, providing resources and materials in the restaurants and offering multiple avenues for reporting concerns. We also provide Franchisees with optional tools and other resources aimed at making their employees feel valued, respected, and supported.”

McDonald’s has opposed the granting of class-action status for Cervantez’s case, Jamelia Fairley and Ashley Reddick v. McDonald’s, which has been ongoing since 2020 and includes complaints from dozens of restaurants in Florida. The company argues that the plaintiffs don’t have enough in common, haven’t provided sufficient evidence to establish a pattern of sexual harassment, and haven’t established that there is a general policy of discrimination; it also said that the restaurants in question had lawful anti-sexual-harassment policies and practices in place.

The allegations extend far beyond Florida, however. The Nation and Type Investigations reviewed three additional lawsuits, including one filed in Texas. In that case, a man named as E.S. alleges that his 15-year-old daughter was raped by a 28-year-old coworker while working at a McDonald’s in the small city of Hearne, less than two months after she was hired in February 2023. The coworker lured her to an area behind the restaurant, then battered and raped her by a dumpster, the suit alleges.

Ad Policy

“We never expected that something like that was going to happen,” the girl’s father told me.

The 28-year-old pleaded guilty to charges of sexual assault of a child and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. McDonald’s has denied that it bears any legal responsibility in the case, and the franchise denied “each and every” allegation made by the plaintiff. The lawsuit is set for trial in January 2026.

In the aftermath, the girl stayed home from school for about eight months, and as of December she still wasn’t speaking much to her family, her father said. “Before this happened, we used to live in a bubble where everybody in my family was safe. After this happened, it was like somebody popped that bubble.”

“I wish they can change all these McDonald’s,” he added, “so nobody can be hurt again.”

When McDonald’s announced its new global brand standards four years ago, it touted them as the key to eliminating sexual harassment from its restaurants. “There are no shortcuts to ensuring that people feel safe, respected and included at a McDonald’s restaurant. This work starts by taking big, intentional moves,” McDonald’s new CEO, Chris Kempczinski, said at the time.

From the beginning, however, details of what the new policies and procedures consist of have remained secret—even to McDonald’s restaurant employees. Rosalia Manuel told me that she never saw the standards, despite being a shift manager. And Eve Cervantez said she hasn’t encountered a single worker who was aware of the standards’ existence, let alone their content. When Cervantez requested that McDonald’s reveal the standards publicly as part of her lawsuit, McDonald’s argued that they must remain under seal, claiming that they are trade secrets that give the company a “competitive advantage.”

“If these are supposed to be these great standards that are going to help protect women in McDonald’s, why would they need to be under seal?” Cervantez said. A ruling on whether the details of the standards must be made public is still pending.

By choosing to keep the standards secret, McDonald’s could be limiting their effectiveness, said Vicki Magley, a psychology professor at the University of Connecticut who studies sexual harassment intervention. “There have to be consistent, distributed, accessible policies and procedures,” Magley continued. “If there is no policy that is clearly written and consistently distributed and that includes very clear procedures, then of course the employees are going to be confused.”

The problems with the standards may extend much further than secrecy, however. The “2022 U.S. People Brand Standards Visit” document lists three primary criteria that restaurants and franchises had to adhere to in order to pass an inspection by a third-party assessor. The first of these: All restaurants and franchises must have a harassment, discrimination, and no-retaliation policy in place. The second: All employees have to complete anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training within 14 days of being hired. And the third: All restaurants must have a process for employees to report harassment as well as protocols for investigating any incidents.

These criteria are reasonable starting points for implementing anti-harassment efforts. The problem is that, even when taking into account a number of additional sub-criteria outlined in the document, they lack the teeth that many experts consider necessary to combat harassment.

While the company requires restaurants to have a policy in place on sexual harassment, for instance, it doesn’t require them to have a standard way of communicating the policy to employees; according to the document, the policy can be shared via e-mail or text message, outlined in lengthy employee handbooks, or simply reviewed during orientation. The document also does not specify that the policy be written in a language that workers can easily understand or in the language that they speak.

Such fuzziness can undermine any corporate standards from the get-go, experts said. In order to be effective, anti-harassment policies must clearly explain which behaviors are prohibited, describe how to report harassment, and state what workers can expect to happen when a report is made, all in plain language that workers can understand. They can’t simply be handed out once at the start of employment, but need to be reinforced and accessible after that—posted in the break room, for example, or sent on a regular basis. The goal is not only for victims of harassment to know what to do, but also for all employees to understand “what are the behavioral expectations in the workplace,” Magley said.

It is difficult to know precisely why McDonald’s harassment prevention efforts failed in each of the cases reviewed by The Nation and Type Investigations. However, what is clear is that, at all of the restaurants in question, the new global brand standards failed to protect workers as promised.

When Fernando Valencia was hired at a McDonald’s in Vallejo, California, at the end of 2021, he didn’t receive any training, including on sexual harassment, he told The Nation and Type Investigations. This was right before the brand standards went into effect. But even after, at the start of 2022, he was given neither information nor training. Although he heard that there was supposed to be some sort of information posted in the break room about what to do if sexual harassment happened, “No teníamos nada,” he said: They didn’t have anything.

This became a problem when, shortly after Valencia started, a male store manager began harassing him daily, according to a complaint he filed with the California Civil Rights Department, touching his genitalia or making him touch the manager’s genitalia, kissing him, and promising raises for participating. Valencia had recently immigrated from Mexico and didn’t know there were laws against what he experienced, he said. “No sabía cómo eso es, cómo denunciar a eso”: I didn’t know what that was, how to report that. But it weighed heavily on him, turning his workplace into a “nightmare,” he said in Spanish. “It makes you feel small and bad about yourself.”

In June 2022, he decided to tell the manager’s boyfriend what had been happening, and the next month his hours were reduced and he wasn’t given opportunities for overtime pay, he said. It was only then that he and other employees at that location were given sexual harassment training, he said, although new hires were not.

That training was spare, Valencia said. During an eight-hour computer training on how to do the job, he said, only 30 minutes were devoted to how to talk appropriately to coworkers. The digital module warned employees not to touch each other because it could be considered sexual harassment, but it didn’t go into more detail than that. The store’s owners investigated his allegation after he filed his legal complaint, but nothing else was done about the harassment, he said.

The California Civil Rights Department declined to pursue Valencia’s case on his behalf but acknowledged his right to sue. A McDonald’s spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about Valencia’s case.

At least six other workers whose complaints The Nation and Type Investigations reviewed reported receiving no training at all after January 2022. This should not have happened, according to the “2022 U.S. People Brand Standards Visit” document. The document is clear that, in order for a restaurant to pass a brand standards inspection, assessors must ensure that it has a training program in place. The document fails to specify, however, what those trainings must consist of; nor does it require any kind of assessment as to whether they are effective or have any impact on the problem of sexual harassment.

The consequences of this lack of muscular requirements became evident in the cases of several workers who did receive training but say it was cursory and digital-only. Two workers in the Florida towns of Apopka and Lakeland who are participants in the Fairley class-action lawsuit said that the anti-harassment training they received after January 2022 consisted of slides in a PowerPoint presentation. Others watched short videos.

“The training in general felt rushed, like they just wanted me to learn how to physically do the job so that I could start working,” Salma Linda Chappa, who was hired at a McDonald’s in Plant City, Florida, in June 2022, stated in a legal filing in Fairley. It was during her orientation that a male manager started hitting on her within earshot of two other managers, who didn’t do anything to stop it, she stated. The harassment prompted her to quit a week later.

Zoe Newsome was already on edge about sexual harassment at McDonald’s before she was hired; female friends had told her they had been sexually harassed working there, she told me. But she needed the money to help her mother with bills, so in September 2021, at age 16, she began working as a crew member at a McDonald’s in Kissimmee, Florida, her first job. During her orientation, she watched a short slideshow that included basic information about sexual harassment. It “only lasted a few minutes and was not very helpful,” she wrote in a legal filing in the Fairley lawsuit.

About a year later, Newsome was promoted to crew trainer and was made to do the same sort of training, watching a “very short” video on harassment and how to report it. Neither training mentioned sexual harassment by customers, she alleges, or what to do if it happened.

Newsome told me that she’s the kind of person who “freezes up when that happens to me,” but if she had been taught what to do in the face of harassment, she might have been more prepared to handle it. “You’re young, it’s your first job, you don’t know what to do,” she said. “It’s kind of like ‘Fend for yourself.’”

McDonald’s did not comment on Newsome’s claims or those of any other worker.

While mandatory sexual harassment training via computer tutorials or videos has become common, experts say these trainings generally don’t stick with employees. “A training video coupled with a policy that’s handed to you is just wholly insufficient to change behavior,” said Gillian Thomas, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU Women’s Rights Project, who has represented sexual harassment plaintiffs against McDonald’s.

Instead, experts say, in order to be effective, anti-harassment training should be interactive, delivered by a human instead of a computer, tailored to the audience, and last at least four hours. The training should also be done regularly after people are hired, experts say. And companies should follow up with employees to see whether the training has had an impact.

Effective training is done “in a way that will actually inspire interest, inspire commitment to some kind of behavioral change,” Magley said.

Training is only the first step in addressing sexual harassment. It’s equally important for employees to have channels to report incidents—and for employers to have a clear process for investigating such reports, experts say.

The “2022 U.S. People Brand Standards Visit” document specifies that restaurants have to make the details of their reporting processes “visible and easily accessible in the restaurant.” This could mean a poster with a hotline number to call with any concerns or a document outlining how to make a report. It also says that restaurants must have a protocol in place for responding to employees who report concerns, but as with the training requirements, it doesn’t specify what those protocols should be. All of the workers who reported harassment after January 2022 said nothing was done.

Ashanti Torres-Rodriguez, who was 16 when she started working at a McDonald’s in Bradenton, Florida, didn’t know what to do when a male coworker in his 40s or 50s began asking her out and making comments about her body; she had never been informed, she told me. After he touched her back one day, she decided to tell her manager, according to a legal filing in Fairley, and when he kept touching her, she reported it to two other managers and eventually to the general manager.

The general manager, who seemed to be friendly with her harasser, didn’t appear to believe her, according to her legal filing. Torres-Rodriguez doesn’t think anyone investigated, and she kept being scheduled to work with the man, who touched her for months, despite her attempts to change shifts. The experience led to frequent panic attacks—so many that her general manager threatened to fire her because they were causing her to have to leave work so often. She quit in June 2022 to get away from the abuse, taking a lower-paying job at Dollar Tree; as of a year ago, she said, her harasser still worked at McDonald’s.

Torres-Rodriguez’s experience is not uncommon. Six other workers involved in Fairley said they were told to report incidents to their managers or the general manager—but they weren’t told what to do if that person failed to act.

On her first day at a McDonald’s in Bradenton in January 2022, Marybeth Wiggins told her manager that the person training her had harassed her, but the manager responded that it was “not a big deal,” according to her legal filing. On her third day, after the person touched her butt, she reported it to a different shift manager, who suggested she wait and, if it happened again, fill out paperwork about it. After another male trainer tried to grab her breasts, she asked a manager to file an official complaint, but once again was met with indifference. “It seemed like managers just wanted the job to get done, no matter what was happening to their employees—they didn’t care if anyone was being harassed,” Wiggins wrote in a complaint in Fairley.

McDonald’s managers also appear to have been ill-equipped to deal with sexual harassment by customers. Customers sexually harassed Zoe Newsome “every few weeks,” she alleges in her legal complaint. One grabbed her wrist whenever she handed food to him. Another told her, “You look like you’re good in bed.” One man in his 50s told her, “You look like an angel, but you’re actually a bad girl,” leaving her with chills and feeling like she was going to throw up.

Early on, Newsome told her manager, who “laughed uncomfortably” and did nothing else. She kept reporting it to various managers, but they never investigated the incidents and never filed any official reports. Nothing was done. Instead, they laughed it off. “They seemed desensitized to it,” she wrote.

“I’m a workaholic, I love to work, but I didn’t feel safe,” Newsome told me. “It honestly made me hate going to work.” She quit in November 2022. “I think McDonald’s is probably the worst when it comes to sexual harassment.”

Making sure employees feel safe reporting sexual harassment is essential to combating it, experts say. Employees should be allowed to report harassment to anyone, not just specific managers. Those managers have to then be trained in how to properly deal with reports—particularly in the fast food industry, where young people are often promoted into leadership—and there have to be visible consequences for any reports found to have merit.

Another important duty of any manager is making sure those who report harassment are protected from retaliation. But four workers say that they faced consequences for speaking up.

Valencia Pratt, who worked at a McDonald’s in Miami Gardens, Florida, in early 2022, while she was pregnant, alleges in a legal filing in Fairley that a male coworker made inappropriate comments to her like “Your booty is big” and “I want to eat your front” every day. Pratt asked to be put on different shifts so she wouldn’t have to work with him; she was fired less than a week later.

Reducing sexual harassment is not simple, but it is also not mysterious. What it requires of employers is a concerted commitment and a determination not simply to check off items on a list but to fundamentally change workplace culture. That’s because workers’ behavior “is guided by organizational norms, by what is and is not appropriate,” said Gillian Thomas, the ACLU attorney. “The only way to move the needle on culture change is through repetition and consistency of message, and having the message come from a variety of places, including from the very top—and then building in consequences when you don’t measure up.”

Experts have provided McDonald’s with a playbook for addressing sexual harassment more effectively. In a class-action sexual harassment lawsuit filed against McDonald’s in Michigan that was settled in April 2022, the plaintiffs sought an injunction to require the company to work with employees to develop mandatory training focused on recognizing, preventing, and addressing sexual harassment in the types of scenarios actually faced by McDonald’s workers.

Their proposal would have required McDonald’s to go farther than the measures the company currently appears to have in place. McDonald’s would have had to revise its anti-harassment policies so they were in plain language; implement a well-publicized process with multiple channels for reporting harassment; develop a protocol for investigating complaints by someone “skilled in conducting and documenting workplace investigations”; and ensure that people who engage in harassment and managers who fail to intervene face consequences.

The proposal would also have required practices to prevent retaliation and a system to monitor complaints and their resolutions, plus metrics to ensure that franchises prevent harassment and are penalized if they don’t. The settlement in the case meant that McDonald’s did not have to make these changes.

Instead, for many McDonald’s workers, the current global brand standards have not done enough to keep them safe. The consequences for some have been devastating.

Rosalia Manuel hasn’t worked since she was fired from the McDonald’s in Saratoga, California, in 2022. She’s had to seek out therapy, and her depression has been hard on her four children. Her family has had to rely on her husband’s income as a cook at Google and the money the couple makes cleaning carpets on the weekends. But that still isn’t enough to cover their rent, car payments, and food.

As difficult as the situation is, however, Manuel says that it’s the lack of accountability for those who did nothing to stop the harassment that she finds most frustrating.

""One of my members called this 'tariff hell,'"" said Bob Kirke, executive director of the Canadian Apparel Federation.

Retail groups in the U.S. have similarly warned that tariffs on Asian countries, where most American clothing is manufactured, will mean a steep uptick in prices ahead of the back-to-school season.

While the Canadian apparel sector wasn't targeted directly by the tariffs, many companies headquartered here make their products overseas and sell to customers south of the border.

Canadian retail giants like Aritzia, Lululemon and Gildan saw their stock tumble after the tariffs were announced last week by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Access to the U.S. market is critical for brands in this country if they hope to grow past a certain point, says Emma May, founder of the Calgary-based womenswear brand Sophie Grace.

""The U.S. market's amazing, it's huge,"" said May, who has customers on both sides of the border. ""We solve the same problem for the U.S. customer that we solve for a Canadian customer and there are 10 [times as many] of them.""

But May is starting to reconsider some of her U.S. expansion plans.

Her clothes are made in China and warehoused in Canada, where they are shipped to U.S. e-commerce customers. On top of an additional 34 per cent tariff on Chinese goods imposed last week, the White House has also said a previous exemption, that allowed small orders from China into the U.S. without tariffs, is closing.

""Maybe the U.S. market is just not something we can go at because our products will end up being just far too expensive for that customer,"" said May.

It's unlikely the U.S. will allow loopholes for Chinese-made products that make a pit stop in Canada before being sold in the U.S., says trade lawyer John Boscariol.

The Trump administration ""is trying to close up any loophole or potential exemption,"" said Boscariol, a partner with McCarthy Tetrault in Toronto.

And while clothing is a prime example, Boscariol says many Canadian businesses are likely dealing with the same problem.

""Whether you're in clothing, apparel items, toys, whatever... whether that's China, Vietnam or any other country in Asia that's now been targeted with very significant tariffs, you're going to be impacted by this in terms of your access to the U.S. market.""

Why not change factories?

Jeremy Oldland, co-owner of the Montreal kids clothing company Hatley, manufactures his products in China and India. He supplies pint-sized rain boots, pajamas and jackets to department stores, boutiques and e-commerce customers south of the border.

U.S. sales make up about half his revenue, says Oldland, and he expects that imposing a new surcharge on all those orders will spur a wave of cancellations.

""We're going to sell less product. It's going to hurt any way you do it,"" he said. And yet shifting supply chains out of Asia to North America would be difficult.

""We don't have the tradesmanship, the craftsmanship, we don't have the printing techniques, we don't have a lot of things [in Canada].""

Kirke, with the apparel federation, says the new tariffs are hitting the industry particularly hard because they seem to come out of left field.

In recent years, growing trade tensions between the U.S. and China have prompted some larger retailers to start shifting production outside of that country, a move that was also driven in part by reports of forced labour in China's Xinjiang region.

But now, the U.S. is also going after smaller manufacturing hubs like Vietnam, Cambodia and Bangladesh, where companies had previously been trying to diversify their production.

""That's a hard, hard thing to deal with,"" said Kirke.

Kirke says he is glad that the U.S. tariffs don't hit Canadian-made products, though this is a relatively small portion of the total industry.

The hope, he says, is that Trump will change course and back down on his tariff policy.

As for May, with the brand Sophie Grace, she hopes to continue growing her business — but with an emphasis on customers north of the border.

""We will obviously be looking to retrench in the Canadian market and then also explore other markets like Australia and Europe,"" she said.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7504382.1744071082!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/sophie-grace.JPG?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-04-08 12:22:36.342220

The closure will impact approximately 230 employees, and Danone has committed to providing fair social plans, retraining programmes and continued employment opportunities within the company for those affected.

Richard Trechman, managing director of Danone DACH, acknowledged the difficulty of this decision, highlighting the commitment of the Ochsenfurt employees and the plant's long-standing legacy.

Levi Strauss posted first-quarter profit that beat estimates on Monday, as higher full-price selling of its bottom wears and cost-saving efforts boosted the denim maker's margins.

Shares of the company, down about 22 per cent this year, rose about 2 per cent in extended trading as Levi maintained its full-year forecasts for sales and profit, which did not account for any impact from the recently announced tariffs.

The retailer has seen demand for wide-legged and skinny jeans hold up - a trend in line with rivals such as Abercrombie and Fitch and Gap - despite shoppers being selective in spending on discretionary items.

The company's finance chief, Harmit Singh, has in the past noted that a diverse supply chain with sourcing from over 25 countries gave Levi an edge over other retailers at a time when tariff risks have hit footwear and apparel retailers from Nike to Target.

""The company's celebrity partnerships, marketing efforts, and strong product pipeline are helping it to win over shoppers despite growing uncertainty - which bodes well for its ability to navigate an increasingly challenging macro-environment,"" said eMarketer analyst Rachel Wolff.

Gross margin increased 330 basis points to 62.1 per cent for the three months ended March 2, from 58.8 per cent last year, driven by lower product costs and a strong direct-to-consumer channel.

As part of its plan to streamline operations, Levi said last October it was exploring a sale of Dockers, which has seen demand struggle.

""Dockers is a business that we're currently in a competitive process to sell sometime in 2025,"" CFO Singh told Reuters.

The company's quarterly adjusted earnings came in at 38 cents per share, compared to estimates of 28 cents.

It posted a 3 per cent rise in revenue from continuing operations to $1.53 billion, which excluded sales from its Dockers brand, now reclassified as a discontinued operation.

Analysts, on average, were expecting a 1 per cent drop in revenue to $1.54 billion, as per data compiled by LSEG, including Dockers.

Instacart's business customers have access to a new white-label service designed to meet the needs of urgent, ""fill-in"" orders.

The grocery technology company’s Instacart Business subsidiary is launching Will Call Delivery, a new offering tailored for distributors and business operators in need of rapid fulfillment.

[READ MORE: Instacart launches business-to-business marketplace]

Will Call Delivery is a white-label solution built for distributors to streamline same-day ordering via their sales reps. Business-to-business and wholesale customers that need items fast can order from their sales reps as usual, and the sales reps can then request an Instacart shopper pick up specific, high-priority items from their warehouse and deliver to their end customers, all in a couple of clicks.

In addition, in an effort to better address out-of-stocks or service customers that are far from the warehouse, distributors have the ability to place orders from retailers on the Instacart marketplace that are closer to their end customers.

This personalized, targeted fulfillment option is designed for circumstances such as when a restaurant owner needs a case of limes or chicken breasts hours before the dinner rush.

All Instacart shoppers have access to comprehensive shopper educational modules covering a variety of food safety topics, including personal hygiene, cross-contamination, time/temperature control for safety (TCS) foods, and storage and transportation tips.

A global luxury brand is AI-enabling its leather goods production and procurement planning capabilities.

Based in Milan, Italy, Prada Group operates brands including Prada, Miu Miu, Church’s, Car Shoe and Marchesi 1824. The company is implementing the artificial intelligence-based o9 Digital Brain platform in an initiative to approve leather goods production orders more efficiently.

Prada Group will tailor reports to support near real-time procurement decisions and leverage root-cause analysis reporting across its highly complex, multi-tier global supply chain to provide insights across ongoing and upcoming production flows.

As a result, the company seeks to help planners anticipate and proactively mitigate potential leather goods supply chain issues, develop finished goods and semi-finished goods production plans, provide greater visibility into capacity at internal factories and external suppliers, and align raw material procurement with production plans.

“o9 is pleased to partner with Prada Group on its journey to optimize production planning with a world-class platform that mitigates potential risks that could create capacity bottlenecks, and to develop processes that enable smarter procurement, planning, and decision-making,” said Chakri Gottemukkala, o9 co-founder and CEO. “We look forward to continuing our partnership with Prada Group in the years to come.”

Prada Group also uses cloud-based solutions from Oracle Retail and Adobe to help collect and analyze customer data to enhance personalization and targeted promotions.

In addition, in summer 2024 the company began deploying the Adyen financial technology platform across all of its retail channels with the goal of creating unified customer experiences, including ""tap to pay"" payment.

Cincinnati-based supermarket giant Kroger reported this month that its aborted takeover of Albertsons cost the company more than $1 billion, according to a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The nation’s largest traditional supermarket operator disclosed it spent $684 million in 2024 on “merger related costs” mostly on “third-party professional fees (outside experts, such as lawyers) and credit facility fees (borrowing costs),” according to its annual report filed on April 1. The latest bills were on top of $316 million spent in 2023 and $44 million spent in 2022. The grocer first announced the proposed deal in October 2022.

Lawyers and other consultants were busy in 2024

Last year was the busiest of Kroger’s merger gambit: antitrust regulators including the Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general from Washington state and Colorado filed separate lawsuits to kill the $25 billion proposed transaction; from August to October, the merits of and objections to the deal were argued in courtrooms in both Seattle and Portland, Oregon; and in December, two separate judges, one federal and one from Washington state, issued rulings blocking the deal, which prompted Albertsons to call the deal off a day later.

Critics of the proposed $25 billion merger said the deal would give Kroger too much power in the marketplace. They also argued it could worsen rampant inflation that drove overall supermarket prices 25% higher after the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020.

Lawsuits could add to the final merger tab

In the collapsed deal’s aftermath, there may be further costs: Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons sued Kroger the same day it pulled out of the deal, blaming the grocer for botching regulatory approval. And last month, Kroger’s former proposed divestiture partner, C&S Wholesale Foods, which stood to acquire nearly 600 stores if the merger went through, filed a lawsuit in Delaware, claiming Kroger owed the New Hampshire-based company a termination fee for the canceled deal.

Both retailers have announced the departures of their respective CEOs; and both grocers have cut jobs. In March, Kroger announced Rodney McMullen, CEO since 2014, had resigned amid an investigation into his “personal conduct” that “was inconsistent” with the grocer’s policy of business ethics.

Kroger has launched a search for a new CEO and is currently being led by Ron Sargent, 69, a board member and former Staples CEO.

Based in downtown Cincinnati, Kroger employs 409,000 workers nationwide, including roughly 20,000 in Greater Cincinnati. Kroger operates 76 stores in Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky, employing 14,500 associates.","https://www.cincinnati.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/09/04/PCIN/75070320007-kroger-albertsons-mashup.png?crop=4070,2290,x0,y212&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-04-08 01:59:44.276241

A higher tariff rate will start on Apr.
Trump fired back on Monday, threatening an additional 50% tariff on China if the country doesn't remove its US tariffs.","Levi's (LEVI) execs just gave a market nervous over bruising tariffs a taste of what's to come for earnings season.

A heavy dose of confusion, with a lack of clear cut guidance for investors in search of badly needed clarity.

""Given that the situation is fluid and unprecedented, the impacts are uncertain. We are in the process of scenario planning and determining different mitigation strategies. We recognize this is a quickly evolving macro situation and we have to see where the dust settles to give you the guidance that is going to be as helpful to you as possible,” Levi's long-time CFO Harmit Singh said on a late Monday earnings call.

“For now, our full-year outlook remains unchanged and includes no impact from the proposed tariffs.""

Levi's CEO Michelle Gass said the company has assembled an internal ""task force"" to determine the tariff impact and proper responses, such as price increases.

The company relies on 130 facilities in China and 50 in Vietnam — two countries Trump earmarked for large tariffs — to produces its various apparel offerings.

At least for now, the market thinks Levi's may be able to overcome some tariff headwinds.

Shares rallied more than 10% in pre-market trading on Tuesday on the unchanged profit outlook and a 10 cent quarterly earnings beat. Execs said on the call that demand remained solid through the end of March.

Levi's shares were among the top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance platform.

But whether the post earnings rally can be sustained is up in the air.

President Trump uncorked a baseline tariff rate of 10% that went into effect on Apr. 5.

A higher tariff rate will start on Apr. 9 for about 60 countries that the administration considers to be the worst trade offenders.

Some of those nations are important sourcing and business regions for large US retailers in Levi's and Nike (NKE). China, for example, will see reciprocal tariffs of 34%. Vietnam clocks in at 46%.

The reciprocal tariffs are on top of existing duties, such as the 20% Trump imposed on China earlier, bringing the total rate on the country to 54%.

China has retaliated with a 34% tariff on American goods. Trump fired back on Monday, threatening an additional 50% tariff on China if the country doesn't remove its US tariffs.

""Levi’s isn’t immune to cost shocks or consumer slowdown: for sensitivity, we estimate tariffs could represent a high-single digit percentage hit to calendar 2026 earnings power assuming no degradation in consumer demand; and could represent mid-teens percentage hit to calendar 2026 earnings power assuming a mid-single digit percentage impact to quantity demanded,"" Stifel apparel stock analyst Jim Duffy said in a note on Tuesday.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UVAlC0uQcajskoeN1WhdFA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MTc7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-04/520fd020-1407-11f0-aa9f-77c4b84a8f8c,N,,2025-04-08 05:03:35.375572

(Reuters) -Levi Strauss maintained on Monday its annual forecast for sales and profit, excluding the impact of tariffs, and posted quarterly profit ahead of Wall Street targets, sending its shares up more than 7% in after hours trade.

Sweeping tariffs by President Donald Trump have sparked concerns over a global downturn and sharp price hikes for items such as clothing and footwear.

""While we recognize that we are operating in an uncertain environment, our global footprint, strong margin structure, and agile supply chain position us to navigate the balance of the year and beyond,"" President and Chief Executive Michelle Gass said in a statement on Monday.

The company said in January that a diverse supply chain across 25 countries would allow it cross-source products.

Levi imports only about 1% of its merchandise directly from China into the U.S., while that for Mexico was about 5%, its executives said in January.

The retailer is looking at price increases as one of the mitigating measures, said Gass, adding that price increases will be ""surgical.""

It has seen demand for wide-legged and skinny jeans hold up - a trend in line with rivals such as Abercrombie & Fitch and Gap - despite shoppers being selective in spending on discretionary items.

In its quarterly filing with regulators, the company added that it was analyzing the impact of tariffs and what it could do to minimize impact.

""We expect these new tariffs to have a material impact on our results of operations in fiscal year 2025,"" it added.

It also said the environment could affect production and distribution.

""If these disruptions persist, they may require us to modify our current sourcing practices, which may impact our product costs, and, if not mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations,"" it warned.

""Given that the situation is fluid and unprecedented, the (tariff) impacts are uncertain,"" CFO Harmit Singh said on a post-earnings call.

Rachel Wolff, an analyst at eMarketer, said, ""Levi Strauss (NYSE: )’ unchanged forecast shows the sheer impossibility of planning ahead, as uncertainty surrounding Trump’s tariff moves paralyzes brands.""

As part of its plan to streamline operations, Levi said last October it was exploring a sale of Dockers, which has seen demand struggle.

The company expects fiscal 2025 net revenue to be down in the range of 1% and 2% and adjusted earnings of $1.20 to $1.25 per share.

On an adjusted basis, it earned a profit of 38 cents per share in the quarter, compared to estimates of 28 cents.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEB2C0AG_L.jpg,N,,2025-04-07 22:01:55.589040

In response, the US-listed company said: “We have no political agenda. We do not use our profits to fund any government or military operations anywhere — and never have.”

It also wrestled with new entrants into the UK’s “highly competitive” coffee market as well as cost of living pressures squeezing disposable income. A weaker consumer environment coincided with inflationary pressures for commodities such as dairy and cocoa and wage inflation.

Duncan Moir, president of Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), said: “It has been a difficult period for the sector. We navigated significant macroeconomic pressures including inflationary headwinds which have also had an impact on consumer confidence.

“We are focused on regaining momentum by strengthening and scaling how we integrate technology

across the business, building on the popularity of our Starbucks Rewards programme and further

optimising our menu to ensure we continue delivering on our core offering every time.”

The San Francisco-based company said its guidance for fiscal 2025 “assumes no significant worsening” of macroeconomic pressure on consumers, supply-chain disruptions, increased tariffs or similar factors. Levi sees organic revenue growth, which excludes items such as currency impact and divestments, growing 3.5 to 4.5 per cent this year.

Shares rose 2.1 per cent at 4.55 pm in extended New York trading. Since US President Donald Trump announced the tariffs on Apr 2, the stock has declined 19 per cent.

Chief financial officer Harmit Singh said it’s “difficult to forecast or plan at this stage” for the tariffs’ impact on consumers. He said the company is focused on issues it can control such as its relationships with vendors and the cost base for its products.

Chief executive officer Michelle Gass said the company is approaching the topic of tariffs with “urgency, but not being overly reactive”.

Levi is one of the first retailers to report earnings after Trump unveiled the tariffs last week.

The company says it sources about 5 per cent of its goods in the US from Mexico, a mid-single digit from Vietnam and 1 per cent from China. It works with 130 facilities in China, 50 in Vietnam, 37 in Bangladesh and 36 in Sri Lanka, according to a company website listing partners in its supply chain.

Gass said Levi sources from 28 countries, adding they are “the places that you’d expect in the apparel industry”.

“We are doing our homework,” she added, without offering more details on specific measures the company is taking to counteract the tariffs. If the company needs to raise prices, it would be “surgical”, Gass said, and be focused on new products that have resonated with shoppers.

In its release, the company said it has “secured the majority of inventory required to meet US orders” in the second quarter.

In the first quarter, the company posted earnings of 38 US cents a share, higher than the average analyst estimate. Levi excluded its Dockers brand, that it’s looking to sell, from its results and adjusted its outlook to reflect an expected divestment.

The company is focused on bolstering its namesake brand and increasing sales through its own channels, such as its stores and website.

Today’s call is scheduled for one hour, so please limit yourself to one question at a time to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed.

And now I’d like to turn over the call to Michelle. Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to today’s call. I’m pleased to share that 2025 is off to a strong start, and our shift to becoming a DTC first company is driving both strategic and financial value. In q one, we exceeded expectations across sales, margins, and EPS, driven by the momentum of our strategy. We again achieved high single digit organic net revenue growth, up 9%.

Direct to consumer continues to be the primary growth driver, up 12%, fueled by positive comp growth, successful new openings, and strong e com performance. Our wholesale business delivered another quarter of positive growth, up 5%. Our US business further accelerated, up 8%, while international was strong as well, up nine percent. And we extended our market leadership with share gains across both women’s and men’s. I am proud we are able to deliver these strong results while fundamentally changing the way we work as part of our hard pivot towards becoming a best in class omnichannel retailer.

Given last week’s tariff announcements, we’re dealing with a dynamic macro environment. However, I’m confident in our ability to navigate these rapidly evolving times. As an iconic brand with more than a hundred and seventy years of history, we’ve weathered challenging times before. We have a playbook that begins with leveraging the strength of our brand and our deep connection with consumers. We know, especially during times like these, people turn to the brands they know and trust and prioritize value and quality, and that’s what Levi’s has always stood for.

Today, almost 60% of our revenue is generated outside The US. We have scale with an agile global supply chain, deep vendor relationships, and a strong balance sheet, all of which position us well to navigate this time of uncertainty. I’ll now walk you through highlights from the quarter in the context of our strategy. Note that all numbers that Harmit and I will reference are on an organic basis and exclude jockers, which as you saw in our release, has been moved to discontinued operations as we explore a sale of the brand. Let’s start with our first strategy, being brand led.

The Levi’s brand was up 8% for the quarter and continued to reach new levels of strength all over the world. While many brands aspire to be at the center of culture, we are firmly there. You can see that through our partnership with the most influential artist of our generation, Beyonce. Since launching Reimagine in September of twenty twenty four, the campaign has generated more than 4,300,000,000 impressions and more than $65,000,000 in estimated earned media value, continuing to help us drive equity gains with men and women across our market. As another proof point in our ongoing efforts to drive brand heat, this last quarter, the Levi’s brand was featured in a complete unknown, a highly celebrated biopic of Bob Dylan starring Timothee Chalamet.

Bob Dylan, known for his love of Levi’s, has shaped and defined culture across many decades. To commemorate the film’s release, we launched a limited edition collection featuring some of Bob Dylan’s wardrobe staples. This example of how we lean into our legacy to spark inspiration for the future is further proof that we’re not a heritage brand, but instead a brand with heritage. We are also partnering with authentic, locally influential icons to drive brand heat and anchor the brand at the center of culture across the globe. Earlier this month, we expanded our partnership in India with Punjabi superstar Diljit Dosan and launched a new campaign in Germany with Stephanie Geisinger, strengthening our appeal with consumers in both of these important markets.

And as a testament to the strength of the Levi’s brand, we gained market share in men’s and women’s in the quarter, further solidifying our number one position in denim across both categories. And consistent with our strategy to recruit younger fans to the brand, we also grew share with our 18 30 year old target consumer demographic. These consumers transacted a higher AUR and purchased more frequently than our average consumer. Moving to product. While our history is built on jeans, our future will be built around lifestyle, always rooted in denim.

For most of our history, we’ve been known as a men’s jeans business. But to achieve our bold aspirations, we need to be more. Over the last couple of years, we have significantly expanded our head to toe offering, especially with women, while maintaining our dominance with men. This enables us to further expand our already large total addressable market. And as a result, women’s continued to accelerate, growing double digits over the last two quarters and now represents 38% of net revenues.

Tops represents more than 20% of our business, which has more than doubled over the last ten years. Inspired by denim lifestyle, newer categories such as dresses, skirts, and outerwear continue to grow at a faster pace than the rest of the business. And while we’re the leader in jeans, our portfolio beyond denim bottoms now comprises 35% of our total sales. As we diversify our product portfolio, we also remain laser focused on our core Levi’s bottoms business. And in q one, bottoms were up 9%, driven by strength in both men’s and women’s.

The continued success we’ve achieved in bottoms is attributable to our fit diversification strategy. We have a style for everyone for every occasion and for any time of year. Loose and baggy fits, which make up roughly 15% of our total bottoms portfolio, continue to be a significant growth driver. For her, we’re building on the trend with new fits. A great example is our launch of the Finch Faggy available across both DTC and wholesale, which went viral on TikTok and created tremendous interest with search volume surpassing 200,000,000.

And with men, we’ve been focused on expanding this trend through new fit launches, like the five sixty eight loose straight and the five seventy eight baggy. While there’s so much buzz around the loose and baggy trend, slim and skinny styles remain a wardrobe staple and comprise more than 20% of both our women’s and men’s bottoms businesses. We continue to infuse innovation and newness into these styles with a robust pipeline of new fits, finishes, and fabrics. Our men’s classic five eleven slim fit is a great example now offered across the range of fabric, washes, colors, as well as part of our new tech series, earning us more space in his closet. As part of our denim lifestyle strategy, tops remain a key growth category for us.

And in the quarter, tops grew 7%. We’re seeing stronger growth in our direct to consumer channel, up low double digits, where we offer our broadest assortment. There is a long runway for growth in our tops business, and the strong demand we’re seeing in our DTC channel give us great confidence that this will scale to be a meaningful part of our business over time. Our pipeline of newness and innovation remains robust, and I’m confident this will continue to drive impact and resonate with our fans. We continue to see an opportunity to further premiumize the brand with the global launch of the Levi’s Blue Tab collection.

Introduced in Asia earlier this year, Blu Tab paired our iconic Levi’s aesthetic with the quality and sensibility of Japanese craftsmanship. Our most elevated expression of denim leadership to date, the collection features iconic denim staples along with new tops, skirts, and outerwear. And building on the success of our lightweight denim collection, we’re excited to introduce our newest innovation, linen and denim, combining the authentic feel of blue jeans with soft, light linen. Now shifting to our strategy to be DTC first. Our global direct to consumer business delivered another quarter of double digit growth, up 12% and posting its twelfth consecutive quarter of positive comp.

AURs in the channel were up mid single digits as customers are gravitating to more premium products as well as an intentional reduction in promotion in our stores. DTC productivity actions, including improving the front of house consumer experience and back of house efficiency, are driving growth across key metrics, including strong conversion and traffic trends, fueling significant margin expansion in this channel. I see firsthand how our strategies and actions are driving these results when I walk our stores and get feedback from our team. Our stores today reflect a more robust head to toe offering compared to when we were mainly a men’s denim bottoms destination, and we’re now showcasing a broader denim lifestyle assortment through tops, dresses, outerwear skirts, and both denim and nondenim bottoms. Our inventory levels are healthier with better in stock availability, and we’re equipping our stylists with enhanced product knowledge and improved selling techniques.

The results of all of this work are more productive and profitable doors, increasing our conviction that we can build several hundred more stores in the future. And we are on that path today. In q one, we continued executing our retail expansion plan. Notable openings include Rome on Via Cola Di Renzo, 1 of the most renowned shopping streets in Italy, and continued expansion across Mexico and India as we grow our retail footprint in these important markets. We have abundant opportunity to increase our DTC presence in major markets all around the world, including here in The US.

Our efforts to accelerate our performance in our ecommerce business are working with a channel up 16% in q one on top of 13% in the prior year. Over the last couple of years, the team has been focused on three core areas to fuel momentum in our econ channel, including fixing the fundamentals, evolving the assortment, and elevating the consumer experience, creating a much more premium and engaging destination for the full Levi’s experience. We have upgraded the content on our site with higher quality imagery that focuses on our lifestyle assortment and enhanced storytelling. We’re featuring more use of videos on our product detail pages, which allow our consumers to see our product in motion. And we’re seeing a strong response from our consumers with customer satisfaction scores for The US E Com business rising to its highest level ever.

Today, comprising just 12% of our total company net revenues, we believe that e commerce represents another significant engine for growth. DTC ended the quarter at 52% of total global net revenues, up two points to last year, accounting for over half of our total revenue, a milestone as we transform into a DTC first company. We are also encouraged by the performance in our global wholesale channel, up 5%, driven by strong growth in The US. US wholesale exceeded our expectations in the quarter, up 9%, in part driven by door expansion and more space with our broadened lifestyle assortment. Our Levi’s women’s business was a particular bright spot, up 17%.

Consistent with our strategy to diversify our channels of business, US department stores now represent just 7%, which is less than half of what it was ten years ago. Signature, our value brand, also grew this quarter, up 19%, driven by strength in our seasonal fit. And as we look to the balance of the year, we remain prudent as respect global wholesale. We continue to expect the channel to be flat for the full year on an organic basis, and this continues to be an important profitable channel for us. Now turning to our third strategy, powering the portfolio.

Our international business represents close to 60% of our total business today, up 9% in q one, driven by growth in Mexico, The UK, France, and Germany. International growth remains an important opportunity for us long term, and we continue to believe that we are underpenetrated. Beyond yoga was up 10% in q one.

Unidentified Speaker: We

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: are continuing to focus on brand building initiatives to drive awareness and profitable growth. Customers are responding to our broad assortment of colorways and styles, as well as new products like our luxe fleece collection, expanded outerwear assortment, and our lifestyle status trousers. And comp sales in our small but growing network of stores were positive for the quarter. In closing, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. We recognize that the environment around us continues to have uncertainty, and we’re focused on the things we can control.

Our first quarter performance demonstrates how our transformation into a best in class lifestyle retailer is accelerating both the top line and the bottom line. Our key strategies of being brand led, DTC first, and powering our portfolio, along with our efforts to rewire our company to be faster and more consumer obsessed, are working and are gaining momentum. Our team is focused on executing with excellence, and I’m grateful to our employees around the globe for their commitment to the change underway and for their unwavering dedication to consistently deliver for our fans. I am confident we have the right foundation to capture the opportunity ahead and deliver profitable long term growth for all of our shareholders. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Harmit to provide a financial overview of the quarter and our expectations for the year.

Harmit?

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you, Michel. We started the year with momentum. Our financial results were better than expected, and our transformation to a DDC first lifestyle business is making real progress. As you saw in this morning’s press release, Dockers has been reclassified to discontinued operations. As you will notice, while Dockers was a positive contributor to sales, our gross and operating margin structure is higher, excluding Dockers, thereby improving the structural economic and profitability of our remaining business.

Our focus on structural economics is reflected in the fact that net revenues, margins, expenses, and EPS were all better than expected. While global wholesale net revenues were up for the second consecutive quarter, our direct to consumer business continues to lead our growth, with net revenues up 12% as we consistently execute the three things that matter most in this channel, what I call a trifecta, positive comp sales, opening high performing stores, and growing ecommerce profitability. Besides the double digit top line growth, our direct to consumer EBIT margins grew 500 basis points in the quarter, contributing to the company’s overall margin expansion. This is helping drive sustainable sequential progression across our p and l. Q one twenty five organic net revenues accelerated to 9% versus flat in q one twenty three and ’24.

Gross margin was a record at 62.1 this quarter versus 58.2 in q one twenty four and fifty six point five in q one twenty three. Given our expense discipline in q one, we were also able to leverage adjusted SG and A margin by 70 basis points, all of which drove 400 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion to 13.4% versus 9.4% in q one twenty four and eleven point five percent in q one twenty three. Now turning to a brief review of our results. 9% top line growth was driven by better than expected performance in both direct to consumer and wholesale channels. Two third of the growth was driven by units and a third by higher AURs.

Turning to margins, we continue to see expansion in both our gross and operating margins. Gross margin for q one was 52.1 percent of net revenues, a new record. Gross margin expanded 330 basis points relative to last year, driven primarily by the continued benefit of lower product costs, favorable channel and brand mix, and higher full price selling. Adjusted SG and A expenses in the quarter were up 2% versus prior year to $744,000,000 from higher distribution expenses driven by a transition to a hybrid 3PL structure. We were pleased to see our adjusted SG and A rate of 48.7% improve after last quarter’s elevated levels, leveraging 70 basis points versus prior year.

Gross profit dollars growth outpaced the adjusted SG and A dollar increase, delivering a flow through of 84%, driving adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 400 basis points to 13.4%. Adjusted diluted EPS came in at 38, well ahead of our expectations and up 52% to prior year. We ended the quarter with reported inventory dollars up 7% to the prior year. We feel comfortable with the level and composition of our inventory and have secured the majority of inventory required to meet US orders for quarter two. In the quarter, as planned, we closed 21 net stores as a system.

However, this consists of 30 new store openings, primarily full price Levi’s brand stores and 51 closures, which were mostly underperforming franchisee stores in China. Our disciplined fleet review process ensures that the doors we are opening are productive, and only the most profitable with the highest return opportunity remain open. In the quarter, we returned 81,000,000 to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, which were up 12% to prior year. In quarter two, we have declared a dividend of 13¢ per share, an increase of 8% versus prior year. Now let’s review the key highlights by segment.

The Americas net revenues were up 11%, fueled by double digit growth across both direct to consumer and wholesale. In The US, net revenues were up 8% driven by high single digit growth in both channels. Our business in Mexico was up 6% from increased traffic in our stores as well as ecommerce growth. For the segment, strong gross margin and SG and A leverage led to operating margin of 21.7, improving three seventy basis points to prior year. Europe was positive for the third consecutive quarter.

Net revenues were up 3% in q one, led by double digit growth in key markets like The UK and Germany. Direct to consumer continued to accelerate this quarter, up 11%, supported by comp stores, ecommerce, and more full price sales. While wholesale shipping was down in the quarter, given the transition of our distribution center in Germany, we expect wholesale in this segment to return to growth in quarter two and have strong pre book orders, up mid to high single digits for spring and summer. Gross margin expansion drove operating margin to leverage a 20 basis points versus prior year to 25.6%. Asia net revenues increased 10% compared to prior year.

Direct to consumer net revenues were up 14, led by double digit growth in key markets like Japan, Korea, and Turkey. Our South Asia, Middle East, and Africa business, which includes India, was also up double digits this quarter as improved in store retail experiences drove higher UPT and better conversion rates in addition to growth in wholesale. This quarter, our China business was flat to prior year, and we continue to have modest expectations in ’25 as our work to reset this market is underway. Operating margin of 18.8% was up 200 basis points to last year from stronger gross margin. Now turning to our full year and quarter two guidance.

We had a strong first quarter with broad based strength across segments, channels, and categories delivering a notable beat for the quarter, and we saw solid trends continue through March. However,

Unidentified Speaker: as

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: you all know, there were changes to the tariff structure announced a few days ago. Given that the situation is fluid and unprecedented, the impacts are uncertain. We are in the process of scenario planning and determining different mitigation strategies. We recognize this is a quickly evolving macro situation, and we have to see where the dust settles to give you the guidance that is going to be as helpful to you as possible. For now, our full year outlook remains unchanged and includes no impact from the proposed tariffs.

Our q two outlook remains consistent with our internal plan. The impacts of tariffs will have a minimal impact to our margin structure in the quarter as most of the product for spring, early summer is already in The US. As a reminder, q two is seasonally our lowest quarter for revenue and margins in the year. For quarter two, we expect organic net revenue growth from continued operations of three and a half to four and a half percent. This excludes approximately two points of foreign exchange headwinds and one and a half points attributable to the exit of Denizen and our footwear business, which implies being flat to up 1% for the quarter on a reported basis.

Gross margin is expected to be up between 80 basis points to a hundred basis points, and adjusted EBIT margin is expected to be in the range of five and a half percent to 6%. This translates to an adjusted diluted EPS of approximately eleven to thirteen cents, which includes around 3¢ headwind from foreign exchange and a higher tax rate versus prior year. With this expectation, our profitability assumptions will be significantly higher, up approximately 20% versus h one twenty four. In closing, I will leave you with three thoughts. First, while the tariffs announced last week pose a significant challenge for us and the industry, our business and our brands have endured for one hundred and seventy years, proving our resilience.

Today, the Levi’s brand is stronger than ever with diversified global revenue, solid margin structure, a giant sourcing base with deep vendor relationships, and a strong balance sheet. We are well positioned to manage through this uncertain time. Second, we delivered strong first quarter results, and we’re starting the year with momentum. Our new products are resonating and driving market share gains. We have a robust product pipeline that will fuel growth in our denim and non denim business for the rest of ’25 and beyond.

We’re making incredible progress on growing the direct to consumer channel to a longer term goal of 55% of our business while also growing wholesale. Third, we are both transforming our business while delivering strong financial results and improving our structural economics as we continue on our path to becoming a $10,000,000,000 company with 15% operating margin. I will now open up the line for q and a.

Conference Operator: You. The floor is now open for questions. Due to time constraints, the company requests that you ask only one question. If you have an additional question, please queue up again. If at any point your question has been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing 11 again.

Our first question comes from the line of Laurent Vasilescu of BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Laurent?

Unidentified Speaker: Good afternoon, Michelle and Harmit. Thanks for taking our question. With tariffs front and center on everyone’s mind, can you provide a percentage breakdown of sourcing by key countries for the investors on this call? What are your suppliers saying about providing potential concessions? And then on passing some of the tariffs down the value chain, how much and when do you think you can raise pricing?

Thank you very much.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Yes. Hi, Laurent. Thanks for the question. So let me just take a step back for a minute. And obviously, the news on tariffs is very new.

It’s fluid. This was just a couple of days ago and I think we like the industry are getting our arms around it. I would say that as we enter in this period, we are coming from a place of strength. We have momentum on the business, the brand’s never been stronger and we’ve achieved significant margin expansion. That said, we have a task force assembled assessing the various scenarios and identifying what levers we have to mitigate.

And you’ve named a couple of them, but I’d first start with the structural changes, cost structure that we can make as part of our transformation initiative. As you know, we’ve made significant progress. You see it again in Q1 with margin expansion. So we will look there first on how we can accelerate further margin and cost opportunities. Point number two is, yes, we will work with all of our stakeholders.

That includes our vendors. It includes our customers as we assess and look at what opportunities we have. As it relates to our vendors, we’ve got long, deep relationships with many suppliers around the world. We source from 28 countries, 20 of which are countries that we source into The US. I’ll speak to some of the countries in a moment.

So that is definitely an area that we’re investigating. But we’re in the very early days on that, Laurent, so I’d say more to follow. And then similarly, on pricing, as we look at pricing, we do believe that the brand, especially given the health of the brand, that there is pricing power there. But if we do anything, it’ll be very surgical. As you saw even this past quarter, our average unit retail, their AURs were up again.

So the consumer is actually increasing prices. They buy up into more premium products. So that’s an opportunity. We’ve also been pulling back, especially in our DTC channel and some promotion. We had more full price selling.

So that whole area is an opportunity. So I would just say more to come. But really, we’re looking at those three areas, The cost structure, kind of the end to end stakeholder and supply chain, and then surgical pricing. And then specific to the supply chain, as I said, we have a global long tenured supply chain. We source from over 28 countries.

The places that we source from are the places you’d expect from the industry. Some of the key countries for us, in no particular order, are places like Bangladesh, Cambodia, Egypt, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Vietnam. Those, I’d say, are our top vendors. But it’s broad. And I’d say our supply chain is more agile today than it ever has been.

We make pivots all the time. We will continue to do so as we look to address the issues both in the short, medium, and long term.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: And I think what we’ve disclosed, Laurent, into The US from China approximately 1%, into The US, from Mexico approximately 5%, and from Vietnam in the mid to high single digits into The US.

Unidentified Speaker: Very helpful. Thank you very much for your thoughts.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead, Dana.

Dana Telsey, Analyst, Telsey Advisory Group: Hi, everyone. Nice to see the progress. As you think about inventory levels, Harmit, how you planning inventory levels going forward on wholesale orders? What are you seeing from the account? And Michelle, given the Beyonce campaign and some of the other activations and collaboration, women’s business, men’s business, how you thinking of the denim market growing?

And what should we be looking at given the linen and denim and new things coming and how you’re thinking about pricing? Thank you.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Dana, a couple of things. Inventory at the end of q one was The composition of the inventory is healthy. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, for The US, we have product for spring and summer. And so that’s why, you know, we gave a guidance on quarter two.

The other thing is our quarter two includes March, and the the the trends in March are stronger than how we exited the, you know, February. So that’s that’s a perspective on that business. We’re being prudent in inventory planning. You know, as we think about the year, you know, as you think about inventory, the three things, and now the fourth that we’re keeping in mind, there was getting product in for spring and summer largely because the tariff clouds were you know, there was an overhang even a couple of months ago. The second for Europe is Red Sea disruption, and and and and the and the third was generally, you know, our thinking about about the year.

So being very prudent. As a reminder for everybody, we sell a lot of coal. Right? So a lot of our product is seasonless, and we can carry it through seasons. And our balance sheet is fairly strong.

We talked about the cash position at the end of the quarter and the access to liquidity. So we are in a good spot in a lot of ways, but we’re being prudent. To your question about wholesale orders, global wholesale was up 5%. US wholesale was up nine organically. This was the second quarter where we have seen both global wholesale and US wholesale up.

And, you know, so as we think and as we’ll as we are understanding right now, there’s been no change to there’s been no change to orders in from wholesale customers. Inventory or trade inventory is, you know, very similar to 2019 levels. Just now let me share a little bit of a perspective on wholesale in Europe. Wholesale in Europe was down in quarter one. Essentially, as I said, because we are ramping up our distribution center, we expect wholesale to return to growth in quarter two.

The indicate best indication of wholesale demand in Europe is prebook, which for spring and summer is positive, and for fall is positive right now. And I think the second question, Michelle, she asked you about the denim category.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Yes. So, Dana, thanks for the question. And I think to echo what we said in remarks, we’re really pleased with the start of the year, and the Levi’s brand has never been stronger. So Levi’s brand was at 8% in the quarter. And I think to your question, we’re seeing gains in both men and women, both in market share and in equity.

So specific to the Beyonce campaign, 4,300,000,000 press impressions, more than 65,000,000 in media value alone. But I think importantly, it’s creating a nice tailwind to everything else that we’re doing. Specific to, as we think about our transformation, we must preserve and drive the leadership position in men’s. But our intention has been to accelerate with women’s because we’re under shared there. Women’s is now 38% of our business.

Q1 was our fourth consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Like I said, we are now firmly in the number one position market share in The US, and we’re growing that, which is really exciting. Women’s was up 12% overall across all channels and geographies. And then if you look at DTC, which is really the leading indicator, up 16% in the quarter and really delivering on that head to toe lifestyle. So as we pivot from jeans to becoming DTC, becoming head to toe, we’re seeing that in our DTC results, up 12%, and we’re seeing that in women’s and in lifestyle.

So like I said, women’s up 16 and both bottoms and tops growing. The team is really nailing it in terms of driving trends and fashion fit. Diversifying the fit opportunity to strengthen loose and baggy continues, but our core remains strong. Western wear continues to trend. The list goes on.

But even in times like these, when it’s turbulent, we’re going to lean in and please our fans with delivering the highest quality product. It’s a great value and deliver that innovation. Thank you. Thanks, Dana.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Please go ahead,

Matthew Boss, Analyst, JPMorgan: Great. Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Thanks, Matt. Thank you.

Matthew Boss, Analyst, JPMorgan: So Michelle, could you elaborate on key drivers of the 9% organic growth, maybe consumer demand and market share trends that you’re seeing in The Americas? And Harmit, if you could maybe speak to the cadence of gross margin in the second quarter relative to the back half?

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Sure. Great. So I can start. I mean, one of the things, Matt, that we’re really proud of the team’s efforts this quarter is really across the board, we saw strength. So if you take our geographies as an example, so our total organic revenue is up nine percent.

We saw strength in The Americas, in Europe, and in Asia, and beyond yoga, I would say, as well, as that carries forward another quarter of double digit growth. The channels both channels were positive. DTC up 12. 12 quarter of positive growth, can speak to that in a moment, as well as our wholesale business up 5%. And I’d say it’s particular strength in US wholesale.

And then if I really double click under DTC, because the 9%, clearly the 12% is what’s fueling the majority of that. It’s now 52% of our business. As you know, our long term goal that we’ve put out there is to be at least 55%, so we’re making great progress. But if you think about DTC and look at some of the the KPIs, the key metrics there, as it relates to our owned and operated stores, positive comp sales. We saw positive traffic.

We saw positive conversion, and we saw positive AURs. E commerce up 16%, again, positive traffic, conversion, and AURs. And so when you think about this, the growth is healthy and it’s sustainable. We’re seeing both it coming through volume and units, which accounted for about twothree of the business, and we’re also seeing AURs up, which is about up onethree. So this, as we look at the trends, feel like it’s sustainable.

And it’s all coming off of the back of our key strategies. When we say DTC first, denim lifestyle, winning with women, we’re seeing that across the board. And then your second part of your question was around market share. And as I think I mentioned even in my earlier remarks, we’re really pleased to see the growth we are seeing there. Both men’s and women’s grew market share in The US this past quarter, number one in both positions across both genders.

And the other piece that we’re seeing nice momentum and growth is growing market share with youth, that eighteen to thirty year old target customer, as well as the premium consumer. So there’s just there’s just, a lot to like and a lot of momentum we’re seeing across all of our segments of the business.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: And, Matt, to your question of gross margin, which to me is a great indicator of how the brand’s doing, record gross margins in quarter one at 62.1. I think the best way to think about it is half is driven by product costs, which are not truly just straight vendor negotiation. As part of our transformation efforts, we’ll you know, we’re taking a hard look at SKUs. We have reduced our SKUs. You know, we’re taking a hard look at assortments that are not as productive, as well as our newer innovations are great margins.

So that’s one piece of it. And the other half, I would say, is a combination of mix, which is higher women’s, higher DTC, higher international, higher full price selling that Michelle referred to. There’s a there’s a real focus given that our products are hitting home. We drive higher full price selling, and we had favorable effects given our, you know, hedging strategy. Similar in for q q two.

So q two reflected margins would be up 80 to a hundred basis points, again, driven by this. And on a full year basis, a hundred basis points. To your question about cadence, first half versus second half, the first half is really strong. The second half, because our margin structure was very strong a year ago, the second half will be muted. Still up, but, you know, much lower than the first half.

And, you know, obviously, we are focused on driving more full price selling. It’s something that is difficult to predict. That’s why, you know, we continue to beat margins. I mean and the other reason that’s driving higher margin is the wonderful DTC business is higher gross margin.

Matthew Boss, Analyst, JPMorgan: Great color. Best of luck.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you, Matt.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Sole of UBS. Please go ahead, Jay.

Jay Sole, Analyst, UBS: Great. Thank you so much. Maybe just on the guidance for Q2, can you give us a sense of for that organic net revenue growth, how you see that by region?

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Yeah. So, similar, Jay, I would say, you know, The US low to mid single digit, as you think about, you know, q two. Europe, probably mid single digit with one difference. Wholesale should return to growth given what I indicated in Asia. Again, mid single digit.

If you think of channels, BDC, you know, I would say high single digit. And global wholesale, flat to slightly up is the general thinking at this stage.

Jay Sole, Analyst, UBS: Got it. Alright. Great. Thank you so much.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you, Jay.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Ike.

Ike Boruchow, Analyst, Wells Fargo: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Harmit, I think two for you. Just can you walk us through the expense deleverage that looks to be implied in the 2Q after getting some pretty good leverage in 1Q? And then it looks like the back half should go back to kind of getting nice leverage to flat.

Just what exactly are the spending dynamics kind of taking place in the second quarter? And then bigger picture for you, it sounds like there’s no revenue issues for the business at all right now. But at least over the past couple of weeks, it might be helpful. Could you talk about the brand overseas? I think there’s some growing narrative about anti American response to US brands that there is a risk to what’s going on geopolitically.

Would love to hear if you’re seeing any of that or if there’s any noteworthy developments that you’ve come across in the past couple of weeks. Thank you.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Right. So I’ll Ike, I’ll I’ll try and do this in a speed round. Right now, international business is fairly strong. We are not seeing any any impact internationally. From our perspective, you know, we’ve been here for a long, long time.

Internationally, you know, as a business, we’ve been around for, you know, over eighty years. So we’re not seeing it. You know, we’re in friends with the local consumers, connecting really well. And our new product offers that Michelle referred to are generally doing well. To your question about the quarter two guidance, so quarter two, just as a reminder, is largely, you know, is our lowest volume quarter just from the seasonality.

First quarter has December holiday. Third quarter has back to school, and the fourth quarter has the beginning of holidays. The second quarter, So seasonally, it’s the lowest quarter. In terms of SG and A increase, the first quarter was up two. We expect the second quarter to be up three.

SG and and A as a rate is in the mid fifties. It was around under 50. We still expect SG and A for the year to be around 50%, and this is prior to any actions that we take, as Michelle referred to, you know, to mitigate actions on tariff, etcetera. And the EPS decline relative to last year is primarily driven by foreign exchange and higher tax. You know, even though foreign exchange rates have improved a little from the last quarter, they’re very volatile.

They go up and down. And so our perspective is FX and higher tax will probably impact EPS adversely by about 3, you know, 3¢. But structurally, the business is in good standing. You know, gross margins, you know, we expect to be up, and organic rate to be up three and a half, 4%. You know, think of our reported revenue reported revenue in quarter two, I said it’s flat to slightly up.

And so that’s what the deleverage in terms of EBIT percentage.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Yeah. The only thing I would add to what Harmit is saying is just when you think about the whole year, know, we’re we’re obviously thinking about our strategy is to drive the top line. We’ll get some leverage there and drive margin expansion, both in gross margin over the year and in EBIT margin. And as you know, we saw progress from 2024 over 2023, and we’ve guided the year to see another level of expansion there as well. All this, of course, does not yet reflect the tariffs.

Ike Boruchow, Analyst, Wells Fargo: Got it. Thanks a lot.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thanks, Ike.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Nardone of BofA. Please go ahead,

Chris Nardone, Analyst, BofA: Great, guys. Good afternoon. Just a couple of follow ups. First on U. S.

Wholesale, can you just clarify whether your guidance is implying positive or negative growth for the remainder of this year? And then looking out, it sounds like you benefited from expanding into some newer wholesale distribution points in the first quarter. How big is this opportunity over the medium term? And do you need growth in U. S.

Wholesale to reach your medium term EBIT margin targets?

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: So Chris, we’ve had two great quarters in wholesale. US and the team, big shout out to them. They’ve delivered US wholesale growth in the first two quarters. I indicated, I think, in the earlier question, q two globally, we expect wholesale to be flat to slightly up. Our expectation in US wholesale right now, we continue to be prudent, and so we think, you know, a flat number is a good number at this stage.

Obviously, we’re another quarter under the belt. We’ll we’ll talk about the the full year from that perspective. On the distribution, you are right. You know, our opportunities on distribution in The US is primarily around the categories we are growing DDC. We think we have an opportunity in women’s.

We think we we have an opportunity in tops. And as you know, you know, after the exit of Denizen and Target, we are working with our customers, in this case, Target, to try and grow our Levi’s business, and that’s making a difference. So as we think about opportunities of distribution and wholesale, there are opportunities around the company, especially as we grow the categories and, you know, both gender, women and men’s, as Michelle referred to, and the different categories as a pivot to a denim lifestyle company.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Oliver Chen of TD Cowen. Please go ahead,

Oliver Chen, Analyst, TD Cowen: Hi, thanks. Michelle and Harmit, in the past, what are your thoughts around frameworks around pricing? And also, when you look at tariffs in the past, what percentage did you absorb versus share with customers in different ways? As we look forward, if you pricing has been something that you’ve adjusted in the past and recently in terms of being prices being too high. So would you take lower margins in terms of offering the consumer a good value?

I know there’s a very dynamic situation here with tariffs and inflation.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Yes. Oliver, I’ll take that. Thanks for the question. I mean, think the word you just said is very appropriate, which is it is very dynamic right now. I mean, we’re literally this this whole situation is just a couple of days old, as you know, and I think both Harmeet and I mentioned we’ve got a really talented team right now who’s dissecting the problem and looking at all the levers that we have to address the issue, two of which you just hit on, which is we will work with our vendors, with our customers to understand the best way forward.

And then pricing is a potential lever. Would say as we think about it, we will very much think about any pricing if we do take pricing very surgically. Number one, one of the things we’ve seen our consumer do is they’re actually driving price up. We saw our AURs again this quarter increase as they gravitate to more premium products. So we expect that to continue.

There could be more pricing power in our more premium products. So we’ll look at that. Promotions. We have been surgically pulling back more in DTC, I would say, on promotions and achieving more full price selling. So that is something that

We can test pricing in our DTC channel. That’s something that we can more easily do and understand the elasticity. We have recent experience, for example, in Mexico where we successfully took some price adjustments based on the tariffs there. And then what I would say overall as we think about the Levi’s brand, we address today a broad range of price points. If you start at the core of our product, we’re at a very accessible price point in that $40.50 dollars range.

Then we do compete in the value segment with signature. It’s largely offered in some of the mass channels. That’s doing really well. We were up 19% this quarter. And then we go high end, the way from, I’ll call it, our tier two, which is in our mainline stores.

You’re seeing more and more on that of ecom. That’s where we’re in the $90.100 dollars range. And then even upwards of $200.300 dollars with Tier one and our new Blue Cab. So I share that in the spirit of we have a lot to work with here to determine what is going to be our right path forward. But it’s gonna be really important for us to be super sensitive to the consumer and make sure that we’re on the right path.

Oliver Chen, Analyst, TD Cowen: Okay. And Harmine, can you get inventory faster, like, now in order to address what’s happening? Or what happened with the inventory you have on hand relative to the win and the the methodology for inventory valuation that we should know about with timing of prices relative to the cost of goods sold?

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Yeah. I mean, Oliver, we’re looking at all options right now. You know, I’m sure a lot of our partners and vendors are being called, you know, and so we’re looking at options. We’ve been able to successfully air freight, you know, in the past when we were chasing product. The fact that we have inventory for spring and summer is a good indication.

We’re also working on a faster go to market calendar, especially for the newer products. So, you know, we’re doing everything that we can within our means. And to your question about, you know, cost accounting and, you know, depending on where tariffs it totally depends where tariffs settle. It’s such a fluid situation, and so we’re working through it.

Oliver Chen, Analyst, TD Cowen: Okay. Thanks. Best regards.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thanks, Oliver.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Please go ahead, Paul.

Unidentified Speaker: Hey, thanks guys. Can you tell you’re thinking about the various macro backdrops of the major regions that you operate in and also how you’re looking at the competitive landscape currently? You’re seeing any changes in terms of promotions, either increasing or decreasing, and just, you know, sort of what is the the backdrop that that you’re you’re thinking about by by your major regions? Thanks.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Yeah. So the good news, Paul, is, you know, q one is a good indication of the momentum of the brand. The growth was broad based. All regions were up. You know, Europe was up only three, but on an organic basis, because that was driven by the ramp up in our distribution center.

And so as we think across the world, you know, Europe, Third consecutive quarter of growth. US, Fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Mexico, Second consecutive quarter of growth. Asia, up, you know, double digits. So, generally, the momentum is strong from that perspective.

Being global and 60% international, I think, will make a difference, at least from that perspective. Consumer, generally resilient across the world. They’re responding to our new products. You know, our products offer great value, as Michelle referenced. So we’re feeling generally good from that perspective.

Unidentified Speaker: Any changes on the promotional front? That

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: you Yeah. And promotions, actually, we are tightening promotions. I mean, that’s why the focus on full price sales, you can see it in margins. So we’re not necessarily going the other way at this stage because the consumer is not giving us giving us a reason for a change. And because inventories are generally in a good spot, there’s no reason to push that down faster, push price down faster.

Unidentified Speaker: Great. Thanks, Henry. Good luck.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thanks, Paul.

Conference Operator: Comes from Brook Roach.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company0: Good afternoon, and thank you for taking our question. I was hoping that you could talk a little bit more about your playbook should the macro environment worsen. What’s the cost structure of your business today? How much is fixed versus variable? And how much additional SG and A leverage can you drive this year to offset higher product costs if the macro environment worsens materially?

Unidentified Speaker: Thank you.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: It’s all it’s all being planned right now, Brooke. I think the best best proxy, unfortunately, but the best proxy recently is is 2020 and ’21, which is which was COVID. At that point, our view was, you know, fixed and variable. You know, I’d say between sixty five and seventy fixed, the rest variable. You know?

And variable, I’d also add incentives available, for example. But, you know, it’s the last thing you want to touch, especially when there’s so much momentum in the brand, I’ll put it there. I think as you think about our stores, very similar cost structure, but even then, we actually grew our store base. You know, we kept adding stores. And so, you know, we’re thinking through it.

We’re putting everything on the table right now as we think through the three levers, which is, you know, cost initiatives without compromising the long term, stakeholder management discussions, which is customers and our vendor partners, and the third is pricing, you know, options and initiatives. And so we are looking at all options, Brooke. And then we have an international business that’s very strong. Right? That could also be you know, we can drive some momentum there to offset some softness, if any, in The US.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company0: Great. Thanks so much. Best of luck.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you. Thank you, Brooke.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining our call today, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

The company said the workers will be laid off starting June 2, with all layoffs occurring by March 31, 2026. All affected workers are at the company's headquarters at 4900 E. Dublin-Granville Road.

The company is also maintaining its 2025 top and bottom line guidance which excludes, it says, any impact from the recent tariff announcements.
But then they say which excludes any impact from the recent tariff announcements and we said we anticipate minimal impact to our second quarter margin outlook.
But again, this is why earnings season is going to be so interesting, Kenny, because we're going to get these companies to say this.
Um, but it's really again, it's not even so much about the numbers, because remember the numbers are history.","Let's take a look at what's trending after hours. We want to talk about Levi's, the denim company. Those shares are moving higher after it delivered a beat on first quarter earnings. The company is also maintaining its 2025 top and bottom line guidance which excludes, it says, any impact from the recent tariff announcements. So that's really important here, um, that I I want to emphasize here. The company's saying in a statement, Harmit Singh, who is the chief financial and growth officer, says, we're maintaining our forecast, which seems like a good thing. But then they say which excludes any impact from the recent tariff announcements and we said we anticipate minimal impact to our second quarter margin outlook. Um, Kenny Polcari, you are still with me here, and I have been I've been looking very closely at companies like this, because obviously Levi's sources a lot of its stuff from outside the US and is subject to tariffs. So you see a statement like this, and at first you say, oh, they're maintaining. That's a good thing. We're excluding all tariffs, though. Is that just because they can't

Well quantify it at this time. if they can't quantify it, but that then leaves open the door, while it sounds positive. They said they've just said we're excluding the tariffs, suggesting we can't quantify it, so we may have more negative news down the line. But the market is not taking it that way. I mean it's up a little bit. What's it up, 2% in the after hours, um, although it is down 34% in the last year. So maybe there's a little bit of a push to, but it's going to be interesting to see if there's any other further clarification, if someone starts calling them out asking them for you know, for more clarification.

It feels that way. Yeah. Right. Yes. Well, I mean, the conference calls is going to be real interesting in that regard. I am sure that analysts are going to push them on a potential tariff effect. But again, this is why earnings season is going to be so interesting, Kenny, because we're going to get these companies to say this. We're going to get um forecasts from many of them, or Right.

We won't get any. Right.

We won't get any, because they say we just don't know. What is the and what is the tariff going to be? I have no idea. Right.

And I think if you have a lot of them that say they're not going to forecast or they can't tell, that's going to be a negative, right? People are going to take it as a negative, because they're going to lose they're going to lose the guidance. They're not going to know which way to go. So that would, in my mind, it would cause uh it would cause the market to become weaker, or at least their stock to become weaker. Um, but then if we keep hearing that with more and more companies, then you know, it'll have a more broader effect.

You said this, though. Yeah. Yes, exactly. You know, we've been asking a lot of people today what they're expecting for earning season. We didn't have a chance to ask you, so.

So I so I think already, listen, I think that when we came into the year, it was supposed to be 12% year-over-year growth. I think that's been whittled back down to 7%. We've seen, you know, uh as they as they modify coming into the end of the quarter. Uh so I think that's I think I'm comfortable saying that I think that's about what it's going to be. And to Keith's point, where he said you're going to see probably a 70% B grade, which is kind of It's the game that they all play. Yes. the number, right? Right. So they they lower the numbers and then they beat it. They go, oh, look, we beat it. I got it, great. Um, but it's really again, it's not even so much about the numbers, because remember the numbers are history. When they report their history It's history. It is really about what they say going forward, and this quarter is going to be very important about what they say going forward.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UjNpulZk93jf4INRqhsn0w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-04/81221d90-13f4-11f0-bf7f-e67618f85d32,N,,2025-04-07 19:05:44.936909

“It’s dynamic, it’s new, it’s fluid and it’s changing,” Gass said of the business climate.
Levi’s set up a task force to understand how the trade change would hit its business and how it could mitigate the impact.
Adjusted earnings per share were 38 cents — 10 cents ahead of the 28 cents analysts had penciled in, according to Yahoo Finance.
“It’s a competitive process,” Singh said of the Dockers sale.","Momentum has got to count for something — in sports and fashion.

“We had a strong quarter,” said Michelle Gass, president and chief executive officer of Levi Strauss & Co., in an interview on first-quarter results. “[Organic] sales up 9 percent kicks off 2025 in a very strong way. But not only sales, our margins were up. It’s another proof point that our transformation is working.”

But this is also one of those moments when the past has a lighter grip on the present and the future is all the more uncertain.

U.S. President Donald Trump moved on from sniping at China to launching a global trade war last week, adding on 10 percent tariffs on goods from nearly every other country. And some have been hit with much higher rates including China, which is being hit with an additional 34 percent tariff.

“It’s dynamic, it’s new, it’s fluid and it’s changing,” Gass said of the business climate. “We — and the entire industry — are facing a tremendous amount of uncertainty at this moment.”

In addition to some momentum, Levi’s has been cutting costs as it moves to a stronger direct-to-consumer stance and is also cushioned by its international business, which accounts for 60 percent of sales.

Levi’s sources from 28 countries, including China (which accounts for only 1 percent of product), Mexico (5 percent) and Vietnam (a single-digit percentage). The rest of Levi’s goods come mostly from other countries in Asia.

But there’s really no global supply chain in fashion that could skirt Trump’s tariffs.

Levi’s set up a task force to understand how the trade change would hit its business and how it could mitigate the impact.

“We’ve already been on the path to improve the structural economics of the business,” said Gass, referring to work that has seen Levi’s cut costs over the past year or so. “We will look to accelerate that and then we will work with all of our partners. And if we do take pricing, we’re going to do that very surgically. No decisions have been made.”

The speed of events on the ground — Trump, for instance, threatened China with another 50 percent tariff on Monday — makes it hard to settle on any decision.

So for now Levi’s, like the rest of fashion, is planning and watching the market closely.

First-quarter sales rose 3 percent to $1.5 billion, but were up 9 percent on an organic basis, which excludes currency fluctuations, the closed footwear and Denizen businesses and the Dockers business, which is now classified as a discontinued operation.

Net income tallied $135 million, or 34 cents a share, up from losses of $10.6 million, or 3 cents a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share were 38 cents — 10 cents ahead of the 28 cents analysts had penciled in, according to Yahoo Finance.

Levi’s ended the quarter with $574 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.4 billion.

Harmit Singh, chief financial and growth officer, called that “a very good spot” to be in.

The company is holding Dockers for sale and was said to be in exclusive talks with brand management firm Marquee Brands. But sources said that period of exclusivity expired just as the market hit its tariff crisis, making it difficult to value the brand in the current environment.

“It’s a competitive process,” Singh said of the Dockers sale. “There are a couple of prospective buyers. We are in the middle of the sale process and it is confidential right now.”

He said the company was confident that a deal would close “sometime in 2025.”

If the uncertainty in the market has complicated the Dockers sale, Gass said Levi’s mission was still clear despite a volatile world.

“There is uncertainty at times like these,” the CEO said. “Levi’s is the type of brand that people will go to. They are going to go to brands that they trust, and we stand for the things that are really important in uncertain times, which is quality, value, taking care of our consumer. We’re going to continue to focus on great execution and operate against our playbook. That playbook is working.”",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Michelle_Gass_Levis.jpg?crop=0px%2C726px%2C1997px%2C1119px&resize=1000%2C563,N,,2025-04-07 18:10:54.948675

CEO notes 'uncertain environment' but touts an 'agile supply chain'

Levi Strauss & Co. on Monday reported a higher adjusted quarterly profit than Wall Street expected, and the denim and jeans maker said it was sticking with its full-year outlook - one that doesn't include the potential impact from President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The company said it still expects a sales drop of 1% to 2% for its fiscal year, which is set to run through November, with adjusted earnings of $1.20 to $1.25 a share. That forecast, Levi's (LEVI) said, excluded any hit from ""the recent tariff announcements."" But it said it expected ""minimal impact"" to its margin expectations for the second quarter.

Levi's reported fiscal first-quarter sales of $1.53 billion, up 3% year over year. It reported adjusted earnings per share of 38 cents.

Analysts polled by FactSet expected Levi Strauss to report adjusted earnings of 28 cents a share for its first quarter, which ended on March 2. They expected sales of $1.54 billion.

""While we recognize that we are operating in an uncertain environment, our global footprint, strong margin structure and agile supply chain position us to navigate the balance of the year and beyond,"" Chief Executive Michelle Gass said in a statement.

Shares rose 3.1% after hours.

The financials included in Levi's earnings release excluded $67 million in sales related to Dockers, which the company now considers ""discontinued operations.""

The company has been trying to sell its Dockers business, amid efforts to lower costs and focus more on newer jeans and other denim items. Levi's has tried to retain inflation-fatigued consumers' interest with a partnership with Beyoncé.

Levi's reported the results as new tariffs announced last week by Trump continue to roil markets. Meanwhile, jeans could be targeted for steeper trade retaliation by the European Union.

Morningstar analyst David Swartz, in a note last week, said Trump's tariffs had ""significant implications"" for clothing makers. He noted that nearly all the clothing sold in the U.S. is imported, mainly from Asia.

Levi's, in its most recent annual report, said that in its last fiscal year, it got its products from manufacturers in nearly 30 nations. No more than 30% came from any one country, that report said. The company said it sourced products from North and South Asia, the Americas, including the United States, as well as Europe and Africa. And it said that of the items it sells in the U.S., ""less than 1% are directly sourced and manufactured in China.""

Even before Trump's announcement, Levi's had forecast falling sales for its fiscal year. In January, management said ""there continues to be a lot of uncertainty related to the macro environment, potential tariffs, changes in the tax code, as well as worsening foreign exchange.""

The stock is down some 34% over the past 12 months.

Shares of the company, down about 22% this year, rose about 2% in extended trading as Levi maintained its full-year forecasts for sales and profit, which did not account for any impact from the recently announced tariffs.

The retailer has seen demand for wide-legged and skinny jeans hold up — a trend in line with rivals such as Abercrombie & Fitch ANF and Gap GAP — despite shoppers being selective in spending on discretionary items.

The company's finance chief, Harmit Singh, has in the past noted that a diverse supply chain with sourcing from over 25 countries gave Levi an edge over other retailers at a time when tariff risks have hit footwear and apparel retailers from Nike NKE to Target TGT.

""The company's celebrity partnerships, marketing efforts, and strong product pipeline are helping it to win over shoppers despite growing uncertainty — which bodes well for its ability to navigate an increasingly challenging macro-environment,"" said eMarketer analyst Rachel Wolff.

Gross margin increased 330 basis points to 62.1% for the three months ended March 2, from 58.8% last year, driven by lower product costs and a strong direct-to-consumer channel.

As part of its plan to streamline operations, Levi said last October it was exploring a sale of Dockers, which has seen demand struggle.

""Dockers is a business that we're currently in a competitive process to sell sometime in 2025,"" CFO Singh told Reuters.

The company's quarterly adjusted earnings came in at 38 cents per share, compared to estimates of 28 cents.

It posted a 3% rise in revenue from continuing operations to $1.53 billion, which excluded sales from its Dockers brand, now reclassified as a discontinued operation.

References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency translation fluctuations.
We define earnings before interest and after taxes as Adjusted net income plus interest expense and income tax expense less an income tax adjustment.
Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric Adjusted net income.","Operating margin was 12.5% compared to 0.04% in Q1 2024. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 400 basis points to 13.4% from 9.4% last year on a reported basis primarily due to higher gross margin.

Gross margin increased 330 basis points to 62.1% from 58.8% in Q1 2024 primarily driven by lower product costs and favorable channel and brand mix.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $749 million compared to $756 million in Q1 2024. Adjusted SG&A was up 1.7% to $744 million compared to $731 million last year. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A was 48.7% compared to 49.4% last year.

Restructuring charges were $7 million related to Project Fuel.

Interest and other expenses, net, which include foreign exchange losses, were $15 million in the aggregate compared to $12 million in Q1 2024.

The effective income tax rate was 20.6%, compared to 15.9% in Q1 2024.

Net income from continuing operations was $140 million compared to net loss from continuing operations of $10 million in Q1 2024. Adjusted net income was $150 million compared to $100 million in Q1 2024.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.35 compared to diluted loss per share from continuing operations of $0.03 in Q1 2024. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.38 compared to $0.25 in Q1 2024.

Additional information regarding Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted net income, Adjusted diluted earnings per share, Adjusted free cash flow as well as amounts presented on an organic net revenues basis and constant-currency basis, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures, is provided at the end of this press release.

Cash and cash equivalents were $574 million, while total liquidity was approximately $1.4 billion.

Total inventories increased 7% on a dollar basis. We have secured the majority of inventory required to meet U.S. orders for Q2.

Shareholder Returns

The company returned approximately $81 million to shareholders in the first quarter, a 12% increase over prior year, including:

Dividends of $51 million, representing a dividend of $0.13 per share.

Share repurchases of $30 million, reflecting 1.6 million shares retired.

As of March 2, 2025, the company had $560 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization, which has no expiration date.

The company has declared a dividend of $0.13 per share totaling approximately $51 million. The dividend is payable in cash on May 9, to the holders of record of Class A common stock and Class B common stock at the close of business on April 24.

Fiscal 2025 Guidance

Guidance for 2025 is based on continuing operations, reflecting the Dockers® business being reported in discontinued operations. Financial results for prior periods have been recast to exclude discontinued operations.

The company’s fiscal 2025 guidance remains unchanged other than to reflect the Dockers® business as a discontinued operation and does not reflect any impact from the recently announced tariffs.

This outlook also assumes no significant worsening of macro-economic pressures on the consumer, inflationary pressures, recessionary concerns, supply chain disruptions, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions taken in response to such tariffs, or currency impacts. Adjusted diluted EPS is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

To supplement its financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital to provide investors with additional useful information about its financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operating decision-making. The company presents these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing its financial performance from management's view and because it believes they provide an additional tool for investors to use in computing the company's core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. The tables found below present Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital and corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Certain items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company’s actual financial condition and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management in determining how they are formulated. Some specific limitations include but are not limited to, the fact that such non-GAAP financial measures: (a) do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or liabilities including pension obligations, post-retirement health benefit obligations and income tax liabilities; (b) do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital requirements; and (c) do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business. See ""RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES"" below for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-currency

The company reports net revenues in accordance with GAAP, as well as on an organic net revenues basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our revenues which excludes the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates from the change in reported net revenues, net revenues derived from business acquisitions or divestitures impacting the previous 12 months of the reporting date and the estimated impact of any 53rd week. The company reports certain operating results in accordance with GAAP, as well as on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.

The term foreign currency exchange rates refers to the exchange rates used to translate the company's operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar into U.S. Dollars. Because the company is a global company, foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on its reported results. In general, the company's financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. Dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. Dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which it conducts its business. References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency translation fluctuations.

The company calculates constant-currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the prior-year period at actual foreign currency exchange rates for the current period. Constant-currency results do not eliminate the transaction currency impact, which primarily includes the realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized from the measurement and remeasurement of purchases and sales of products in a currency other than the functional currency and of forward foreign exchange contracts.

The company believes disclosure of organic net revenues and Adjusted EBIT constant-currency, Adjusted EBIT Margin constant-currency and Adjusted Net Income constant-currency results are helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of its results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. However, organic net revenues and constant-currency results are non-GAAP financial measures and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should be read in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have limitations in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2025

The following information relates to non-GAAP financial measures, and should be read in conjunction with the investor call held on April 7, 2025, discussing the company’s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the quarter and year ended March 2, 2025. Because the results of our Dockers® business are classified as discontinued operations, those results are not reflected in our non-GAAP measures.

We define the following non-GAAP measures as follows:

Adjusted SG&A:

The following table presents a reconciliation of SG&A, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted SG&A for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Net Income:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted net income for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share:

The following table presents a reconciliation of diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted diluted earnings per share for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow:

Adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, includes net cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment from continuing and discontinued operations. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available after capital expenditures for operational expenses and investment in our business. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is useful to investors because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet, invest in future growth and return capital to stockholders.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted free cash flow for each of the periods presented.

Return on Invested Capital:

We define Return on invested capital (""ROIC"") as the trailing four quarters of Adjusted net income before interest and after taxes divided by the average trailing five quarters of total invested capital. We define earnings before interest and after taxes as Adjusted net income plus interest expense and income tax expense less an income tax adjustment. We define total invested capital as total debt plus shareholders' equity less cash and short-term investments. We believe ROIC is useful to investors as it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business.

Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric Adjusted net income. Although ROIC is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROIC. As a result, the method we use to calculate our ROIC may differ from the methods used by other companies. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP.

The table below sets forth the calculation of ROIC for each of the periods presented.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-Currency:

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by segment on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025.

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by channel on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by brand on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Constant-Currency Adjusted EBIT and Constant Currency Adjusted EBIT margin:

The table below sets forth the calculation of Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin on a constant-currency basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Constant-Currency Adjusted Net Income and Constant-Currency and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share:

The table below sets forth the calculation of Adjusted net income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share on a constant-currency basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Discontinued Operations - Dockers®

In the fourth quarter of 2024, we announced we were undertaking an evaluation of strategic alternatives to the global Dockers® business, including a sale or other strategic transactions. During the first quarter of 2025, we commenced a sale process of the Dockers® business with the target of completing a transaction in fiscal year 2025. As of March 2, 2025, we determined the Dockers® business met held for sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria. The supplemental table below includes our 2024 results recast for continuing and discontinued operations.

Levi Strauss said fiscal first-quarter revenue rose, boosted by the U.S. market, and kept its outlook for the year unchanged but excluded the impact of higher tariffs from its guidance.

The apparel retailer on Monday swung to a profit for the three months ended March 2 of $135 million, or 34 cents a share, from a loss of $10.6 million, or 3 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier.

Stripping out one-time items, the company's earnings per-share came in at 38 cents. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast adjusted earnings of 28 cents.

""While we recognize that we are operating in an uncertain environment, our global footprint, strong margin structure, and agile supply chain position us to navigate the balance of the year and beyond,"" Chief Executive Michelle Gass said.

Revenue rose 3.1% to $1.53 billion, excluding $67 million of revenue from Dockers after being reclassified as a discontinued brand, and boosted by a 6% increase across its core Americas region. Overall, direct-to-consumer revenue increased 9%, while wholesale fell 3%. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast total revenue of $1.54 billion.

In the U.S., revenue rose 8% on an organic basis after logging high-single digit growth in both its direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses.

The company kept its outlook for fiscal 2025 unchanged, excluding the impact from President Trump's latest round of tariffs, but said it expects a minimal impact to its second-quarter outlook.

Levi's guidance also doesn't assume any significant worsening macro-economic pressure on the consumer.

The company expects a drop in full-year revenue of 1% to 2%, and adjusted earnings between $1.20 to $1.25.

Guidance for 2025 is based on continuing operations, reflecting the Dockers® business being reported in discontinued operations. Financial results for prior periods have been recast to exclude discontinued operations.

The company’s fiscal 2025 guidance remains unchanged other than to reflect the Dockers® business as a discontinued operation and does not reflect any impact from the recently announced tariffs.

This outlook also assumes no significant worsening of macro-economic pressures on the consumer, inflationary pressures, recessionary concerns, supply chain disruptions, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions taken in response to such tariffs, or currency impacts. Adjusted diluted EPS is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and the rules of the SEC. To supplement its financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital to provide investors with additional useful information about its financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operating decision-making. The company presents these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing its financial performance from management's view and because it believes they provide an additional tool for investors to use in computing the company's core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. The tables found below present Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital and corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Certain items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company’s actual financial condition and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management in determining how they are formulated. Some specific limitations include but are not limited to, the fact that such non-GAAP financial measures: (a) do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or liabilities including pension obligations, post-retirement health benefit obligations and income tax liabilities; (b) do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital requirements; and (c) do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business. See “RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES” below for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-currency

The company reports net revenues in accordance with GAAP, as well as on an organic net revenues basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our revenues which excludes the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates from the change in reported net revenues, net revenues derived from business acquisitions or divestitures impacting the previous 12 months of the reporting date and the estimated impact of any 53rd week. The company reports certain operating results in accordance with GAAP, as well as on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.

The term foreign currency exchange rates refers to the exchange rates used to translate the company's operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar into U.S. Dollars. Because the company is a global company, foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on its reported results. In general, the company's financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. Dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. Dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which it conducts its business. References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency translation fluctuations.

The company calculates constant-currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the prior-year period at actual foreign currency exchange rates for the current period. Constant-currency results do not eliminate the transaction currency impact, which primarily includes the realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized from the measurement and remeasurement of purchases and sales of products in a currency other than the functional currency and of forward foreign exchange contracts.

The company believes disclosure of organic net revenues and Adjusted EBIT constant-currency, Adjusted EBIT Margin constant-currency and Adjusted Net Income constant-currency results are helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of its results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. However, organic net revenues and constant-currency results are non-GAAP financial measures and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should be read in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have limitations in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2025

The following information relates to non-GAAP financial measures, and should be read in conjunction with the investor call held on April 7, 2025, discussing the company’s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the quarter and year ended March 2, 2025. Because the results of our Dockers® business are classified as discontinued operations, those results are not reflected in our non-GAAP measures.

We define the following non-GAAP measures as follows:

Adjusted SG&A:

The following table presents a reconciliation of SG&A, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted SG&A for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Net Income:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted net income for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share:

The following table presents a reconciliation of diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted diluted earnings per share for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow:

Adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, includes net cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment from continuing and discontinued operations. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available after capital expenditures for operational expenses and investment in our business. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is useful to investors because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet, invest in future growth and return capital to stockholders.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted free cash flow for each of the periods presented.

Return on Invested Capital:

We define Return on invested capital (""ROIC"") as the trailing four quarters of Adjusted net income before interest and after taxes divided by the average trailing five quarters of total invested capital. We define earnings before interest and after taxes as Adjusted net income plus interest expense and income tax expense less an income tax adjustment. We define total invested capital as total debt plus shareholders' equity less cash and short-term investments. We believe ROIC is useful to investors as it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business.

Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric Adjusted net income. Although ROIC is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROIC. As a result, the method we use to calculate our ROIC may differ from the methods used by other companies. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP.

The table below sets forth the calculation of ROIC for each of the periods presented.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-Currency:

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by segment on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025.

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by channel on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by brand on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Constant-Currency Adjusted EBIT and Constant Currency Adjusted EBIT margin:

The table below sets forth the calculation of Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin on a constant-currency basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Constant-Currency Adjusted Net Income and Constant-Currency and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share:

The table below sets forth the calculation of Adjusted net income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share on a constant-currency basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Discontinued Operations - Dockers®

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation price-eps-surprise | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Quote

The consensus estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.49 per share, which has been revised marginally downward over the past seven days. This indicates a rise of 15.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.

The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $4.73 billion, implying 4.5% growth.

Factors to Impact BNY Mellon’s Q1 Results

Fee Revenues: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total investment services fees (comprising more than 50% of the company’s total revenues) is pegged at $2.39 billion, suggesting a rise of 4.7% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the metric is $2.37 billion.

The consensus mark for financing-related fees stands at $54.7 million, which suggests a 4.1% year-over-year decline. Our estimate for financing-related fees is $54.3 million.

The consensus estimate for distribution and servicing fees is pegged at $39 million, implying a 7.1% decline. Our estimate for the same is $41.6 million.

In the first quarter, foreign exchange (FX) trading activity was driven by heightened market volatility and increased hedging demand amid global economic uncertainties. Further, higher-for-longer interest rates and concerns regarding a potential trade war, given Donald Trump’s tariff policies, weakened the dollar. Thus, increased FX trading volumes are likely to have had a positive impact on BNY Mellon’s FX revenues, partially offset by a weak dollar performance. The consensus estimate for foreign exchange revenues stands at $181.8 million, suggesting a jump of 19.6%. Our estimate for the same is $176.5 million.

The consensus estimate for total fees and other revenues is $3.44 billion, suggesting a rise of 4.1%. We project the metric to be $3.60 billion.

NII: The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged at 4.25%-4.5% during the first quarter of 2025 amid sticky inflation concerns. This is likely to have positively impacted BK’s NII during the first quarter, given relatively higher yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding costs.

Further, the yield curve steepened during the quarter due to economic uncertainties, which is likely to have offered further support for reinvestment yields.

However, a cautious stance regarding future rate cuts by the Fed and a tough operating backdrop is likely to have subdued the overall lending scenario to some extent. Per the latest Fed data, overall loan demand improved in the first two months of the quarter.

The consensus mark for NII is pegged at $1.12 billion, indicating an 8.1% year-over-year rise. We expect NII to be $1.08 billion.

Expenses: Because of higher restructuring charges and buyouts, BNY Mellon’s expenses have been elevated over the past few years. In the first quarter, overall costs are expected to increase, driven by inflationary pressure, technology upgrades and a multi-year transformation plan.

Our estimate for non-interest expenses is $3.38 billion, suggesting a 6.3% year-over-year rise.

While President Donald Trump's tariffs will not have much direct impact on eateries, another pullback in consumer spending would hurt restaurants.

Fast-food chains have historically fared the best during economic downturns.

Restaurant stocks fell in morning trading Monday, fueled by investors' fears that a recession is coming.

U.S. stocks have tumbled for three consecutive days after President Donald Trump shocked the markets with high tariffs on goods imported from key trading partners. While analysts do not expect the tariffs to hit most restaurant companies directly, the inflation that is expected to follow would put pressure on consumers' wallets and could lead to an economic downturn.

""We view the direct cost impact of tariffs on restaurants as manageable, with a focus on select commodity costs, but see the bigger risk as incremental pressure on consumer spending and industry demand,"" UBS analyst Dennis Geiger wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

Investor concerns hit restaurant stocks across all sectors.

Shares of Starbucks fell more than 2%, following a downgrade to neutral from Baird, citing near-term economic headwinds. The coffee chain, which is already attempting to turn around its U.S. business, has seen its stock sink nearly 20% since Trump unveiled the new tariffs.

""Explanations for the drawdown we heard included higher coffee costs from tariffs, anti-American sentiment, and recession risk,"" Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note on Saturday.

Money Report

Most of the world's coffee is grown in an equatorial region that spans Latin America, the Asia-Pacific region and Africa known as the Coffee Belt. Last week, Trump slapped higher tariffs on key coffee exporters like Vietnam, Brazil and Switzerland, where beans are roasted. Like bananas and vanilla, coffee production cannot be easily shifted to the U.S. because of high domestic demand and climate limitations.

Trade tensions also put Starbucks' international sales at risk. Consumers in China, the company's second-largest market, have boycotted Western brands previously for political reasons.

Casual dining chains also took a tumble. Shares of Dine Brands, which owns Applebee's and IHOP, sank nearly 3%, while rivals Darden Restaurants and Texas Roadhouse dropped less than 1% and 2%, respectively.

Fast-casual stocks, a recent favorite of investors, also slipped. Chipotle shares slid nearly 2%, Sweetgreen's stock fell 1% and shares of Wingstop sank less than 1%.

Fast-food stocks were not spared from Monday's declines. Shares of McDonald's, Restaurant Brands International and Yum Brands all dipped in morning trading.

Historically, fast-food chains have fared the best during recessions as diners seeking cheap meals trade down from full-service or fast-casual eateries to McDonald's or Taco Bell. But last year's pullback in consumer spending saw fast-food eateries hit hard. Low-income consumers visited less frequently and pared back their orders, while consumers with higher incomes stuck to their usual dining habits, leading to same-store sales declines for quick-service restaurants.",https://media.nbcdfw.com/2025/04/108106608-17404258302025-02-24t185956z_1297819252_rc261dagdmju_rtrmadp_0_starbucks-layoffs.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-04-07 17:08:50.964434

Dive Brief:

Visits to coffee chains of all sizes are up by 29% over the past five years, according to Placer.ai data. Small and medium-sized coffee brands have seen a disproportionate benefit, however, while industry titans like Starbucks and Dunkin’ lagged.

Small chain’s visit share rose from 3.2% in 2019 to 4.4% in 2024, while medium-sized brands, like BIGGBY Coffee and Dutch Bros, saw visit share grow from 10.8% to 17.6% in the same time.

Starbucks and Dunkin’s combined share of coffee visits remains vast — 77.9% according to Placer.ai — and visits have increased in absolute terms. But the erosion of visit share could signal vulnerability for coffee category leaders.

Dive Insight:

Consumer behavior at stores, rather than simple visit data, also sheds light on shifts in coffee’s competitive landscape.

Visits lasting longer than 10 minutes increased 13.4% at small coffee chains from 2023 to 2024, and fell at Dunkin and Starbucks by 8.9%, according to Placer.ai’s data. Short visits and long visits increased at medium-sized brands.

“Smaller coffee shops are increasingly filling the niche of a relaxed, destination-oriented experience,” Bracha Arnold, a content writer for Placer.ai, wrote in a post analyzing the data.

This consumer shift toward smaller and medium-sized chains as coffee-oriented “third places” could help explain why Starbucks, after years of emphasis on speed and throughput, is returning its focus to in-store experience under CEO Brian Niccol. That move may be necessary to preserve the brand’s position in the market from competition from smaller, more local-feeling coffee shops.

“These shifts highlight the different needs that coffee shops can fill within a community, with some offering speed and convenience, while others can meet the desire for a relaxed and personalized coffee experience,” Arnold wrote in the report.

Dive Brief:

Visits to coffee chains of all sizes are up by 29% over the past five years, according to Placer.ai data. Small and medium-sized coffee brands have seen a disproportionate benefit, however, while industry titans like Starbucks and Dunkin’ lagged.

Small chain’s visit share rose from 3.2% in 2019 to 4.4% in 2024, while medium-sized brands, like BIGGBY Coffee and Dutch Bros, saw visit share grow from 10.8% to 17.6% in the same time.

Starbucks and Dunkin’s combined share of coffee visits remains vast — 77.9% according to Placer.ai — and visits have increased in absolute terms. But the erosion of visit share could signal vulnerability for coffee category leaders.

Dive Insight:

Consumer behavior at stores, rather than simple visit data, also sheds light on shifts in coffee’s competitive landscape.

Visits lasting longer than 10 minutes increased 13.4% at small coffee chains from 2023 to 2024, and fell at Dunkin and Starbucks by 8.9%, according to Placer.ai’s data. Short visits and long visits increased at medium-sized brands.

“Smaller coffee shops are increasingly filling the niche of a relaxed, destination-oriented experience,” Bracha Arnold, a content writer for Placer.ai, wrote in a post analyzing the data.

This consumer shift toward smaller and medium-sized chains as coffee-oriented “third places” could help explain why Starbucks, after years of emphasis on speed and throughput, is returning its focus to in-store experience under CEO Brian Niccol. That move may be necessary to preserve the brand’s position in the market from competition from smaller, more local-feeling coffee shops.

“These shifts highlight the different needs that coffee shops can fill within a community, with some offering speed and convenience, while others can meet the desire for a relaxed and personalized coffee experience,” Arnold wrote in the report.

Arnold noted that coffee traffic growth slowed in late 2024, which could signal a plateau in consumer demand.

Shares of Dutch Bros ., a fast-growing rival of Starbucks, rose more than 3% in morning trading after tumbling nearly 10% on Friday.","Restaurant stocks fell in morning trading Monday, fueled by investors' fears that a recession is coming.

U.S. stocks have tumbled for three consecutive days after President Donald Trump shocked the markets with high tariffs on goods imported from key trading partners. While analysts do not expect the tariffs to hit most restaurant companies directly, the inflation that is expected to follow would put pressure on consumers' wallets and could lead to an economic downturn.

""We view the direct cost impact of tariffs on restaurants as manageable, with a focus on select commodity costs, but see the bigger risk as incremental pressure on consumer spending and industry demand,"" UBS analyst Dennis Geiger wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

Investor concerns hit restaurant stocks across all sectors.

Shares of Starbucks fell more than 3%, following a downgrade to neutral from Baird, citing near-term economic headwinds. The coffee chain, which is already attempting to turn around its U.S. business, has seen its stock sink nearly 20% since Trump unveiled the new tariffs.

""Explanations for the drawdown we heard included higher coffee costs from tariffs, anti-American sentiment, and recession risk,"" Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note on Saturday.

Most of the world's coffee is grown in an equatorial region that spans Latin America, the Asia-Pacific region and Africa known as the Coffee Belt. Last week, Trump slapped higher tariffs on key coffee exporters like Vietnam, Brazil and Switzerland, where beans are roasted. Like bananas and vanilla, coffee production cannot be easily shifted to the U.S. because of high domestic demand and climate limitations.

Trade tensions also put Starbucks' international sales at risk. Consumers in China, the company's second-largest market, have boycotted Western brands previously for political reasons.

Casual dining chains also took a tumble. Shares of Dine Brands , which owns Applebee's and IHOP, sank nearly 3%, while rivals Darden Restaurants and Texas Roadhouse dropped more than 2% and 3%, respectively.

Fast-casual stocks, a recent favorite of investors, also slipped. Chipotle shares slid nearly 2%, Sweetgreen's stock fell close to 1% and shares of Wingstop sank 3%.

Fast-food stocks were not spared from Monday's declines. Shares of McDonald's , Restaurant Brands International and Yum Brands all dipped in morning trading.

Historically, fast-food chains have fared the best during recessions as diners seeking cheap meals trade down from full-service or fast-casual eateries to McDonald's or Taco Bell. But last year's pullback in consumer spending saw fast-food eateries hit hard. Low-income consumers visited less frequently and pared back their orders, while consumers with higher incomes stuck to their usual dining habits, leading to same-store sales declines for quick-service restaurants.

Few restaurant stocks were in the green. Shares of Dutch Bros ., a fast-growing rival of Starbucks, rose more than 3% in morning trading after tumbling nearly 10% on Friday. Cava gained more than 3%, while Domino's Pizza rose slightly.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108106608-17404258302025-02-24t185956z_1297819252_rc261dagdmju_rtrmadp_0_starbucks-layoffs.jpeg?v=1740425859&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-04-07 13:24:00.314884

One of the many complaints and reasons for this decline is consumers' dislike of Starbucks' prices, which tend to be higher than those of most coffee shops and have risen over the years due to inflation and extra charges for customizations.

Since taking over as Starbucks' CEO, Brian Niccol has emphasized the need to bring the company back to its roots by focusing on its core products, personalizing the coffee shop experience like it once did, and keeping prices from increasing.

""I made a commitment that we’d get back to Starbucks, focusing on what has always set Starbucks apart – a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather and we serve the finest coffee handcrafted by our skilled baristas,"" said Niccol in an earnings call.

Starbucks' turnaround plan is threatened by tariffs

To return the business to growth, Starbucks (SBUX) developed a turnaround strategy that aims to improve customers' overall experience by redesigning stores, optimizing efficiency, prioritizing coffee quality, simplifying its menu, and keeping prices from elevating in 2025.

Starbucks has tried to freeze prices by eliminating extra charges for milk alternatives, reducing customization options, discontinuing menu items, and providing free refills for those who consume in stores.

However, President Donald Trump's new tariffs could make Starbucks' goal of price-freezing without risking further profit losses even more challenging.

President Trump announced in February that he would implement a 25% additional tariff on all goods imported into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, a 10% tariff on China, and a 10% levy.

However, on Apr. 2, President Trump declared that foreign trade and economic practices created a national emergency. He implemented new tariffs on products imported into the U.S. from many countries, including an additional 10% baseline tariff.

President Trump claims that these newly imposed tariffs aim to combat this concern by encouraging the production and purchasing of American-based products, which will increase competitive edge, protect sovereignty, and strengthen national and economic security.

Starbucks' main product faces challenges amid tariff implementations

Although Starbucks is an American company, most of its coffee is imported from over 30 different countries worldwide. Since more than 70 countries are coffee producers, only around 1% of all coffee consumed in the U.S. is made within the country.

Starbucks sources coffee from the three main regions that produce it: Latin America, Africa, and Asia/Pacific. Asia is one of the regions with the highest tariffs, and Vietnam is one of Starbucks' top suppliers, now facing a 46% tariff on goods imported into the U.S.

Many companies from all sectors are concerned about the negative financial repercussions the implementation of these tariffs could have on their businesses since some are highly dependent on imported goods from these select countries, including Starbucks, whose coffee beans make up around 10% to 15% of its production and distribution costs.

We help 185 million Americans live their healthiest lives possible. It is a privilege to lead CVS Health®, and more importantly, to work with our more than 300,000 colleagues to deliver simply better health.

Our job has never been more important: improve the well-being of individuals across the country by making health care more accessible, simple and aﬀordable. Our unmatched combination of businesses and extensive consumer reach uniquely position CVS Health to help deﬁne the future of health care.

I am honored to have been appointed president and chief executive oﬃcer in October 2024. In many roles throughout my 39 years in our industry, I've had none more meaningful than the one I have now, supporting our colleagues as they work to improve the health of millions of people.

The health care industry is challenging and complex, but our commitment to care never wavers. From ensuring a child had access to their anti-seizure medication during a hurricane, to supporting a member through a complex transplant surgery so they could attend their son's wedding… we are there for the moments that matter most. Each of our businesses plays a critical role in achieving our mission and supporting the health of Americans. Every day, we are working hard to become America's leading and most trusted health care company.

In 2024, we generated $372.8 billion in revenue and delivered GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.66 with adjusted earnings per share of $5.42.* Despite the challenges last year, particularly in our Aetna® business, we advanced our strategy and achieved signiﬁcant milestones.

Health Care Beneﬁts

We took decisive actions to address the long-term sustainability of our Aetna business, including product design updates that support a strong, multi-year recovery, while oﬀering members the beneﬁts that matter most. We appointed new leadership at Aetna, including a new president, chief operating oﬃcer and chief ﬁnancial oﬃcer, and strengthened business processes to drive improved ﬁnancial performance, while increasing transparency and accountability.

Our Medicare Advantage Stars capabilities represent a strength of the Aetna business. In 2024, Aetna achieved exceptional Star Ratings with 88 percent of our Medicare Advantage members in plans rated at least 4 Stars, and more than two-thirds of members in plans rated at least 4.5 Stars. In addition, our commitment to outstanding service resulted in our highest-ever member experience score since the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services launched the Quality Bonus Stars Program in 2012.

Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness

CVS Pharmacy® is America's leading pharmacy. Our focus on consumer engagement, colleague experience and operational excellence enabled us to achieve a record retail pharmacy script share in 2024. We also continue to lead the shift to a more sustainable and transparent pharmacy market with the implementation of CVS CostVantage™.

We converted all commercial prescriptions dispensed through CVS Pharmacy to this innovative economic model as of January 1, 2025. CVS CostVantage brings clarity and simplicity to retail pharmacy - the most durable and frequent interaction in the health care journey - and ensures our pharmacies are appropriately compensated for the valuable clinical services they provide.

Health Services

Our Health Services segment consists of three key businesses: CVS Caremark®, Cordavis™ and Health Care Delivery. CVS Caremark drives aﬀordability of prescription drugs. Pharmacy Beneﬁt Managers (PBMs) are the only part of the drug supply chain whose role is to lower drug costs.

In fact, CVS Caremark members have an average out-of-pocket cost of less than $8 for a 30-day prescription. Economists have estimated that PBMs generate net value of over $100 billion per year for the U.S. health care system. Clients who fully transition to our new CVS Caremark TrueCost™ model ensure members see lower costs at the pharmacy counter, including the full pass-through of the rebates we generate from our negotiations with drug manufacturers. In 2025, we saw additional momentum as clients representing more than 75 percent of CVS Caremark commercial lives chose to implement two or more elements of the CVS Caremark TrueCost model.

We continue to transform the biosimilar market and improve access and aﬀordability of costly specialty medications. By establishing co-manufacturing capacity through Cordavis and collaborating with CVS Caremark and CVS Specialty® pharmacy, we successfully converted over 90 percent of eligible HUMIRA® patients to a low-cost biosimilar, delivering almost $1 billion of net savings for our clients. These savings demonstrate the power and potential of our integrated assets.

Our Health Care Delivery businesses achieved another year of solid growth in 2024, supported by integration points across CVS Health®. Signify Health® had a record year of In-Home Health Evaluations, including nearly doubling the number of Aetna® members served.

We continue to accelerate patient growth at Oak Street Health®, increasing the number of individuals enrolled in this best-in-class care model, including the number of Aetna members. We are also bringing together existing Oak Street Health and Signify Health care delivery capabilities for use more broadly across CVS Health to improve quality of care and better manage costs.

Our impact and value

Beyond our business, we take seriously our responsibility to make a positive impact on the people and communities we serve. Our Healthy 2030 approach outlines how we are paving the way for sustainability and working toward best practices in corporate responsibility.

I believe in our mission and strategy because I believe

in my colleagues. We take on the biggest challenges

in health care because we know we can solve them

in ways no one else can. We do our best work when people need us the most, and we show up every day to create a better health care experience.

I want to say thank you to our stockholders for your continued conﬁdence in CVS Health, and I thank my colleagues for giving you every reason to believe in our future.

PART I

Item 1. Business.

Overview

CVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, ""CVS Health,"" the ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""our"" or ""us""), is a leading health solutions company building a world of health around every consumer it serves and connecting care so that it works for people wherever they are. As of December 31, 2024, we had more than 9,000 retail locations, more than 1,000 walk-in and primary care medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 90 million plan members and expanding specialty pharmacy solutions, and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than 800,000 patients per year. We serve an estimated more than 36 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan (""PDP""). We are creating new sources of value through our integrated model allowing us to expand into personalized, technology driven care delivery and health services, increasing access to quality care, delivering better health outcomes and lowering overall health care costs.

The Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Health Services, Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness and Corporate/Other.

Business Strategy

We are building a world of health around every consumer we serve, seeking to make it easier and more affordable to live a healthier life. This means delivering solutions that are more personalized, simpler to use and increasingly digital so consumers can receive care when, where and how they desire. We address holistic health _ physical, emotional, social and economic _ and we are creating new sources of value through our integrated care model which allows us to expand into personalized, technology driven care delivery and health services, increasing access to quality care, delivering better health outcomes and lowering overall health care costs. We believe our consumer-centric strategy will drive sustainable long-term growth and deliver value for all stakeholders.

Health Care Benefits Segment

The Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers, serving an estimated more than 36 million people as of December 31, 2024. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs and Medicaid health care management services. The Health Care Benefits segment's primary customers, its members, primarily access the segment's products and services through employer groups, government-sponsored plans or individually. The Health Care Benefits segment also serves customers who purchase products and services that are ancillary to its health insurance products.

Health Care Benefits Products and Services

The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as ""Insured"" and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk of medical and dental care costs) as ""ASC."" Health Care Benefits segment products and services consist of the following:

• Commercial Medical: The Health Care Benefits segment offers point-of-service (""POS""), preferred provider organization (""PPO""), health maintenance organization (""HMO"") and indemnity benefit (""Indemnity"") plans. Commercial medical products also include health savings accounts (""HSAs"") and consumer-directed health plans that combine traditional POS or PPO and/or dental coverage, subject to a deductible, with an accumulating benefit account (which may be funded by the plan sponsor and/or the member in the case of HSAs). Principal products and services are targeted specifically to large multi-site national, mid-sized and small employers, individual insureds and expatriates. The Company offers medical stop loss insurance coverage for certain employers who elect to self-insure their health benefits. Under medical stop loss insurance products, the Company assumes risk for costs associated with large individual claims and/or aggregate loss experience within an employer's plan above a pre-set annual threshold. The segment also has a portfolio of additional health products and services that complement its medical products such as dental plans, behavioral health and employee",https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,N,,2025-04-07 13:23:44.084367

Now, all eyes are on key inflation data, Federal Reserve signals and Big Bank earnings as traders search for footing in a week that could redefine the market’s path forward.

Inflation and Tariffs in Focus

With global markets under intense scrutiny, investors are turning their attention to key economic reports this week, starting with Thursday’s release of the March Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Friday’s Producer Price Index (PPI), both critical gauges of inflation.

Wells Fargo economists predict that inflation will remain stable in March, continuing the trend of easing pressures observed in recent months. February’s CPI, in particular, surprised many with a sharper-than-expected drop, fueling optimism about moderating price increases.

As these reports loom, attention will also shift to the Federal Reserve’s March meeting minutes, set to be released on Wednesday.

Market participants will look for any hints regarding the central bank’s next moves on interest rates. Additionally, remarks from Fed officials in the coming days are expected to shed further light on the broader economic outlook.

Alongside inflation data, consumer sentiment and credit reports will offer a fuller picture of economic health. On Tuesday, the NFIB small business optimism index will provide insight into the confidence of one of the most vital segments of the U.S. economy.

Big Banks Kick Off Earning Season

The first-quarter earnings season begins in earnest this week, with reports from major financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BlackRock and Bank of New York Mellon, scheduled for Friday.

JPMorgan Chase, the world’s largest bank by market capitalization, will set the tone for the sector.

Investors will be looking for updates on the bank’s strong performance from the previous quarter, which saw a surprising surge in profits driven by growth in investment banking revenue and net interest income.

On the same day, BlackRock will also report its earnings following a record-breaking quarter for assets under management.

Investors are particularly keen on updates on the firm’s ambitious $30 billion AI infrastructure initiative, which involves major partners like Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Elon Musk’s xAI.

Other major earnings this week include Delta Air Lines on Wednesday, CarMax on Thursday and Levi Strauss and Cal-Maine Foods later in the week.

As investors closely monitor these reports, many will be looking for insights into how the broader economy—including the ongoing impacts of tariffs and inflation—is affecting various sectors.

Eyes on Gold and VIX

Gold (XAU/USD) saw modest buying near $2,972 early Monday, halting its pullback from last week’s record high.

Safe-haven demand was driven by global market turmoil following President Trump’s sweeping tariffs and continued buying by China’s central bank, which has now purchased gold for five consecutive months.

Falling Treasury yields—amid expectations the Fed may resume rate cuts—supported gold, while a weaker USD added to the metal’s appeal. However, long-position liquidation to cover broader market losses has capped upside momentum.

At the same time, the Volatility Index (VIX) surged by 50%, reaching 50 and breaching key resistance levels, signaling heightened market stress. The 10-year Treasury yield also fell sharply, dropping below 4.16% and nearing significant support at 3.90%.

The widening divergence between the VIX and Treasury yields highlights deepening concerns about market instability.

Both Gold and VIX will be key indicators to watch closely this week as they could signal further market movements.",https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/key-economic-indicators-markets-rattled-tariffs-us-inflation-big-bank-earnings_cropped.webp,N,,2025-04-07 12:15:30.477542

Chief Commercial Officer Matt Klein is also leaving and will be succeeded by insider Rana Ghosh.

The departures come as the carrier works to move away from its no-frills image and rebrand itself as a premium airline.

An interim office of the CEO, consisting of Chief Financial Officer Fred Cromer, Chief Operating Officer John Bendoraitis and General Counsel Thomas Canfield, will lead the company until a new chief is named.

Christie joined Spirit in 2012 as its finance chief and took the helm in 2019.

He guided the airline through the pandemic disruptions and a challenging period for low-cost carriers grappling with rising costs and a readiness among travelers to pay extra for a more comfortable journey as they pursued experiences.

The Florida-based carrier filed for bankruptcy protection last November, following years of losses and heavy debt, as well as failed merger attempts.

Spirit had been in merger talks with Frontier Group since at least 2022, but ended them in favor of a more attractive offer from rival JetBlue Airways.

Its merger with JetBlue was ultimately scrapped after a U.S. judge blocked it on anti-competition concerns.

Spirit, which has estimated that shift to premium would generate 13% more revenue per passenger, also plans to revamp its loyalty program and pursue alliances with other carriers.

Market Update

The Fed’s interest rate hikes throughout 2022 and 2023 have successfully cooled post-pandemic inflation, bringing it closer to the 2% target. Inflationary pressures have eased without tipping the economy into a recession, suggesting a soft landing. This stability, paired with recent rate cuts (0.5% in September 2024 and 0.25% in November 2024), fueled a strong year for the stock market in 2024. The markets surged further after Donald Trump’s presidential victory in November, with major indices reaching record highs in the days following the election. Still, questions remain about the direction of economic policy, as potential tariffs and corporate tax changes add uncertainty for 2025.

The news was revealed in the firm’s latest annual report for the year ended 30 March 2024, filed with the UK’s Companies House.

While four stores will be closing permanently–including those in Newcastle, Milton Keyes, Manchester’s New Cathedral Street, and the concession in Harvey Nichols London–Michael Kor’s Regent Street store in London will be shuttering temporarily while “waiting for the relocation to a new near-by premises”.

In light of the plans, the company said that sales for FY25 are expected to decrease by 20 percent for both retail and e-commerce compared to 2024. Prices are also expected to drop in the “foreseeable future”, the report noted however, “in order to better meet consumer demand and counter competitors’ strategies on the market”.

JD Sports is facing a 6% share dip, sparking concerns over its heavy reliance on Nike and vulnerability to US tariffs.

What does this mean?

JD Sports Fashion is in a slump, with shares dropping over 18% in the past month. The unveiling of new tariffs by US President Donald Trump anticipated a hit, dragging the FTSE 100 down by 4%. For JD, the US market is crucial, representing nearly 40% of global sales, especially after acquiring the Hibbett chain. However, over-reliance on Nike – making up 45% of sales – ties JD’s fate closely to the sportswear giant. Soaring tariffs on goods sourced from China (54%) and Vietnam (46%) add to the pressure. These tariffs impact both JD’s branded items and those of suppliers like Adidas and On. Panmure Liberum analysts predict this setback might be shared among brands and retailers, possibly reducing sector volumes.

Why should I care?

For markets: Tariff tensions hurt investor confidence.

Investor concerns are valid as tariffs disrupt and weigh down companies with strong US ties like JD Sports. With the US market vital to its strategy and a heavy dependency on Nike, unforeseen tariff developments can sharply influence market sentiments.

The bigger picture: Supply chain strains reshape fashion's future.

More broadly, trade tensions and significant tariffs hint at a shift for global supply strategies across industries.

BROWN, Getty Images",,,,,https://www.thestreet.com/retail/formerly-bankrupt-retail-healthcare-chain-may-go-bankrupt-again,"One retail industry disrupted by big-box retail and new competition is retail pharmacy.
Particularly hard hit has been Rite Aid.
Walgreens wound up buying 1,932 Rite Aid stores and three distribution centers for $4.38 billion in 2018.
As a result, Rite Aid officially filed for Chapter 11 restructuring on October 15, 2023.
Reportedly, Rite Aid is exploring its options with law firm Paul Weiss.","It's been a very tough time to be in the retail business. Thousands of stores nationwide been closed over the past two decades because of e-commerce adoption, and the situation has accelerated since Covid forced more consumers inside and online.

Once formidable major retailers like Sears have been shuttered, and even retail store chains considered essential like pharmacy's have been stung by shifting consumer trends as competition has intensified.

It has gotten even harder to eke out a living as a retailer since inflation skyrocketed in 2022, crimping budgets. Inflation has eased a bit since then, but prices are still climbing and cash-strapped consumers have largely rotated away from discretionary purchases that retailers rely on.

In February, the Consumer Price Index showed inflation had increased to 2.8% from 2.4% last September, raising concern that prices could reignite, something even more in focus following newly instituted tariffs on imports that add more price pressures.

Worse, fears of economic recession are mounting this year as unemployment climbs.

Altogether, the backdrop has created an environment where even the strongest retailers are struggling. Weaker retailers? Well, they're on the ropes.

A retail reckoning forces companies into bankruptcy

Chapter 11 bankruptcy allows retailers to pare expenses and debt, giving them wiggle room necessary for a shot at survival. However, bankruptcy remains a last resort for companies.

Bankruptcy protection means damaged relationships with suppliers, bankers, workers, and customers. As a result, suppliers may cut off retailers, banks may not lend money necessary to operate, and workers and customers may move on to greener pastures.

Nevertheless, sometimes bankruptcy is the only option. Increasingly, that's been true for many companies.

It may be hard to believe today, but Sears ran 700 stores when it filed for bankruptcy in 2018. Bed Bath & Beyond had 1,500 stores in 2018, but fewer than 300 in 2023 when it went bankrupt, and none are open anymore. Christmas Tree Shops operated more than 80 stores before all were closed when it went bankrupt.

The economy has certainly been a driving force behind the retail reckoning, but fierce competition hasn't helped.

Walmart, Target, and Costco Wholesale have all seen significant revenue growth over the past decade as they successfully leverage their size to offer consumers lower prices, and expand into new markets.

Walmart and Costco's revenue have risen to $681 billion and $254 billion in 2024 from $408 billion and $78 billion in 2010, respectively.

One retail industry disrupted by big-box retail and new competition is retail pharmacy. Particularly hard hit has been Rite Aid.

In addition to fending off larger department stores, the national chain counted on by millions for essentials from toothpaste to prescriptions has also lost market share due to upstarts like Mark Cuban's CostPlus Drug Company, a low cost mail order pharmacy, and Hims, a direct-to-consumer, subscription-based telehealth platform.

Rite Aid enters, exits bankruptcy but woes remain

Rite Aid spent a lot of money acquiring rival pharmacies, including Brooks, in a bid to keep pace with Walgreens and CVS Health. The spending accelerated its retail footprint, but also saddled it with a mountain of debt that needed to be refinanced at higher rates when it came due.

The weight of its debt was already taking a toll before Covid struck. It attempted to sell itself to Walgreens in 2015, but the deal was revised after the U.S. government objected for antitrust concerns. Walgreens wound up buying 1,932 Rite Aid stores and three distribution centers for $4.38 billion in 2018. A deal to sell itself to Albertsons was also scuttled in 2018.

Rite Aid continued to try to find a buyer but by 2022, when the Fed hiked interest rates, making debt refinancing more costly, it was in dire straights.

The final blow came in March 2023. The Department of Justice filed a civil suit against Rite Aid alleging pharmacists “repeatedly filled prescriptions for controlled substances with obvious red flags"" and that Rite Aid ""intentionally deleted internal notes about suspicious prescribers.”

Similar suits had previously been settled by Walgreens and CVS Health for $5.7 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, figures that Rite Aid couldn't match.

As a result, Rite Aid officially filed for Chapter 11 restructuring on October 15, 2023. While in bankruptcy, it cut deals with lenders, closed over 500 stores, roughly a quarter of its locations, and settled the Justice Department's suit for $7.5 million and an unsubordinated, general unsecured claim of $401.8 million.

The company exited bankruptcy in September 2024, saying at the time it ""has successfully completed its financial restructuring and emerged from Chapter 11, marking a new beginning as a stronger company with a rightsized store footprint, more efficient operating model, significantly less debt, and additional financial resources.”

Unfortunately, the restructuring may not have been enough to guarantee Rite Aid's success, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

The WSJ said on April 4 that Rite Aid's management is seeking buyers again and contemplating another bankruptcy filing. Reportedly, Rite Aid is exploring its options with law firm Paul Weiss.

There's no telling what might happen to Rite Aid's remaining 1,300 stores if it sells itself or enters bankruptcy protection again. It's certainly possible more stores will close, leaving additional customers in the lurch, searching for a new pharmacy.

We’re excited to open more stores and bring McDonald’s closer to more Filipinos,” Yang said.

(GADC), or McDonald’s Philippines, plans to invest at least ₱3 billion to ₱5 billion this year to open more than 65 stores, with the aim of reaching 1,000 stores in two years.

This comes as GADC Founder and Chairman George T. Yang said they will embark on an accelerated growth path for the quick-service restaurant (QSR) giant after McDonald’s Corp. of the United States (US) granted Yang and his son, GADC President and CEO Kenneth S. Yang, a fresh 20-year franchise for the Philippines.

“This 2025, We will be opening our 800th store,” said the younger Yang. McDonald’s opened 65 stores last year and ended 2024 with a network of 792 stores nationwide.

In a media interview, GADC’s CEO said, “We will continue to build new restaurants all over the Philippines. We grow through our company-owned stores as well as through our franchise restaurants.”

“For this year, most likely, we should grow about the same as what we did last year, which is 65 stores. Hopefully we will surpass it,” said Yang.

Since 65 new stores in a year was an all-time high for the company, he said, “This 2025, we aim to break our record new store openings.”

While expansion will be nationwide, Yang said most of the new stores will be outside the National Capital Region (NCR)—in cities in southern and northern Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.

“We see our growth coming from areas outside of NCR that have rapidly been developing. We’re excited to open more stores and bring McDonald’s closer to more Filipinos,” Yang said.

He noted that, “The country is growing and there is progress in these areas so that is where we will be going.”

He said that they will likely maintain the current ratio of 55 percent company-owned stores and 45 percent franchise outlets.

Yang said they spent around ₱3 billion to ₱5 billion for the renovation of older restaurants and construction of new ones, and capital expenditures (capex) this year should at least be equal or higher.

In 2005, McDonald’s Philippines became a 100-percent Filipino-owned company with George and Kenneth Yang as its majority owners and tycoon Andrew Tan’s Alliance Global Group Inc. as its investment partner.

This strategic move paved the way for the company to look towards a digitally led future, underpinned by growing demand for seamless omni-channel customer experience.

The company extended its reach by growing its delivery business through digital initiatives. It was the first QSR to have an online delivery channel in 2009 and the first to launch a delivery app in 2014.

That’s a far cry from the 1,000-store target by 2028, which was announced in early 2023, which now looks more like a stretch goal than a clear path.

Too Rich for the Middle Class?

The official story points to India’s economic slowdown. There is ongoing inflation, wages are flat, and consumers – especially the urban middle class – are feeling the squeeze. Spending has cooled off after a post-pandemic boom fueled by easy credit and pent-up demand. People are tightening their belts, and fancy lattes are often the first to go.

But there’s a deeper story brewing. Starbucks isn’t just bumping into macroeconomic headwinds; it’s facing a shift in how Indian consumers think about value, brand, and everyday indulgence.

Starbucks is still seen as an upscale brand in big cities – a place to show off, not chill out. In smaller cities, it’s often seen as out of reach. A masala chai at ₹ $320 ($3.70) is a tough sell when the same drink costs a tenth of that at a local stall. Even with localized menu items and smaller cup sizes, Starbucks hasn’t quite cracked the code of cultural fit and pricing perception.

Age-appropriate and Cheaper Choices

Meanwhile, homegrown brands like Blue Tokai and Third Wave are quietly winning the loyalty of India’s younger, more discerning coffee drinkers. They offer craft brews, Instagram-ready interiors, and a price that doesn’t sting. Starbucks’ joint venture with Tata says it’s still committed to hitting the 1,000-store goal maybe a year later. But the real challenge isn’t timing.

India’s middle class is evolving, not just growing. Brand alone isn’t enough as consumers want quality, authenticity, and value all at once.

Nevertheless, Starbucks isn’t pulling out. But to grow in India, it may need to rethink more than its store count. It might need to rethink its role entirely.

That being said, you can find a dozen eggs for under $5 in most grocery stores. If you join a warehouse club like Costco or Sam’s Club, you might even be able to get a better deal.

It’s easy to understand why people do not like seeing the price of everyday staples go up. In reality, however, most families probably eat no more than a couple of dozen eggs a week.

If they eat the full two dozen, let’s say that their expenses increase by basically five dollars per week. That’s $260 a year.

Admittedly, eggs are not the only staple that has increased in price, which is causing many Americans to feel the pinch of inflation and higher prices.

Spending more at the grocery store each week is death by 1,000 paper cuts, which is a painful way to die.

But if you suffer one giant cut, the reality is you’re just as dead. Americans have some options to buy food produced in this country that won’t be impacted by tariffs.

Certain staples like coffee, well, almost certainly increase, but even there, there are options, at least if all you want is a caffeine fix. When it comes to electronics, there are no options.

You can’t get an iPhone, a laptop, a television, or most appliances that come from US manufacturers. And admittedly, unlike eggs, you can put off upgrading your phone or buying a new television.

At some point, however, whether it’s your washing machine, your refrigerator, your smart phone, or whatever type of computer you might use, something will break. When that happens, you are going to face a reality that’s going to be very painful.

That’s something Best Buy’s CEO is warning consumers and investors about.

Best Buy buys from China and Mexico

Best Buy (BBY) CEO Corie Sue Barry did not pull any punches when it came to discussing tariffs during the electronics retailer's fourth-quarter earnings call.

""Against this backdrop, I need to pause a moment to address the topic of tariffs. International trade is critically important to our business and industry. The consumer electronics supply chain is highly global, technical, and complex. China and Mexico remain the No. 1 and No. 2 sources for products we sell, respectively,"" she shared.

The CEO also made it clear that tariffs would be passed on to the retailer, which would then have to pass them onto consumers.

""While Best Buy only directly imports 2% to 3% of our overall assortment, we expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely,"" she shared.

Barry admitted that she does not have all the answers.

""This is because it is a highly dynamic situation, with uncertainty about the duration, timing, amount, and countries involved, in addition to the potential action of others in the industry, as well as the potential reaction of American consumers,"" she said.

Best Buy, American consumers face higher prices

Best Buy does have flexibility on some products and Barry wanted to make it clear that it will be actively looking to offset the increased costs as much as possible.

""I want to stress that our deeply tenured and talented teams are experienced at operating in volatile conditions, and this is also a situation where our partnerships with vendors are extremely valuable. We intend to execute the strategic plan we set for this year while navigating the tariff environment,"" she added.

CFO Matthew Bilunas made it clear, or at least as clear as someone speaking in financial terms could, that consumers will pay more.

""We're assuming in this estimation that a material portion of the costs are passed on to us by the vendors and then either, that's either directly broken out or blended in with the higher COGS (cost of goods sold) or through some level of promotional positioning. Of course, you know, we prefer not to raise prices.

The president himself is determined to impose higher prices on his citizens, even though many Americans have now realized the truth of tariffs and that we will all be responsible for paying for them. Even though equities in the tech, automotive, and other sectors have declined, the former reality TV star’s most recent announcement was concerning from a fashion perspective.

Trump’s tariffs are having a much bigger impact than expected on Nike

Trump’s most recent list includes nations that produce clothing, such as Vietnam and Indonesia, which are presumably further down the alphabet than Denmark, the European Union, and Greenland. Besides Nike, huge companies like Adidas and Puma source their supplies from the two nations listed, and Trump’s decision has caused their stock market value to plummet like a driverless Tesla into the Hudson River. Following the announcement of the news, shares of Skechers, Deckers, and Crocs also declined.

On Wednesday, the United States levied reciprocal tariffs of 46% on Vietnamese goods, 49% on Cambodian goods, 34% on Chinese goods, 32% on Indonesian goods, and 36% on Thai goods. Although Nike’s stock is still steady for the time being, analysts believe that the American brand will decline soon because it also depends significantly on imports from the aforementioned countries. Nike itself anticipates a more than 10% decline in revenue in the upcoming quarter, according to CNBC, and their figures are significantly worse than those of analysts.

Finance director Matt Friend anticipates that Nike’s initiatives will have the most impact in the fourth quarter, with revenue and gross margin headwinds projected to moderate. The corporation is also dealing with external challenges such as geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, variable foreign exchange rates, and tax rules, all of which may influence consumer confidence.

Besides Nike, American Eagle, and Wayfair could also be impacted due to Trump’s tariffs

Brands and retailers have shifted some or all of their production out of China and are now using Vietnam to manufacture everything from couches to sneakers. For many years, businesses wishing to stay out of the crossfire of U.S. trade conflicts with Beijing turned to China’s southern neighbor. They are now unable to avoid President Donald Trump as he broadens his trade war globally. As part of a new round of international tariffs announced Wednesday, Trump declared he would impose a 46% levy on Vietnamese products.

Major companies in the clothing, furniture, and toy industries may soon see cost rises as a result, and some of them may boost prices for customers. On April 9, the Vietnam tariffs go into force. Donald Trump announced a new round of international tariffs on Wednesday, including a 46% duty on Vietnamese imports. This may soon result in cost rises for large companies in the toy, furniture, and clothing industries, some of which may raise prices for customers. On April 9, the tariffs on Vietnam go into force.

Moreover, Mexico overtook China as the largest supplier of commodities to the United States in 2023, after China had been the leading exporter for more than 20 years. Government statistics from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative show that, with $438.9 billion in products sold in 2024, China is now the second-largest supplier to the United States. Vietnam has also grown in popularity as a destination for businesses seeking to diversify their manufacturing sources and lower the risks associated with trade disputes with China.",https://pedirayudas.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Nike.jpg,N,,2025-04-06 12:11:47.825213

With thousands of stores across the country, the company has kept enormous popularity over the years. Its success lies in a varied offering of beverages and a service that aims to be quick and efficient.

However, behind every cup they sell, there are small details that often go unnoticed. An example of this is, for instance, the measurement marks that allow baristas to prepare drinks with precision.

This Is the Change That Starbucks Has Already Implemented in the United States

For years, Starbucks cups included black marks on their sides. These lines were not just decorative, as some might think. Their function was very practical: they allowed employees to measure the ingredients of each drink accurately.

Each line on the tall, grande, and venti cups marked a precise amount of liquid. This facilitated the quick and efficient preparation of popular drinks like the iced chai tea latte. Thus, Starbucks baristas didn't need external measuring tools, which optimized the service.

However, recently, Starbucks made an important change: it modified the marks to a more visible design. The new cups feature white and black lines, which improve visibility in both light and dark beverages. Additionally, these cups include raised dots to enhance accessibility for visually impaired individuals.

This change wasn't the only one. Starbucks implemented opaque paper cups in 14 states in the United States, removing the measurement marks. The company also opted for compostable cups and lids made of the same material, reducing its use of plastic.

The transition has caused divided opinions among customers. While some applaud Starbucks's effort to promote a more sustainable change, others lament the loss of the transparent cups. Customers can no longer see their drink—and what's left of it in the cup—as they did before.

Despite the criticism it has received, Starbucks continues to bet firmly on innovation and continuous improvement. The company keeps seeking a balance between functionality and sustainability. So, although some customers may take time to adapt to the new designs, it is likely that over time they will get used to the modifications.

It is evident that the future of Starbucks cups continues to evolve to meet new market demands. The brand continues to stand out for its ability to adapt and stay at the forefront, establishing itself as a leader in innovation within the sector.",https://edatv.news/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-de-fotos-de-starbucks-con-bandera-estados-unidos-al-lado_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-04-06 09:01:53.922466

Too Rich for the Middle Class?
There is ongoing inflation, wages are flat, and consumers – especially the urban middle class – are feeling the squeeze.
India’s middle class is evolving, not just growing.
Nevertheless, Starbucks isn’t pulling out.","Starbucks (SBUX) came to India more than a decade ago with big dreams. Now, those dreams are hitting a patch of reality. According to a report in the Financial Times, the coffee giant has sharply slowed its store expansion in the country, opening just 16 new outlets in the last quarter of 2024 – barely half of what it had aimed for. That’s a far cry from the 1,000-store target by 2028, which was announced in early 2023, which now looks more like a stretch goal than a clear path.

Too Rich for the Middle Class?

The official story points to India’s economic slowdown. There is ongoing inflation, wages are flat, and consumers – especially the urban middle class – are feeling the squeeze. Spending has cooled off after a post-pandemic boom fueled by easy credit and pent-up demand. People are tightening their belts, and fancy lattes are often the first to go.

But there’s a deeper story brewing. Starbucks isn’t just bumping into macroeconomic headwinds; it’s facing a shift in how Indian consumers think about value, brand, and everyday indulgence.

Starbucks is still seen as an upscale brand in big cities – a place to show off, not chill out. In smaller cities, it’s often seen as out of reach. A masala chai at ₹ $320 ($3.70) is a tough sell when the same drink costs a tenth of that at a local stall. Even with localized menu items and smaller cup sizes, Starbucks hasn’t quite cracked the code of cultural fit and pricing perception.

Age-appropriate and Cheaper Choices

Meanwhile, homegrown brands like Blue Tokai and Third Wave are quietly winning the loyalty of India’s younger, more discerning coffee drinkers. They offer craft brews, Instagram-ready interiors, and a price that doesn’t sting. Starbucks’ joint venture with Tata says it’s still committed to hitting the 1,000-store goal maybe a year later. But the real challenge isn’t timing.

India’s middle class is evolving, not just growing. Brand alone isn’t enough as consumers want quality, authenticity, and value all at once.

Nevertheless, Starbucks isn’t pulling out. But to grow in India, it may need to rethink more than its store count. It might need to rethink its role entirely.

What Is the Price Target for SBUX Stock?

Turning Wall Street, Starbucks is considered a Moderate Buy based on 24 ratings. The average price target for SBUX stock is $111.64, implying a 35.98% upside potential.

The US coffee giant, which entered India in 2012 through a joint venture with Tata Consumer Products, had last year announced plans to nearly triple its store count to 1,000 outlets by 2028.
In response to growing competition and evolving consumer preferences, Starbucks has been actively tweaking its India playbook.
Despite the slowdown, Tata Consumer remains optimistic about Starbucks’ long-term potential in India.
The report said Tata Starbucks clocked 8% year-on-year sales growth in the December quarter, with a 10% sequential rise.","Starbucks has sharply slowed the pace of its store expansion in India amid intensifying competition in the country’s evolving café culture and signs of consumer fatigue, The Financial Times has reported.

The US coffee giant, which entered India in 2012 through a joint venture with Tata Consumer Products, had last year announced plans to nearly triple its store count to 1,000 outlets by 2028. But that target is now facing headwinds, as middle-class consumers pull back on discretionary spending and rivals flood the market with newer and more affordable café options.

In an interview with The Financial Times, Sunil D’Souza, Chief Executive of Tata Consumer Products, said Starbucks opened only ""a little over half"" the 30 stores it had targeted for the December quarter. “We saw traffic dropping,” D’Souza said. “So I told my team, let’s moderate a bit. We’ll continue to grow and we’re still opening outlets, but we’ve slowed it down momentarily.”

Starbucks opened a net 16 stores in the three months through December, bringing the total to 473 across 74 Indian cities — well below the post-pandemic record of 29 store additions in the January-March quarter last year.

India, though traditionally a tea-drinking nation, has seen a boom in speciality cafés in recent years, led by homegrown brands like Blue Tokai and Third Wave Coffee, alongside global entrants such as Tim Hortons, Pret A Manger, and Costa Coffee. The report said this surge in new-age coffee brands, coupled with changing urban preferences, is reshaping how Indians consume beverages outside the home.

In response to growing competition and evolving consumer preferences, Starbucks has been actively tweaking its India playbook. The report said the coffee chain introduced smaller ""Picco"" cup sizes, a milky short masala chai priced at Rs320, and food items like chilli paneer sandwiches — part of its effort to blend international appeal with Indian flavours.

To make its cafés more inviting in smaller cities, the company also moved away from darker, high-end interiors to lighter colours that signal affordability and accessibility.

D’Souza said in the interview that in non-metro markets, many consumers still view the brand as premium. “Often we’ve heard that people are not entering because they see this as... a luxury,” he said.

Despite the slowdown, Tata Consumer remains optimistic about Starbucks’ long-term potential in India. “There’s a long runway — it’s just that in a country like India, you’ve got to have a slightly longer perspective,” D’Souza said. He added that the 1,000-store goal still stands, though the timeline “might go up or down by a year.”

During its third quarter investor call, the company said affordability-focused efforts are gaining traction, even as demand pressures persist. The report said Tata Starbucks clocked 8% year-on-year sales growth in the December quarter, with a 10% sequential rise. Expansion picked up in East India, with new stores in Patna, Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Bilaspur, and Gangtok.

To improve local relevance, the company introduced a “classic menu” tailored to Indian taste preferences. Initial trials showed promising repeat purchases, the company noted. It also launched a Diwali 360-campaign with a media reach of over 40 million, and introduced Monsoon Malabar — a reserve small-lot coffee developed exclusively for the Indian market.

Globally too, Starbucks has hit a rough patch. The report noted the company has seen four straight quarters of declining same-store sales, weighed down by slowing footfall in both the US and China — its two largest markets. In China, it has been undercut by faster-growing rivals like Luckin Coffee.",https://media.assettype.com/bloombergquint%2F2025-04-06%2Fzz6jbkqa%2Fhiroko-nishimura-SiSLeFTr5Cg-unsplash.jpg?w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true,N,,2025-04-06 06:01:14.403466

Summary of the day so far

Here is a summary of the latest developments so far:

Donald Trump on Saturday doubled down on the sweeping tariffs he unleashed on countries around the world, warning Americans of pain ahead, but promising historic investment and prosperity. “We have been the dumb and helpless ‘whipping post’, but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “This is an economic revolution, and we will win,” he added. “Hang tough, it won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic.”

Trump’s 10% tariff on UK products came into force on Saturday, as global stock markets continued to fall in response to the imposition of import taxes. The FTSE 100 plummeted on Friday in its worst day of trading since the start of the pandemic, while markets on Wall Street also tumbled. Australia, Colombia, Argentina, Egypt and Saudi Arabia are also among the countries first hit with the 10% tariff.

The initial 10% “baseline” tariff took effect at US seaports, airports and customs warehouses at 12.01am ET (0401 GMT). Many other countries will see their tariff rates increase above that next week – including the EU, which will be hit with a 20% rate. A 25% tariff imposed on all foreign cars imported into the US came into effect on Thursday.

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed it will “pause” shipments to the US in April as it works to “address the new trading terms” of Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, is expected to spend the weekend speaking to foreign leaders about the tariffs, after calls with the prime ministers of Australia and Italy on Friday in which the leaders agreed that a trade war would be “extremely damaging”.

Downing Street said that Starmer had “been clear the UK’s response will be guided by the national interest”. A spokesperson said officials will “calmly continue with our preparatory work, rather than rush to retaliate”.

Ralph Goodale, the high commissioner for Canada in the UK, told the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme on Saturday that “action taken by the US government is completely illogical”. He added: “It will damage the United States itself.”

The Italian economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, warned on Saturday against the imposition of retaliatory tariffs on the US in response to Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs on trade partners. Speaking at a business forum near Milan, Giorgetti said Italy was aiming for a “de-escalation” with the US. “We should avoid launching a policy of counter-tariffs that could be damaging for everyone and especially for us,” Giorgetti said.

The stock market plunge has more to do with the emergence this year of China’s DeepSeek artificial intelligence tool than with Trump’s policies, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in an interview released on Friday that signalled little concern about the ongoing nosedive. “For everyone who thinks these market declines are all based on the president’s economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek,” Bessent told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

Bangladesh’s interim leader called an emergency meeting on Saturday after textile leaders in the world’s second-largest garment manufacturing nation said US tariffs were a “massive blow” to the key industry. Trump on Wednesday slapped punishing new tariffs of 37 % on Bangladesh, increasing duties from the previous 16% on cotton and 32% on polyester products.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is expected to visit the White House on Monday to discuss recently announced tariffs with Trump, three Israeli officials said on Saturday. As part of a sweeping new tariff policy announced by Trump, unspecified Israeli goods exports to the US face a 17% tariff.

China has taken and will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, the foreign ministry said on Saturday, citing a Chinese government stance on opposing US tariffs. The US should “stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China’s economy and trade, and stop undermining the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people”, the ministry said.

Nissan Motor is considering shifting some domestic production of US-bound vehicles to the US, the Nikkei reported on Saturday. As early as this summer, Nissan plans to reduce production at its Fukuoka factory in western Japan and shift some manufacturing of its Rogue SUV to the US to mitigate the impact of Trump’s tariffs, the business newspaper said, without citing the source of its information.

The president of Taiwan, Lai Ching-te, met tech executives on Saturday to discuss how to respond to new US tariffs, promising to ensure Taiwan’s global competitiveness and safeguard its interests. Lai met the executives at his official residence to discuss the response to “the global economic and trade challenges brought about by the reciprocal tariff policy”, his spokesperson Karen Kuo said in a statement. She did not say which companies were present, only that there were several representatives from the information and communications technology, or ICT, industry.

“Today, America is not only humiliating Iran, but also the world,” the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said on Saturday, in an apparent reference to recent policies adopted by Trump, including imposing tariffs on imported goods. Pezeshkian said his country was willing to engage in dialogue with the US as equals, without clarifying whether Tehran would participate in direct talks.

China has said “the market has spoken” in rejecting Trump’s tariffs, and called on Washington for “equal-footed consultation” after global markets plunged in reaction to the trade levies that drew Chinese retaliation. Trump introduced additional 34% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most US trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54%.

Away from tariff news, left-leaning organisations in the US say that more than 500,000 people are expected to take to the streets to protest in Washington DC, Florida and elsewhere around the country on Saturday to oppose Donald Trump’s “authoritarian overreach and billionaire-backed agenda”. MoveOn, one of the organisations planning the day of protest they’re calling Hands Off along with dozens of labour, environmental and other progressive groups, said that more than 1,000 protests are planned across the US, including at state capitols.

Some 1,200 demonstrations are planned across the U.S. on Saturday in what organizers expect to be the largest single day of protest against president Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk since they launched a rapid-fire effort to overhaul government and expand presidential authority.

Thousands were streaming into downtown Washington as the protests got underway. Organisers told Reuters that more than 20,000 people were expected to attend the rally at the National Mall.

The protests in the U.S. will give Trump opponents an opportunity to demonstrate their displeasure en masse in response to Trump’s raft of executive orders.

Some 150 activist groups have signed up to participate, according to the event’s website. Protests are planned in all 50 states plus Canada and Mexico.

Protesters were lining the busy thoroughfare of Connecticut Avenue in Washington, D.C., awaiting buses to take them downtown. They were carrying signs with slogans such as “No Kings in the USA” and “Deport Musk.”

Terry Klein, a retired biomedical scientist from Princeton, New Jersey, was among hundreds who gathered early in front of the stage below the Washington Monument.

She said she drove down to attend the rally to protest Trump’s policies on “everything from immigration to the DOGE stuff to the tariffs this week, to education. I mean, our whole country is under attack, all of our institutions, all the things that make America what it is.”

David Madden, a 75-year old Army veteran and retired trial lawyer, said he flew from Dayton, Ohio, to demonstrate against “the injustice that is dominating this country, the institutions that are being stolen from the American people, the confusion in the courts, the fact that we have a population that I believe is essentially racist.”

Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs are roiling global financial markets, with stocks tumbling across the board from New York to London.

Wall Street suffered its worst week since the onset of the Covid-19 crisis five years ago as investors worldwide balked at the US president’s risky bid to overhaul the global economy with the vast tariffs.

Experts are all but unanimous that the impact on global growth of Wednesday’s extraordinary Rose Garden press conference will be negative – but just how bad remains highly uncertain.

Here are the key stories at a glance:

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will pause shipments of its UK-made cars to the US for a month as it considers how to mitigate the cost of Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The 25% tariff imposed by the US on imported cars and light trucks took effect on 3 April.

A JLR spokesperson said: “The USA is an important market for JLR’s luxury brands. As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are enacting our short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid to longer-term plans.”

JLR, which is owned by India’s Tata Motors, is one of Britain’s biggest producers, selling 400,000 Range Rover Sports, Defenders and other models annually.

Exports to the US account for almost a quarter of those sales and JLR is at the centre of Britain’s car industry, accounting for £1 in every £8 of the country’s exports.

The Sunday Times reported that JLR is thought to have a couple of months’ supply of cars already in the US, which will not be subject to the new tariffs. Shipping vehicles across the Atlantic takes about 21 days.

Hundreds of protesters gathered in central London as part of global demonstrations against Donald Trump’s administration.

Crowds gathered in Trafalgar Square on Saturday afternoon with banners which read “No to Maga hate” and “Dump Trump”.

The rally is one of hundreds of so-called “hands off” demonstrations around the world – including in cities across the US, Paris and Berlin.

The movement has been organised by more than 150 groups, including civil rights groups and trade unions.

A 25% levy on all foreign cars imported into America came into force on Thursday, and a wider “baseline” 10% tariff on goods imported from around the world kicked in on Saturday morning.

Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron discussed their “concerns about the global economic and security impact, particularly in South East Asia” in the wake of Donald Trump’s tariffs, Starmer’s office said.

The UK’s prime minister spoke to the French president on Saturday, the latest in a series of calls with world leaders following the announcement of the US levies.

Issuing a readout of the call, a Downing Street spokesperson said: “The prime minister spoke with President Macron following this week’s announcement that the US will impose additional tariffs. They agreed that a trade war was in nobody’s interests but nothing should be off the table and that it was important to keep business updated on developments.

“The prime minister and president also shared their concerns about the global economic and security impact, particularly in South East Asia.

“Following discussions between military planners in Ukraine this week, they discussed the good progress that has been made on the Coalition of the Willing.

“The prime minister and president agreed to stay in close contact over the coming weeks.”

The stock market plunge has more to do with the emergence this year of China’s DeepSeek artificial intelligence tool than with Donald Trump’s policies, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in an interview released on Friday that signaled little concern about the ongoing nosedive, reports Reuters.

“For everyone who thinks these market declines are all based on the president’s economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek,” Bessent told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

“If I were to analyse in my old hat, and this is the only time I’m going to talk about it … what’s happening with the market I’d say it’s more a Mag 7 problem, not a Maga problem,” Bessent, who ran a hedge fund until being tapped as treasury secretary by Trump, said.

“Mag 7” refers to the shares of the “Magnificent 7” – a group of seven high-performing tech stocks that had helped drive the market higher before its recent selloff. Maga refers to Trump’s “Make America great again” political slogan.

US stocks have tumbled by about 10% in the two days after Trump announced a new global tariff regime that was more aggressive than analysts and investors had been anticipating.

It is a drop that market analysts and large investors themselves have laid at the feet of Trump’s aggressive push on tariffs, which most economists and the head of the Federal Reserve believe risk stoking inflation and damaging economic growth, reports Reuters.

Stocks did take a hit in late January when Chinese startup DeepSeek launched a free AI assistant that it says uses less data at a fraction of the cost of incumbent services. It resulted in a record one-day loss of nearly $600bn in value from the shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia, one of the “Magnificent 7”. But the market soon found its footing again and by mid-February, the benchmark S&P 500 index had regained a record-high level.

Then stocks turned south again starting in late February after a widely followed survey of consumers showed households growing broadly pessimistic about the economy’s prospects and fearful that Trump’s push for tariffs would drive up inflation, reports Reuters.

A raft of other surveys of businesses and consumers since then have flagged similar concerns, and other data has shown the pace of activity has slowed over the course of the first quarter of 2025. The S&P has lost nearly 14% since 19 February, and nearly $10tn of US stock market value has been erased.

The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has been dismissive of the drop as well.

Trump himself on Friday retweeted a social media post bearing the caption “Trump is Purposely CRASHING The Market” and featuring images of the president pointing at a large downward red arrow and of him signing executive orders at the White House.

Meanwhile, Bessent also told Carlson the administration retains a “strong dollar” policy and dismissed assertions by some analysts that the tariff drive was a deliberate effort to weaken the dollar to make US goods more competitive on global markets.

“No one should listen to anyone in the markets talk about the US dollar other than President Trump or myself,” Bessent said. “We are the only ones that speak for this administration, the United States government on dollar policy.”

“We have a strong-dollar policy and we are putting in all of the necessary ingredients to make sure the dollar is strong over the long run,” he said.

The dollar has shed nearly 6% of its value against major trading partners’ currencies since Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, reports Reuters.

'Hang tough, it won’t be easy': Trump defiant on tariffs

Donald Trump on Saturday doubled down on the sweeping tariffs he unleashed on countries around the world, warning Americans of pain ahead, but promising historic investment and prosperity.

The comments came as the US president’s widest-ranging tariffs took effect in a move that could trigger retaliation and escalating trade tensions that could upset the global economy.

“We have been the dumb and helpless ‘whipping post,’ but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.

“This is an economic revolution, and we will win,” he added. “Hang tough, it won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic.”

A 10% “baseline” tariff came into place just after midnight, hitting most US imports except goods from Mexico and Canada as Trump invoked emergency economic powers to address perceived problems with the country’s trade deficits.

The trade gaps, said the White House, were driven by an “absence of reciprocity” in relationships and other policies like “exorbitant value-added taxes”.

Come 9 April, about 60 trading partners – including the European Union, Japan and China – are to face even higher rates tailored to each economy.

Already, Trump’s sharp 34%tariff on Chinese goods, to kick in next week, triggered Beijing’s announcement of its own 34% tariff on US products from 10 April.

Beijing also said it would sue the US at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and restrict the export of rare-earth elements used in high-end medical and electronics technology.

“China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close,” Trump said in his post. “They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly.”

But other major trading partners held back as they digested the unfolding international standoff amid fears of a recession.

Leading garment producer Bangladesh holds crisis talks on US tariffs

Bangladesh’s interim leader called an emergency meeting on Saturday after textile leaders in the world’s second-largest garment manufacturing nation said US tariffs were a “massive blow” to the key industry, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Textile and garment production accounts for about 80% of exports in Bangladesh, and the industry has been rebuilding after it was hard hit in a revolution that toppled the government last year.

Donald Trump on Wednesday slapped punishing new tariffs of 37 % on Bangladesh, increasing duties from the previous 16% on cotton and 32% on polyester products.

Bangladesh exports $8.4bn of garments annually to the US, according to data from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), the national trade body. That totals about 20% of Bangladesh’s total ready-made garments exports, reports afp.

“Chief adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus has convened an emergency meeting … to discuss the US tariff issue,” a government statement read, with the meeting to take place late Saturday in the capital, Dhaka. Top experts, advisers and officials will attend, it added.

Bangladesh’s tax authority, the National Board of Revenue, is also expected to meet to review the fallout from the tariffs.

Rakibul Alam Chowdhury, chair of RDM Group, a major manufacturer with an estimated $25m turnover, said on Thursday that the industry would lose trade. “Buyers will go to other cost-competitive markets – this is going to be a massive blow for our industry,” he said.

Several garment factories produce clothing for the US market alone, report AFP. Anwar Hossain, administrator of the BGMEA, has told AFP that the industry was “not ready” for the tariff impact.

Bangladesh, the second-largest producer after China, manufactures garments for global brands – including for US firms such as Gap Inc, Tommy Hilfiger and Levi Strauss.

Jaguar Land Rover to pause shipments to the US as it works to 'address new trading terms'

Anti-Trump protests expected in US today

Kira Lerner

Away from tariff news, left-leaning organisations in the US say that more than 500,000 people are expected to take to the streets to protest in Washington DC, Florida and elsewhere around the country on Saturday to oppose Donald Trump’s “authoritarian overreach and billionaire-backed agenda”.

MoveOn, one of the organizations planning the day of protest they’re calling Hands Off along with dozens of labor, environmental and other progressive groups, said that more than 1,000 protests are planned across the US, including at state capitols.

“This is shaping up to be the biggest single-day protest in the last several years of American history,” Ezra Levin, a founder of Indivisible, one of the groups planning the event, said on a recent organizing call.

The largest event is expected to be on the National Mall in Washington DC, where members of Congress, including the Democrats Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Maxwell Frost of Florida and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, are scheduled to speak to crowds.

China has said “the market has spoken” in rejecting Trump’s tariffs, and called on Washington for “equal-footed consultation” after global markets plunged in reaction to the trade levies that drew Chinese retaliation.

Trump introduced additional 34% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most U.S. trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54%.

Trump also closed a trade loophole that had allowed low-value packages from China to enter the U.S. duty-free.

This prompted retaliation from China on Friday, including extra levies of 34% on all U.S. goods and export curbs on some rare earths, escalating the trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan told public broadcaster RTHK, however, Hong Kong would not impose separate countermeasures, citing the need for the city to remain “free and open”.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said:

The market has spoken.

Now is the time for the U.S. to stop doing the wrong things and resolve the differences with trading partners through equal-footed consultation.

China’s leader, Xi Jinping, says he is prepared to dance if it means sidestepping some of the worst of Donald Trump’s trade tariffs. Last week he sent a letter to India’s president, Droupadi Murmu, urging her to join him in a tango to celebrate 75 years of ­bilateral trade.

Xi said it was “the right choice” for the two countries to be “partners of mutual achievement and realise the ‘Dragon-Elephant Tango’”, which, he added, “fully serves the fundamental interests of both countries and their peoples.”

Beijing is on a wide-ranging charm offensive, aimed at redirecting its exports away from the US to other willing destinations as Washington erects trade barriers.

Tariffs on China imposed by the US president amounting to 20% earlier this year were more than doubled last week to 54% and an effective average rate of 65%, raising the cost of Chinese imports to a level that many analysts believe will be uncompetitive.

The response from Beijing was swift. A sell-off on financial markets intensified after China’s finance ministry said it would respond in kind, adding 34% to the tariff on all US goods from 10 April.

Investors worry that a recession in the US cannot be ruled out as the trade war intensifies and companies hunker down, cutting investment and jobs to weather the storm.

John Denton, head of the International Chambers of Commerce, likens the onset of these tariff wars to the oil shock of the 1970s, such is its seismic importance. “The overriding theme is the battle for supremacy between China and the US for global trade dominance,” he said.

China has taken and will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, the foreign ministry said on Saturday, citing a Chinese government stance on opposing US tariffs.

The US should “stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China’s economy and trade, and stop undermining the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people,” the ministry said, according to Reuters.

Trump introduced additional 34% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most US trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54%.

This prompted retaliation from China on Friday, including extra levies of 34% on all US goods and export curbs on some rare earths, escalating the trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

Jaguar Land Rover will pause shipments of its UK-made cars to the United States for a month, as it considers how to mitigate the cost of president Donald Trump’s 25% tariff, according to a report in the Times newspaper.

Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by India’s Tata Motors, did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters on Saturday.

A pause in shipments would add to fears over the impact from tariffs on the UK’s car industry, which employs 200,000 people directly. The US is the second-biggest importer of British-made cars after the European Union, with nearly a 20% share, data from industry body SMMT shows, reports Reuters.

Jaguar Land Rover, one of the UK’s biggest producers by volume, sells 400,000 Range Rover Sports, Defenders and other models annually. Exports to the US account for almost a quarter of those sales.

The US 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks took effect on 3 April. The previous day, Trump announced tariffs on other goods from countries across the globe, upending world trade.

The Times said that Jaguar Land Rover is thought to have a couple of months’ supply of cars already in the US, which will not be subject to the new tariffs.

Taiwan president Lai Ching-te met tech executives on Saturday to discuss how to respond to new US tariffs, promising to ensure Taiwan’s global competitiveness and safeguard its interests, reports Reuters.

President Donald Trump announced across-the-board import tariffs on Wednesday with much higher duties for dozens of trading partners, including Taiwan, which runs a large trade surplus with the US and is facing a 32% duty on its products. The US tariffs, however, do not apply to semiconductors, a major Taiwanese export.

Lai met the executives at his official residence to discuss the response to “the global economic and trade challenges brought about by the reciprocal tariff policy”, his spokesperson Karen Kuo said in a statement. She did not say which companies were present, only that there were several representatives from the information and communications technology, or ICT, industry.

Lai “hopes to give industry the greatest support, stabilise the economic situation, ensure Taiwan’s industry’s global competitiveness, and safeguard our country’s national interests and the continued steady progress of our economy”, Kuo said.

Taiwan is home to TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker and an important supplier to companies including Apple and Nvidia. TSMC did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment on whether it attended the meeting. TSMC is in its quiet period ahead of first quarter earnings announcement on 17 April.

On Friday, Taiwan’s government announced T$88bn ($2.67bn/£2.07bn) in financial help for companies and industries to deal with the impact of the US tariffs.

Taiwan, which says the tariffs are unreasonable, has said it will discuss them with the US and has not announced any retaliatory tariffs.

US president Donald Trump has long been an advocate of tariffs – once describing them as the most beautiful word in the dictionary – and his promise to impose them was a central plank of his presidential election campaign. In anticipation, Downing Street developed a defensive strategy that revolved around building a strong relationship with Trump’s White House – despite clear political differences – and launching talks to strike an economic deal that would secure tariff exemptions.

Trade talks between the UK and US began soon after Trump’s inauguration, before the prime minister visited Washington in February, with the goal of agreeing a relatively narrow deal focused on advanced technologies. Talks intensified before UK business secretary Jonathan Reynolds’ own visit to meet Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, just over two weeks ago.

UK officials were assured by their US counterparts that they were in a strong position to negotiate a trade deal with Washington. “By then we knew what the faultlines were, and we were broadly there, so we just had some details to thrash out,” an official said.

The two key figures leading the negotiations are Reynolds and Varun Chandra, a corporate strategist turned senior No 10 aide known as the prime minister’s “business whisperer”. Officials have been impressed by how Chandra has navigated the US administration. “He just gets them, and they get him. The talks have been much more corporate in tone than trade negotiations usually are. That’s his world,” one said.

A senior trade department official, Kate Joseph, and Keir Starmer’s economic international affairs adviser, Michael Ellam, have been working behind the scenes at home to get the Whitehall machine ready. Multiple scenarios were drawn up depending on what tariff regime Trump imposed.
