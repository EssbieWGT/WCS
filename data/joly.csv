But retail experts told Daily Mail that the iconic Canadian brand was in trouble before President Trump reclaimed the White House.
Across most of its stores, Hudson’s Bay has provided the shopper with a sub-par experience and this has created a situation in which traffic and spend has declined.
The company, which has ties back to 17th-century fur trades, has been a mainstay in Canadian retail for decades.
Hudson Bay went independent in December 2024, keeping both Saks-based brands under its wing.","An iconic 354-year-old Canadian retailer is going out of business and shutting down all of its stores.

And it's pointing the finger at America and the ongoing tariff war.

Hudson’s Bay, a retailer and an anchor to dozens of malls across Canada, is preparing for an 'immediate' liquidation after failing to secure enough money to stay afloat.

Clearance sales will begin as early as next week at all 80 Hudson’s Bay locations, as well as three Saks Fifth Avenue and 12 Saks Off 5th stores it operates in Canada.

Hudson’s Bay blames its collapse on sluggish consumer spending, post-pandemic declines in foot traffic, and even trade tensions between Canada and the U.S.

The two countries have been engaged in a brutal back-and-forth after President Donald Trump launched tariffs on Canadian imports.

Canada hit back with duties on $20 billion worth of American goods.

The tariffs, a cornerstone of President Trump's economic vision, are expected to raise prices for everyday Americans and Canadians who have already been hurt by inflation and high borrowing costs.

But retail experts told Daily Mail that the iconic Canadian brand was in trouble before President Trump reclaimed the White House.

'Bankruptcy is just the latest twist in a long running saga,' Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData's retail division, said.

'The central problem is one of experience. Across most of its stores, Hudson’s Bay has provided the shopper with a sub-par experience and this has created a situation in which traffic and spend has declined.

'The chain has basically become far less relevant to Canadian shoppers and even its heritage and iconic status have not been enough to offset this.'

Hudson Bay is in negotiations with some of its debtors. If the these fail, all stores may close by June 15.

The company owes more than $950 million to suppliers, such as Ralph Lauren and Chanel.

The collapse would leave 9,364 people out of work.

'Our team has worked incredibly hard to identify a viable path forward,' Liz Rodbell. the company's CEO, said.

The company, which has ties back to 17th-century fur trades, has been a mainstay in Canadian retail for decades.

Hudson Bay still sells an iconic striped wool blanket found in many Canadian households.

There has been a run on the blankets since rumors about the company's potential demise, according to the Times Columnist.

The company has also changed hands multiple times in the past decade, including partnerships with real estate mogul Richard Baker and Lord and Taylor.

In his nearly four-year tenure, Grieder revamped the Hugo and Boss brands with the goal of luring younger shoppers with more casual wear.
The outlook for 2025 sales, however, came in just below the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
“The road ahead comes with several challenges that all pose tangible risk to consumer sentiment in 2025,” Grieder said, citing tariffs and the weak economic situation in China.
Hugo Boss intends to pay a dividend of 1.40 euros per share, above analysts estimate.","[FRANKFURT] Hugo Boss’ plan to return to profit growth this year faces an initial hurdle as weak consumer sentiment in the US and China weigh on sales and profit in the current quarter.

“We expect a muted first-quarter performance trending somewhat below our full-year top line guidance range,” chief executive officer Daniel Grieder told journalists on a call.

The shares fell 5.3 per cent by 1.17 pm Frankfurt time in an up-and-down session that earlier saw them rise as much as 4.7 per cent. The stock has dropped about 35 per cent in the last 12 months, a worse performance than rival high-end apparel makers Burberry Group and Ralph Lauren.

The German fashion house has been suffering since last year from a decline in consumer spending, which Grieder is trying to address with efficiency measures, such as shifting transport from air freight to ships. Job cuts are “not in our intention as we speak”, he said on the call.

In his nearly four-year tenure, Grieder revamped the Hugo and Boss brands with the goal of luring younger shoppers with more casual wear. His goals initially set out for 2025 – sales of five billion euros (S$7.3 billion) and a profit margin of at least 12 per cent – were delayed last year. But they are still doable, he said on Thursday (Mar 13), without giving a specific time frame for reaching them.

The company expects earnings before interest and taxes of between 380 million euros and 440 million euros this year, it said, in line with analysts’ forecasts. The outlook for 2025 sales, however, came in just below the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

“The road ahead comes with several challenges that all pose tangible risk to consumer sentiment in 2025,” Grieder said, citing tariffs and the weak economic situation in China.

While the effect of tariffs imposed by the US administration is still unclear, Hugo Boss’s supply chain is flexible and sourcing from China has been reduced to below 5 per cent, chief financial officer Yves Müller said. The company does not plan price increases at the moment, “but we have to see how it develops in the next few weeks and months”, Grieder said.

Asked about Frasers Group, now the company’s largest shareholder, Grieder said the exchanges have been “very constructive”. The acquisitive sportswear-to-department-store retailer’s CEO, Michael Murray, is seeking a seat on Hugo Boss’s supervisory board at the May 15 annual meeting.

The risk of a criminal investigation into Grieder over media allegations of insider trading activities is over, with the German financial watchdog and a public prosecutor deciding after an initial examination that there was no sufficient evidence to launch such a procedure.

“This affair is behind us, it’s dealt with in a serious, transparent way,” Grieder said.

United Concordia Dental and HM Insurance Group, the company's stop-loss division, were bright spots with steady performance. Highmark said that trend was backed by growing dental membership and a disciplined pricing approach.

Nike will report quarterly earnings after the market closes on Thursday.

The company is expected to report earnings-per-share of $0.28 on $11.02 billion in revenue.

Both figures are lower than last quarter even though Nike exceeded both estimates

This will be the second earnings report under new CEO Elliott Hill.

This earnings season is coming to a close, and Nike (NKE) is one of the final household brand names that has yet to report. On Thursday, it will report quarterly earnings after the market closes. This will be the second earnings report under new CEO, Elliott Hill. Although Nike exceeded earnings-per-share (EPS) and revenue estimates last quarter, the expectation bar is lower this time.

Nike is expected to report an EPS of $0.28 on $11.02 billion in revenue, and both figures are lower than last quarter's estimates.

NKE stock is trading near five-year lows, hovering around $72 per share. This is slightly lower than the stock opened in 2025 at $76.25 per share. The stock has bounced to the upside around $70, so hopefully the world's largest athletic shoe and apparel company can find a way back to a better stock price. With that said, NKE stock realized a massive sell-off after the earnings report in June 2024, falling over 20% the next day. The realized volatility is real here, and traders are looking for some positive sentiment this week.

During the last earnings call, Nike executives offered words of encouragement for the future of the brand. CEO Elliot Hill had this to say: “After an energizing 60 days of being back with my Nike teammates, our clear priority is to return sport to the center of everything we do. ... We're taking immediate action to reposition our business, so we can get back to driving long-term shareholder value. Our team is ready to go, and I'm confident you will see more moments of Nike being Nike again.""

Matthew Friend, chief financial officer, said, ""Nike’s second-quarter financial performance largely met our expectations, as we continue to make progress in shifting our portfolio. ... Under Elliott's leadership, we are accelerating our pace and reigniting brand momentum through sport.""

When a new CEO takes over, even if it was someone who worked at Nike previously, there's going to be some turbulence along the way. We're seeing that now, and the market is pricing in a relatively large stock price range for earnings this week.

Based on current implied volatility, we're looking at a +/- $5.92 stock price range against a $72 stock price. This is about 8% of the notional value of the stock price, which is on the higher end of the typical 5%-10% range we see for earnings.

Looking to the May 2025 options cycle, we can see the market is only pricing in a range of +/- $8.22. That means the earnings announcement this week makes up for over 75% of the expected stock price range for the next 60 days.

Bullish on Nike stock for earnings

If you're bullish on NKE stock for earnings, you're looking for another strong report against lower estimates. If Nike can post two earnings beats in a row, we could see the stock price rally from lows. It could help that the general market volatility has come down a bit, which could entice investors to engage in products trading near multi-year lows, and Nike is certainly one of them.

Bearish on Nike stock for earnings

If you're bearish on NKE stock for earnings, you're looking for an earnings miss against lower estimates. If the company can't beat estimates, the stock retreat to levels we haven't seen in many years. High implied volatility going into an earnings announcement means there's plenty of uncertainty, and the market is waiting to see what is said on Thursday.

Earlier this month, Audacy conducted a broad round of layoffs, cutting about 200 employees across divisions.

Audacy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year as it looked to reduce its debt load. The one-time publicly traded company emerged from bankruptcy in September 2024 under a new ownership group led by controlling shareholder Soros Fund Management.

“On behalf of the Audacy board, we are delighted that Kelli Turner has agreed to take on the permanent president and CEO role and lead Audacy through its next phase of reinvention and growth,” said Michael Del Nin, chairman of Audacy and the lead media investor in Soros Fund Management. “She is an exceptional media executive who, along with Chris Oliviero and the rest of the Audacy team, will ensure we continue to invest in high-quality content to engage our audiences and provide best-in-class solutions to our partners.”

Turner has served on the Audacy board since September 2024. She has also served on the boards of directors of several ad and music technology companies, including DoubleVerify, Downtown Music Holdings and Central European Media Enterprises. Turner most recently was managing director and CFO of private investment firm Sun Capital Partners. Prior to joining Sun Capital Partners, she was president and CEO of SESAC Holdings, a music licensing and rights management company owned by Blackstone. She has also served in various executive and leadership roles in the investment and media industries, including RSL Group, Martha Stewart Living, Time Warner, Allen & Co. and Citigroup.

“It’s a privilege to lead Audacy at this exciting moment in its impressive history and the evolution of audio,” Turner said in a statement. “This is one of the most dynamic businesses in media and entertainment, and I am looking forward to partnering with Chris Oliviero and all of our teams to build on our momentum with audiences, creators and advertisers. I’m especially excited by the appointments of Chris and Bob, who know Audacy’s businesses inside out and whose track records in management, programming and sales are second to none.”

Oliviero, Audacy’s new chief business officer, has served as market president in New York since 2020 and spent more than 23 years at CBS Radio (which became part of Audacy in 2017).

Continued growth and innovation By 2024, Kraft Heinz had extended its partnership with Highbury Canco in Canada.","COVID-19 sent shockwaves through global manufacturing, forcing industries to rethink supply chains, operations and workforce management.

The US auto sector slumped, with car sales still struggling to reach pre-pandemic levels.

In Germany, automation accelerated, wiping out nearly 250,000 manufacturing jobs. But for Kraft Heinz, the crisis presented both challenges and opportunities, demanding rapid adaptation to unprecedented shifts in demand.

As lockdowns took hold, consumer panic buying fuelled a surge in demand for pantry staples. Products like Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, Heinz Ketchup and Maxwell House Coffee flew off shelves, testing the limits of supply chains.

Kraft Heinz responded with an all-hands-on-deck approach—US factories ramped up to 24/7 production, attendance rates hit record highs and facilities like the Iowa plant achieved historic output levels.

The company doubled down on modernisation, automation and expansion to solidify its supply chain for the long haul.

Supply chain resilience and expansion

Kraft Heinz’s response to pandemic-driven demand spikes laid the groundwork for significant global investments.

In 2021, the company poured £140m (US$189m) into its Kitt Green facility in the UK, Europe’s largest food manufacturing plant. The initiative focused on modernisation, machinery upgrades and sustainability.

Notably, sauce production was repatriated, reducing reliance on imports while improving efficiency and environmental impact.

In the US, the company committed US$143m to expanding its Garland, Texas plant, increasing production lines and workforce capacity.

Meanwhile, a €70m (US$82.6m) investment in Alfaro, Spain boosted factory capacity by 50%, strengthening its European supply chain. This expansion allowed the site to process 25,000 tonnes of locally grown tomatoes annually, reinforcing Kraft Heinz’s commitment to regional sourcing and efficiency.

These strategic investments align with a broader shift toward Industry 4.0 technologies, integrating automation and AI to streamline operations and improve responsiveness to consumer trends.

Strategic acquisitions and distribution enhancements

Beyond physical expansion, Kraft Heinz sharpened its direct-to-consumer capabilities.

In 2022, the company acquired an 85% stake in Just Spices, a digital-first spice brand with strong online sales. The move strengthened Kraft Heinz’s foothold in the taste elevation market and enhanced its ecommerce strategy.

On the logistics front, a US$400m investment in a high-tech, 775,000-square-foot automated distribution centre in DeKalb, Illinois transformed supply chain efficiency.

With direct national railway access, the facility processed more than 60% of the company’s foodservice business and nearly a third of its dry goods.

Sustainability was also a key focus, with the site designed to reduce environmental impact while optimising speed and cost-effectiveness in product distribution.

Continued growth and innovation

By 2024, Kraft Heinz had extended its partnership with Highbury Canco in Canada. The Leamington, Ontario facility remains a critical part of operations, producing more than US$1bn worth of Heinz products through 2027.

Innovation also took centre stage, with new ketchup flavours and expanded condiment applications aiming to drive growth in evolving consumer markets.

Poppi and the plaintiff moved to settle the suit on Friday for $8.9 million, according to court filings.","PepsiCo said Monday that it is buying prebiotic soda brand Poppi for nearly $2 billion.

While soda consumption has broadly fallen over the past two decades in the U.S., prebiotic sodas, fueled by industry newcomers Poppi and Olipop, have won over health-conscious consumers over the past five years.

The category's growth makes it attractive for Pepsi and its rival, Coca-Cola , which recently launched its own prebiotic soda brand, Simply Pop. Pepsi had reportedly aimed to launch its own functional soda under its Soulboost brand, but it canceled those plans, likely paving the way to a deal with Poppi.

Pepsi said it plans to acquire the upstart Poppi for $1.95 billion. The deal includes $300 million of anticipated cash tax benefits, making the net purchase price $1.65 billion.

Pepsi will also have to make additional payments if Poppi achieves certain performance milestones within a set time frame after the acquisition closes. The company did not say when the deal is expected to close, pending regulatory approval.

Poppi's founders Allison and Stephen Ellsworth launched the brand back in 2018, the same year that Olipop was founded. Poppi's formula includes apple cider vinegar, prebiotics and just five grams of sugar.

By 2023, Poppi's annual sales reportedly crossed $100 million.

The company recently made its second straight Super Bowl appearance with an ad during the big game, demonstrating both its deep pockets and a desire to reach an even wider audience.

But as Poppi's sales have grown, it has also attracted backlash for its health claims.

Analysts already incorporated company challenges in the guidance. The results are likely to be broadly in line with expectations, according to Telsey Advisory Group.

The Nike Analyst: Analyst Cristina Fernández reaffirmed a Market Perform rating and price target of $80.

The Nike Thesis: Given lower demand for its products, a reduction in units of three key lifestyle franchises, and higher promotions to clear inventory, the company is likely to report a 12% decline in sales versus consensus of 11.3%, Fernández said in a note.

Check out other analyst stock ratings.

Gross margins are likely to have contracted to 41.5%, versus consensus of 41.8%, she added.

The analyst mentioned the key areas to watch during the earnings call:

Progress on inventory reduction

Impact of the shift in clearance activity from ecommerce to factory stores

Magnitude of further reductions in lifestyle franchise units

Pace of product innovation and potential for new products

Retro products making a comeback to offset declines in other parts of the business

The recently announced launch of the NikeSKIMS brand to broaden the reach for Nike in women's apparel

While Nike will announce the initial guidance for fiscal 2026, it had indicated that reductions in lifestyle franchise units, a mix shift toward lower margin products, and steps to improve relationships with wholesale partners will have adverse impacts on both sales and profitability in fiscal 2026, she stated.

""We don't expect a significant direct impact to Nike from tariffs given the majority of Nike products manufactured in China (15% of total) serve the Chinese market, with only a small portion of those imported into the US (both adidas and Under Armour have noted that only 3%-4% of the products made in China are sold in the US),"" Fernández further wrote.

Price Action: Shares of Nike had risen by 2.09% to $73.12 at the time of publication on Monday.

The operator of Forever 21's U.S. unit said Sunday that foreign competition from fast-fashion rivals, rising costs, economic challenges and evolving consumer trends were to blame. For the time being, stores and the company's U.S. website will remain open as the company starts winding down operations and seeks a last-minute bidder for its assets.

Founded in 1984 by Korean immigrants in California, Forever 21 grew to $1 billion in annual sales by 2005. The store quickly became a mall staple for millennials looking for designer-inspired styles, alongside fellow low-cost retailer H&M and the pricier Abercrombie & Fitch. Forever 21’s sales peaked at more than $4 billion a decade later, and founders Jin Sook and Do Won ""Don"" Chang were estimated to hold a combined net worth of $5.9 billion.

Yet as the 2010s wore on, the brand began to be eclipsed by online rivals, including ultra-cheap fast-fashion retailers like Shein that shipped their garments to U.S. customers from overseas. In this environment, Forever 21's reliance on foot traffic at malls began to prove a liability as customers increasingly leaned into e-commerce.

Forever 21 filed for bankruptcy for the first time in 2019, hoping to become a more efficient operation. But the Covid-19 pandemic only accelerated the company's woes, even as it was bought out of bankruptcy by Authentic Brands, the operator of other major retailers and two major mall operators.

F21 OpCo, which runs Forever 21 stores, said late Sunday that it will wind down the business in the U.S. under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection while determining if it can continue as a business with a partner, or if it will sell some or all of its assets.

“While we have evaluated all options to best position the company for the future, we have been unable to find a sustainable path forward, given competition from foreign fast fashion companies, which have been able to take advantage of the de minimis exemption to undercut our brand on pricing and margin,” Chief Financial Officer Brad Sell said in a statement.

The de minimis tax exemption lets shipments headed to U.S. businesses and consumers valued at less than $800 to enter the country tax free and duty free.

Forever 21 stores in the U.S. will hold liquidation sales and the website will continue to run while operations wind down. The retailer's locations outside of the U.S. are run by other licensees and are not included in the bankruptcy filing. International store locations and websites will continue operating as normal.

Authentic Brands Group owns the international intellectual property associated with the Forever 21 brand and may license the brand to other operators, F21OpCo said.

Forever 21 first filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019. It was acquired by a consortium of parties including Authentic Brands Group and mall owners Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners.

Forever 21 was founded in 1984 and, along with other fast-fashion chains like H & M and Zara, rode a wave of popularity among young customers in the mid-1990s. Their popularity grew during the Great Recession, when shoppers were seeking bargains. But Forever 21 went on an aggressive expansion just as shoppers were moving more online.

Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a statement that part of the problem now is that Forever 21's stores are too big for its current needs and it's in malls with not enough foot traffic.

“Forever 21 was always a retailer living on borrowed time. Over recent years it has been hit with dual headwinds from a weak apparel market and stiff competition from cheap Chinese marketplaces,” he said. “Both things have eroded its standing and depleted its market share.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/37e83778-28a0-41e4-b6ca-79e58738ec11/wirestory_0c5e9bac07bf184988475a2b57842e08_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-03-17 12:09:22.364561

(Nasdaq: MBX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel precision peptide therapies for the treatment of endocrine and metabolic disorders, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024, and highlighted recent corporate progress.

""We are poised to deliver Phase 2 clinical data on our lead program in hypoparathyroidism, canvuparatide, with topline results from our Avail™ trial anticipated in the third quarter of 2025.

Finally, we look forward to initiating a Phase 2 trial evaluating MBX 1416 in post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) patients in the second half of 2025.”

Fourth Quarter 2024 and Recent Corporate Highlights

Hypoparathyroidism (HP): Canvuparatide (MBX 2109)

Completed Enrollment in Phase 2 Avail Trial in HP patients: In March 2025, MBX announced the completion of enrollment of 64 patients with HP in the Phase 2 Avail trial of canvuparatide, the Company's potential long-acting parathyroid once-weekly hormone (PTH) peptide prodrug. Topline results from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week trial are anticipated in the third quarter of 2025.

Published Phase 1 Trial Results: In December 2024, MBX announced the publication of a peer-reviewed article highlighting results from the Phase 1 study of canvuparatide titled ""MBX 2109, a Once-Weekly Parathyroid Hormone Replacement Therapy Prodrug: Phase 1, First-in-Human, Randomized Trial” in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (JCEM) and can be accessed here.

Post-bariatric Hypoglycemia (PBH): MBX 1416

Positive results from MBX 1416 Phase 1 trial support Phase 2 advancement: In January 2025, the Company announced positive topline results from its Phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose clinical trial of MBX 1416 in healthy adult volunteers. MBX 1416 is the Company's long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist in development for the treatment of PBH. MBX anticipates initiating a Phase 2 study of MBX 1416 in patients with PBH in the second half of 2025 following completion of an End-of-Phase 1 meeting with the FDA.

Obesity: MBX 4291

IND filing on track for Q2 2025: MBX expects to submit an IND application to the FDA in the second quarter of 2025 for MBX 4291, the Company's GLP-1/GIP co-agonist prodrug for the potential once-monthly treatment of obesity.

Corporate

Leadership Team Additions: In March 2025, the Company announced the appointments of Chatan Charan, Ph.D. as Senior Vice President, Pharmaceutical Development and Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls and Mark Hope as Senior Vice President, Regulatory and Quality, adding additional expertise in support of the company's ongoing advancement and expansion of its novel product candidates.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities: As of December 31, 2024, MBX Biosciences had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $262.1 million. Based on its current operating plan, the Company expects the combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance to fund operations into mid-2027.

R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2024, were $15.2 million and $57.4 million, respectively, compared to $7.7 million and $28.5 million for the same periods in 2023. The increases of $7.5 million and $28.9 million, respectively, were driven by costs associated with ongoing IND-enabling studies for MBX 4291 and the ongoing canvuparatide Phase 2 clinical trial.

G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2024, were $3.4 million and $10.8 million, respectively, compared to $2.3 million and $6.8 million for the same periods in 2023. The increases of $1.1 million and $4.0 million, respectively, were driven by increased personnel-related costs as the Company expanded its infrastructure to support its growth in operations.

Net Loss: Net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2024, was $15.6 million compared to a net loss of $8.8 million for the same period in 2023. Net loss for the full year ended December 31, 2024 was $61.9 million compared to a net loss of $32.6 million for the same period in 2023.

Finally, we look forward to initiating a Phase 2 trial evaluating MBX 1416 in post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) patients in the second half of 2025.”

Fourth Quarter 2024 and Recent Corporate Highlights

Hypoparathyroidism (HP): Canvuparatide (MBX 2109)

Completed Enrollment in Phase 2 Avail Trial in HP patients: In March 2025, MBX announced the completion of enrollment of 64 patients with HP in the Phase 2 Avail trial of canvuparatide, the Company’s potential long-acting parathyroid once-weekly hormone (PTH) peptide prodrug. Topline results from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week trial are anticipated in the third quarter of 2025.

Published Phase 1 Trial Results: In December 2024, MBX announced the publication of a peer-reviewed article highlighting results from the Phase 1 study of canvuparatide titled “MBX 2109, a Once-Weekly Parathyroid Hormone Replacement Therapy Prodrug: Phase 1, First-in-Human, Randomized Trial” in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (JCEM) and can be accessed here.

Post-bariatric Hypoglycemia (PBH): MBX 1416

Positive results from MBX 1416 Phase 1 trial support Phase 2 advancement: In January 2025, the Company announced positive topline results from its Phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose clinical trial of MBX 1416 in healthy adult volunteers. MBX 1416 is the Company’s long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist in development for the treatment of PBH. MBX anticipates initiating a Phase 2 study of MBX 1416 in patients with PBH in the second half of 2025 following completion of an End-of-Phase 1 meeting with the FDA.

Obesity: MBX 4291

IND filing on track for Q2 2025: MBX expects to submit an IND application to the FDA in the second quarter of 2025 for MBX 4291, the Company’s GLP-1/GIP co-agonist prodrug for the potential once-monthly treatment of obesity.

G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2024, were $3.4 million and $10.8 million, respectively, compared to $2.3 million and $6.8 million for the same periods in 2023. The increases of $1.1 million and $4.0 million, respectively, were driven by increased personnel-related costs as the Company expanded its infrastructure to support its growth in operations.

Forever 21 joins a long list of companies closing stores in the US.
Forever 21 currently has more than “540 locations globally and online,” according to its website.

The retailer’s US operating company filed for bankruptcy Sunday — for the second time in six years — in a court in Delaware, citing fierce competition from foreign fast fashion retailers. It marks the end of an era for a clothing brand that introduced many teens to fast fashion.

The company said in a statement that its stores and website in the United States will remain open and continue serving customers for now, but it is implementing an “orderly wind-down” of its business in the country. It added that it would conduct liquidation sales at its stores and that it was seeking a buyer for some or all of its assets.

Brad Sell, the company’s chief financial officer, said in the statement: “We have been unable to find a sustainable path forward, given competition from foreign fast fashion companies… as well as rising costs, economic challenges impacting our core customers and evolving consumer trends.”

Many US businesses file for bankruptcy protection to wind down some operations, shed debt and cut costs. Chapter 11 bankruptcy is a common route, allowing ailing companies to solve their financial problems by restructuring.

Forever 21 has been unable to keep up with Chinese e-commerce giants such as Shein and Temu, especially as online shopping boomed during the pandemic. The company is also sensitive to President Donald Trump’s tariff hikes on Chinese imports into the United States.

All three retailers are fast fashion brands, meaning they mass-produce cheap clothes that are often quickly discarded as consumers strive to keep up with the latest trends. The business model has also been criticized for its negative impact on the environment.

“Forever 21 has not helped itself through these challenges: merchandising and the assortment have been lackluster, and the brand has lacked any clear point of view for a long time,” said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at GlobalData Retail, in a comment. “The net result is that more and more customers, especially those at the younger end of the market, have abandoned it.”

Forever 21 first filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2019 and subsequently shut down 200 stores. A few months later, a team consisting of mall operators Simon Property Group and Brookfield Properties and brand management firm Authentic Brands Group bought Forever 21 for $81 million. That allowed the retailer to keep operating with a smaller retail footprint.

But years later, the outlook remained bleak.

Forever 21 joins a long list of companies closing stores in the US. Last year, major US retailers announced more than 7,300 store closures, up 57% from 2023, according to Coresight Research. These included Walgreens (WBA) and CVS (CVS).

Forever 21 currently has more than “540 locations globally and online,” according to its website. At the time of its first bankruptcy filing, it had 800 locations worldwide.

The Forever 21 brand might live on through licensing agreements, but that would make the retailer a “a shadow of its former self, but a sale is possible as e-commerce and brand groups may show some interest,” Saunders added.

The increases of $7.5 million and $28.9 million, respectively, were driven by costs associated with ongoing IND-enabling studies for MBX 4291 and the ongoing canvuparatide Phase 2 clinical trial.

G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2024, were $3.4 million and $10.8 million, respectively, compared to $2.3 million and $6.8 million for the same periods in 2023. The increases of $1.1 million and $4.0 million, respectively, were driven by increased personnel-related costs as the Company expanded its infrastructure to support its growth in operations.

Artisan Mid Cap Value Fund stated the following regarding Polaris Inc. (NYSE:PII) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:

""Our biggest individual detractors in Q4 were Dentsply Sirona, Polaris Inc. (NYSE:PII) and Baxter International. Polaris designs, engineers and manufactures power sports vehicles, operating in three segments: off-road, on-road and marine. This company missed earnings expectations and lowered FY2024 guidance due to continued weak demand for recreational vehicles. Additionally, with dealer inventories still too high, Polaris has had to pursue greater promotional activity through rebates as well as provide cheaper floor plan financing and advertising assistance to dealers—all of which are pressuring margins. Retail weakness is partly a hangover from robust sales during the pandemic that pulled forward demand. Additionally, as inflation has constrained consumer budgets, consumers are deferring big-ticket discretionary purchases and avoiding high financing costs at today’s interest rates. We admit that the challenging sales environment may continue, but with the stock drifting back toward its lowest prices since the pandemic selloff of 2020 and selling cheaply at 11X our estimate of normalized earnings, we added to our position in Q4. The company is well run historically, and current management has demonstrated operating discipline by divesting bad businesses acquired under old management, focusing on the company’s roots in power sports and continuing its history of returning capital to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. Returns over a business cycle are strong, with returns on tangible capital most years in the mid-to-high teens. Though cash generation has fallen—as expected in a tough retail backdrop—Polaris remains well financed.""

Hudson’s Bay attributed its financial struggles to subdued consumer spending, trade tensions between the United States and Canada, and decreased foot traffic in downtown locations following the pandemic.
The company’s stores often occupy several floors and significantly more square footage than other retailers.

Originally established as a fur trading business, Hudson’s Bay has been led by Americans for several decades.","Hudson’s Bay Co plans to liquidate its entire business as early as next week unless it secures additional financing, the 354-year-old Canadian retailer said in court filings, putting more than 9,000 jobs at risk across the country.

The iconic department store chain, which traces its roots back to 1670, announced late Friday that “exhaustive” efforts to secure financing had failed, forcing it to pursue a full liquidation of its 80 stores pending court approval on Monday.

“Without an immediate liquidation across retail stores, it is not expected that Hudson’s Bay would be able to repay its obligations under the financing it did secure,” Jennifer Bewley, chief financial officer for Hudson’s Bay’s parent company, said in an affidavit filed Friday.

The retailer owes more than $950 million to creditors including landlords, suppliers and fashion brands such as Chanel, Columbia Sportswear, Diesel, Estee Lauder, and Ralph Lauren.

Hudson’s Bay attributed its financial struggles to subdued consumer spending, trade tensions between the United States and Canada, and decreased foot traffic in downtown locations following the pandemic.

“Our team has worked incredibly hard to identify a viable path forward, and our resolve is strengthened by the overwhelming support from customers and associates…” Hudson’s Bay president and CEO Liz Rodbell said in a statement.

Retail experts say the planned closure marks the end of an era for a company deeply woven into Canadian identity.

The liquidation would leave vacant anchor tenant spaces in malls and prime real estate in high-traffic shopping districts across Canada. The company’s stores often occupy several floors and significantly more square footage than other retailers.

Ontario would be hardest hit, with 32 of the company’s stores located in the province. British Columbia has 16 locations, while Alberta and Quebec each have 13. Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan have two stores each.

Union representatives for about 320 workers at three Ontario stores and a Toronto warehouse called on the company to “uphold its legal obligations to workers” and provide transparent communication about closures and severance protections.

The company’s history is intertwined with Canada’s development. Originally established as a fur trading business, Hudson’s Bay has been led by Americans for several decades. Richard Baker’s National Realty and Development Corp. Equity Partners purchased it in 2008 for $1.1 billion.

Baker took the company public in 2012 before privatizing it again in 2020 through a takeover bid that required multiple revisions to secure shareholder approval. The liquidation process is expected to conclude by June if approved by the court.

Chicago, IL – March 17, 2025 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Nike NKE, FedEx FDX, Costco COST, Oracle ORCL and Adobe ADBE.

Looking Ahead to Q1 Earnings Season

The Q1 reporting cycle will really get going when the big banks come out with their March-quarter results on April 11th, but the Q1 earnings season has actually gotten underway already, with four S&P 500 members having come out with results for their fiscal quarters ending in February.

We have another 10 such index members on deck to report their respective February-quarter results this week, including bellwether operators like Nike, FedEx and others. We and other research organizations count these February-quarter results as part of our March-quarter tally.

By the time the big banks come out with their quarterly results about a month from now, we will have such Q1 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members.

The market has been unimpressed with the results we have seen in recent days, with three of the four stocks losing ground following the respective quarterly releases. We should note that these results from Costco, Oracle and Adobe coincided with a broad market sell-off, so one could attribute the post-release weakness in each of these stocks to broad market forces.

That said, we do know that while Costco, Oracle and Adobe came out with strong and better-than-expected results for their respective February quarters, their guidance for the current period was tentative and underwhelming. The weak guidance from these companies follows similarly soft outlooks from the likes of Walmart, Target, Delta Air Lines, and others.

These weak guidance releases are coming at a time of growing anxiety about the macroeconomic backdrop, with many in the market starting to worry about the U.S. economy’s near-term growth momentum. Uncertainty about the Trump administration’s tariff policies is starting to show up in business and consumer confidence measures, and some have begun to worry if the ongoing public sector job cuts will eventually seep into the private sector as well.

We discuss the earnings impact of the tariff question here >>>The Earnings Impact of the New Tariff Regime

We discuss the earnings impact of the tariff question here >>>The Earnings Impact of the New Tariff Regime

While we acknowledge that near-term risks have increased for the economy, we remain sanguine in our outlook and see the ongoing market weakness as a buying opportunity. The U.S. economy defied skeptics during and after the extraordinary Fed tightening cycle and remains resilient enough to withstand the current bout of tariffs-centric uncertainty.

Importantly, for the first time in a long time, the U.S. economy enjoys the backstop of the Fed with more than enough ‘dry powder’ to jumpstart growth should investors’ worst fears come to fruition.

Depending on where the emerging tariff regime settles, earnings estimates will need to come down in response. But we all need to look past the daily noise around tariffs and remind ourselves that the overall corporate earnings picture has been steadily improving in recent quarters.

The earnings growth pace has been steadily accelerating in recent quarters, with the preceding quarter’s +13.7% earnings growth rate (+16.4% on an ex-Energy basis) reaching its highest level in three years.

We believe that these favorable growth trends will remain in place in the current and coming quarters, with the sectors contributing to the growth momentum expanding beyond the Tech core of the last couple of years.

Early Q1 Earnings Scorecard

As noted earlier, we have already seen February-quarter results from four S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these four index members are up +8.4% from the same period last year on an equivalent growth in revenues, with only one of the four beating EPS estimates and two of four beating revenue estimates.

Of the 10 index members reporting results this week, we will be closely watching for trends in the releases from Nike, FedEx, and Accenture, focusing on how they describe trends in their outlook.

Nike is expected to bring in 28 cents per share in earnings on $11.12 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of -71.4% and -10.6%. While estimates have been stable over the past month, they have been cut more than -50% over the past three months.

The stock has been a true laggard lately, underperforming the broader market and the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector by a wide margin.

Nike shares have lost more than -60% of their value from their all-time peak in November 2021, with a host of self-inflicted steps that have weighed on the outlook. Specifically, the company’s much-needed focus on the direct-to-consumer effort that helped the business gain share during Covid resulted in management failing to nurture the far bigger wholesale channel. On top of this has been the perception of new product innovation and weakness in the Chinese market that have weighed on Nike shares.

Q1 Earnings Estimates Under Pressure

The expectation is that Q1 earnings will be up +6.0% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues, which would follow the +13.7% earnings growth on +5.4% revenue gains in the preceding period.

We have been experiencing a relatively elevated magnitude of negative revisions to estimates for the current period (2025 Q1) even before the more recent signs of weakness in data that drove the recent run of soft guidance from several companies.

As noted earlier, there have been more negative revisions to Q1 estimates since the start of January compared to the comparable periods of the preceding few quarters. Not only is the magnitude of negative revisions to Q1 estimates more pronounced relative to the last few quarters, but it is also more widespread.

Since the start of the period in January, estimates have come down for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines for the Conglomerates, Autos, Basic Materials, Aerospace, Consumer Discretionary, and others.

Medical and Construction are the two sectors whose Q1 estimates have increased since the quarter got underway.

The Tech sector, whose estimates have consistently been positive over the past year, is also suffering negative revisions to Q1 estimates. Optimism about the AI investment cycle suffered a psychological blow following China’s DeepSeek announcement. The resulting shift in market sentiment has weighed on the space ever since, causing the underperformance of AI-focused stocks this year.

You can see this in the performance of Oracle and Adobe, which reported strong quarterly results, but guidance was relatively weak.

A lot will be riding on the evolving earnings expectations for the Tech sector, which has been a pillar of growth over the last two years. The expectation is for Q1 earnings for the sector to be up +12.6% from the same period last year on +10% higher revenues, which will follow the sector’s +26.3% earnings growth in the preceding period.

“Unlike national department stores or global brands, we focus on curating collections tailored to the Palm Beach lifestyle and climate,” Maus said.
“In Palm Beach prices climbed to a point I don’t think anybody would have imagined pre-pandemic,” Cloninger said.
“As far as what they are and what they represent, the last place there should be one of those is Palm Beach.
""Loved by locals and visitors, our mix of boutiques, dining and experiences has become a Palm Beach favorite.","By December 2020, more than 40 vacant storefronts were seen throughout Palm Beach, from Worth Avenue, its vias and adjoining streets, and along South County Road, to the Royal Poinciana Plaza.

To help, the Town Council approved a plan to give restaurants and shops more outdoor space and hired a firm to conduct a retail study.

Five years later, the retail landscape is much different, with almost no retail vacancies in Palm Beach, although there is the usual turnover.

In March 2020, the coronavirus pandemic capsized the world, upended lives, and impacted the retail stores where people shopped.

By December 2020, more than 40 vacant storefronts were seen throughout Palm Beach, from Worth Avenue, its vias and adjoining streets, and along South County Road, to the Royal Poinciana Plaza.

That dire situation followed a March-to-May mandatory shutdown. The 2019-2020 season, referred to as “a season like no other,” was cut short. Supply chain issues affected retail offerings.

Some retailers made it through by pivoting towards more online and phone sales and offering in-store pickup and delivery. Others shut down and never reopened.

The local focus and service Palm Beach retailers are known for, plus the fact that the island has been a famous destination and homebase for the wealthy for decades, helped businesses survive.

“Certainly, we saw a tremendous increase in business during the pandemic. Sure, 2020 was scary, but signs of life returned during the season of 2021, and despite pandemic-themed news stories, we try not to look back,” said Michael Maus, treasurer of the Worth Avenue Association and owner of men’s store Maus & Hoffman.

“Unlike national department stores or global brands, we focus on curating collections tailored to the Palm Beach lifestyle and climate,” Maus said. “Our local approach has always set us apart, and in the years since the pandemic, and the decades before, it has served us well.”

Frank Steinhart, president of the Worth Avenue Association and production manager at shoe store Stubbs & Wootton, said five years after the pandemic began, what strikes him is the avenue's resilience. One standout change, he said, was how retailers introduced concierge-style service during the public health crisis, reached out to clients and delivered goods to their homes.

“Online sales surged amid supply chain chaos and closures, and while that trend lingers, the pendulum has swung decisively back to in-person shopping — people are eager to escape isolation and savor the experiential allure of the avenue,” Steinhart said. “In 2020, we faced a vacancy crisis with over 20 empty storefronts. Today, we’re at full occupancy, with brands clamoring on waitlists for a coveted spot. This journey highlights the enduring strength and adaptability of Worth Avenue.”

Katie Green, who works in sales at Worth Avenue shop DEA Fine Linens, said the business experienced a surge in sales and traffic as people flocked to Palm Beach to nest.

“Fortunately, we avoided supply chain disruptions, with Italian production resuming swiftly. The booming real estate turnover has brought more design professionals to the area, while the rising foot traffic on Worth Avenue reflects Palm Beach’s growing allure. Additionally, the new boat marina has sparked a noticeable uptick in the boating business,” Green said.

John Zoller, senior vice president-retail operations at The Breakers Palm Beach, said the pandemic posed an unprecedented challenge, but the hotel's retail division was supported by The Breakers guiding principles and a renewed appreciation of the importance of adaptability.

“Every decision made was rooted in the organization’s commitment to its team, guests and community, allowing the company to navigate uncertainty with purpose and agility,” Zoller said.

He said the division has seen record sales and strong growth in the newly remodeled boutiques Absolutely Suitable, Guerlain, Match at The Breakers, Polo Ralph Lauren Kids and Signature Shop.

Neiman Marcus was among the higher-profile closures in Palm Beach. It shut down permanently in September 2020. The company declared bankruptcy in May 2020, partially due to the pandemic’s effects.

In May 2020, the Palm Beach Town Council approved a plan to help protect restaurants and retail shops by allowing more outdoor space. Phased re-openings slowly began across the town, with precautions such as sanitizing, mask wearing and social distancing.

In February 2021, to help revive struggling shopping areas, the council hired an urban-growth firm based in Cincinnati to conduct a retail study to help Palm Beach revive struggling shopping areas and streamline town codes.

Five years later, the retail landscape is much different, with almost no retail vacancies in Palm Beach, although there is the usual turnover. The pandemic jump started an upward rise in demand and prices and with the newcomers came increased traffic.

The steady trickle of people moving into Palm Beach and nearby cities over the last few decades became a deluge, bringing higher-income individuals and families from other states and countries.

“The pandemic was an absolutely horrific thing to hit earth,"" said Jeff Cloninger, senior global real estate adviser for Sotheby’s International Realty in Palm Beach. ""My personal view was when it started, I thought it would be similar to after 9-11. Who would dream the pandemic would cause the biggest surge in real estate values that Palm Beach has ever seen?""

But as the pandemic began to ease, the climb in commercial and residential real estate prices was unprecedented.

“In Palm Beach prices climbed to a point I don’t think anybody would have imagined pre-pandemic,” Cloninger said.

After real estate prices climbed from 2004 to 2006, people thought that was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, Cloninger said, but it was not. Today there’s more demand than supply, which created an upward push.

“It has all settled down now. Prices are no longer rising in that double-digit category in residential. One of the most difficult things in the last few years is when someone says, ‘What is my property worth?’ In 2022 and 2023 that was a number on a rocket. It just kept going up and up,” Cloninger said.

“Since the pandemic, it has been a 180 as far as the commercial properties go,” Cloninger said. “I have a number of properties between the Breakers and Worth Avenue. Pre-pandemic, there were vacancies. Since the pandemic, I have probably got five or six qualified prospective tenants for every commercial space I have.”

People moved to Florida because of looser COVID restrictions, the lack of a state income tax, and of course, the weather and the lifestyle. Many were working remotely and considered Palm Beach a relatively secure haven.

By the start of the 2022-23 season, while some Main Streets around the country were still struggling and malls had empty stores, Palm Beach had zero retail vacancies, brokers said, and it was developing even more cachet on a global level.

Merchants characterized the 2022-2023 season as one of their best ever. Customers started buying formal wear again. A number of shops new to Palm Beach debuted, including jewelers David Yurman and Lisa Gozlan, watchmaker IWC Schaffhausen Boutique, luxury fashion brand Hadleigh’s, Mark Russell Custom Clothing, resort wear boutique Cou, and Summit Furniture.

“Florida benefited more than any other state in the country,"" said Orin Rosenfeld of Rosenfeld Realty Advisors in Boca Raton. ""It was a bonanza with all those high-net-worth (individuals) moving here. All those folks needed clothes, furniture and cars. The rest of the country did not fare so well.

“Everyone had a pause for a few months, then people started to move here, and that continued. There is a saying in real estate that retail follows rooftops,” Rosenfeld said.

The permanent closure of Saks Fifth Avenue in Worth Avenue’s Esplanade, set for next month after 99 years on the avenue, was largely due to the downturn experienced by department stores around the country as luxury goods consumers favored exclusive boutiques.

""The department stores have suffered greatly,” Rosenfeld said. “As far as what they are and what they represent, the last place there should be one of those is Palm Beach. People there are looking for very high-end exclusive items. The last thing they want is something everyone around the country can buy.”

When it comes to shoes, clothing, jewelry, home décor and other items featured in many Palm Beach stores, shoppers prefer an in-store experience and the ability to see merchandise, try it on and ask questions before they buy it.

“Our customers value the ability to see, feel, and be personally guided through their purchases, ensuring they receive something truly exceptional,” said Maus, of the Worth Avenue Association.

“Let’s be done talking about the pandemic,” Maus said, and “focus on building our lives and businesses and on being ready for the next macro-level disruption.”

For a major shopping destination such as the Royal Poinciana Plaza, the boost has brought continued success, said Lori Berg, its general manager.

“The Royal Poinciana Plaza keeps growing with more visitors and energy each year,"" Berg said. ""Loved by locals and visitors, our mix of boutiques, dining and experiences has become a Palm Beach favorite. We’re thrilled to keep the momentum going and see what’s next as we unveil more tenants at the Playhouse.”","https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/12/NPBD/82313972007-031225-french-exchange-students-clo-1.jpg?crop=2497,1405,x0,y199&width=2497&height=1405&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-03-17 09:02:37.603134

These compact stores, averaging under 5,000 square feet, will feature full-service pharmacies while limiting general merchandise like snacks, cosmetics, and household items.

The move comes as CVS faces growing competition from retailers like Amazon and Target, along with declining front-end sales.

Additionally, the company has struggled with increased theft and changing consumer shopping habits. By streamlining its offerings, CVS aims to enhance access to essential healthcare services, including prescription medications and immunizations, particularly in communities with limited pharmacy options.

As part of this strategic shift, CVS plans to open about a dozen of these smaller drugstores in select locations throughout 2025. However, this expansion coincides with a broader downsizing effort.

The company will close approximately 270 locations this year, continuing a trend of store closures that has resulted in around 800 locations shutting down over the past three years.

The new pharmacy-focused stores align with CVS’s long-term vision of transitioning into a healthcare-oriented company.

This move follows the company’s acquisitions of healthcare providers like Oak Street Health and Signify Health, reinforcing its commitment to expanding medical services beyond traditional drugstore operations.

Under pressure: Here's why Starbucks' broken supply chain is killing the global coffee giant

Starbucks is saddled with Stone Age supply chain technology, according to Brittain Ladd, a consultant and former Amazon executive.

In a LinkedIn post, he said that he had spent the last week communicating, off the record, with current and former executives, directors and managers from Starbucks, specifically, the individuals responsible for the supply chain part of the business.

He commented: ""I approached the discussions with a preconceived notion: Starbucks former CEOs; Howard Schultz, Kevin Johnson, and Laxman Narasimhan, all failed to invest the necessary capital to design and equip Starbucks with the optimal supply chain.”

“Based on the discussions, I was right. I place the blame for the Stone Age supply chain primarily at the feet of Schultz. Johnson had minimal understanding of the importance of supply chain technology, and Narasimhan was out of his depth the minute he became CEO.""

Over the years, former Chief Supply Chain Officers, VPs and SVPs, had clearly outlined the gaps in Starbucks supply chain related to technology and the sub optimised logistics network, Ladd observed.

""On multiple occasions, funding was promised to close the gaps only to be withdrawn. This forced the supply chain organisation to have to keep Starbucks mediocre supply chain operating without the right software tools, logistics facilities, and budget.""

Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol is making the right moves, Ladd believes. However, he has to do more than proclaim that it takes too long to get products to the stores, and that the stores run out of inventory too frequently. In short, he must invest in the supply chain

Starbucks should replace its antiquated supply chain software with best-in-class tech with a focus on DeepSeek AI, Manus, and Solvoyo. The company is using software from o9 Solutions. ""Why are Starbucks locations still running out of products so frequently? Is it the platform or is Starbucks not using the platform correctly? It’s inexcusable that it can’t keep products stocked in their stores,"" Ladd said.

He added: ""I strongly suggest that Brian Niccol meet with Leo Laranjieria of MIT, to discuss the supply chain that Starbucks must have to meet customer demand and eliminate stores running out of inventory. Dr. Laranjeira should be hired as an advisor reporting directly to Niccol.""

'Out of touch' Tesco under fire for large trolley checkout scales trial at grocery giant's Gateshead store

Tesco is testing out giant trolley checkout scales at its Gateshead Trinity Square Extra store.

The aim is to identify items that customers may have missed or duplicated while using the retailer's Scan as You Shop service, which is exclusive to Clubcard members.

In a LInkedIn post, Lee Coopersmith, Director of Business Development at Cleveron, said: ""Before joining Cleveron, I had the privilege of being a key contributor to this Tesco project, and like many, I find it tough to leave behind something I’ve invested so much effort into (over three years!), especially when I know it’s bound for success. A huge congratulations to Bizerba and Supersmart for making this happen in the UK. Excited to see where this journey takes them next.""

There have been mostly negative reactions to the trial among customers on social media, with one user on Reddit likening the experience to “border control”.

Another quipped: “No Clubcard? Deported!”

Over on X, meanwhile, @BradChuck said: ""Having fallen foul to the @Tesco policy of making you look like a criminal every time you use the scanner to shop, for them to then not belive you and rescan all your shopping again whilst making you look like a shoplifter, these new weight measuring gates are nothing new.""

And @ClareBeveridge commented: ""So now you have to have your trolley weighed after self scan in @Tesco, how much has that cost? You just don’t get it do you? Bring back proper checkout tills.""

Customers fume as Ocado once again cancels grocery delivery orders due to operation issues

Ocado experienced operation issues earlier this month, resulting in a large number of customers having their orders cancelled.

This followed on from issues at Christmas when long booked orders were binned due to major warehouse woes.

Customers have taken to social media to hit out at the online retailer, with one fuming on X: “Abysmal service @Ocado just cancelling orders, no explanation no reason just cancelled, you can rebook for tomorrow with a voucher. Great, but I need the shopping today! No answer from your customer service number either!”

Another commented: “@Ocado this is more than inconvenient. How do I tell my boss I didn’t make it to the mega important meeting because ‘Ocado was late’ lol I will be fired. There should be an option to change delivery to a convenient time or cancel the delivery.”

“Any @ocado orders in the midlands I’ve just spoken to customer service and their warehouse outside Tamworth has had operational issues, 5,000 orders cancelled! What a great start,” another said.

An Ocado customer service representative responded: “We are sorry to hear that your order has been cancelled due to operation issues and due to this your voucher has expired and you are unable to get another delivery. We would love to look into this further, if you could please send us a DM?”

Ocado lays claim to the most advanced grocery automation in the world and is well known in the retail tech world for its customer fulfilment centres (CFCs).

A spokesperson told RTIH: “Unfortunately, we’ve had an operational issue at one of our sites and this has resulted in the cancellation of some customer orders. We’re working hard to get this resolved as soon as possible and we’re really sorry about the inconvenience this has caused to customers.”

Ocado Intelligent Automation announces debut of Porter AMR autonomous pallet moving robot

Ocado Intelligent Automation (OIA), part of Ocado Group, has introduced Porter AMR, a pallet moving AMR that navigates warehouses to automate several warehouse workflows such as cross-docking, bulk-item picking, putaway, and pallet movement.

OIA’s patented system directed software orchestrates each Porter autonomous pallet moving robot–or a whole fleet of them - to reduce travel times and avoid warehouse congestion. Ocado’s Fulfillment Execution System (FES) groups orders to maximise case picking, optimise route plans and reduce steps between picks. Meanwhile, machine learning prioritises and plans pallet stacking intelligently to avoid product damage.

“Porter from OIA automates low value, manual tasks and fosters a more productive workplace by supporting associates, increasing case picking rates, and automating the movement of high volumes of inventory,” says Jeff Larson, Director of Solutions Design for Ocado Mobile Robot System at OIA.

“Companies in third-party logistics, retail, e-commerce, distribution, and healthcare can maximise warehouse productivity and scale operations up or down easily without depending on manual forklifts and expensive certified forklift drivers.”

Reckon.ai powered Carrefour BuyBye interactive fridge deployed at Auderghem, Belgium hypermarket

Carrefour Belgium has developed a new autonomous micro-store concept, Carrefour BuyBye, in association with Reckon.AI, with the aim of tapping into opportunities beyond traditional retail.

The initiative has now seen a trial of an interactive fridge section at an Auderghem hypermarket.

""We’re proud to mark a new milestone with Carrefour Belgium, bringing smart stores to one of the largest hypermarkets in Auderghem - unlocking new revenue streams with ease,"" says Ana Pinto, CEO at Reckon.ai. ""Trusted by Carrefour, our solution is live at HQ, franchised stores, and Publicis, with roll-outs expanding to hospitals, stations, and universities, driving growth and creating value together.""

“We’re excited to see how the latest test at the Auderghem hypermarket unfolds. A huge thank you to all the teams who brought this idea to life. Your dedication is paving the way for a more innovative and effortless shopping experience. This is just the beginning as we continue to build the future for our customers.""

Fashion rules as Vinted CEO Adam Jay once again bags top spot in RTS Retail Disruptors Report

Adam Jay, CEO at controversial fashion resale platform Vinted, has once again taken top spot in the Retail Disruptors & Innovators report, released today by Retail Technology Show.

This is an annual report championing progressive individuals from across the sector, who are driving seismic change across the retail landscape.

Soon to be launched at its Montego-Bay and Waterloo locations, the new segment will stock an elite line of skincare, make-up and perfume brands.
Orá, which represents Fontana’s strategic expansion into the premium beauty segment, the company’s management said aligns with its broader vision that seeks to enhance the retail experience while meeting a growing customer demand for luxury beauty products.
The introduction of the new product line is expected to redefine the beauty retail landscape in Jamaica.
“We recognise the evolving preferences of our customers and the increasing demand for globally renowned beauty brands.","PHARMACEUTICAL retailer Fontana Limited is expecting to push up revenues with the roll-out of its new luxury beauty and self-care Orá by Fontana segment.

Soon to be launched at its Montego-Bay and Waterloo locations, the new segment will stock an elite line of skincare, make-up and perfume brands.

Orá, which represents Fontana’s strategic expansion into the premium beauty segment, the company’s management said aligns with its broader vision that seeks to enhance the retail experience while meeting a growing customer demand for luxury beauty products. The introduction of the new product line is expected to redefine the beauty retail landscape in Jamaica.

Considered an investment in the future of beauty retail, the line aims to strengthen Fontana’s market position, introducing new, high-value categories as it enhances overall brand equity.

“Having already established ourselves as a leader in the beauty industry, this line comes as a natural extension, moving into more luxurious brands that customers will have access to there. We’ve seen a lot of success with much of what we’ve been doing recently as we added some new perfume lines and the customers still have been asking for more, so we’re just trying to meet the demand,” CEO Anne Chang told the Jamaica Observer of the rationale behind Orá’s onboarding.

“We recognise the evolving preferences of our customers and the increasing demand for globally renowned beauty brands. Orá allows us to create a more immersive and elevated shopping experience, reinforcing Fontana’s commitment to innovation and excellence in retail,” she also noted in a company release.

Among the international beauty brands to be sold in the curated portfolio of products are Hermès, Ralph Lauren, Armani, Lancôme, Prada, Viktor & Rolf, and several others. Some of these brands making their debut in Jamaica through Orá, Chang said, will offer beauty enthusiasts access to a wider range of premium products not usually available locally.

“The addition of these products will certainly augur well for revenue growth as they are usually sold at higher price points. Right now a Jimmy Choo perfume in our regular section costs about $13,000 but some of these we’ll be stocking for Orá will be priced from $20000 and upwards,” Chang further said to Sunday Finance.

“We know that as we get to higher price points, products in this segment are not expected to carry mass appeal, which is why we decided to launch first in our two larger and busiest locations as we seek to sort of test the market,” she added.

The roll-out of Orás due to come first for the two city locations precedes a longer-term plan to launch the segment in other stores across the Fontana chain, based on the rate of take-up. The segment will officially go live at the locations in April.

“The one at Waterloo will be housed in-store while that in Fairview will be adjacent to Fontana Fairview in Montego Bay. Both are to form part of Fontana’s larger operation and not to be seen as stand-alone businesses,” Chang said.

On the heels of its recent acquisition of the Monarch pharmacies, Fontana, which now operates approximately seven stores across six parishes, is now busy finalising plans to convert the Monarch outlets into Fontanas.

“We’re currently taking over the four Monarchs as we add these two new segments, which makes it technically about six projects that we have to be focused on right now so we have our hands full. Reconfiguring the Monarchs will take time — as we can’t convert all the stores immediately — so that’s what we’ll really be focused on this year as well as the two Orás that we’re bringing on stream,” the CEO said.

Fontana’s revenues climbing to $4.8 billion up to the end of the six-month December 31 period saw approximately $2.7 billion earned over the three-month period, driven by improved performance across all locations coupled with increases in all key metrics, based on sales by category, scripts, average scripts, and number of transactions. Net profit earned for the six months was $402.5 million and $326.6 million for the quarter. These follow revenues of $8.1 billion in 2024 and profit of $590 million.",https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/jamaicaobserver/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/445389781a1bad0b5fe9690730df2d56.jpg,N,,2025-03-16 12:01:26.700332

The announcement, made late Friday night, revealed plans for liquidation could begin as early as the week of March 17, 2025, subject to court approval. The retail giant aims to complete the process by June 15, 2025.

Despite the grim outlook, Hudson's Bay executives expressed hope for financial assistance from key stakeholders. ""Our team has worked incredibly hard to identify a viable path forward, and our resolve is strengthened by the overwhelming support from customers and associates,"" stated Hudson's Bay president and CEO Liz Rodbell. Unfortunately, discussions around restructuring have failed to produce the necessary capital to avoid this unprecedented step.

On March 15, 2025, employees across Hudson's Bay locations were left reeling from the announcement. Staff members at the Hudson’s Bay Market Mall location in Calgary were seen reflecting solemnly on what this decision means for their futures. One long-time employee lamented, ""It’s pretty emotional for everyone; we were always hopeful."" Many others speculated openly about the company's fate, with thoughts of closing dates looming heavily over the workforce, comprised of about 9,364 staff members nationwide, who may soon find themselves unemployed.

Signs of distress within the company have been apparent for several months now. Reports indicate frequent disruptions, with some outlets struggling to maintain basic services; for example, the sliding glass doors at the north entrance at some locations are nonfunctional due to lack of maintenance. The Bay's troubles have hit home for many; customers and employees alike voiced their heartbreak over the potential loss of such a staple of Canadian culture.

The Hudson's Bay Company's history is steeped deeply within the fabric of Canada; not only has it served as a retail haven, but it's also held nostalgic significance for many citizens. Gary Long and his partner, Darlene Selby, who were at the Market Mall browsing familiar patterned blankets, expressed their sadness over the impending closure. “This chain was integral to our childhood and family traditions; it feels like losing part of our history.”

Hudson's Bay filed for creditor protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) less than two weeks prior to the liquidation announcement, citing significant financial troubles. The company owes approximately $950 million to nearly 1,900 creditors, including notable brands such as Ralph Lauren and Estée Lauder, who are now facing potential losses of their own.

Experts predict the closure will leave significant voids within the shopping mall space, particularly as the Bay has been regarded as one of Canada’s retail anchors. Bruce Winder, a retail analyst, noted, ""It’s going to leave a significant-sized hole; the Bay from a legacy standpoint was an anchor and there isn’t an heir apparent to take their place.” With declining foot traffic and changing consumer habits favoring online shopping, the turn of events for Hudson's Bay seems almost emblematic of larger trends impacting traditional retailers.

Through this turmoil, the affect on employees is palpable, particularly for those who have dedicated decades to the company. Dwayne Gunness, president of Unifor Local 40, expressed concerns about what this means for the employees' pension plans and severance packages. “Some members have put 20, 30 years with the employer, and they fear they may not receive the compensation owed to them,” he pointed out.

Customers have already begun preparing for the worst, with many taking advantage of upcoming liquidation sales to secure mementos. Corey Gordon and his wife, who drove hours from St. Paul on March 14, expressed their commitment to benefit from the Bay's offerings, purchasing items like Hudson's Bay blankets and dishes. For Gordon, this store is steeped with memories: ""My uncle, who was more like a grandfather, was a Winnipegger. I have been coming here all my life.”

The emotional weight carried by shoppers and employees reflects not just the loss of income—it's about losing the heart of communal shopping and social connection often found within such historic establishments. Today, as customers flock to their local Hudson's Bay stores for what may be their final purchases, the sentiment is clear: the closing of Hudson's Bay is more than just another retail business disappearing; it’s the fading of shared experiences woven through generations.

Even amid all the uncertainty, there lies the potential for some restructuring. The company has reportedly secured $16 million of debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing, which could bolster the company’s last-ditch efforts to sidestep total liquidation, providing there is sufficiently positive engagement from landlords and investors. If there is even the smallest glimmer of hope for keeping parts of the company afloat, it would require significant backing.

Retail characterized by brick-and-mortar establishments is at several turning points; Hudson's Bay serves as both the cautionary tale and rallying point for what remains. The very fabric of shopping experience, relationships formed within these walls, brings with it the stark realization—retail is transforming, and the loss of such giants could signify the end of what many longtime shoppers cherished.

With the impending timeline for liquidations—marking the close of what many have regarded as their retail home—there is little time left for customers and employees alike to adjust to the reality of delivering final goodbyes to their beloved Hudson's Bay stores.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/Hu4li5YLGElo-rt-68DRjd4nei0=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2F5a36d26b-d418-4262-9d0e-9e20e81dbda0.jpeg,N,,2025-03-16 13:00:38.987051

Despite its historical significance and long-standing presence within Canadian commerce, the company now faces dire circumstances, attributing the need for liquidation to inadequate financing and persistent economic challenges.

The imminent liquidation plan follows the company's filing for creditor protection with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, which revealed staggering debts of over $950 million owed to various creditors, including landlords, suppliers, and partners like Ralph Lauren and Estee Lauder. The filing highlights significant struggles, reflected by the company's deferment of payments to suppliers, landlords, and service providers for months.

Factors leading to Hudson's Bay's financial turmoil include subdued consumer spending, trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada, and shifts in consumer shopping behavior exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Store closures have not been uncommon for the retailer; the company had previously spun off its U.S. Saks locations to separate entities to address financial issues. By drawing attention to its most profitable divisions, Hudson's Bay attempted to inject needed capital and refocus its operational strategy.

Despite these previous adaptations, Hudson's Bay's predicament became increasingly severe as the flow of revenue continued to deteriorate. Issues peaked recently, as evidenced by landlords denying access to some storefronts due to nonpayment actions, with reports of attempts to seize merchandise from various locations.

The geographical distribution of Hudson's Bay's stores includes 32 locations concentrated in Ontario, where more than half of the workforce resides. Other provinces, such as British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec, also hold strategic stores, signifying the brand's extensive reach and historical constitution of the Canadian retail environment.

Richard Baker, the American businessman and owner of Hudson's Bay through his National Realty and Development Corp., acquired the retailer for $1.1 billion back in 2008. Under his leadership, Hudson's Bay went public, which proved challenging as its stock performance suffered, particularly nearing the onset of the pandemic. Baker has continually asserted the necessity of patience and long-term investment to manifest future value at the intersection of real estate and retail.

Recent events have incited discussions surrounding the nature of economic recovery, with many pointing to Hudson's Bay as indicative of wider issues facing the retail sector, particularly against fast-evolving consumer preferences and online competition. The potential ramifications of the liquidation extend beyond mere closures; it is expected to leave significant vacancies within premium mall spaces, displacing these anchor tenants and indicating shifts within established shopping districts.

While the outlook appears bleak for Hudson's Bay, not all hope is lost. Following its bankruptcy announcement, the company remains committed to exploring refinancing options and appealing for assistance from stakeholders. The responsibility now lies with Hudson's Bay to convince court officials and investors of the viability of its operations moving forward.

With the financial ramifications of this development poised to affect both consumers and employees alike, Canadian shoppers are reminiscing about the brand's legacy and the memories tied to Hudson's Bay. The company has continued to be recognized for its historical contribution to the fabric of Canada, dating back to its founding during the era of fur trading. Its demise would mark the end of significant Canadian retail tradition.

The outcome of the upcoming court ruling will play a pivotal role not only for Hudson's Bay Company but for the many individuals who depend on its economic success. Retail culture, particularly within Canada, is poised for significant changes should the company be unable to navigate through its challenges successfully. With the future of Hudson's Bay hanging precariously, all eyes are set on the legal proceedings and the required actions moving forward.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/thNIE05GpCvwiaXcXCylM1dI9MY=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2F317fed9e-4f4c-4670-8883-a15a1adbd9cd.jpeg,N,,2025-03-16 00:02:02.627473
ID31,Ralph Lauren,2025-03-15 20:32:18+00:00,CityNews Toronto,"Lack of store investment, underlying issues led Hudson's Bay to 'slow death': experts",John Marchesan,,,,,https://toronto.citynews.ca/2025/03/15/hudsons-bay-lack-of-store-investment/,"She said customers likely noticed the lack of investment by Hudson’s Bay into its physical stores, where it wasn’t uncommon to find non-functioning escalators that went unrepaired for long periods of time.
American real estate kingpin Richard Baker’s National Realty and Development Corp. Equity Partners bought Hudson’s Bay in 2008 from the widow of late South Carolina businessman Jerry Zucker for $1.1 billion.
It said that “without an immediate liquidation across retail stores, it is not expected” that Hudson’s Bay would be able to repay its obligations under the financing it did secure.
The sites Hudson’s Bay operates in often contain several floors and make up significantly more square footage than other retailer businesses.
The bulk of the company’s stores are in Ontario, where it has 32 locations and more than half of its employees work.","Analysts say the planned liquidation of Hudson’s Bay will leave a hole in the country’s retail landscape, as Canada’s oldest company prepares to wind down in the coming months unless it can find a last-minute solution.

Retail experts attribute a combination of missteps that led to Friday night’s announcement from Hudson’s Bay, which said it would begin liquidating its entire business as soon as next week, pending court approval.

The department store chain that dates back to 1670 and now spans 80 stores said it has been forced toward a full liquidation because “exhaustive” efforts haven’t turned up the financing it needs to keep at least some of its empire alive.

A closure of the entire business, which is planned pending a court appearance set for Monday, would mean job losses for 9,364 employees the company has in Canada across its Hudson’s Bay stores, as well as three Saks Fifth Avenue stores and 13 Saks Off 5th locations it owns through a licensing agreement.

The liquidation process would wrap up in June.

“It’s really, really sad, because of how many people are going to be impacted because of this,” said Liza Amlani, co-founder of the Retail Strategy Group.

“It is an iconic brand. It’s important to Canadians, and there will be a gap in the market if The Bay completely disappears.”

But Amlani said the writing had been on the wall for some time.

She said customers likely noticed the lack of investment by Hudson’s Bay into its physical stores, where it wasn’t uncommon to find non-functioning escalators that went unrepaired for long periods of time. Amlani also pointed to several stores in the Vancouver area that temporarily closed last summer related to problems with air-conditioning systems.

She said another problem the company ran into in recent years was that its stores’ hours didn’t always align with that of the malls where they are located.

“Considering a department store’s original function is to be an anchor store — a gateway to the mall, let’s say — the fact that the store hours were different, and that has continued to today, that is absolutely an issue,” said Amlani.

“In tourist destinations like the Eaton Centre, for example, if the store is closed and the mall is open, that is a problem. That is something that the customer will notice and then they’ll tell other customers.”

Though the situation looks bleak, the company said it remains optimistic it can drum up capital and find a solution with key stakeholders, particularly its landlord partners, to avoid a full shutdown.

“Our team has worked incredibly hard to identify a viable path forward, and our resolve is strengthened by the overwhelming support from customers and associates who have shared heartfelt stories about Hudson’s Bay and what our stores have meant to them, their families, and their communities across the generations,” said Hudson’s Bay president and CEO Liz Rodbell in a statement on Friday night.

While the company’s coast-to-coast footprint and its 17th century fur trade origins have made it a quintessential part of the fabric of Canada, it has been led by Americans for several decades.

American real estate kingpin Richard Baker’s National Realty and Development Corp. Equity Partners bought Hudson’s Bay in 2008 from the widow of late South Carolina businessman Jerry Zucker for $1.1 billion.

That marked “the point at which the company began its slow death,” said Joanne McNeish, an associate professor at Toronto Metropolitan University specializing in marketing.

“Investment firms are like house flippers … A house flipper rarely deals with the underlying business issues,” she said in an email.

“Investment companies don’t allow the management team to run businesses. Rather they take their profit, sell on the problems to the next company or break up the company to sell off its assets.”

Baker took the company public in 2012 and then turned it private again with a takeover bid that had to be boosted twice to earn shareholder approval in the weeks before Canada was hit with COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

Shareholders were difficult to appease in part because Baker presided over HBC while its stock was dropping — but many thought the company still carried immense value in its real estate.

“If we look at the Bay, I speculate that the management team has not been allowed to make the financial and effort investments in running the business for success for the past 17 years,” said McNeish.

“The result is a stagnation in the presentation of the company, and limited the changes that might have allowed the company to continue to be a strong competitor in the retail landscape.”

In documents filed with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on Friday, Hudson’s Bay said it plans to sell off its assets over the coming months, pending court approval, which could include an auction process if it receives multiple qualified bids.

The company said a store-by-store liquidation is necessary because it has only secured “limited” debtor-in-possession financing — a form of capital companies can seek for restructuring purposes after they make creditor protection filings.

It said that “without an immediate liquidation across retail stores, it is not expected” that Hudson’s Bay would be able to repay its obligations under the financing it did secure.

Given the company’s “limited liquidity,” it wants to conclude the liquidation process by June 15, Jennifer Bewley, the chief financial officer for Hudson’s Bay’s parent company, said in an affidavit filed in court Friday.

The company’s plea for help comes roughly a week after it laid bare its financial struggles in a creditor protection application. The documents said it was facing financial struggles because of subdued consumer spending, trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada, and post-pandemic drops in downtown store traffic.

The filings show the company owes more than $950 million to 26 pages’ worth of listed creditors: landlords, suppliers and other partners, including fashion heavyweights Ralph Lauren, Chanel, Columbia Sportswear, Diesel and Estee Lauder.

On Saturday, the union representing approximately 320 workers at the company’s Windsor, Kitchener and Sherwood Gardens stores, and its Toronto e-commerce warehouse, called on Hudson’s Bay “to uphold its legal obligations to workers” and provide “clear communication” about potential store closures, layoffs and severance protections.

“HBC must act in good faith by ensuring workers receive the wages, benefits, and severance they are entitled to under their collective agreements,” Unifor national president Lana Payne said in a statement.

“Workers’ livelihoods are on the line — they’re rightfully concerned and deserve full transparency from HBC.”

A full liquidation in Canada would also leave anchor tenant spaces in malls and prestige real estate in high-traffic shopping districts in need of filling. The sites Hudson’s Bay operates in often contain several floors and make up significantly more square footage than other retailer businesses.

The bulk of the company’s stores are in Ontario, where it has 32 locations and more than half of its employees work.

But CVS shoppers don't need to worry, as the retailer is planning to open smaller stores with fewer products, targeting locations with higher traffic.

The pharmacy giant blames changing consumer needs, buying habits, and population shifts for the closures.

But CVS shoppers don't need to worry, as the retailer is planning to open smaller stores with fewer products, targeting locations with higher traffic.

This comes after 900 store closures between 2022 and 2024, leaving CVS with 9,144 pharmacies across the U.S.

A spokesperson said: “Even after the realignment work, 85% of people in the U.S. will still live within 10 miles of a CVS Pharmacy.”

While CVS hasn't released a list of the stores set to close, locations with overlap or low footfall are expected to be the first one to go.

No timeline has been given yet either.

But it’s not all bad news as CVS is still expanding.

The company plans to open 30 new locations this year, including inside Target stores, and has added 100 new locations since 2022.

It comes after CVS confirmed it would be cutting around 2,900 jobs as bosses revealed they will be investing in technology.

the cuts will primarily impact those within the corporate sector, per the CBS affiliate WPRI-TV.

Mike DeAngelis, a spokesperson, explained that the job losses are a consequence of changing shopping trends, expectations, and disruption.

The cuts are part of a $2 billion cost-cutting drive intended to reduce business expenses.

Chiefs will also look at ways to boost efficiency within the company.

Execs have warned how vital it is for the company to remain competitive.

They also tried to give a reassuring message to shoppers.

""The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies, and distribution centers,"" said DeAngelis.

Meanwhile, a CVS executive has admitted that one of the store’s policies to combat theft has not been welcomed among all shoppers.

Bosses at the drugstore chain have resorted to locking items away in cabinets.

CVS is not alone in implementing the measure as locked cabinets are a feature in Walmart, Walgreens and Target stores.

And, the measure has not been appreciated by all shoppers.

Tilak Mandadi, the executive vice president of ventures at CVS Health and its chief digital, data, analytics and technology officer, admitted the anti-theft tool had proved unpopular.

“People really, really dislike locked cabinets,” he told the Wall Street Journal.

""Foot traffic has improved compared to the declines seen last summer, indicating that elements of the 'Back to Starbucks' strategy and improving the in-store experience are gaining traction,” he said.","Starbucks wants to brew up a more comfortable environment with additional seating, plentiful power outlets and free coffee refills.

The coffee chain has also recently simplified and refreshed its menu to ""help reduce wait times, improve quality and consistency, and align with our core identity as a coffee company,"" Starbucks told USA TODAY in a statement last month. Earlier this year, the company also reversed its open-door policy regarding restrooms, now requiring people order something from the menu to use the restroom or hang out in the store.

All of these adjustments are part of the ""Back to Starbucks"" strategy, instituted by Brian Niccol, the former Chipotle CEO who left to become Starbucks' chief executive in September 2024.

“We’re working hard to ensure our coffeehouses have the right vibe,"" Niccol said Wednesday during a meeting with shareholders. ""We want to invite customers in, showcase our great coffee, provide a comfortable place to stay, and make them feel like their visit was time well spent.”

Starbucks wants to regain its 'third place' status

The idea of Starbucks as a ""third place,"" a destination beyond home and work, isn't new; it's a philosophy also touted by former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. However, the expansion of mobile ordering and grab and go pickup has made coffee shops sometimes feel more like a waystation.

Starbucks hopes to strengthen and regain its connection with customers. “I'm happy to say the third place is alive and well. It's as needed as it ever was,” Niccol said. ""We're working hard to ensure our coffee houses have the right vibe. We want to invite customers in, showcase our great coffee, provide a comfortable place to stay, and make them feel like their visit was time well spent.

For instance, Starbucks is testing new store designs at ""select locations across the U.S.,"" Niccol said. At the same time, stores have brought back condiment bars and serving in-store coffee in ceramic mugs, as well as having baristas write on cups with Sharpies, he said.

""Imagine coffee houses that are comfortable and warm with expanded seating options, power outlets, and abundant food displays,"" he said. ""Stores with more separation between the café and mobile order experience, featuring new risers and dedicated pickup shelves in select locations to create an intuitive handoff, and cafes anchored by a redesigned espresso bar that adds a sense of theater to the experience and enhances the connection between our baristas and our customers.""

The company is also setting a goal of delivering ""a high-quality beverage in four minutes or less with a moment of connection,"" Niccol said.

'Back to Starbucks' strategy 'gaining traction'

Niccol is looking to turn a sales tide at the coffee houses. Starbucks reported comparable sales down 2% in the U.S. and worldwide in the 2024 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 29, 2024. And global comparable sales fell 4% in the first quarter of the 2025 fiscal year, which ended Dec. 29, 2024, the company reported.

Starbucks isn't alone in seeing a year-over-year decline in visitation trends in February, said R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, which estimates visits to locations by tracking millions of devices and using machine learning. That trend has hit many restaurants ""amid economic uncertainty and unfavorable weather conditions,"" he said.

But Starbucks' efforts may be working, Hottovy said. ""Foot traffic has improved compared to the declines seen last summer, indicating that elements of the 'Back to Starbucks' strategy and improving the in-store experience are gaining traction,” he said.

“These powerful experiences remind us why we must continue to pursue every possible opportunity to secure the necessary support from key landlords and other stakeholders to save The Bay.”

The department store chain dates back to 1670 and now spans 80 stores.

One week later, the company finds itself in much more dire shape, saying its “exhaustive” efforts haven’t turned up the financing it needs.

Hudson’s Bay laid the groundwork for its creditor protection case when it spun its U.S. Saks locations off into a separate entity last year after it purchased luxury department stores Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, essentially saving them from the impending closures now set to engulf HBC in Canada.

A full liquidation in Canada wouldn’t just plunge a large portion of the country’s retail workforce into unemployment but would also leave anchor tenant spaces in malls and prestige real estate in high-traffic shopping districts in need of filling.

The sites Hudson’s Bay operates in often contain several floors and make up significantly more square footage than other retailer businesses.

The bulk of the company’s stores are in Ontario, where it has 32 locations and more than half of its employees work. B.C. hosts 16, Alberta and Quebec each have 13 and Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan have two per province.

Saks Fifth Avenue’s Canadian sites are split between Ontario and Alberta and Saks Off 5th has stores in Ontario, B.C., Alberta, Quebec and Manitoba.

While the company’s coast-to-coast footprint and its 17th century fur trade origins have made it a quintessential part of the fabric of Canada, it has been led by Americans for several decades now.

American real estate kingpin Richard Baker’s National Realty and Development Corp. Equity Partners bought Hudson’s Bay in 2008 from the widow of late South Carolina businessman Jerry Zucker for $1.1 billion.

Baker took the company public in 2012 and then turned it private again with a takeover bid that had to be boosted twice to earn shareholder approval in the weeks before Canada was hit with COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

Shareholders were difficult to appease in part because Baker presided over HBC while its stock was dropping — but many thought the company still carried immense value in its real estate.

When he gained their approval, he admitted the brand had work to do.

“It will take patient capital and a long-term view to fully unleash HBC’s potential at the intersection of real estate and retail,” he said in March 2020.

A handful of store closures and piecemeal layoffs over the last two years suggest that unleashing that potential was not easy as rivals like fellow Canadian department store Simon’s expanded and online giants such as Amazon gobbled up sales.

During the Wednesday meeting, Niccol was also asked about a lawsuit filed against Starbucks in February by the state of Missouri.

Corporate layoffs In late February, Starbucks laid off 1,100 corporate employees.
As part of the company turnaround, Starbucks was “creating smaller, more nimble teams,” he said in a letter to employees.","Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol is focused on bringing the company back to its roots. During his first shareholders meeting this week he repeated two of the concepts guiding his changes: a simpler company, and feedback from customers and workers.

Some of the plans are already in motion. In Starbucks cafes, he’s dropped menu items. He’s created delineation between “to-go” and “for here” customers, the latter of whom get their coffee served in ceramic mugs. Niccol also announced sweeping layoffs in an effort to cut the corporate payroll.

But the company is dealing with a frustrated union representing its baristas, attacks on its diverse hiring practices and criticism for allowing its CEO to be based away from the Seattle headquarters.

Diversity

Corporations are facing public relations battles over diversity, equity and inclusion policies, with the Trump administration as one of the more prominent antagonists. Those skirmishes have slipped into board rooms and the courts.

Another Seattle-area retail company, Costco, faced a shareholders proposal earlier this year that targeted its DEI policies. The National Center for Public Policy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based conservative think tank, pitched a proposal that if approved would have had Costco probe its DEI practices for legal risks. Costco shareholders rejected it.

Starbucks faced a proposal this week from a shareholder represented by Houston-based financial adviser Patron Partners. In short, they asked Starbucks to depoliticize its charitable giving, Patron Partners managing partner Rick Figueroa said during the meeting on behalf of the shareholder.

Through its Giving Match program, Starbucks matches any financial donations made by its employees, and hours they’ve volunteered. It has a few stipulations, as only 501(c)(3) public charities and registered charities in Canada qualify. The company also does not allow donations to professional and political organizations or those listed on the Southern Poverty Law Center hate group list.

The proposal requested an analysis on how Starbucks’ “contributions impact its risks related to discrimination against individuals based on their speech or religious exercise.” It also opposed Starbucks’ corporate partnership with the Human Rights Campaign, a pro-LGBTQ+ organization.

Leading up to the meeting, Starbucks’ board urged shareholders to vote against the proposal. It was overwhelmingly voted down.

During the Wednesday meeting, Niccol was also asked about a lawsuit filed against Starbucks in February by the state of Missouri. The lawsuit claims the company’s hiring practices are discriminatory. Starbucks has said the allegations were inaccurate and that the company’s hiring practices are inclusive and competitive.

“I think it’s great that we reflect the diversity of our customers and we reflect the diversity of our team members and partners that are in every single one of our stores,” Niccol said. “Diversity is going to continue to be a key strength of our business and frankly, helps us connect with our customers at another level.”

Union contract

On Tuesday, six union-represented Starbucks locations staged walkouts, including one in Seattle. Baristas demanded a finalized contract. In December, unionized baristas launched strikes during the holiday shopping season, including at the Roastery in Seattle.

Niccol was asked during the meeting when Starbucks would finalize a contract with the union. He handed the question off to the company’s chief partner officer, Sara Kelly.

Kelly said the company and the union were committed to working with a mediator, and that the two parties have been at the table for nine months “making great progress.” She did not say when she expects a contract to be inked.

“That mediator is supporting us as we look to really negotiate a foundational framework that will serve for single-store contracts,” Kelly said.

In a news release Tuesday, Michelle Eisen with the Starbucks Workers United union bargaining committee called Starbucks’ most recent offer pitiful.

“We are still without a first contract from a company who can certainly afford to do right by its workers,” said Eisen, a Buffalo, N.Y.-based barista who’s been with Starbucks for 15 years.

Corporate layoffs

In late February, Starbucks laid off 1,100 corporate employees. Hundreds of workers based in the company’s Sodo neighborhood headquarters were affected.

In the announcement, Niccol called it a necessary change to position Starbucks for success. As part of the company turnaround, Starbucks was “creating smaller, more nimble teams,” he said in a letter to employees. The layoffs and elimination of hundreds of open roles were meant to target redundancy.

Niccol expanded on the rationale for the layoffs on Wednesday when asked. He said the company was focused on accountability and efficiency.

“I think it’s really important the corporate structure is set up to first and foremost serve the store, support the customer experience and support the partner experience,” Niccol said. “This was all about simplifying some complexity, getting clarity of who’s responsible for what.”

Layoffs weren’t the only part of Niccol’s corporate restructuring. The company is ratcheting up its in-person policy. Employees are only required to be in the office three days per week, but future roles will be based in Seattle or Toronto, signaling a departure from remote status options.

The company is also revoking remote status permission for executives at the vice president level and above.

Corporate aircraft

Niccol is based in Newport Beach, Calif. In Starbucks’ offer letter to him, the company said he wouldn’t be forced to move to the Seattle headquarters and would have use of the corporate jet for his travel to Seattle, other office locations and stores, according to an August regulatory filing. He’s also eligible for up to $250,000 worth of personal travel per year on the company’s aircraft.

In response to a question about his work and travel arrangements and any environment impacts, Niccol defended his use of the jet.

“Obviously Starbucks serves customers in over 88 markets,” he said. “The CEO, in this case myself, needs to be where the business needs to be.”

Starbucks’ chief legal officer, Brad Lerman, said the company is focused on mitigating any environmental impact from Niccol’s travel. He said Starbucks purchases low-emission fuel and aircraft that are more efficient.

“These are things that the board looks at, that management looks at carefully, and it’s carefully governed,” Lerman said.

Last year, Niccol incurred $72,398 in expenses related to his use of Starbucks’ aircraft traveling between Newport Beach and Seattle, according to a Jan. 24 regulatory filing. Another $19,367 in expenses were related to his personal use of the jet.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/03142025_tzr_tzr_133116.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-03-15 13:03:36.736488

The court proceedings set for March 17, 2025, will be pivotal, with expectations for Hudson’s Bay to apply for extensions and possibly clarify store closure strategies.","Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), Canada's oldest retailer, is on the brink of closure as it prepares to begin liquidations as early as next week. The announcement came late on Friday, March 14, 2025, putting over 9,000 jobs at risk across its operations. Origins of this predicament trace back to the company's longstanding financial struggles, which have worsened significantly amid subdued consumer spending and shifting market dynamics.

Founded in 1670, HBC operates 80 department stores across Canada, and its proposed liquidation threatens 9,364 employees associated with Hudson’s Bay stores as well as its three Saks Fifth Avenue and 13 Saks Off 5th locations. The company recently filed for creditor protection to stave off immediate bankruptcy, but it announced last week the serious difficulties it faces.

“The closure of the company could become inevitable,” stated Jennifer Bewley, chief financial officer for Hudson’s Bay’s parent company, during her court filings. The company, which owes over $950 million to creditors ranging from Ralph Lauren and Chanel to Estée Lauder, admitted needing to defer payments to vendors and landlords for several months due to its dire financial standing.

The initial creditor protection application was made on March 7, 2025, as HBC grappled with debts and operational costs, and highlighted the significant impact of trade tensions, reduced consumer spending, and declining downtown traffic post-COVID-19. Central to the company’s restructuring strategy is the urgent need for more liquidity to avoid total liquidation.

Hudson’s Bay continues to seek support from key stakeholders, particularly landlords, as it attempts to raise necessary capital. CEO Liz Rodbell expressed determination, stating, “Our team has worked incredibly hard to identify a viable path forward, and our resolve is strengthened by the overwhelming support from customers and associates who have shared heartfelt stories about Hudson’s Bay.”

Despite these optimistic words, the outlook looks bleak. Due to limited debtor-in-possession financing available for restructuring, HBC acknowledged the imperative of moving to store-by-store liquidations.

Richard Baker, who purchased HBC for $1.1 billion back in 2008, took the company public and then private again, is no stranger to challenging circumstances. Since the COVID-19 pandemic struck, Baker's leadership has been closely tied to efforts meant to revive the company against competition from industry rivals as well as online giants like Amazon, which have gained significant market share.

Should Hudson’s Bay proceed with liquidation, it would not only lead to massive job losses but also leave substantial retail spaces vacant, impacting high-traffic shopping centers. Currently, the province of Ontario hosts the majority of HBC’s operations, with 32 stores, followed by British Columbia with 16, and both Alberta and Quebec with 13 stores each.

Adding to the complexity of the situation, HBC's financial documents detail roughly $920,000 owed to Vancouver Island creditors, with significant sums due to Central Walk—amounting to about $860,000—associated with mall properties where Hudson’s Bay stores operate. The Kingdom of British Columbia itself is owed approximately $2.88 million and is likely to prioritize loan recoveries over small unsecured creditors.

Creditors on Vancouver Island include AllFire Access Pro, owed around $30,940, and Haven Security, which is awaiting $19,400. The sentiment among these local businesses echoes the growing concern about HBC's solvency and operating future. Both creditors have noted delays and non-payments from HBC for over 18 months, severely impacting their operations.

Charles Schell, finance professor at Vancouver Island University, remarked on the situation: “Small unsecured creditors will likely not see any money from Hudson’s Bay as insolvency managers wind down operations.” His analysis indicates secured creditors, such as investment firms and banks, will take precedence during the debt resolution process.

The court proceedings set for March 17, 2025, will be pivotal, with expectations for Hudson’s Bay to apply for extensions and possibly clarify store closure strategies. While the fate of its numerous locations remains uncertain, the hope is for some path to maintain operations as the retail giant grapples with its historical significance and modern challenges.

HBC's long history, entwined with Canada’s early colonial days, has solidified it as more than just a retailer but also as part of the nation's fabric. The impending liquidation delivers stark reminders of how much the retail industry is changing and how traditional business models are under pressure, forcing companies like Hudson’s Bay to rethink their strategies dramatically.

Hong Kong: Chinese food and beverage brands are gaining ground across Southeast Asia, offering alternatives to big name American chains and expanding Beijing’s commercial and cultural influence in neighbouring economies.

The Chinese beverage giant Mixue Group has become the world’s largest F&B chain by number of outlets, overtaking Starbucks and McDonald’s. The company, whose brand name Mixue Bingcheng means “Honey Snow Ice City”, in Chinese, is capitalising on the region-wide sweet tooth with affordable offerings of ice cream, coffee and bubble tea drinks.

“Even on social media like TikTok and others, there is a joke that any empty shophouse would soon turn into a Mixue store,” Rahma Yuliana said, referring to a popular saying in Indonesia, where Mixue has more than 2,600 outlets.

The single mother, who runs an online business, takes her daughter for afterschool treats that won’t drain her wallet, such as a cup of brown sugar milk tea that costs USD 1.10, about one-third cheaper than similar offerings by rival Taiwanese tea chain Chatime. An ice cream sells for as little as 50 cents, undercutting McDonald’s.

As of September, the Mixue Group had over 45,000 stores carrying its Mixue tea drinks, ice creams and Lucky Cup coffee products, more than the store numbers of Starbucks and McDonald’s, industry analysts reported. About 40,000 of those are in China.

More broadly, by December, Chinese F&B brands had opened over 6,100 outlets in Southeast Asia, Singapore-headquartered research firm Momentum Works reported. India and Vietnam account for roughly two-thirds, while there are relatively more Chinese brands in Singapore and Malaysia, which have sizable Chinese-speaking populations.

Nearly all of Mixue’s stores are franchises that the company supplies with ingredients for drinks like Creamy Mango Boba, Mango Oats Jasmine Tea and Coconut Jelly Milk Tea.

Apart from Mixue, other market stars include hotpot giant Haidilao, Fish With You sauerkraut fish restaurants, and well-known beverage brands such as Luckin Coffee, Heytea and Chagee.

Mixue’s shares have doubled from their IPO price since their March 3 trading debut in Hong Kong.

Momentum Works CEO Jianggan Li said Chinese businesses are actively seeking new growth in Southeast Asia after facing fierce competition in their home market.

The push by food and drink retailers has raised awareness that China has more to offer than just cheap electronics. The companies are well-equipped, using automation to enhance their efficiency, and adept at online marketing, Li said.

Big Western brands sometimes take a long time to find local partners and develop long-term plans. The Chinese F&B companies are “much more impatient,” he said.

In Thailand’s capital Bangkok, Chinese entrepreneur Siya Han has invested over USD 1.37 million in 12 Mixue stores and about 10 other outlets selling spicy broth bowls, sauerkraut fish and fried chicken steaks in about six years.

Outlets in shopping malls take time to recover costs due to huge rent deposits, she said, but her other outlets typically break even within six months to a year, excluding their lease guarantees. “If you open Chinese restaurants slowly, you can’t survive,” she said.

In the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, Chinese sauerkraut fish chain Fish With You vice president Liu Liujun also spotted opportunity in Southeast Asia’s large ethnic Chinese population and growing economies.

The brand’s USD 2,35,000 investment in one of its Malaysian outlets paid off in just nine months, with lines out the door almost daily, said Liu, who oversees the company’s overseas expansion across the region.

A customer, Victoria Kovalan said the new Chinese brands made it easier for her to try new cuisines. “It’s opened up our palates,” she said, referring to the popularity of Sichuan hotpots, known for their spicy flavours.

Vietnamese student Nguyen Thu Hoài in Hanoi initially was sceptical about Mixue as a Chinese brand but has become a regular customer, she said, won over by its affordability and better-than-expected quality.

The expansion of Chinese food and beverage brands is part of a broader trend where Chinese goods are no longer seen as merely cheap but as having real value, said Gordon Mathews, a professor of anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Recalling the cultural influence from McDonald’s global expansion, Mathews said he visited its first outlet in southern China’s economic hub of Guangzhou in the 1990s, where a clerk told him, “I want to go to America.”

If Chinese food brands exploded worldwide, they might have that influence, though the impact remains to be seen, he said. “China does have an uphill struggle to obtain soft power, but it’s doing an excellent job with its products,” he said.",https://media.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Mixue.jpg,N,,2025-03-15 16:04:01.677127

The sites Hudson’s Bay operates in often contain several floors and make up significantly more square footage than other retailer businesses.
American real estate kingpin Richard Baker’s National Realty and Development Corp. Equity Partners bought Hudson’s Bay in 2008 from the widow of late South Carolina businessman Jerry Zucker for $1.1 billion.
“It will take patient capital and a long-term view to fully unleash HBC’s potential at the intersection of real estate and retail,” he said in March 2020.","Though the situation looks bleak, the company is holding out hope for a Hail Mary. It said it remains optimistic that it can drum up capital and find a solution with key stakeholders, particularly its landlord partners, to avoid a full shutdown.

“Our team has worked incredibly hard to identify a viable path forward, and our resolve is strengthened by the overwhelming support from customers and associates who have shared heartfelt stories about Hudson’s Bay and what our stores have meant to them, their families, and their communities across the generations,” Hudson’s Bay president and CEO Liz Rodbell.

“These powerful experiences remind us why we must continue to pursue every possible opportunity to secure the necessary support from key landlords and other stakeholders to save The Bay.”

The company’s plea for help comes roughly a week after it laid bare its financial struggles in a creditor protection application it made with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

In its application, Hudson’s Bay said it was facing financial struggles because of subdued consumer spending, trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada, and post-pandemic drops in downtown store traffic.

The filings show the company owes more than $950 million to 26 pages’ worth of listed creditors: landlords, suppliers and other partners, including fashion heavyweights Ralph Lauren, Chanel, Columbia Sportswear, Diesel and Estee Lauder.

Jennifer Bewley, the chief financial officer for Hudson’s Bay’s parent company, said in a court filing made on March 7 that the business had to defer certain payments to such companies for many months because it was having so much trouble making payments to landlords, service providers and vendors.

The situation was so severe that she said a landlord “unlawfully locked” Hudson’s Bay out of a store located in Sydney, N.S. and a team of bailiffs attempted to seize merchandise from another location it runs in Sherway Gardens, a suburban Toronto mall.

The March 7 filing was not meant to be the precursor to the closure of the business because Hudson’s Bay was intent to on keeping the company alive and as much of its sprawling footprint operational as possible.

One week later, the company finds itself in much more dire shape. It said the store-by-store liquidation is necessary because it has only secured “limited” debtor-in-possession financing – a form of capital companies can seek for restructuring purposes after they make creditor protection filings.

Hudson’s Bay laid the groundwork for its creditor protection case when it spun its U.S. Saks locations off into a separate entity last year after it purchased luxury department stores Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, essentially saving them from the impending closures now set to engulf HBC in Canada.

A full liquidation in Canada wouldn’t just plunge a large portion of the country’s retail workforce into unemployment but would also leave anchor tenant spaces in malls and prestige real estate in high-traffic shopping districts in need of filling.

The sites Hudson’s Bay operates in often contain several floors and make up significantly more square footage than other retailer businesses.

The bulk of the company’s stores are in Ontario, where it has 32 locations and more than half of its employees work. B.C. hosts 16, Alberta and Quebec each have 13 and Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan have two per province.

Saks Fifth Avenue’s Canadian sites are split between Ontario and Alberta and Saks Off 5th has stores in Ontario, B.C., Alberta, Quebec and Manitoba.

While the company’s coast-to-coast footprint and its 17th century fur trade origins have made it a quintessential part of the fabric of Canada, it has been led by Americans for several decades now.

American real estate kingpin Richard Baker’s National Realty and Development Corp. Equity Partners bought Hudson’s Bay in 2008 from the widow of late South Carolina businessman Jerry Zucker for $1.1 billion.

Baker took the company public in 2012 and then turned it private again with a takeover bid that had to be boosted twice to earn shareholder approval in the weeks before Canada was hit with COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

Shareholders were difficult to appease in part because Baker presided over HBC while its stock was dropping – but many thought the company still carried immense value in its real estate.

When he gained their approval, he admitted the brand had work to do.

“It will take patient capital and a long-term view to fully unleash HBC’s potential at the intersection of real estate and retail,” he said in March 2020.

A handful of store closures and piecemeal layoffs over the last two years suggest that unleashing that potential was not easy as rivals like fellow Canadian department store Simon’s expanded and online giants such as Amazon gobbled up sales.

At Publicis Groupe, quiet determination took hold.
While their core Coca-Cola business, spanning creative and production remained intact, losing the North American media account was a notable hit.
Meanwhile, Publicis Groupe celebrated.","In Atlanta’s quiet conference rooms, Coca-Cola’s headquarters became a battleground of digital strategy. At stake was the North American media planning and buying account, valued at an estimated USD 785 million in 2024 alone.

WPP had long ruled its $4 billion global account with Coca-Cola as a symbol of dominance. But three and a half years later, change was brewing beneath the surface.

Publicis Groupe, the former global runner-up, hadn’t stood still. Instead, it had strengthened its media portfolio, securing major wins with Pfizer and Hershey’s while mastering the shifting digital landscape. Now, with Coca-Cola’s closed-door review underway, Publicis saw a prime opportunity to take the lead.

The review was a high-stakes game of data, strategy, and persuasion. WPP, banking on its long-standing partnership, pitched continuity and global integration. Publicis, on the other hand, emphasised innovation, data-driven insights, and a localised strategy tailored to North America’s distinct market dynamics.

Tension ran high at WPP’s GroupM, where the review loomed large. As the backbone of WPP’s growth, any loss could shake the organisation, especially amid investor concerns over weak financials.

At Publicis Groupe, quiet determination took hold. Fuelled by ambition, their teams fine-tuned their strategy, highlighting proprietary data platforms and a deep understanding of North America’s fragmented media landscape.

The verdict, when it came, marked a shift. In a worded statement, Coca-Cola named Publicis Groupe a ""complementary partner"" for its US and Canada media business while reaffirming WPP as its ""only global marketing partner,"" with renewal talks in progress. Yet, the underlying message was unmistakable - a strategic transformation was in motion.

For WPP, the loss was a setback. While their core Coca-Cola business, spanning creative and production remained intact, losing the North American media account was a notable hit. Beyond the financial impact, it was a reminder that even the strongest partnerships weren’t untouchable.

Meanwhile, Publicis Groupe celebrated. The win validated their strategic investments and reinforced their media expertise. The USD 785 million account marked a major expansion in North America, strengthening their client portfolio, boosting confidence, even prompting an upward revision of their 2024 earnings forecast.

The impact of Coca-Cola’s decision sent ripples through the advertising world, signalling a shifting landscape where data, technology, and measurable results took centre stage. Established partnerships were no longer a given, and new contenders were rising.

Beyond strategy and numbers, the move highlighted the human element - relentless agency teams, the high-stakes decisions of executives and the vision driving change.

Companies typically move to edge computing to improve efficiency, plus it's often cheaper.
According to Rice, sensors are being installed at locations on the kitchen equipment that will instantaneously feed information to the edge computing system.
Some fans have already clapped back about the targeted promotions not working due to broken McFlurry machines.
Won't matter anyway, the machine is broken..."" a customer fumed on X. McDonald's hasn't disclosed how much the tech updates cost.","MCDONALD'S is in the middle of making some massive updates, and some are likely music to customers' ears.

Each of its over 43,000 locations is getting improved technology this year to help efficiency and the customer experience.

Some of that tech revolves around kitchen equipment like McFlurry machines, according to what Brian Rice, chief information officer at McDonald's, told the Wall Street Journal earlier this month.

The ice cream makers are infamous for breaking down frequently and have gotten a flood of complaints from consumers in recent years.

It's so known that Wendy's even made a jab at McDonald's for it during a marketing campaign in October.

Last February, a longtime fan complained about the espresso machines being broken at their local McDonald's in a post on X, and others were quick to call out the McFlurry machines as well.

CONTINUED CRITIQUES

""Try getting an ice cream cone!"" a peeved diner exclaimed.

""Just went to McDonald's and the mcflurry machine is broken. I'm going to crash my car now,"" another fumed earlier this year.

""Can I get a McFlurry or is the machine still broken?"" a third joked.

Even so, Rise assured that the tech advancements would eliminate the McFlurry machine issue and help McDonald's stay on top of other maintenance issues and resolve them quickly.

He also told WSJ that the company found that restaurants were becoming ""very stressful"" for workers due to overwhelmed and outdated systems, causing incorrect orders or broken machines.

""We have customers at the counter, we have customers at our drive-through, couriers coming in for delivery, delivery at curbside — that's a lot to deal with for our crew,"" he explained.

""Technology solutions will alleviate the stress.""

Pursuit of these improvements has been underway since the end of 2023, when McDonald's sought to implement Google Cloud for edge computing at its restaurants.

Edge computing allows McDonald's to look at data from its kitchen equipment and other electronic systems on-site rather than having it sent to a specific location like a data center for analysis.

Companies typically move to edge computing to improve efficiency, plus it's often cheaper.

KEEPING TRACK

Not to mention, a major advantage for McDonald's with edge computing is that it lets them know when kitchen equipment is getting worn down and might break soon to avoid order delays or an item having to be temporarily removed from the menu.

According to Rice, sensors are being installed at locations on the kitchen equipment that will instantaneously feed information to the edge computing system.

This allows for a ""real-time"" viewpoint into the states of any given location's operations.

With McDonald's including artificial intelligence in the upgrades, it can immediately analyze the data gathered by the sensors and notify staff of a potential maintenance issue, like for a McFlurry machine.

Other AI advances McDonald's is considering include computer vision, typically a facial-recognition based AI, but used instead in cameras to detect and analyze orders to ensure their accuracy before customers get them.

""If we can proactively address those issues before they occur, that's going to mean smoother operations in the future,"" Rice noted.

AI in the drive-thru is also moving forward, similar to recent decisions from competitors like Wendy's.

McDonald's has had voice-activated drive-thru tech since 2019 through International Business Machines, but ended its partnership last year.

MANAGER ASSIST

The fast food giant even seeks to use AI to assist staff as a ""generative AI virtual manager,"" per Rice.

That way the AI can make scheduling changes and select administrative decisions for managers, freeing them up to handle other responsibilities.

Customers could also start directly experiencing the impact of the AI updates at McDonald's soon through the mobile app.

Rice said McDonald's is tailoring promotional offers through AI's analysis of previous purchase history and even considering the weather.

""A customer who we know loves our sweet treats could get an offer through the app for a McFlurry on a hot summer day,"" he said.

Some fans have already clapped back about the targeted promotions not working due to broken McFlurry machines.

""They need facial recognition software to sell me a McFlurry in the summer? Won't matter anyway, the machine is broken..."" a customer fumed on X.

McDonald's hasn't disclosed how much the tech updates cost.

CEO Chris Kempczinski also recently confirmed the creation of a new team at the fast food giant that's ""devoted"" to taking on rivals like KFC.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/03/jwmconaldstech-op.jpg?1741957433&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-03-15 14:05:17.496503

“We’re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,” CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.
By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.
Last year, months before filing for Chapter 11, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks.
Shares of Spirit previously issued by Spirit Airlines Inc. was canceled upon its exit from bankruptcy — but it expects to re-list shares, newly-issued under new owners, “as soon as reasonably practicable.”","NEW YORK — Discount carrier Spirit Airlines has emerged from bankruptcy protection.

The budget airline — known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of yellow planes — said Wednesday that its parent, Spirit Aviation Holdings, exited Chapter 11 after finalizing debt restructuring. The reorganization plan, which received the court greenlight last month, aims to bring the carrier back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals.

“We’re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,” CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.

The restructuring deal allows Spirit to convert $795 million of its debt into equity. The company says it's also received a $350 million equity investment from existing investors to aid future operations.

Spirit filed for bankruptcy back in November, following years of struggles and mounting debt as it failed to bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Florida carrier was particularly hit hard by rising operating expenses and stiffer competition. By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.

Whether Spirit will continue as a standalone airline has also been up in the air, although takeover attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier have proven to be unsuccessful before and during the bankruptcy process. Spirit rejected a third bid from Frontier last month.

While future merger proposals may not be entirely off the table, Spirit signaled Wednesday that it would continue to focus its own growth and offerings. Christie noted that the airline would be ""moving forward with our strategy to redefine low-fare travel with our new, high-value travel options.”

In an evolution from its budget-exclusive roots, Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities. Last year, months before filing for Chapter 11, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks.

In a message sent to Spirit customers Wednesday, Christie continued to point those four travel options from the airline, which he said “let you choose how you want to fly.""

Chinese beverage giant Mixue Group has become the world's largest food and beverage chain by number of outlets, surpassing Starbucks and McDonald's.
As of September, Mixue Group had over 45,000 stores selling Mixue tea drinks, ice creams, and Lucky Cup coffee products, outnumbering Starbucks and McDonald's, according to industry analysts.
For Malaysian customer Victoria Kovalan, the influx of Chinese brands has made it easier to explore new cuisines.
“If Chinese food brands expand globally, they might have a similar influence, though the impact remains to be seen,” he said.","Hong Kong. Chinese food and beverage brands are gaining ground across Southeast Asia, offering alternatives to major American chains and expanding Beijing's commercial and cultural influence in neighboring economies.

Chinese beverage giant Mixue Group has become the world's largest food and beverage chain by number of outlets, surpassing Starbucks and McDonald's.

The company, whose brand name Mixue Bingcheng means ""Honey Snow Ice City"" in Chinese, is capitalizing on the region’s love for sweets with affordable offerings of ice cream, coffee, and bubble tea.

“Even on social media like TikTok, there’s a joke that any empty shophouse will soon turn into a Mixue store,” said Rahma Yuliana, referring to a popular saying in Indonesia, where Mixue has more than 2,600 outlets.

The single mother, who runs an online business, takes her daughter for after-school treats that won’t drain her wallet, such as a cup of brown sugar milk tea for $1.10—about one-third cheaper than similar offerings from Taiwanese tea chain Chatime. An ice cream costs as little as 50 cents, undercutting McDonald's.

As of September, Mixue Group had over 45,000 stores selling Mixue tea drinks, ice creams, and Lucky Cup coffee products, outnumbering Starbucks and McDonald's, according to industry analysts. About 40,000 of those stores are in China.

By December, Chinese F&B brands had opened more than 6,100 outlets in Southeast Asia, according to Singapore-based research firm Momentum Works. India and Vietnam account for roughly two-thirds of that number, while Singapore and Malaysia, which have sizable Chinese-speaking populations, have a relatively higher concentration of Chinese brands.

Nearly all Mixue stores operate as franchises, with the company supplying ingredients for drinks like Creamy Mango Boba, Mango Oats Jasmine Tea, and Coconut Jelly Milk Tea.

Beyond Mixue, other major players include hotpot giant Haidilao, Fish With You sauerkraut fish restaurants, and beverage brands like Luckin Coffee, Heytea, and Chagee.

Since its March 3 trading debut in Hong Kong, Mixue’s stock has doubled from its IPO price.

Momentum Works CEO Jianggan Li said Chinese businesses are looking to Southeast Asia for new growth opportunities after facing fierce competition at home.

The expansion of food and beverage retailers has also shifted perceptions of Chinese goods from being cheap to offering real value. The companies excel in automation to enhance efficiency and are skilled in online marketing, Li said. Western brands often take longer to find local partners and develop long-term strategies, while Chinese F&B companies are ""much more impatient,"" he noted.

In Thailand’s capital, Bangkok, Chinese entrepreneur Siya Han has invested more than $1.37 million in 12 Mixue stores and about 10 other outlets selling spicy broth bowls, sauerkraut fish, and fried chicken steaks over six years. While shopping mall outlets take time to recoup costs due to hefty rent deposits, her other locations typically break even within six months to a year, excluding lease guarantees.

“If you open Chinese restaurants slowly, you can’t survive,” she said.

In Kuala Lumpur, Chinese sauerkraut fish chain Fish With You sees opportunity in Southeast Asia’s large ethnic Chinese population and growing economies, said Liu Liujun, the company’s vice president.

The brand’s $235,000 investment in one of its Malaysian outlets paid off in just nine months, with lines out the door almost daily, said Liu, who oversees the company’s regional expansion.

For Malaysian customer Victoria Kovalan, the influx of Chinese brands has made it easier to explore new cuisines. “It’s opened up our palates,” she said, noting the popularity of Sichuan hotpots known for their spicy flavors.

Vietnamese student Nguyen Thu Hoài in Hanoi was initially skeptical of Mixue as a Chinese brand but became a regular customer, impressed by its affordability and quality.

Gordon Mathews, an anthropology professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, sees the expansion of Chinese F&B brands as part of a broader trend where Chinese products are gaining global appeal. He recalled McDonald's cultural influence when it expanded worldwide, including its first outlet in Guangzhou in the 1990s, where a clerk once told him, ""I want to go to America.""

“If Chinese food brands expand globally, they might have a similar influence, though the impact remains to be seen,” he said. “China faces an uphill battle in gaining soft power, but it’s doing an excellent job with its products.”

Hudson’s Bay announced late Friday evening that unless it finds a more viable path forward, it will begin liquidating its entire business as soon as next week, putting more than 9,000 jobs at risk.

The department store chain that dates back to 1670 and now spans 80 stores said it has been forced toward a full liquidation because ""exhaustive"" efforts haven't turned up the financing it needs to keep at least some of its empire alive.

A closure of the entire business, which is planned pending a court appearance set for Monday, would mean job losses for 9,364 employees the company has in Canada across its Hudson's Bay stores, as well as three Saks Fifth Avenue stores and 13 Saks Off 5th locations it owns through a licensing agreement.

Though the situation looks bleak, the company is holding out hope for a Hail Mary. It said it remains optimistic that it can drum up capital and find a solution with key stakeholders, particularly its landlord partners, to avoid a full shutdown.

“Our team has worked incredibly hard to identify a viable path forward, and our resolve is strengthened by the overwhelming support from customers and associates who have shared heartfelt stories about Hudson’s Bay and what our stores have meant to them, their families, and their communities across the generations,” Hudson's Bay president and CEO Liz Rodbell.

“These powerful experiences remind us why we must continue to pursue every possible opportunity to secure the necessary support from key landlords and other stakeholders to save The Bay.”

The company's plea for help comes roughly a week after it laid bare its financial struggles in a creditor protection application it made with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

In its application, Hudson's Bay said it was facing financial struggles because of subdued consumer spending, trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada, and post-pandemic drops in downtown store traffic.

The filings show the company owes more than $950 million to 26 pages' worth of listed creditors: landlords, suppliers and other partners, including fashion heavyweights Ralph Lauren, Chanel, Columbia Sportswear, Diesel and Estée Lauder.

Jennifer Bewley, the chief financial officer for Hudson's Bay's parent company, said in a court filing made on March 7 that the business had to defer certain payments to such companies for many months because it was having so much trouble making payments to landlords, service providers and vendors.

The situation was so severe that she said a landlord ""unlawfully locked"" Hudson’s Bay out of a store located in Sydney, N.S. and a team of bailiffs attempted to seize merchandise from another location it runs in Sherway Gardens, a suburban Toronto mall.

The March 7 filing was not meant to be the precursor to the closure of the business because Hudson's Bay was intent to on keeping the company alive and as much of its sprawling footprint operational as possible.

One week later, the company finds itself in much more dire shape. It said the store-by-store liquidation is necessary because it has only secured ""limited"" debtor-in-possession financing — a form of capital companies can seek for restructuring purposes after they make creditor protection filings.

Hudson’s Bay laid the groundwork for its creditor protection case when it spun its U.S. Saks locations off into a separate entity last year after it purchased luxury department stores Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, essentially saving them from the impending closures now set to engulf HBC in Canada.

A full liquidation in Canada wouldn’t just plunge a large portion of the country’s retail workforce into unemployment but would also leave anchor tenant spaces in malls and prestige real estate in high-traffic shopping districts in need of filling.

The sites Hudson's Bay operates in often contain several floors and make up significantly more square footage than other retailer businesses.

The bulk of the company's stores are in Ontario, where it has 32 locations and more than half of its employees work. B.C. hosts 16, Alberta and Quebec each have 13 and Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan have two per province.

Saks Fifth Avenue's Canadian sites are split between Ontario and Alberta and Saks Off 5th has stores in Ontario, B.C., Alberta, Quebec and Manitoba.

While the company's coast-to-coast footprint and its 17th century fur trade origins have made it a quintessential part of the fabric of Canada, it has been led by Americans for several decades now.

American real estate kingpin Richard Baker's National Realty and Development Corp. Equity Partners bought Hudson's Bay in 2008 from the widow of late South Carolina businessman Jerry Zucker for $1.1 billion.

Baker took the company public in 2012 and then turned it private again with a takeover bid that had to be boosted twice to earn shareholder approval in the weeks before Canada was hit with COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

Shareholders were difficult to appease in part because Baker presided over HBC while its stock was dropping — but many thought the company still carried immense value in its real estate.

When he gained their approval, he admitted the brand had work to do.

“It will take patient capital and a long-term view to fully unleash HBC’s potential at the intersection of real estate and retail,” he said in March 2020.

A handful of store closures and piecemeal layoffs over the last two years suggest unleashing that potential was not easy as rivals like fellow Canadian department store Simon's expanded and online giants such as Amazon gobbled up sales.

“We’re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,” CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.
By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.
Last year, months before filing for Chapter 11, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks.
Shares of Spirit previously issued by Spirit Airlines Inc. was canceled upon its exit from bankruptcy — but it expects to re-list shares, newly-issued under new owners, “as soon as reasonably practicable.”","NEW YORK — Discount carrier Spirit Airlines has emerged from bankruptcy protection.

The budget airline — known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of yellow planes — said Wednesday that its parent, Spirit Aviation Holdings, exited Chapter 11 after finalizing debt restructuring. The reorganization plan, which received the court greenlight last month, aims to bring the carrier back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals.

“We’re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,” CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.

The restructuring deal allows Spirit to convert $795 million of its debt into equity. The company says it's also received a $350 million equity investment from existing investors to aid future operations.

Spirit filed for bankruptcy back in November, following years of struggles and mounting debt as it failed to bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Florida carrier was particularly hit hard by rising operating expenses and stiffer competition. By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.

Whether Spirit will continue as a standalone airline has also been up in the air, although takeover attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier have proven to be unsuccessful before and during the bankruptcy process. Spirit rejected a third bid from Frontier last month.

While future merger proposals may not be entirely off the table, Spirit signaled Wednesday that it would continue to focus its own growth and offerings. Christie noted that the airline would be ""moving forward with our strategy to redefine low-fare travel with our new, high-value travel options.”

In an evolution from its budget-exclusive roots, Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities. Last year, months before filing for Chapter 11, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks.

In a message sent to Spirit customers Wednesday, Christie continued to point those four travel options from the airline, which he said “let you choose how you want to fly.""

Wednesday's announcement also noted plans to trade shares publicly again, although not immediately.

This seems to be a reflection of dissatisfied customers who have opted to get their morning ""cup of Joe"" at rival coffee shops instead.

Since taking over as Starbucks' new CEO, Brian Niccol has emphasized the need to bring the company back to its roots by focusing on its core products and personalizing the coffee shop experience like it once did.

“I made a commitment that we’d get back to Starbucks, focusing on what has always set Starbucks apart – a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather and we serve the finest coffee handcrafted by our skilled baristas,” said Niccol in an earnings call.

To return the business to growth, Starbucks developed a turnaround strategy that aims to improve customers' overall experience by redesigning stores, optimizing efficiency, prioritizing coffee quality, simplifying its menu, and empowering its baristas.

Over the last six months, Starbucks (SBUX) has made multiple changes to its coffee shops as part of its turnaround plan to make them feel more like homes rather than establishments, creating a third place for customers.

These changes include reintroducing condiment bars after being banished during the pandemic, returning ceramic mugs for in-house sipping, and bringing back handwritten notes on to-go cups and bags to foster better customer connections.

Staying longer at Starbucks shops now comes with a few perks as well. The company has returned the free in-café refills on hot and iced brewed coffee and tea at participating locations for non-Starbucks Rewards members.

Starbucks has also refreshed its menu with a simpler version, discontinuing 13 items to focus on coffee and quality rather than the number of customizations, which tend to complicate orders.

As for the stores themselves, Starbucks will be closing underperforming shops to invest in building new locations, and revamping old ones to make them more welcoming, cozy, and warm, encouraging customers to stay longer.

On Mar. 12, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol provided a six-month update on the progress of the company's turnaround plan to revive Starbucks' coffeehouse and boost growth.

Although the turnaround plan is in its early stages, and true results will not be seen until all changes have been completed, more of its medium-term goals of bettering Starbucks' in-store experience have already been enacted and are showing signs of progress.

To improve mobile, in-store, and drive-thru ordering systems, Starbucks is currently testing new risers and dedicated pickup shelves in select locations to create more separation between the café and mobile ordering.

Starbucks is also developing technological innovations to improve efficiency and has increased operating hours at 3,000 cafés based on demand to meet customers' coffee needs.

Not only is this turnaround plan focused on improving customers' experience, but also making its working experience better for employees.

""To deliver a great customer experience, we also have to deliver a great partner experience,"" said Niccol.

Over the last few months, Starbucks Workers United has filed several unfair labor practice charges against the company and staged multiple strikes, demanding higher wages and staffing.

Despite the fact that this is an ongoing issue that has yet to be solved, Niccol claims Starbucks has made recent changes to improve employees' work experience, including adding more benefits such as double parental leave and increased manager promotions to reward hard work.

When United Airlines CEO Jeff Smisek was forced to step down over corruption charges, he was quickly replaced by legacy Continental Airlines board member Oscar Munoz.
The onboard coffee was much-hated Fresh Brew, still used by American Airlines.
If American Airlines wants to be a premium carrier, it is important to remember that most passengers fly economy.
Today, coffee on American Airlines serves just one purpose: covering up smells in the lavatory.","Dear American Airlines. One simple change to your service would signal a break from the past and a bright premium future. Change the coffee, and I have a specific suggestion for how you do this.

When United Airlines CEO Jeff Smisek was forced to step down over corruption charges, he was quickly replaced by legacy Continental Airlines board member Oscar Munoz. Munoz set to turn the airline around. While current CEO Scott Kirby is credited with much of the work elevating United as a premium airline and turning around its fortunes, a lot of the heavy lift was done by Munoz.

He traveled the system talking to employees, giving them hope for the future and motivating them to become a part of the airline’s turnaround. He spent tremendous time connecting with the front line.

He reversed Smisek-era cost cuts. While Smisek’s face was known to United flyers as the one promising ‘changes you’re going to like’ from the United-Continental merger, he was relentless in cheapening the product. His effort to cut $2 billion in costs was given the Orwellian name Project Quality.

The Polaris business class seat was green lit under Smisek, but it was Munoz who signed off on all of the service elements. This makes sense because Polaris is, above all else, the most efficient way to squeeze seats into a business class cabin while maintaining lie flat direct aisle access.

But Munoz didn’t start the turnaround with business class. The first thing he did – a real symbolic break from the past – was focus on two things in economy.

Coffee. The onboard coffee was much-hated Fresh Brew, still used by American Airlines. Flyers derided it as ‘fresh poo’. They didn’t just get rid of that coffee, the introduced a genuine premium brand in Illy.

Snacks. They brought out the Stroopwafel, beloved by flyers, and which pairs well with the coffee – demonstrating a real thoughtfulness in the product that had been lacking

I tell this story because American Airlines (1) says they want to be premium now (since competing at the low-end of the marketplace hasn’t worked out well, indeed with their high costs they need to earn a revenue premium) and (2) has focused on premium passengers exclusively so far – talking up the new business class suites that are coming, a new business class lounge in Philadelphia, and more first class seats that will trade off with coach legroom.

If American Airlines wants to be a premium carrier, it is important to remember that most passengers fly economy. They may see first class, and eventually buy up there – which is why seeing a beautiful cabin is important for sales, and seeing passengers enjoying themselves with an elevated service underscores how important simple things like predeparture beverages can be.

But they aren’t going to want to fly American if there aren’t little touches that make the experience just a bit more human. And why not start with the coffee, like United did?

Plus, if Eurowings can pull this off in Europe surely American Airlines can manage it:

European value airline Eurowings is taking in-flight coffee to new heights with the trial of this innovative self-contained coffee cart!

Cappuccinos, macchiatos, and espressos are no longer just for premium cabins—this game-changing cart prepares barista-style coffee and hot chocolate at the touch of a button, right at passengers’ seats. The fully autonomous cart comes equipped with its own battery, water, and milk supply, allowing cabin crew to serve fresh coffee on demand during the service in the cabin.

Today, coffee on American Airlines serves just one purpose: covering up smells in the lavatory.

But come on, wouldn’t you prefer an airline offering this for your next trip in economy, provided that price, schedule and legroom were constant?

And I actually think that flight attendants would love providing this service – it would give them something to be proud of. And if you give them the tools, and pride, they’ll be excited and provide excellent service.

That needs to be paired, of course, with the first Oscar Munoz lesson of getting out and spending time with the front line, motivating them and describing the bright future that they can be part of, that you need them to be part of.",https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/coffee.webp,N,,2025-03-14 18:59:28.834385

The company owes a total of $950 million to nearly 2,000 secured and unsecured creditors, including well-known apparel and beauty brands like Adidas Canada, Estée Lauder, L'Oréal Canada, Levi Strauss Canada, Michael Kors Canada, Nike Canada and Ralph Lauren.

""The scale is certainly monumental for insolvency proceedings as far as Canada goes. It's a very large one,"" said Dina Kovacevic, editor-in-chief of Insolvency Insider Canada. But it's not a surprise, she said.

""Retailers in the last several years since the COVID pandemic have really been having a hard time with less foot traffic and all of the economic issues that have been going on in the world. So while it is monumental, I think we were probably expecting it. There have been a lot of retailer filings in the last several years.""

The company owes more than $1 million to Canada Post, and is in debt to over a dozen municipalities. The list doesn't include the debt amount owed to some government agencies, figures that the filing says are unknown at this time. The amount owed to employees is to be determined, per the filing.

At the beginning of the year, Hudson's Bay had just $3 million in cash and cash equivalents, the documents show. The $1.1 billion it owes in secured debt includes $724.4 million in mortgages.

Secured creditors are lenders, like banks, which give out loans to companies. To ensure they are paid back, the creditor takes on some of the company's assets as collateral. Unsecured creditors are usually employees and suppliers, ""and unfortunately they tend to be at the bottom of the food chain, so to speak,"" said Kovacevic.

""For any employees that get terminated throughout the process, unfortunately their termination and severance pay will be an unsecured claim, which means that they will likely receive cents on the dollar for those claims,"" she explained.

'The worker always comes out last'

The Bay announced last week that it was seeking creditor protection, with its chief executive pointing to the COVID-19 pandemic and an ongoing trade war with the U.S. as external factors that have put financial pressure on the company.

Some experts say The Bay's decline began long before the pandemic, tracing its issues back to its 2008 acquisition by the American investment firm NRDC Equity Partners, and saying that the company's new ownership prioritized its real estate over a cohesive retail strategy.

The company's lack of investment in its stores became evident in recent years, with floors understaffed, escalators and elevators in disrepair and faulty HVAC systems leading to temporary closures last summer.

""I was in just before Christmas, and there are large parts of the floor that weren't stocked with anything, and it didn't have the hum of Christmases past,"" said Lawrence Archer, a Toronto resident who was leaving The Bay with a shopping bag in each hand.

""I feel sorry for the employees,"" he added. ""I've just talking to several of them inside there and they're worried. The worker always comes out last in these sort of situations.""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7483642.1741959559!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/hudsons-bay-toronto.JPG?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-03-14 18:11:38.707356

The company reported a decline in both sales and net income for the fourth quarter, along with a goodwill impairment charge of $475 million related to its health unit. Additionally, Best Buy's guidance for fiscal year 2026 suggested a slight decline in first-quarter comparable sales. The impact of these financial disclosures likely overshadowed positive movements in the broader market, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both experienced gains following a correction earlier in the week. Despite a slight increase in its dividend, Best Buy faced a challenging market environment as a strong tech sector rally led by companies like Nvidia and Palantir didn't extend to the retailer.

Over the past five years, Best Buy has delivered a total shareholder return of 53.50%, benefiting in part from consistent dividend increases and strategic stock buybacks. Notably, the company announced a 5% dividend increase in mid-2024, followed by a further 1% rise in early 2025, highlighting a commitment to returning value to shareholders. Additionally, Best Buy repurchased nearly $1.72 billion worth of shares from its buyback program, which ended in early 2025, further enhancing shareholder returns during this period.

However, the last year has presented challenges, with Best Buy underperforming the U.S. Specialty Retail industry. Key issues included a $475 million goodwill impairment related to its health unit, as reported in March 2025, and declining earnings, with net income falling from $460 million to $117 million for Q4 2025. Despite a sound return on equity and attractive dividend yield, these financial difficulties and a slower growth forecast than the broader market have influenced its recent stock performance.

This included existing anti-obesity medication users who succeeded in nearly doubling their pre-program weight loss while working with program clinicians on diet and lifestyle.

Results are derived from a population of 265,000 members from 2023-2024.

The initial results demonstrate improved weight loss and high program satisfaction for CVS Caremark clients’ plan members trying a lifestyle-first approach, as well as additional clinical effectiveness and cost savings for members receiving clinical support while taking weight management medications like GLP-1s.

GLP-1 products from Novo Nordisk A/S NVO and Eli Lilli And Co LLY have gained substantial traction. The CVS Weight Management program provides one-on-one support from a dedicated registered dietitian in a virtual setting, including personalized nutrition planning.

The program can integrate into a member’s existing pharmacy benefit with plan sponsors’ direction.

As of February 1, 2025, the CVS Weight Management program is now available to over 3.5 million CVS Caremark plan members.

Despite FDA prescription drug labeling recommendations to take GLP-1’s in combination with diet and physical activity, 70% of members were using a weight management drug without any lifestyle or nutrition support before enrolling in the CVS Weight Management program.

Before program enrollment, nearly 30% of members had lost less than 1% of their body weight on anti-obesity medication. These same members lost, on average, 11.7% of body weight after enrollment.

The program accelerated weight loss and delivered an average of 20% weight loss for those with moderate success before enrollment.

“We’re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,” CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.
By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.
Last year, months before filing for Chapter 11, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks.
Shares of Spirit previously issued by Spirit Airlines Inc. was canceled upon its exit from bankruptcy — but it expects to re-list shares, newly-issued under new owners, “as soon as reasonably practicable.”","NEW YORK — Discount carrier Spirit Airlines has emerged from bankruptcy protection.

The budget airline — known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of yellow planes — said Wednesday that its parent, Spirit Aviation Holdings, exited Chapter 11 after finalizing debt restructuring. The reorganization plan, which received the court greenlight last month, aims to bring the carrier back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals.

“We’re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,” CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.

The restructuring deal allows Spirit to convert $795 million of its debt into equity. The company says it's also received a $350 million equity investment from existing investors to aid future operations.

Spirit filed for bankruptcy back in November, following years of struggles and mounting debt as it failed to bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Florida carrier was particularly hit hard by rising operating expenses and stiffer competition. By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.

Whether Spirit will continue as a standalone airline has also been up in the air, although takeover attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier have proven to be unsuccessful before and during the bankruptcy process. Spirit rejected a third bid from Frontier last month.

While future merger proposals may not be entirely off the table, Spirit signaled Wednesday that it would continue to focus its own growth and offerings. Christie noted that the airline would be ""moving forward with our strategy to redefine low-fare travel with our new, high-value travel options.”

In an evolution from its budget-exclusive roots, Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities. Last year, months before filing for Chapter 11, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks.

In a message sent to Spirit customers Wednesday, Christie continued to point those four travel options from the airline, which he said “let you choose how you want to fly.""

Wednesday's announcement also noted plans to trade shares publicly again, although not immediately.

Of the four, Olive Garden-parent Darden held up the best at the start of week. But support eventually gave way at the 10-week moving average.

It's also a busy week of earnings for several top performing China-based stocks. They include Qifu Technology (QFIN), GDS Holdings (GDS) and Kingsoft Cloud (KC), along with high-flying Chinese electric-vehicle makers Zeekr (ZK) and Xiaomi (XIACY).

Results from financial services firm Qifu will be out Monday before the open; GDS and Kingsoft report early Wednesday; Zeeker reports late Thursday and Xiaomi reports sometime Tuesday.

Nike Stock Struggles

Longtime Nike executive Elliot Hill took over as chief executive in October to help with a turnaround after several quarters in a row of weak revenue. Hill aims to refocus the company's attention on sports core to the company's brand like running and basketball.

The new tack comes after Nike's focus on direct-to-consumer sales resulted in bloated inventories and heavy discounting. Meanwhile, increasing competition from the likes of On Holding (ONON) and Deckers' (DECK) wildly popular running shoe brand Hoka hasn't helped Nike stock.

Revenue growth declined again for the November-ended quarter, falling 8% to $12.4 billion. Revenue in all four of its geographies — North America, Europe/Middle East/Africa, Asia Pacific/Latin America and China — declined, but the only area that missed expectations was China, which fell 8% to $1.7 billion.

Nike Stock: Converse Revenue Falls

Nike's Converse brand, acquired all the way back in 2003, is also struggling. In the latest reported quarter, Converse revenue fell 17% to $429 million.

Hill acknowledged that Nike has been focused too much on driving online sales, crimping its relationship with wholesale partners like Foot Locker (FL) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS).

Earnings and revenue are expected to decline again for the February-ended fiscal third quarter, with adjusted profit down 39% to 30 cents a share and revenue down 11% to $11 billion. Nike is scheduled to report Thursday.

Watching Sportradar, Ollie's Bargain Outlet

Sportradar (SRAD), which has held up better than a lot of other growth stocks during the recent sell-off, is due to release fourth-quarter results Wednesday before the open. The company, with a market capitalization of nearly $6 billion, provides data services for the sports betting market as well as other media.

The stock blasted out of a flat base on Nov. 7 after the company reported adjusted profit of 12 cents a share vs. 1 cent in the year-ago quarter. Revenue growth accelerated from the second quarter, rising 34% to $284.1 million. After a strong gain after the breakout, Sportradar settled into another flat base in November and scored another bullish breakout in early January.

Analyst chatter has been positive around the stock lately. Last month, Deutsche Bank maintained a buy rating and lifted Sportradar's price target to 24 from 19. Guggenheim, meanwhile initiated the stock with a buy rating and 27 price target.

In the retail sector, Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) reports early Wednesday as well. Growth has been slowing in recent quarters, but the company is still performing well as a provider of closeout merchandise and excess inventory from manufacturers and bankrupt retailers.

Ollie's is still on a downtrend, but it's been trading tightly while holding just above its 40-week moving average. The stock's relative strength line has started to turn higher as a result.

Ollie's fourth-quarter earnings report comes after some cautious comments from some high-profile retailers lately.

Ulta Beauty (ULTA) on Friday became the latest retailer to caution about a possible slowdown in consumer spending, joining Target (TGT) and Walmart (WMT).

Options Trading Strategy

A basic options trading strategy around earnings — using call options — allows you to buy a stock at a predetermined price without taking a lot of risk. Here's how the option trading strategy works:

First, identify top-rated stocks with a bullish chart. Some might be setting up in sound early-stage bases. Others might've broken out already and are getting support at their 10-week moving average for the first time. And a few might be trading tightly near highs and are refusing to give up much ground. Avoid extended stocks that are too far past proper entry points.

Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy

A call option is a bullish bet on a stock. Put options are bearish bets. One call option contract gives the holder the right to buy 100 shares of a stock at a specified level, known as the strike price.

Once you've identified a bullish setup in the earnings calendar, check strike prices with your online trading platform, or at Cboe.com. Also, make sure the option is liquid with a relatively tight spread between the bid and ask.

Look for a strike price just above the underlying stock price — that's out of the money — and check the premium. Ideally, the premium should not exceed 4% of the underlying stock price at the time. In some cases, an in-the-money strike price is OK as long as the premium isn't too expensive.

Choose an expiration date that fits your risk objective. But keep in mind that time is money in the options market. Near-term expiration dates will have cheaper premiums than those further out. Buying time in the options market comes at a higher cost. Also keep in mind that implied volatility tends to rise before an earnings report, which can push up the cost of options.

Kingsoft Option Trade

The stock market is in a correction where new buys should generally be avoided, but China-based cloud services provider Kingsoft Cloud continues to show relative strength after an explosive gain in recent months and could make sense as a call-option trade.

When Kingsoft traded around 16.70, a slightly out-of-the-money monthly call option with a 17.50 strike price and a March 21 expiration came with a premium of around $1.15 per contract. That was 6.9% of the underlying stock price at the time, and well above the 4% threshold.

One contract gave the holder the right to buy 100 shares of Kingsoft at 17.50 per share. The most that could be lost was $115 — the amount paid for the 100-share contract. To break even, Kingsoft would need to rise to 18.65, factoring in the premium paid.

“We’re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,” CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.
By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.

Shares of Spirit previously issued by Spirit Airlines Inc. was canceled upon its exit from bankruptcy — but it expects to re-list shares, newly-issued under new owners, “as soon as reasonably practicable.”","NEW YORK — Discount carrier Spirit Airlines has emerged from bankruptcy protection.

The budget airline — known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of yellow planes — said Wednesday that its parent, Spirit Aviation Holdings, exited Chapter 11 after finalizing debt restructuring. The reorganization plan, which received the court greenlight last month, aims to bring the carrier back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals.

“We’re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,” CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.

The restructuring deal allows Spirit to convert $795 million of its debt into equity. The company says it's also received a $350 million equity investment from existing investors to aid future operations.

Spirit filed for bankruptcy back in November, following years of struggles and mounting debt as it failed to bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Florida carrier was particularly hit hard by rising operating expenses and stiffer competition. By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.

Whether Spirit will continue as a standalone airline has also been up in the air, although takeover attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier have proven to be unsuccessful before and during the bankruptcy process. Spirit rejected a third bid from Frontier last month.

While future merger proposals may not be entirely off the table, Spirit signaled Wednesday that it would continue to focus its own growth and offerings. Christie noted that the airline would be ""moving forward with our strategy to redefine low-fare travel with our new, high-value travel options.”

In an evolution from its budget-exclusive roots, Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities. Last year, months before filing for Chapter 11, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks.

In a message sent to Spirit customers Wednesday, Christie continued to point those four travel options from the airline, which he said “let you choose how you want to fly.""

The documents were submitted as part of its creditor protection filing last week. The company owes a total of $950 million to nearly 2,000 secured and unsecured creditors, including well-known apparel and beauty brands like Adidas Canada, Estée Lauder, L'Oréal Canada, Levi Strauss Canada, Michael Kors Canada, Nike Canada and Ralph Lauren.

The company also owes more than $1 million to Canada Post, and is in debt to over a dozen municipalities. The list doesn't include debts owed to government agencies, a figure that the filing says is unknown at this time. The amount owed to employees is to be determined, per the filing.

At the beginning of the year, Hudson's Bay had just $3 million in cash and cash equivalents, the documents show. The secured debt it owes includes $724.4 million in mortgages.

The Bay announced last week that it was seeking creditor protection, with its chief executive pointing to the COVID-19 pandemic and an ongoing trade war with the U.S. as external factors that have put financial pressure on the company.

Experts say that Hudson's Bay had been in decline long before then, some tracing its issues back to its 2008 acquisition by the American investment firm NRDC Equity Partners, and saying that the company's new ownership prioritized its real estate over a cohesive retail strategy.

The company's lack of investment in its stores became evident in recent years, with floors understaffed, escalators and elevators in disrepair and faulty HVAC systems leading to temporary closures last summer.

By expanding brand assortments, introducing innovative products and optimizing distribution channels, the company is well-positioned for sustained growth.

RL on Track With “Next Great Chapter: Accelerate” Plan

Ralph Lauren continues to make strong progress on its strategic initiatives to enhance business performance. The company is on track to exceed its sales and profit goals under the ""Next Great Chapter: Accelerate Plan."" This plan aims to streamline operations, upgrade technology and enhance the customer experience.

As part of the plan, RL is focused on three strategic pillars: elevating and energizing its lifestyle brand, driving core offerings while expanding, and winning key cities with its consumer ecosystem. The company completed its brand reshuffling by transitioning Chaps into a licensed business. Ralph Lauren’s strategy emphasizes premium product offerings, data-driven promotions, efficient inventory management, and expansion across key locations and sales channels.

RL's DTC & Omnichannel Strategies Drive Growth

Ralph Lauren is advancing its digital and omnichannel expansion by investing in mobile, online shopping and fulfillment services. The company’s digital business, including its own websites, department store partnerships, online retailers and social commerce, continues to experience strong growth. RL added nearly two million new consumers to its direct-to-consumer (DTC) business in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, marking steady year-over-year growth. This growth was largely driven by younger, high-value customers who are less price-sensitive, reinforcing the brand’s appeal to the next generation. Social media engagement continues to grow, with an expanding follower base across platforms like TikTok, Threads, Instagram, Line and Douyin.

In the fiscal third quarter, Ralph Lauren achieved significant digital sales growth across key regions, with notable increases in Europe and Asia. The company is experiencing strong DTC comparable store sales growth while expanding its connected ecosystems in major markets. Strong brand positioning and sustained demand for core and seasonal products have driven higher full-price sales and increased average unit retail prices, surpassing expectations.

How is RL Positioned for 2025?

Ralph Lauren’s stock momentum and stronger North American wholesale performance provide a solid foundation for resilience in a competitive landscape. For fiscal 2025, RL anticipates constant-currency revenue growth of 6-7% year over year, including 100-150 bps of adverse currency impacts. Management now expects the operating margin to increase 120-160 bps in constant currency, driven by a gross margin expansion of 130-170 bps.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, management anticipates revenues to increase 6-7% on a constant-currency basis. The operating margin is expected to expand around 120-140 bps in constant currency, driven by gross margin expansion of 80-120 bps and slight operating expense leverage. Wholesale is projected to continue its positive trajectory, with North America sell-in aligning more closely with sell-out, and Europe wholesale receipts shifting to the second half of fiscal 2025.

Challenges in RL’s Pathway

Despite its strong performance, Ralph Lauren faces challenges due to its extensive international presence, which makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The strengthening U.S. dollar has created a financial hurdle, affecting both revenues and earnings.

A stronger dollar is expected to slightly reduce overall revenues for fiscal 2025 and entail significant impacts on fourth-quarter results. Additionally, foreign exchange fluctuations are projected to slightly lower gross and operating margins in 2025, with a more pronounced effect in the fourth quarter.

Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol has announced further measures to improve wait times at US stores.

Addressing the coffee chain’s 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Niccol reaffirmed his commitment to improving the experience for both customers and staff, especially during peak operating hours.

A part of his Back to Starbucks strategy, Niccol has already pledged to reduce customer wait times by reducing menu complexity and reducing the frequency of discount-driven offers. “Early reactions tell me these were the right steps for our partners, our customers, and the business,” he said.

The former Chipotle CEO has also increased staff hours at 3,000 company-owned US stores and is trialling a new staffing model to streamline the handling of mobile orders to reduce strain on baristas.

More than 30% of transactions at Starbucks’ US stores are made through mobile ordering, which Niccol said in October 2024 can be ‘difficult to sequence and quickly deliver to our customers’ during busy periods.

Further alluding to the in-store congestion and delays caused by mobile orders, Niccol told shareholders that Starbucks plans to remodel outlets with greater separation between in-store transactions and mobile order collections areas, including the introduction of dedicated pick-up shelves.

He also unveiled new espresso bars designed to improve customer engagement and ‘add a sense of theatre’ for dine-in customers.

“We want to be the solution for when people want to connect. We also want to be the solution for people when they need to do something quick and convenient. The good news is we have the ability to do both,” Niccol said.

Starbucks shareholders also voted on several proposals during the meeting on 12 March 2025, including approving Board of Director members. Former LEGO Group CEO Jørgen Vig Knudstorp has been appointed Starbucks’ new Lead Independent Director, succeeding Mellody Hobson.

For the second time in less than a month, Kroger has announced an undisclosed number of layoffs. On Thursday, the grocer said the lost jobs included positions at its prized consumer insights subsidiary 84.51.

Last month, Kroger also announced unspecified cuts to non-store workers in both Cincinnati and nationwide. The Kroger consumer unit analyzes data collected from the grocer's loyalty program and uses it to pitch relevant coupons to shoppers, as well as advise consumer products supplies on the best ways to appeal to customers.

Multiple 84.51 workers in software and data engineering listed themselves on LinkedIn as ""open to work"" on Thursday.

On Thursday, Kroger said the move was part of an ""efficiency"" drive to serve its customers:

""The best way we can accomplish this goal is to focus on the key priorities ... as part of this prioritization work and improved efficiencies, we restructured a few teams and eliminated a small number of roles,"" Kroger said in a statement.

The disclosure comes at a tense time for Kroger. On March 3, the company announced the abrupt departure of its long-serving CEO Rodney McMullen after he resigned following an ethics investigation. Currently led by board member and former Staples CEO Ron Sargent, the grocer has begun a national search for a new CEO.

Besides the leadership shift, Kroger is also grappling with a lawsuit brought against it by Albertsons following the collapse of Kroger's two-year takeover bid of its rival; uneven sales to skittish consumers worried about inflation; and an ongoing trade war after President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada that are expected to affect staples like produce within weeks if they remain in effect.

Based in downtown Cincinnati, Kroger employs 414,000 workers nationwide, including roughly 20,000 in Greater Cincinnati. The latest job cuts were not disclosed in any filings with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or the state of Ohio. Kroger operates 76 stores in Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky employing 14,500 associates.

The company also owes more than $1 million to Canada Post, and is in debt to over a dozen municipalities. The list doesn't include debts owed to government agencies, a figure that the filing says is unknown at this time.

The Bay announced last week that it was seeking creditor protection, with its chief executive pointing to the COVID-19 pandemic and an ongoing trade war with the U.S. as external factors that have put financial pressure on the company.

Experts say that Hudson's Bay had been in decline long before then, some tracing its issues back to its 2008 acquisition by the American investment firm NRDC Equity Partners, and saying that the company's new ownership prioritized its real estate over a cohesive retail strategy.",https://www.cbc.ca/lite/favicon.ico,N,,2025-03-14 12:05:29.580615

A new survey reveals the impact of artificial intelligence on how consumers shop digitally.

A majority of surveyed U.S. consumers have used AI tools to help them shop online, according to a study by customer experience personalization technology provider Bloomreach. Six-in-10 (61%) respondents have leveraged general purpose AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini to help them shop online.

And more than 66% of respondents were at least somewhat familiar with AI assistants built specifically for shopping, such as Amazon Rufus, with 57% having used one in the past six to nine months and 42% becoming aware of these kinds of AI solutions in the past year.

Half of respondents said they would be more likely to use an AI assistant if it knew preferences such as size or style and used that data to personalize responses and recommendations. Time savings was the biggest benefit of AI shopping assistants cited by respondents, followed by easier navigation and better product recommendations.

Signs have already been removed at some locations and at least one, at 5081 J. Turner Butler Blvd., is listed for lease by real estate services firm TSCG.

The closings represent a quarter of the 60-year-old, Atlanta-based fast-food chain’s locations in Duval County.

They also represent more than 100 years of combined service slicing and serving up Arby’s signature roast beef and other menu favorites.

According to Duval County property records, the restaurant at 9361 Atlantic Blvd. was built in 1984 near the United Artists theater complex which was later redeveloped into Circuit City and Bed Bath & Beyond, now Ashley Furniture and Aldi, and Best Buy, where Korean supermarket Lotte Plaza Market is set to open.

The Arby’s restaurant at 9171 Baymeadows Road, has been a fixture there since it was built in 1985. The restaurant at 4316 Southside Blvd., near Touchton Road, was built in 2004. And Arby’s opened in the former Hardee’s spot on Butler Boulevard near Philips Highway in 2017.

RL on Track With “Next Great Chapter: Accelerate” Plan

Ralph Lauren continues to make strong progress on its strategic initiatives to enhance business performance. The company is on track to exceed its sales and profit goals under the ""Next Great Chapter: Accelerate Plan."" This plan aims to streamline operations, upgrade technology and enhance the customer experience.

As part of the plan, RL is focused on three strategic pillars: elevating and energizing its lifestyle brand, driving core offerings while expanding, and winning key cities with its consumer ecosystem. The company completed its brand reshuffling by transitioning Chaps into a licensed business. Ralph Lauren’s strategy emphasizes premium product offerings, data-driven promotions, efficient inventory management, and expansion across key locations and sales channels.

RL's DTC & Omnichannel Strategies Drive Growth

Ralph Lauren is advancing its digital and omnichannel expansion by investing in mobile, online shopping and fulfillment services. The company’s digital business, including its own websites, department store partnerships, online retailers and social commerce, continues to experience strong growth. RL added nearly two million new consumers to its direct-to-consumer (DTC) business in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, marking steady year-over-year growth. This growth was largely driven by younger, high-value customers who are less price-sensitive, reinforcing the brand’s appeal to the next generation. Social media engagement continues to grow, with an expanding follower base across platforms like TikTok, Threads, Instagram, Line and Douyin.

In the fiscal third quarter, Ralph Lauren achieved significant digital sales growth across key regions, with notable increases in Europe and Asia. The company is experiencing strong DTC comparable store sales growth while expanding its connected ecosystems in major markets. Strong brand positioning and sustained demand for core and seasonal products have driven higher full-price sales and increased average unit retail prices, surpassing expectations.

How is RL Positioned for 2025?

Ralph Lauren’s stock momentum and stronger North American wholesale performance provide a solid foundation for resilience in a competitive landscape. For fiscal 2025, RL anticipates constant-currency revenue growth of 6-7% year over year, including 100-150 bps of adverse currency impacts. Management now expects the operating margin to increase 120-160 bps in constant currency, driven by a gross margin expansion of 130-170 bps.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, management anticipates revenues to increase 6-7% on a constant-currency basis. The operating margin is expected to expand around 120-140 bps in constant currency, driven by gross margin expansion of 80-120 bps and slight operating expense leverage. Wholesale is projected to continue its positive trajectory, with North America sell-in aligning more closely with sell-out, and Europe wholesale receipts shifting to the second half of fiscal 2025.

Challenges in RL’s Pathway

Despite its strong performance, Ralph Lauren faces challenges due to its extensive international presence, which makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The strengthening U.S. dollar has created a financial hurdle, affecting both revenues and earnings.

A stronger dollar is expected to slightly reduce overall revenues for fiscal 2025 and entail significant impacts on fourth-quarter results. Additionally, foreign exchange fluctuations are projected to slightly lower gross and operating margins in 2025, with a more pronounced effect in the fourth quarter.

Even if you're one of the biggest, baddest, toughest and strongest multinational labels, you've probably met your fair share of struggles since the early 2020s.

And if you're not one of those aforementioned retailers, you're probably mired in difficulties.

It's always been difficult to be a retailer, but since 2020, things have gotten more complicated.

Covid certainly changed things at the onset. Prolonged closures quickly reduced foot traffic to zero. Social distancing became the norm. Suddenly, nobody wanted to dine, drink or shop together.

After Covid ebbed, interest rates soared. So any businesses that had managed to stay in business through the worst of the Covid closures suddenly found their costs of operation had risen sharply. Growth was more expensive. Debt cost more. And retail had been changed irrevocably.

Retail has been challenged

All in all, the past five years have been challenging for everyone.

For the local mom-and-pop shops, retail has become downright risky. For all the retailers, including the giants like Walmart and Amazon, it's become more expensive to operate.

And as more key goods and services rise in price, consumers are getting choosier about where, when and how much they spend.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for February found that the cost of goods and services rose 0.2% on the month.

The annual rate of inflation was also up 2.8% — slightly less than expected.

Here's a breakdown of several price changes for February:

Food: increase 0.2%

Energy: increase 0.2%

Electricity: increase 1.0%

New vehicles: decrease 0.1%

Used vehicles: increase 0.9%

Apparel: increase 0.6%

Shelter: increase 0.3%

Transportation: decrease 0.8%

Medical care services: increase 0.3%

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that according to its indexes, over the month the cost of medical care rose 0.3%, physicians' services were 0.4% higher, hospital services added 0.1%, and prescription-drug costs were unchanged.

Top retail chain closing hundreds of locations

And now a top U.S. pharmacy chain, CVS, is closing as many as 270 underperforming locations this year.

CVS (CVS) said it would be changing how it operates, opening small-scale stores that offer only pharmacy services. The stores will be about 5,000 square feet or less.

It will open about 12 of these, which will have smaller footprints and are aimed at increasingly choosy customers who are looking to save on everything and are far less brand-loyal, out of convenience or preference.

""By taking a customized approach to our footprint that is focused on the specific needs of the communities we serve, we’re continuing to strategically realign our pharmacy footprint to better support patient and ensure the right geographic coverage,"" a CVS spokesperson said.

All told, CVS, Woonsocket, R.I., has closed about 900 stores over the past two years. It has opened about 100 new ones.

A: Bernard Schaferbarthold noted that volatility remains high, with some delays in Europe. However, there is no significant change in customer behavior due to CO2 regulations as they are not yet law.

Q: How is HELLA handling potential tariffs between Mexico and the US, and what is the exposure from Europe to the US? A: Bernard Schaferbarthold explained that HELLA is mostly USMCA compliant, minimizing tariff impacts. For Europe to the US, potential tariffs on materials like copper are not significant, and the impact on cars is uncertain.

The largest production volumes among ArcelorMittal’s European assets are accounted for by the Belgian division – 5.2 million tons in 2024, up 20.9% y/y. ArcelorMittal France produced 4.8 million tons of steel for the year (+23.1% y/y), Spain – 3.6 million tons (+12.5%), Poland – 3.8 million tons (+22.6%), Bremen – 3.1 million tons (+6.9%).

Last year, ArcelorMittal Méditerranée (France) produced 1.9 million tons of steel (-20.8% y/y), ArcelorMittal Belval & Differdange (Luxembourg) – 1.9 million tons (+0%), ArcelorMittal Eisenhüttenstadt (Germany) – 1.8 million tons (-5.2%), ArcelorMittal Zenica – 0.5 million tons (-16.7%).

According to the financial report, ArcelorMittal Europe continues to maintain its leading position in the steel market, as evidenced by the growth in production volumes. The company is also actively investing in the modernization of production and the introduction of low-carbon technologies. An important aspect was the growth of production in blast furnaces, while the reduction in production in electric arc furnaces was due to high electricity prices and changes in the production strategy. In 2024, ArcelorMittal continued to implement its sustainability programs aimed at reducing CO2 emissions and improving steel production efficiency.

As GMK Center reported earlier, in 2024, ArcelorMittal reduced steel production by 0.3% compared to 2023 to 57.9 million tons. Iron ore production in the period increased by 0.9% y/y – to 42.4 million tons. Steel shipments to customers in the period amounted to 54.3 million tonnes (-2.3% y/y), and iron ore (only for AMMC and Liberia) – 26.4 million tonnes (+0% y/y).

ArcelorMittal is a leading global steel and mining company with operations in 60 countries and production assets in 18 countries.",https://gmk.center/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-1-2024-12-11T102058.048.jpg,N,,2025-03-14 11:03:42.235145

“But someone who is lower income, they’re going to cut out something like fabric softener more quickly than, say, they cut out laundry detergent,” said Pretnar.","If you want to know how low-income Americans are feeling, just look to Dollar General. Its CEO Todd Vasos said in the company’s earnings call this week that its “core customers” — people who earn under $40,000 annually — are struggling even more this year.

Customer traffic fell last quarter. But if you can’t afford Dollar General, where do you go?

Dollar General’s customers are struggling and end-of-month store sales are slowing, said retail analyst Matt Todd with S&P Global.

“Lower income households, who are their core customer, are running short on cash,” said Todd.

Plus, there’s inventory loss. Something called “shrink” is high.

“Elevated shrink, I think, is another sign of people struggling at the lower end of the income spectrum,” said Todd. “… third-party theft is the largest component of it. People stealing things.”

Dollar General’s CEO said customers have already cut out discretionary purchases. Now they’re going without some basic necessities, too — partly by having a more strict definition of “necessities.”

“The more income you have, the more we tend to consider things as necessities,” said Nick Pretnar from the Laboratory for Aggregate Economics and Finance at University of California, Santa Barbara. He says take something like fabric softener. Higher income consumers might call that a necessity.

“But someone who is lower income, they’re going to cut out something like fabric softener more quickly than, say, they cut out laundry detergent,” said Pretnar.",https://www.marketplace.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DollarGeneral-GettyImages-1473987022.jpg?w=1200,N,,2025-03-14 15:06:20.366074

Last week, however, parent company Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by the retail-focused private equity firm Sycamore Partners for $10 billion.
Will the Takeover Affect Walgreens Store Closures?
Some have questioned the type of recovery Walgreens could launch under private ownership, and whether it will be significant enough to reverse its planned store closures.
""I suspect that the store closures will continue as planned,"" Sucharita Kodali, a retail industry analyst at the market research firm Forrester, told Newsweek.","After Walgreens entered into a definitive takeover agreement, experts spoke with Newsweek about what the acquisition means for the pharmacy chain and whether the move would impact its planned store closures.

Why It Matters

Walgreens is the second largest pharmacy chain in the country behind CVS, offering health and wellness products and other services in its almost 8,500 stores across the U.S. However, ongoing financial struggles and competition from Amazon's online pharmacy and major retailers, such as Walmart and Target, have forced the company to scale back many of its operations.

What To Know

In late 2024, Walgreens announced that it would shutter 1,200 locations across the country over the next three years, with 500 set to close in the financial year that runs until September.

Last week, however, parent company Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by the retail-focused private equity firm Sycamore Partners for $10 billion. WBA said that with a cash offer of $11.45 per share, other potential considerations and the addition of its liabilities and settlements, the total value could reach up to $23.7 billion.

Walgreens' parent company told Newsweek that it had no additional information regarding the potential effects of the acquisition beyond what was shared in last week's announcement and related Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

Will the Takeover Affect Walgreens Store Closures?

Some have questioned the type of recovery Walgreens could launch under private ownership, and whether it will be significant enough to reverse its planned store closures.

""I'd imagine their new owners will evaluate heavily both internal data and external data around the communities each of the soon-to-be-closed stores sit within,"" said Nicole Leinbach Hoffman, the founder and president of the retail-focused newsletter Retail Minded. ""If I had to guess, they'd still close them, however, to open up dollars to nurture the remaining stores with a refreshed strategy.""

Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth said in an October earnings call that the closures targeted unprofitable stores, enabling the company to focus on its 6,000 profitable locations.

""I suspect that the store closures will continue as planned,"" Sucharita Kodali, a retail industry analyst at the market research firm Forrester, told Newsweek.

""Unless the wrong stores were marked for closure or the [private equity] firm's approach to closure is different than how Walgreens thought about closures, I suspect it will remain the same,"" she added.

Sycamore has been involved in similar acquisitions of struggling retailers, such as Staples, and the firm's past strategy has involved selling assets and closing stores to pay down debts and limit operational costs, Reuters reported.

Kodali said the Walgreens case reminded her of the Staples takeover. She suggested that, given the company's extensive recent challenges, the new owners might pursue ""an even more aggressive plan to close stores.""

Store theft, weak traffic, huge debt and competition in the pharmaceutical space from savings apps, such as GoodRx, were among the issues she cited, along with billions in settlement payments to address opioid-related lawsuits.

What People Are Saying

Nicole Leinbach Hoffman, the founder and president of Retail Minded, told Newsweek: ""After years of struggling and losing money, Walgreens' plans to sell to a private equity firm are a promising approach to keep this legacy retailer alive. And more so, hopefully thriving again. Retail historically always changes and has evolution as well, and this sale, I believe, is the opportunity for Walgreens to be reinvented to keep up with the modern consumer and evolved retail alike. As for their internal teams, change is inevitable.""

She added: ""Maintaining these scheduled closings could be a winning strategy despite the hurdles, job losses and frustrations along the way. Walgreens needs a reset, and these closures combined with this new private equity purchase could be the winning duo to help clear the path of a brighter future for Walgreens.""

Sucharita Kodali, a retail industry analyst at Forrester, told Newsweek: ""[Private equity] takeovers are usually never good for employees nor really for the retail brand either. It is usually great for any one that is competitive with the company. In this case, it could be a boon for CVS, the Walmart and Target pharmacy businesses and even Amazon's pharma business.""

What Happens Next

According to a news release WBA issued on March 6, the takeover remains subject to shareholder approval and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2605735/walgreens-10-billion-takeover-store-closures.png,N,,2025-03-14 10:05:10.254747

£2.9 million...Deliveroo reported this week that it made a £2.9 million annual profit, compared to a £31.8 million loss in 2023. Revenue and orders rose 2% as the company expanded further to grocery deliveries.

Susannah Streeter, Head of Money and Markets, Hargreaves Lansdown, comments:‘’It’s been a long hard slog but Deliveroo has finally climbed the tough summit of reaching annual profitability. But it’s not going to be freewheeling from here and the uncertain economic environment points to a wobbly ride ahead.""

""Deliveroo is selling its operations in Hong Kong, given the tough competition to focus on more profitable markets like the UK and Ireland. But that leaves the company that bit more exposed to this part of Europe’s economic climate. Growth is already highly sluggish in the UK, and there are concerns that the harsh global trade winds blowing could knock recovery off course.""

She adds: ""Cautious consumers may be less inclined to shell out on expensive takeaways, and although Deliveroo has expanded into grocery deliveries which offers more resilience, it’s not going to be an easy path ahead and there are plenty of rivals already in this space. Deliveroo faces a more powerful competitor in ’Just Eat Takeaway now that it’s been being gobbled up by Prosus to fulfil its ambitions to become a mega global platform in the consumer delivery and FinTech space.""

""Prosus wants to get fingers in more pies where Uber has already found a sweet spot, eyeing up opportunity rights across the consumer-focused space. While consumers have become accustomed to easy delivery at the click of an app, Deliveroo is going to have to pedal hard to get its hands on the yellow jersey.’’

1,800...Currys reports that, starting this month, a proportion of every online sale of refurbished tech, across its mobile and computing categories, will go towards those living in digital poverty.

The retailer will be donating £1 of every refurbished phone or laptop sale online to the Digital Poverty Alliance (DPA). This comes following the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology's newly published Digital Inclusion Action Plan, backed by Currys.

As one of the Digital Poverty Alliance’s founding partners, Currys works with the DPA through its Tech4Families scheme, which helps vulnerable families in need by providing access to digital technology. So far, over 1,800 families have been provided a laptop via the initiative, thanks to Currys customers.

""We are thrilled to see the convergence of two of our strategic priorities: promoting the use of refurbished technology and raising funds to help tackle digital poverty. By supporting this cause, we are giving tech a longer life and also ensuring that more families have access to the tech they need. I am incredibly proud of the progress we have made and look forward to seeing the positive impact this initiative will have,"" says Paula Coughlan, Chief People, Communications and Sustainability Officer at Currys.

24% of the UK population have witnessed shoplifting taking place while at a store in the last 12 months. That is equivalent to over 16 million people seeing these events. That's according to the latest BRC-Opinium survey data.

This also shows 23% of customers have witnessed the physical or verbal abuse of shop staff. This can include racial or sexual abuse, physical assault or threats with weapons.

The research comes as the UK experiences record levels of retail crime with 20 million incidents of theft last year, and incidents of violence and abuse climbing to over 2,000 per day. Separately, Usdaw - the shopworkers’ union - have produced their own survey showing 77% of retail staff experiencing abuse, 53% threats, and 10% assault.

These incidents are not restricted to those working in stores: delivery drivers are often subjected to abuse, physical violence, and threats with weapons. As a result, many are being equipped with protective measures, such as personal safety devices to alert the police of their whereabouts, and DNA spit testing kits.

Crime cost retailers £4.2 billion last year. This includes £2.2 billion from shoplifting, and another £1.8 billion spent on crime prevention measures such as CCTV, more security personnel, anti-theft devices and body worn cameras. These costs add to the wider cost pressures retailers already face, further limiting investment and pushing up prices for customers everywhere.

$8.5 million...Mimo, a platform that aims to simplify global payments, cash flow, and financial management for SMBs and accountants, has raised $8.5 million of new investment, led by Project A.

Previous investors Northzone and Seedcamp return to participate in this round. Mimo has also arranged an embedded funding partnership with Froda, a SMB financing provider, enabling it to provide UK SMBs with $125 million+ in flexible working capital solutions over the coming years, with potential for pan-European scalability.

Mimo will deploy the new equity funding to continue to build out its B2B payments solution for SMBs and expand its headcount.

It was founded in 2023 by Henrik Grim (CEO), former General Manager of Europe at Capchase and Investment Manager at Northzone, Alexander Gernandt Segerby (CPO), and Andreas Meisingseth (CTO), all formerly of iZettle. It has offices in London and Stockholm.

Its platform is being used by businesses like protein breakfast brand Surreal, luxury mens- and womenswear brand Wales Bonner, and canned beans brand Bold Bean, as well as accounting firms supporting the SMB economy, like PM+M, TC Group and Green & Purple.

66%...Rumblings of a global trade war, plus a tumbling US stock market, mark week seven of the Trump administration.

Against this backdrop, 66% of C-suite and operations leaders say they are confident or very confident that they can effectively mitigate the impact of geopolitical risks on their supply chain over the next five years, according to a survey of 600 global executives (across 12 sectors including retail and e-commerce) by Argon & Co.

The research points to a growing need for businesses to strengthen operational resilience, as growing geopolitical volatility associated with the United States, China, Russia, and the Middle East are reshaping supply chain and sourcing strategies.

Industries with complex, global supply chains and extensive experience in managing geopolitical disruptions exhibit higher confidence levels, including life sciences (83%), logistics (82%), and fashion (73%). Yet, these industries also face some of the most significant exposures to these risks, including increased costs due to tariffs and disruptions to shipping routes.

The relative lack of major disruptions over the past 12 months compared to the previous five years is fostering complacency, with just 25% of C-suite leaders citing geopolitical uncertainty as a major challenge impacting their operations over this period. However, intensifying trade tensions and protectionist policies means many leaders may be underestimating the scale of upcoming operational disruptions.

$4 million...SaySo has emerged from stealth and secured $4 million in seed funding, led by VC firm UP.Partners.

David Olk, former co-founder of cloud-based PoS ShopKeep, helped launch the venture, an end-to-end clearance solution and price optimisation platform.

""Retailers all say the same thing: clearance inventory drains cash, takes up valuable space, and limits ability to bring in new products,” Olk says. ""Offloading clearance inventory may be the bane of any retailer's existence, but we try to make it as smooth as possible. Our solution helps them effortlessly offload excess inventory while still driving brand awareness and profits.""

SaySo partners with retailers to create co-branded, interactive shopping experiences. The platform uses a gamified pricing model where item prices gradually drop over time, allowing shoppers to “name their price” while encouraging engagement and urgency.

Unlike traditional clearance methods, SaySo enables retailers to sell excess inventory directly from their warehouses and distribution centres. At the same time, the platform captures pricing insights from each transaction, helping retailers refine future pricing strategies and optimise margins.

70% and 39%...Now that we're in March, garden lovers across the UK are actively revamping their outdoor spaces - and this momentum is just beginning.

While cost and value remain front of mind for many, new eBay Advertising research (involving 2,003 Brits) shows that gardens are a priority. 70% of green fingered Brits surveyed plan to purchase items for their outdoor spaces this year, with 39% saying they’ll spend more this year than last.

And 46% of eBay shoppers say they’re more likely to purchase a garden item after seeing an advert, reinforcing the role of targeted promotions in driving sales.

With rising costs putting pressure on discretionary spending, some consumers are prioritising their gardens over leisure experiences. The research reveals that one in ten of those planning garden purchases are doing so instead of going on holiday.

57% of shoppers looking to refresh their outdoor spaces this year are preparing for spring and summer. 39% plan to spend more on their gardens than in the past one to two years, reflecting ongoing investment in home spaces despite financial pressures. This rises to 43% among eBay shoppers specifically.

25%..A new Avery Dennison report flags many fashion retailers struggling with serious item level visibility limitations.

The findings are based on a survey of 250 senior fashion retail supply chain leaders in the UK and US.

While half of those surveyed say their company has ‘visibility into most items’, 25% have ‘limited or no visibility’ at the item level in factories and distribution centres. The research also reveals that the supply chain is ‘highly problematic with regular disruptions’ for 30% of respondents, while only 22% categorise it as ‘efficient and responsive’.

Six in ten of the smaller companies, those with annual revenue between $1 million and $9.99 million, feel they have full visibility. Surprisingly, larger companies appear to be impacted the most by a lack of visibility, with only four in ten of firms with annual revenue above $1 billion believing they have a complete view.

Full visibility was found to be most challenging for medium sized retailers with only one in ten of the $250 million-$499 million revenue cohort saying they had achieved this. Only six out of the 250 companies surveyed (which were split into six different revenue categories) had ‘no visibility’.

$13 million...Kroger has announced the creation of a new e-commerce business unit, which aligns the teams contributing to every aspect of the online customer experience.

Yael Cosset, Kroger's Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer, will lead this function as Executive VP and Chief Digital Officer.

""Accelerating our e-commerce growth is a top priority,"" says Ron Sargent, Kroger's Chairman and CEO. ""As the architect of Kroger's digital strategy, Yael will continue to make it easier for customers to shop for our fresh, affordable food.""

Kroger's e-commerce sales reached $13 billion in 2024.

Gregg London, a supply chain consultant, comments: “Both Kroger and Albertsons are trying to make up for ""lost time"" as a result of the merger fiasco. CEO changes, senior management changes, and more. While e-commerce is important, it seems like more of a ""band aid"" for faltering sales, and a ""low cost"" way of furthering customer loyalty. Will it work? Time will tell.”

$2.6 million...Ad network specialist Thanks has announced both $2.6 million in seed funding from venture firms Peak XV Partners, Founder Collective and Side Stage Ventures, alongside multinational partnerships with eBay and Zip.

“We’re all customers at the end of the day, and we all navigate - and often avoid - the constant bombardment of ads. We built Thanks because we believe the relationship between advertisers and customers should be rewarding, but it must be delivered in a way that respects the customer and adds value to their day,” says Steven Tesoriero, Co-CEO and Co-founder at Thanks.

$25 million...Textile-to-textile recycling specialist, Circ, has closed its latest ($25 million) investment round led by Taranis through its Carbon Ventures fund, with continued support from existing strategic investors, including fashion retailer Inditex, and Avery Dennison, a materials science and digital identification solutions company.

This takes the total raised to date to over $100 million.

“This chapter of our journey - scaling textile recycling to an industrial level - requires that we build on our proven technology with world class engineering, operations, and strategic investment from mission-aligned partners,” says Peter Majeranowski, CEO at Circ. “Taranis brings exactly that. Their industrial expertise, paired with our innovation, positions Circ to accelerate the transition to a circular fashion economy.”

3,600...Research from national charging network Be.EV and sporting goods retailer Decathlon shows that EV drivers are more likely to hit the gym than their petrol and diesel counterparts.

The survey of over 3,600 Decathlon shoppers found that EV drivers were more likely to do cardio intensive sports than their petrol and diesel counterparts, such as swimming (57% vs 52%), running (51% vs 46%) and cycling (69% vs 61%).

The survey also showed that EV drivers are more likely to be adrenaline junkies as well, with them listing several sports as hobbies that no petrol or diesel driver respondent named, such as skydiving, cold water swimming and CrossFit.

The research comes as Be.EV launches its new 16-bay ultra-rapid charging hub at Decathlon Wednesbury at Gallagher Retail Park. The chargers at the site can deliver up to 165 miles of range in a 20-minute sto.

The ultra-rapid hub is one of the biggest sites of its kind at any retail park in the Black Country. Gallagher Retail Park is located just off J9 of the M6 - one of the UK’s busiest motorway junctions - with an average daily traffic flow of over 140,000 vehicles.

66%...New research from parcel lockers specialist, InPost, reveals that while 66% of Brits say expressing love is their main reason for gifting, too many are put off by the hassle of traditional delivery methods, with millions of gifts going unsent each year because sending parcels is often expensive, inconvenient or unreliable.

The survey, involving 2,148 Brits, also showed that: Eight in ten of the UK public struggle with missed deliveries, making gift giving stressful and inconvenient; Within a normal week, at least one parcel delivery time is not suitable for two-thirds of the UK population; 93% of the UK public feel positive when they receive a gift.

With their partner and mother top of the list for sending gifts (52% and 45% respectively), and Mother’s Day just around the corner (Sunday 30th March), InPost is calling on the people of the UK to show appreciation and give generously as part of its ‘Send a Little Love” campaign.

1 and 2...Adam Jay, CEO at controversial fashion resale platform Vinted, has once again taken top spot in the Retail Disruptors & Innovators report, released today by Retail Technology Show.

This is an annual report championing progressive individuals from across the sector, who are driving seismic change across the retail landscape.

Jay holds on to his number one position for the second year in a row, for continuing to grow Vinted’s pre-loved marketplace at pace while simultaneously putting second hand and circular retail models back at the forefront of fashion.

He was followed by Carl Pei, Founder and CEO at Nothing, a challenger smartphone and tech brand that’s aiming to make tech and gadgets “fun again” in second place, while third place was shared by brothers and co-founding duo of performance sportswear brand, Castore.

Fashion performed strongly within the top ten disruptors, with high end DTC only fashion brand ME+EM’s Founder, Clare Hornby, coming in fourth, following expansion into the US and a first UK flagship store opened in London.

7.5 million...Currys has been winning plaudits of late for its organic social engagement strategy, with Brand & Marketing Director Dan Rubel taking to LinkedIn to ""shout out the fab team that runs it.""

In a post, Rubel focused on TikTok, noting that, ""our main account lifetime likes has hit 7.5 million (with 2.3 million brought in over the last six months) - whilst competitors aren't in the same race (e.g. John Lewis at 0.8 million lifetime likes, Argos at 0.4 million lifetime likes).""

""There are other UK brands with brilliant TikTok engagement of course (Aldi UK, M&S Food, Lidl GB, Nando's UK & Ireland and Specsavers) and some of those have more lifetime TikTok likes vs. Currys (they got serious about social engagement before we did!).”

""But there's only one UK focused brand we can find that have brought in anywhere near as many likes as Currys over the last six months - that is those chicken lovers over at KFC UK & Ireland. Well done to that team....But most of all (as I am shamelessly biased in my heart).""

$1.6 million...Platter, an e-commerce technology startup, has raised $1.6 million in a pre-seed round.

Animal Capital led the investment with participation from Visionary Ventures, e-commerce veterans Ben Jabbawy, Kyle Hency, Aaron Spivak, Pierson Krass and others.

Platter was founded in 2021 by friends Ben Sharf, Kieran Derfus, and Michael Keenehan. With years of experience in the e-commerce industry, including agency, consulting, and marketplace roles, they identified a common issue: building a high converting Shopify website was too expensive, complicated, and time-consuming for brands of all sizes.

While the company made its name building entire storefronts for Shopify brands, its latest launch offers optimisation tools to a wider set of customers. Platter+, available in the Shopify app store, allows brands to add product upsells, cross-sells, and social proof at their checkout and post-purchase pages in minutes.

“Ben Sharf and the Platter team have thoughtfully created a holistic product offering for e-commerce businesses that makes it simpler, easier, and more intuitive to manage your storefront and maximise profitability,” says Marshall Sandman, Managing Partner at Animal Capital.

40...The likes of The Office co-creator Stephen Merchant, Ted Lasso’s Nick Mohammed, and the UK’s biggest TikToker Kyle Thomas are the latest to unveil red noses as the countdown begins to Red Nose Day on Friday 21st March.

These are available to buy on Amazon, with free, fast delivery promised for all customers on noses and official merchandise from the Comic Relief store.

The merchandise is inspired by the past four decades as Comic Relief marks its 40th birthday year, with items including a 90s inspired bucket hat, collectable pin badges, phone cases, umbrellas, and dog bandanas.

Other products include ‘byAmazon’ Jelly Babies, Fizzy Mini Pencils, tissues, and kitchen roll, with a portion of the proceeds from each product going to Comic Relief to help tackle some of the urgent problems faced by people here in the UK and around the world.

""We are enormously proud to be supporting Comic Relief’s 40th birthday appeal in our third year as the official home of the Red Nose,” says John Boumphrey, UK Country Manager at Amazon. ""Being the home of the Red Nose is just one of the ways our team at Amazon is supporting this year - our Comic Relief store includes noses and merchandise to raise vital funds, and our colleagues are creating and taking part in fundraising activities right across the country. Every nose helps to change lives, and we’ll be wearing ours with pride on Red Nose Day.""

45%...Hybrid shopping has become the dominant path to furniture purchases, according to 3D Cloud’s Furniture Shopping Trends Study, 2025, conducted in partnership with Provoke Insights.

The research, involving 400 furniture purchasers, found that 45% now engage with both digital and in-store channels, reinforcing the need for a seamless omnichannel experience. At the same time, the percentage of consumers shopping exclusively online has increased, particularly among females, while in-store only shopping continues to decline.

“The shift in shopping behaviours underscores the growing reliance on digital experiences,” says Carly Fink, President and Head of Research at Provoke Insights. “Retailers must ensure they are delivering engaging, seamless, and intuitive digital experiences that enhance both online and in-store journeys. Consumers want the best of both worlds - the convenience of online shopping and the tactile confidence of in-store visits.”

Topline results from the study include:

● 45% shopped both online and in-store; 62% of Millennials shopped both channels

● 26% growth in online only shopping

● 46% of shoppers visited websites first before purchasing in a store

● 58% of shoppers want more help with furniture visualisation when visiting stores

● 86% are satisfied with either traditional photos or 3D images, as long as they represent the real product",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/590eeff5b8a79b2147a783be/590ef147e6f2e1fda30e84c5/67d330792e5841678c413bcd/1741931592300/Vinted+new+again+9.jpeg?format=1500w,N,,2025-03-14 11:03:50.849224

“Consumer spending dipped slightly again in February due to the combination of harsh winter weather and declining consumer confidence driven by tariffs, concerns about rising unemployment and policy uncertainty,” says NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay. “Unease about the probability of inflation and paying higher prices for non-discretionary goods has the value-conscious consumer spending less and saving more. But for the moment, year-over-year gains reflect an economy with strong fundamentals.”

Total retail sales, excluding automobiles and gasoline, were down 0.22 percent seasonally adjusted month over month but up 3.38 percent unadjusted year over year in February, according to the Retail Monitor. That compared with a decrease of 1.07 percent month on month and an increase of 5.44 percent year over year in January.

The Retail Monitor calculation of core retail sales (excluding restaurants in addition to automobile dealers and gasoline stations) was also down 0.22 percent month over month in February but up 4.11 percent year over year. That compared with a decrease of 1.27 percent month over month and an increase of 5.72 percent year over year in January.

Total sales were up 4.41 percent year over year for the first two months of the year and core sales were up 4.91 percent. That compares with 3.6 percent growth for the full year in 2024.

The February monthly downturn came after President Donald Trump announced 10 percent tariffs on goods from China and 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico at the beginning of February. The Canada-Mexico tariffs were immediately delayed by a month, then delayed again for most goods until April 2 last week, but the tariffs on China were doubled to 20 percent. The University of Michigan’s Index of Consumer Sentiment dropped to 64.7 in February from 71.7 in January, marking the second monthly decline after five months of small gains.

Unlike survey-based numbers collected by the Census Bureau, the Retail Monitor uses actual, anonymized credit and debit card purchase data compiled by Affinity Solutions and does not need to be revised monthly or annually.

The report adds that ArcelorMittal is committed to sustainability and efficiency improvements, modernizing production facilities, and enhancing low-carbon technologies. While the shift towards heightened blast furnace usage was evident, the reduced output from electric arc furnaces was primarily attributed to the elevated electricity costs impacting strategic decisions.

But now, its admitting what customers have known for years — chicken and drinks are a big deal too.

On Tuesday, the fast-food giant announced it was creating three C-suite roles to analyze menu offerings in three categories: beef, chicken, and beverages and desserts.

It’s a clear sign that McDonald’s is done playing defense in the chicken and drinks wars — and is now taking direct aim at competitors with more specialized menus.

'We’re competing against somebody like a KFC, which is single-mindedly devoted to winning in chicken,' Chris Kempczinski, the company's CEO, said in a video on LinkedIn.

'This category team now allows us to have that same level of focus.'

McDonald's bosses are looking to take on Chick-Fil-A, KFC and Popeyes in the chicken space, and Starbucks and Dutch Bros are key rivals for drinks and desserts.

The move comes as McDonald's is already upping its chicken menu items. It is rolling out chicken tenders and has brought back Snack Wraps.

McDonald’s also in October introduced the Chicken Big Mac to the US for the first time, and plans to bring it back for limited runs in the future.

The fast-food chain is not alone. Other fast-food companies are also trying to build out their chicken-based offerings.

Taco Bell launched a new slate of chicken nuggets and new chicken burritos.

'In a world dominated by chicken cravings, it was time to show the world how Taco Bell does chicken nuggets,' Taco Bell CMO Taylor Montgomery said in a press release.

But McDonald's is also building out beverage offerings as it refocuses on areas of potential growth.

The brand recently launched its CosMc’s beverage-focused concept, serving slushies, iced teas, and coffees.

Most of the drinks carry a sales price between $4 and $6.

So far, the company's launch of the concept stores have been mixed, with some locations reporting hours-long waits for customers.

But the brand is rumored to be thinking about folding the drink-based menus into its franchise stores.

McDonald's recently announced it was shuttering three CosMc's locations with an eye on launching six more in Texas.

Fast flood

In the video, Kempczinski also said the company needed to be 'able to move faster.'

The social media post comes as global competition from brands with simple menus is heating up.

McDonald's recently lost its crown as the largest restaurant by store count to Chinese fast-fooder Mixue, which offers a simple menu of teas, coffees, and ice creams.

The Chinese company (pronounced: ME-Schway) has exploded to 45,000 locations, mostly in Asia. There are 42,000 global McDonald's locations.

McDonald's still boasts plenty of advantages over the Chinese drink brand. Mixue's market valuation is $10 billion, or one-21st the size of McDonald's.

But the Kempczinski's video shows the brand is trying to keep its eye on the ball and maintain its global dominance.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/13/17/96165453-0-image-a-14_1741886996369.jpg,N,,2025-03-14 06:04:09.523120

The reason for the weakening demand in China is that consumers are reducing their spending due to an economic slowdown and property market slump.

The layoffs are part of the company's target to cut costs by about 15% this year.

The plan comes after the beer maker had laid off 16% of some 25,000 employees last year, and it has also been steadily reducing its headcount over the past few years, with the staff size shrinking about 20% by the end of 2023 from more than 30,000 in 2017, according to the report.

On top of this, profits plunged 15% while revenue declined 9% for the entire year as a whole.

Budweiser is not alone as well. Rival brewer Carlsberg also saw a drop in both volume and revenue in China last year.

Q & A Highlights Q: Can you discuss the encouraging signs in consumer spending behavior, particularly regarding basket size and categories?

A: Pierre St-Laurent, COO, noted that same-store sales are trending positively, with significant growth in the Fresh category. Basket sizes are increasing as consumers return to more natural shopping behaviors, focusing on fewer stores with good value offerings.

Q: What is your strategy for converting Instacart and Uber Eats customers to VoilA ?

A: Matthew Reindel, CFO, explained that while it’s early days, the strategy is to convert immediacy-based customers from Instacart and Uber Eats to VoilA. The company is excited about the opportunity and increased sales from these partnerships, but it will take time to analyze data and convert customers.

Q: How will tariffs impact grocery store inflation, and what measures are you taking to mitigate this?

A: Pierre St-Laurent, COO, stated that Empire’s exposure to US products is around 12% and declining. The company is shifting to Canadian and non-US products to mitigate tariff impacts. They are confident that customers will not be interested in paying significantly more for US products, and they have diversified their supply chain to manage potential inflation.

Q: Is VoilA maintaining or growing market share, and are losses improving?

A: Pierre St-Laurent, COO, confirmed that VoilA is experiencing solid double-digit growth and improving financial performance. The focus on existing CFCs is yielding benefits, and partnerships with Instacart and Uber Eats are not causing cannibalization. Matthew Reindel, CFO, added that VoilA is accretive to the business starting in fiscal 2025.

Q: How is Empire maintaining flexibility in a volatile environment?

A: Michael Medline, CEO, emphasized that Empire is well-positioned to handle volatility due to strong cash generation and improved operational execution. The company is focused on maintaining a stable strategy and not reacting to every piece of news, ensuring they remain calm and strong amidst uncertainty.

Q: What are the trends in gross margin and promotional penetration?

A: Pierre St-Laurent, COO, highlighted that gross margin improvements are due to disciplined execution, reduced shrink, and a favorable sales mix with more fresh products. Promotional penetration is slightly declining, contributing positively to margins.

Q: How is the e-commerce market growing, and what is Empire’s position?

A: Michael Medline, CEO, noted that e-commerce penetration is accelerating, contributing to better results from their CFCs. The company is seeing growth in both immediacy and full-basket segments, with VoilA focusing on larger basket sizes.

Q: What are Empire’s cost reduction initiatives, and how will they impact future performance?

A: Matthew Reindel, CFO, outlined initiatives in supply chain, goods not for resale, and organizational restructuring. These efforts are expected to deliver value in the short, medium, and long term, with ongoing benefits from strategic sourcing and supply chain optimization.

“From bean to cup, it’s the people at Starbucks that make us special… The moment of connection between a customer and their barista can mean so much, especially in today’s fast-paced and sometimes isolating world.

“In response to feedback from customers and partners, we also rolled out a new code of conduct that helps create a warm and welcoming environment in every store.

Rate setters mull growth and inflation outlooks in US, UK and Japan

Central bank meetings in the US, UK and Japan are likely to see rates on hold, but will be eagerly watched for clues as the next moves as policymakers juggle differing signals for growth and inflation.

The FOMC decision is due on Wednesday and comes as most nowcast models indicate GDP growth slowing in the first quarter, with some such as the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow currently even pointing to a 2.4% annualized contraction. This looks like it is overstating the weakness, and survey data such as the S&P Global PMI point to a more moderate slowdown, though even the PMI data have fallen sharply to an extent now consistent with a mere 0.6% rate of growth in February. Surveyed companies report demand weakness from federal budget cutting and tariff-related uncertainty.

Meanwhile, lower than expected US CPI readings for February masked a worrying stickiness of underlying inflation, notably in core goods prices, which followed news from the PMI of factory goods prices rising at the sharpest rate for two years. Additional tariffs announced in March will only add to the concerns that the inflation trajectory is heading north. With the Fed still smarting from underestimating inflation after the pandemic, and non-farm payrolls pointing to resiliency in the job market, the markets think there's a high bar to imminent US rate cuts.

In the UK, the Bank of England is also expected to hold rates steady, having reduced its policy rate to 4.5% via a 25 basis point cut in February. The Bank also halved its economic growth forecast for 2025 to just 0.75% in a sign of rising concern about the weaker business and consumer sentiment seen since the tax hikes of the Autumn Budget and global tariff developments. These same factors are, however, also likely to pull inflation higher, meaning that the Bank of England's rate setters also face a juggling act between signs of weaker economic growth and rising inflation expectations.

While the Bank of Japan is also like to be on hold, the next move is expected to be a hike amid signs of higher wage growth. However, concerns are growing about a potential slowing of the Japanese economy amid tariff uncertainty. The February PMI, for example, showed business confidence sliding to a four-year low despite robust current output growth. A weakening of S&P Global's Business Outlook survey likewise underscored the heightened uncertainty facing businesses around the world.

What to watch in the coming week

Americas: FOMC, Banxico meetings; US retail sales, industrial production, building permits, existing home sales data; Canada inflation

The Fed convenes for their March meeting with no changes to interest rates expected according to consensus. The focus will be with the economic projections as the market mulls the potential for further rate cuts in 2025 amid US policy and growth uncertainties. According to the latest S&P Global Investment Manager Index, the majority of US equity investors expect the Fed to lower interest rates by 50 basis points or less in the next 12 months.

On the data front, US retail sales, industrial production and housing data will be released for official insights into February's economic performance. S&P Global US PMI earlier showed manufacturing output growth accelerating, while services PMI - which serves as a good proxy for retail sales performance - slowed midway through the first quarter.

Outside of the US, a central bank meeting in Brazil and Canada's inflation rate and retail sales are highlights.

EMEA: BoE meeting, UK labour data; Germany ZEW survey; Eurozone inflation

The Bank of England (BoE) updates their monetary policy decision on Thursday. According to consensus, more rate cuts are expected in 2025 following the February decision, albeit not at the upcoming meeting. This was amidst an intensification of price pressure, with the latest February PMI data showing the rate of output price inflation remained among the highest in the past year. Meanwhile the UK labour market report will be released for January, with more up-to-date KPMG/REC UK Report on Jobs having shown a further weakening of UK labour market conditions in February.

Final February eurozone inflation data will also be updated alongside trade data and the ZEW investor sentiment survey.

APAC: BoJ, BI meetings; China industrial production, retail sales data; Japan inflation and trade data; New Zealand GDP

Central bank meetings in Japan and Indonesia are convened in the coming week with no changes to rates expected according to consensus. The focus instead will be with the series of data releases including activity data out of mainland China and also inflation and trade data from Japan. Latest Caixin China PMI data revealed that February's business activity growth had been the fastest in three months, supported by improvements across both manufacturing and service sectors.

Under the new pricing, the signature Big Mac meal will cost 7,400 won ($5.09) beginning Thursday, up by 200 won from the current 7,200 won, according to the company.

The bulgogi burger, cheeseburger and six other meal sets are also subject to the price hike.

This marks the second price increase in less than a year. McDonald's Korea had raised the prices of 16 menu items by around 3 percent last May, citing increased costs in food, logistics and labor.

The upcoming price increase is in line with the nationwide trend of rising food prices as many major food companies have announced price hikes in response to growing costs partly caused by recent political uncertainties.

Nongshim, Korea's leading instant noodle maker, will raise the prices of its 17 products next week.

CJ CheilJedang has already increased the prices of its Bibigo dumplings and other processed foods this month, while Dongwon F&B has also adjusted its product prices.

The bakery and cafe sectors are also seeing similar trends. SPC Group, which operates bakery and donut brands Paris Baguette and Dunkin Donuts, has raised prices of bread and donuts. Lotte Wellfood and Binggrae have increased prices of snacks and ice cream.

Coffee brands have also joined the move, with Starbucks Korea, Hollys and Paul Bassett raising their coffee prices in January.

According to government data, Korea's processed food price index increased 2.9 percent from a year earlier in February, marking the highest on-year gain in 13 months. (Yonhap)",https://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/thumbnailV2/e590a5001b97475eaed7c13023e00631.jpg,N,,2025-03-14 06:04:18.441463

Americans have been seeking out cheaper versions of products—or trading down—while closings at some competing retailers has been giving Dollar General a chance at winning over new shoppers, CEO Todd Vasos said on an earnings call Thursday. The company earlier today reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter sales but missed profit estimates.

Trading down has accelerated through the end of 2024 and the beginning of 2025, according to Vasos. He said the trend could be good for Dollar General, which owns its namesake stores along with pOpShelf, a retail concept with slightly pricier items than the bargain brand.

“We’re squarely focused on ensuring that we have our best foot forward. So when these customers come in our stores, they become sticky and continue to shop with us,"" Vasos said, according to a transcript made available by AlphaSense.

Americans' focus on saving has some downsides for Dollar General, though. The company's core lower-income consumers have been financially squeezed, Vasos said. The company gained market share in some categories, but sales of seasonal home goods and apparel were sluggish, he said.

""Many of our customers report that [they] only have enough money for basic essentials, with some noting that they have had to sacrifice even on the necessities,"" Vasos said.

Expanding home delivery is part of Dollar General's plan to build its customer base. About 400 stores currently offer delivery through a partnership with DoorDash (DASH), and the option may be available at 10,000 stores by the end of the year, Vasos said.

While Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) have made inroads with delivery services, Dollar General will stand out, Vasos said, because it can quickly get goods to rural residents. And Dollar General delivery orders are larger on average than what customers spend in store and could lead to improved loyalty.

Enrique Lores

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, HP, Inc.

Thank you, Orit, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. Q1 was a strong start to the year. We delivered top line revenue growth, increased momentum across our key growth areas and maintained our focus on positioning HP for long-term success.

Today, I will focus on three main areas. First, our Q1 results and key innovation highlights; second, a deeper dive on our business unit performance; and finally, I will share our outlook for the year ahead, including the actions we are taking to respond to evolving market conditions, while continuing to fuel our long-term growth.

Let me now turn to our Q1 results. Overall, we delivered revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter, up 2% year-over-year. This was largely driven by growth in our Personal Systems, commercial business and key growth areas. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.74 was slightly above the midpoint of our guide.

Operating profit margins for both Print and Personal Systems were in line with our expectations. These results demonstrate our ability to deliver on our commitments and execute our strategy to build a stronger HP.

Last quarter, I outlined our ambition to lead the future of work. We know companies need highly productive workforces to drive growth and employees are seeking fulfillment in the work they do. With our robust portfolio of PCs, printers, peripherals and more, we not only have a unique competitive advantage, but we sit at the intersection of this opportunity.

I am pleased to report we are making solid progress against our strategy. We are doubling down on our efforts in the commercial segment and aggressively investing and innovating in new AI and software capabilities. As an example of that, we recently entered into an agreement to acquire strategic assets from Humane. Once completed, we will benefit from their AI-powered platform Cosmos, highly skilled technical team and hundreds of patents.

With this acquisition, we will accelerate our plans to build an intelligent ecosystem across all HP devices, from AI PCs to smart printers and connected conference rooms. We look forward to boosting our technology and innovation organization by integrating the Humane team to HP.

HP, Inc. (HPQ)

Q1 2025 Earnings Call

27-Feb-2025

We're also realigning our key growth areas to reflect the shift of our investment focus on the future of work. In addition to hybrid systems, workforce solutions, consumer subscriptions, industrial graphics and 3D, we are now including AI PCs and advanced compute solutions, such as workstations and retail solutions.

Gaming will no longer be one of the key growth areas and will instead be managed as part of our core portfolio because even though it will continue to be a very important business for us, is not directly related to the future of work. Collectively, we expect these realigned key growth areas to continue to grow faster than the core and to be accretive to our margins over time.

Turning to our innovation highlights. In Q1, our vision for the future of work was brought to life at CES with AI- powered innovations. For example, we announced several new models of AI PCs. We are empowering professionals with faster decision making an effective collaboration with the EliteBook Ultra, adapting to how and where people work best, our EliteBook X offers flexibility and enhanced security protection.

And these new PCs now bring HP's award-winning AI companion to our Intel platforms. And for product designers and data scientists, the ZBook Ultra recognized with the best laptop award at CES, can help manage complex projects and datasets with ease. We are strengthening the end-to-end experience of hybrid workers with Thunderbolt Dock. With a quick connect docking experience, employees are instantly connected to their workspace before they even sit down at their desk.

In gaming, we introduced OMEN AI beta, a groundbreaking software innovation that automatically adjusts for optimized performance. Our customer-centric approach also expands our print innovation. To meet the growing demand for convenience, we recently added Smart Tank printers to our HP all-in subscription plans. This all- inclusive print program has strongly resonated with our customers.

In Industrial, we're empowering print providers with new equipment and capabilities. With the introduction of two game-changing HP PageWide presses, we are delivering high-speed, high-quality print production. As we continue to innovate, we remain committed to technology that fosters connections, improves access and support sustainability. In 2024, HP reached nearly 20 million people through digital equity programs and partnerships. And I am proud to share earlier this month, HP jumped to the number two spot on America's Most Just Companies list.

Our progress were driven in large part by how we invest in our employees, support our communities and treat our customers. We were recognized as the leader in our industry for all three.

In a few weeks, we will host Amplify, our flagship conference to engage with customers and partners. This event provides an opportunity to share our vision and the progress we have made including how we are delivering AI- powered innovation and technology experience.

This past quarter, HP led the way in shaping the future of work. Thanks to the dedication of our talented team, and I want to take the opportunity to thank all of them.

Let me now turn to Personal Systems performance for the quarter. Revenue was up 5% year-over-year, with conversion continuing to power the growth more than offsetting a decline in consumer and continued softness in China. We drove share gains in the PC commercial windows market, particularly in high-value categories such as commercial premiums.

HP, Inc. (HPQ)

Q1 2025 Earnings Call

27-Feb-2025

However, we lost share in consumer with units down year-over-year. While our strategy is not to gain share for the sake of gaining share, you should expect us to improve our performance through the year in this segment, especially in the premium category.

Worldwide PC commercial revenue grew 10% year-over-year, fueled in part by the growing adoption of AI PCs and the positive impact of the Windows 11 refresh cycles. The AI PC market experienced remarkable momentum achieving a sequential growth rate of 25% in calendar quarter four, and we continued to gain share in this market.

We believe the refresh cycle, combined with an increasing mix of AI PCs will further propel our commercial growth through fiscal year 2025 and beyond. Internally, we are empowering our teams with enhanced AI tools. Going forward, all new PCs we purchase will be AI PC, giving our teams greater insights and helping them better address customers' needs.

In our growth areas, hybrid systems, advanced compute and AI PCs, delivered strong performance with revenue up year-over-year. We believe there is more opportunity here, and we'll continue to prioritize investments in these categories.

Shifting to Print. We saw strong unit growth and share gains in home and specifically Big Tanks. In office, we maintained our share overall, and importantly, gained share in our strategic areas, A4 value and A3. We continue to see a competitive pricing market in office and weak demand in China that will continue to push us to improve our operational execution.

For the Print business, revenue declined 1% in constant currency year-over-year, in line with our expectations. In growth areas, consumer subscriptions revenue and subscribers grew year-over-year. This quarter, we achieved a milestone of 1 million instant paper subscribers with double-digit revenue growth, and we continue to drive revenue growth in industrial graphics.

In Workforce Solutions, momentum continued with revenue growth year-over-year. We had several new managed print wins during the quarter, including Prime Healthcare. This new customer in a growing industry enables us to support variety journey covering 44 hospitals and more than 45,000 employees.

And we saw notable wins in managed device services in multiple verticals, which include automotive, industrial, banking, agriculture and pharmaceuticals in multiple geographies. The range of deals demonstrates our ability to close and manage diverse customer deals around the globe.

Before I close, it's important that I take a moment to share the efforts underway to address the evolving external environment. We have been tracking geopolitical developments and are well prepared to respond to these shifting dynamics. Over the past few years, we have taken proactive measures to ensure manufacturing resiliency.

We have built a globally diverse supply chain, and we are continuing to expand our footprint across multiple countries to meet growing customer demand and bolster multi-source production. We have made significant progress. And by the end of fiscal year 2025, we expect more than 90% of HP products sold in North America will be built outside of China. China will continue to be an important manufacturing hub for the rest of the world.

As we look ahead, we are managing the current tariff increases on China and have included them in our outlook. Should additional tariffs be implemented, we would manage them the same way we have with China, leveraging the flexibility of our global supply chain network, along with cost improvements and pricing actions as needed.

HP, Inc. (HPQ)

Q1 2025 Earnings Call

27-Feb-2025

Depending on the scope, while some of our mitigating actions can take a few months lead time we would be focused on fully offsetting over time.

During the first two years of our Future Ready plan, we have made excellent progress across process efficiency, automation, portfolio optimization and operational excellence. This has given us visibility in traditional opportunities aligned to our future of work strategy.

There is even more we can do to reduce our structural costs and we now plan to deliver $1.9 billion in gross annual run rate structural savings by the end of fiscal year 2025. These incremental structural savings will help mitigate macro and geopolitical uncertainty while continuing to support investments in strategic areas. Karen will share more details about this shortly.

I will close by reiterating our confidence in our full year outlook and our ability to deliver on our strategy to lead the future of work. As demonstrated in Q1, we have continued to build strong momentum while taking the measures necessary to mitigate risks, navigate policy changes and importantly, invest in our long-term growth.

Let me now turn it over to Karen.

Karen L. Parkhill

Chief Financial Officer, HP, Inc.

Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our first quarter results and the solid progress on delivering towards our financial commitments for the year.

We drove revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter with continued strength in the Personal Systems commercial business and momentum in our key growth areas. We also gained share in a stabilizing print market, while executing against our plan to drive strong operating margins.

We have made excellent progress in accelerating our Future Ready plans. And as Enrique said, have increased the gross annualized run rate savings target for the program by the end of fiscal year 2025. And through disciplined execution and rigorous cost management, we delivered on our EPS commitments, while maintaining important investments in strategic areas, including the future of work.

Now taking a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was up 2% nominally and 3% in constant currency with growth across all regions. In constant currency, APJ grew 5%, Americas grew 3% and EMEA grew 2%.

Gross margin was 21%, down year-over-year due to increased commodity costs. As mentioned last quarter, we have put in place cost reduction and pricing actions to offset these headwinds. However, they will take time to ramp through the year, leading to stronger margins in the second half.

Non-GAAP operating expenses were up year-over-year, reflecting continued investment in key strategic initiatives and our people, offset in part by disciplined cost management, including Future Ready cost savings. All in, non- GAAP operating profit was $984 million, in line with our expectations.

Below the op profit line, non-GAAP net OI&E was also in line with our expectations and flat year-over-year with lower levels of short-term financing activity offset by higher currency-related losses. Finally, with a diluted share count of approximately 960 million shares, our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.74.

HP, Inc. (HPQ)

Q1 2025 Earnings Call

27-Feb-2025

Now, let's turn to segment performance. We drove solid growth in Personal Systems with revenue up 5%, both nominally and in constant currency from higher commercial volumes and increased ASPs as we continue to take disciplined pricing actions to help mitigate increased component costs.

We are focused on leading the future of work and doubling down on commercial, which represented over 70% of our PS revenue mix for the quarter. We also drove strong performance in key growth areas across AI PCs, Advanced Compute Solutions and Hybrid Systems.

Aligned with our strategy, we drove commercial revenue up 10% on 6% unit growth with stronger pricing and mix shift towards premium in a market that is beginning to show signs of accelerating refresh activity. However, the consumer market remained competitive, with revenue down 7% on lower volume as a result of our strategy to rebalance our portfolio to a more profitable mix.

Our operating margin in PS was 5.5%, in line with the range we guided at the beginning of the quarter and down year-over-year from higher commodity costs that were not yet fully offset by repricing and cost initiatives. We also continued to invest in important strategic initiatives.

In Print, our results reflect our focus on profitable unit placement and disciplined execution. While total Print revenue was down 2%, we increased our market share with strong performance in consumer hardware.

We also drove double-digit revenue growth in Consumer Subscriptions and maintained momentum in Industrial. By customer segment, we grew consumer 5% year-over-year on 7% unit growth and drove share gains with double-digit growth in Big Tank.

In commercial, while units were flat year-over-year, revenue declined 7% in a competitive pricing environment, particularly in China, where the market remains weak. We continued our purposeful focus on profitable long-term unit growth, gaining share in the higher-value categories of A4 and A3 and across all markets in the Americas and EMEA.

We increased market share and drove favorable pricing and supplies, though revenue declined 1% with currency and usage headwinds. And we delivered Print operating margin at the high end of our range, as expected, reflecting rigorous cost discipline in a competitive market.

Now turning to our Future Ready plan. We have continued to drive progress, not only accelerating our initial plan, but also identifying additional initiatives to further reduce costs in our core and drive efficiencies. Given this, we are raising our cumulative gross run rate savings target from $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion by the end of fiscal year 2025.

We expect restructuring charges associated with the plan to increase by approximately $150 million to $1.2 billion and anticipate approximately $400 million in charges this fiscal year as we complete the program. These incremental structural savings will be a key lever to help offset macro and geopolitical uncertainties, while also continuing to fuel investments in our key growth areas and AI innovation, all designed to position us well for long- term sustainable growth.

Now, let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. As expected, our cash flow from operations was approximately $375 million in the quarter, and free cash flow was $70 million. Our results reflect normal seasonality associated with the timing of variable compensation payments and sequentially lower volumes in Personal Systems.

HP, Inc. (HPQ)

Q1 2025 Earnings Call

27-Feb-2025

With regard to working capital, as part of the tariff response actions, we purposely produced additional inventory and also took advantage of strategic buy opportunities as part of overall cost mitigations. While these actions will be economically beneficial to the year, they increased our cash conversion cycle.

And as we pay for and sell the increased inventory, we anticipate a further impact in cash conversion, resulting in negative free cash flow in Q2. It is important to note that these are timing impacts only and do not impact our full year outlook. Lastly, we returned close to $400 million to shareholders through both share repurchase and dividends and finished the quarter within our target leverage range.

As we look ahead, we will continue to monitor the evolving geopolitical environment. And as Enrique mentioned, we have been focused for some time on response plans to mitigate potential adverse impacts. In both our full year and Q2 guide, we have accounted for the added cost driven by the current tariffs on China and associated mitigations, including our higher Future Ready cost reductions. I would note that those tariffs mostly impact our Personal Systems business.

Though the environment ahead remains fluid, we will be focused on offsetting any additional tariffs with further leveraging the flexibility of our global supply chain network, along with cost and pricing actions as needed.

We continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.45 and to $3.75. FY 2025 GAAP diluted net earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.86 to $3.16 including increased restructuring costs for our Future Ready plan.

As we said at the beginning of the year, we expect EPS to be stronger in the second half with consistent levels of sequential growth each quarter. Normal seasonal strength in Personal Systems, combined with the timing of the Windows 11 refresh and increased penetration of AI PCs are catalysts that we expect to drive revenue strength in the back half of the year.

And we continue to execute on our plans to offset commodity costs, including repricing efforts and cost reduction actions that are ramping and will have a more significant impact in the second half. These actions and the overall measures we are taking to deliver incremental structural cost savings from our Future Ready plans are expected to drive EPS improvement throughout the year, particularly in Q4.

There is no change to our beginning of the year projection for print revenue to grow at least in line with the market in fiscal year 2025. And we now expect Personal Systems to grow faster than the market, driven by share gains in commercial.

Our focus on premium categories, including AI PC, is also expected to contribute to increased levels of revenue growth in the second half. We continue to expect PS operating margins to be in the upper half of our 5% to 7% range for the year due to the actions I described earlier as well as the sustained efforts to drive higher ASPs through the increased mix of premium products.

And for Print, we continue to expect our operating margins to be near the top of our 16% to 19% long-term range, as we exercise disciplined cost management and execute on our Future Ready plans.

For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.85 and GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.72. In Personal Systems, we expect Q2 revenue to

perform better than typical seasonality as we continue to see strength in commercial aligned with our future of work efforts.

And we expect Personal Systems margins to remain in the lower half of the 5% to 7% range given the timing of tariff mitigation. In Print, we expect Q2 year-over-year revenue growth to be in line with full year growth rates and operating margins to remain near the top of our 16% to 19% range, as we continue to focus on profitable unit placement and disciplined cost management.

And just to note, we expect corporate other expense to continue to be higher in Q2, though not as high as Q1 with the timing of some stock compensation expenses. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion for FY 2025 with the second half of the year stronger than the first.

And on capital allocation, we remain committed to returning approximately 100% of free cash flow to shareholders overtime, as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2 times, and there aren't better return opportunities.

In closing, we drove solid progress in Q1 against our strategic objectives and full year commitments, while taking action that will help us navigate through the dynamic geopolitical environment. We remain focused on disciplined execution, as we continue to invest for the future and believe we are well positioned to deliver long-term profitable growth.

With that, I would like to hand it back to the operator, and open the call for your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION

Operator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Yes, of course. I think, first of all is, we expect the market to continue to grow, especially in commercial as we have seen during the last two quarters. And the key drivers of that, first is the aging of installed base, second the Windows 11 refresh and third, to some extent, the penetration of AI PCs. This is what is driving that.

Then in this market, we are performing well, we are driving significant innovation. We have a strong sales team and this has been driving our progress and driving the better competitive position that we have and the improvement that we have made. Of course, pricing is part of it, also because of mix. Our focus, as you know, is to grow in the most profitable premium categories. This is what we are doing, and this is impacting our results, and this will continue to impact our results through the end of the year.

Q3 Earnings on Tap When Nike reports its third-quarter results on March 20, at 4:15 pm ET, Wall Street will be looking for earnings of $0.27 per share on revenues of $11.01 billion.
The stock was trading lower on Thursday afternoon, after opening the session at $73.58.","Nike, Inc. (NYSE: NKE) is expected to report third-quarter results on March 20, after the close of regular trading. The sneaker giant has adopted a strategy focused on aggressive sports marketing and innovations centered on its sports-led portfolio. While those efforts are expected to drive a turnaround, it may take some time before the company regains its former glory.

Nike’s stock has yet to fully recover from the selloff it suffered in mid-2024, and the downturn has extended into the current year, though there were short-lived rebounds. The stock experienced further weakness ahead of next week’s earnings, ending the last trading session close to the levels seen at the beginning of the year. That is below its 52-week average value of $82.25. However, considering the company’s brand power and growth initiatives under the new leadership, NKE appears to be an attractive long-term investment.

Q3 Earnings on Tap

When Nike reports its third-quarter results on March 20, at 4:15 pm ET, Wall Street will be looking for earnings of $0.27 per share on revenues of $11.01 billion. That suggests a deterioration from the prior-year quarter when the company earned $0.77 per share and generated revenues of $12.43 billion.

In the second quarter of 2025, Nike returned approximately $1.6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and through share repurchases. It ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $9.8 billion. Total revenues decreased 8% annually to $12.4 billion in the November quarter.

Under Elliott Hill, a long-term Nike veteran who took the helm as the new CEO a few months ago, the company realigned its priorities to overcome the recent sales slump, and a key strategy is to return to its sports roots. The initiative is significant since the company is facing increased competition from others like Adidas and Puma as well as newer more innovative players. Nike has often faced criticism for its decision to pull back from certain long-standing retail partners like Footlocker and to excessively focus on direct-to-customer sales. Additionally, the company is experiencing a sales slowdown in China, one of the largest markets outside the U.S.

In the second-quarter earnings call, Elliott Hill said, “Moving forward, we will lead with sport and put the athlete at the center of every decision. The sharpness in each sport is what differentiates our brand and our business, and fuels our culture. Another observation is that the reliance on a handful of sportswear silhouettes is not who we are. We will get back to leveraging deep athlete insights to accelerate innovation, design, product creation, and storytelling. Sport is what authenticates our brand.”

Sales Dip

Sales of footwear and apparel, which together account for more than 90% of Nike’s total revenues, declined in Q2, partially offset by an increase in equipment sales. Demand declined across all geographical regions. Consequently, net income decreased by double digits to $1.2 billion or $0.78 per share. Meanwhile, both revenues and the bottom line exceeded expectations, marking their second consecutive beat.

NKE’s performance has been lackluster so far this week. The stock was trading lower on Thursday afternoon, after opening the session at $73.58.",https://cdn.news.alphastreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Nike-Q2-2025-Earnings-Infographic-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-13 16:07:29.851895

“The actions we are taking today give me confidence we will emerge stronger when the powersports market returns to growth,” comments Mike Speetzen, Polaris CEO.
We downshifted through the course of the year (2024).” The CEO says Polaris helped dealers during that transition period by providing things like extended flooring.
Speetzen says that dealer inventory will continue to be a big focus in 2025 as Polaris navigates this promo environment.","Polaris Inc. hosted its 2025 Capital Markets Day meeting on Wednesday, March 12. During the event, Polaris provided an overview of the powersports industry and the company’s long-term strategy to remain an industry leader while executing a number of initiatives to meet its mid-cycle financial targets. During the two-hour-long briefing, Polaris’ leadership also discussed its commitment to dealers, innovation, and customers.

“The actions we are taking today give me confidence we will emerge stronger when the powersports market returns to growth,” comments Mike Speetzen, Polaris CEO. “Our teams are focused in the right areas to not only continue our leadership in powersports but also to improve the financial strength of Polaris, which I believe will ultimately lead to creating shareholder value.”

Speetzen says the current market environment needs some context. He thought it was a good opportunity to provide an update on the market conditions, which weren’t at the top of his mind when the meeting invites were sent out in September. “We weren’t necessarily thinking about the current environment [in September]. The point of this discussion is to reinforce the strategy and talk more long-term about the setup that we’ve got going for the company, which we think is strong when we talk about this down cycle that we’re in.”

According to Speetzen, a recession is defined as two successive down quarters. “You look at each one of our segments, and we’re well past that. That’s no surprise to most of you; there’s been a lot of fallout from this. It’s a bit staggering when you look at the number of competitors who are either exiting categories, shutting down completely, or have filed for bankruptcy and gone through that process.

Speetzen says Polaris is the best house in a recovering neighborhood. “We’re trying to work on ensuring that this company is positioned incredibly well so that when the recovery comes, we will be positioned better than anybody else to take advantage of that and grow the company.”

Promos

Speetzen acknowledges they’ve fielded a lot of questions about promotions. “Yes, it is elevated,” he says flatly. “We’ve got consumers who are stressed. From a debt perspective, interest rates are high, but we also have a lot of competitors who haven’t managed their inventory with our level of discipline, which puts a lot of pressure on the market.”

Speetzen says they won’t respond to all of the channel’s promotional activity and that Polaris will not discount its newer technology. “Quite frankly, that’s not sustainable share, so we’re trying to be as disciplined as we can and make sure that we’re pointing promo in the right areas, whether that’s targeted offers to specific consumers, broad offer categories getting aggressive around financing, given that interest rates are likely to stay high for longer.”

Speetzen also discussed the EV category and its expanded relationship with Zero Motorcycles. “We talked about EV at our last Capital Markets Day. I still feel good about the positioning that we took. If you remember, I said I didn’t think EVs would move rapidly through powersports. There are a lot more challenges within the powersports category. And in fact, that’s what made us different than most. We listened to customers and let that guide where we went…”

Polaris is not investing in electric vehicles at the same levels they thought they would previously. “At this point, just given how much slower that market has developed, we are continuing to make advancements. And I’ll be honest with you: we learned a lot through this relative to connected vehicles; we’ve been able to watch and see how consumers are using that, and that’s feeding back into how we’re thinking about the development of the next generation of vehicles. And we also partnered with Zero Motorcycles to get our powertrain up and running quickly. We’ve since modified the relationship with them.”

Speetzen remarks that they reduced their salaried workforce by about 10%, many of which were at the vice president level. “That shows how we’ve flattened the organization, and it will allow us, as the recovery comes, to keep our operating expenses down and put ourselves in a position to leverage that as we go into the future.”

Dealers

The Polaris CEO continues to highlight its commitment to dealers. “[We’re] going to be with dealers in Nashville in a couple of weeks for a dealer council meeting. We will take them to our Huntsville plant and walk them through what we’re doing with Lean. They have a lot of curiosity around that, and we are listening to what they’re talking about. We take it seriously. Given how rapidly the market moved down, it was about getting the dealer inventory down. That was a challenging thing for us to accomplish.

Dealers have pushed back on inventory to keep them at acceptable levels for the market conditions. Speetzen says that is a priority, but Polaris is a huge company. “We’ve got supply chains that are in motion. We had materials on the ocean four weeks out, and we’ve got factories that we’ve got to manage. We’ve got employees to contend with in terms of ensuring we’re managing that system. We downshifted through the course of the year (2024).”

The CEO says Polaris helped dealers during that transition period by providing things like extended flooring. “We did things like providing additional promo to help dealers navigate through that challenging time period, and I’m proud that we got inventory down 16%. We led the industry and made sure that we held firm to that commitment. We’ve had a lot of questions about inventory in 2025, and there are still pockets that we have to make adjustments to.”

The lack of snowfall during the season and in the flatlands has put a lot of pressure on Polaris’ snowmobile business, Speetzen notes. “We’ve cut the [snowmobile] builds to get our inventory down. And we’re making a few minor tweaks in the marine segment. Then, within off-road, we’re bringing the recreation side down a bit more, given the persistent weakness in that category, and pulling the utility side up, given it remains stronger year-over-year than the recreational side of the business.”

R&D

When asked about cutting some of the R&D budget, Speetzen says firmly they won’t do that. “We learned a lot through the last down cycle. Polaris became number one because we kept investing, outpaced the Japanese, and overtook them all. And we’re not going to back off of that. The products we’ve come out with over the past four years is pretty impressive, but it’s not going to stop.”

Speetzen outlines that innovation will be the key for Polaris to gain market share in the future. “Once this starts to recover, we want the right products that customers will want, and we think we got ourselves well positioned to do that.”

Ridership

Speetzen emphasizes Polaris’s partnership with its dealers and how they’ve been able to grow the sport. “We’ve brought in over 1 million new customers. Powersports is a business that has many recurring, repeat customers. The fact that we’ve brought in over a million new customers, I think, speaks to the strength of the brand.”

Ridership is up 10% compared to the time period before Covid, Speetzen notes. “It’s a great indicator for us now, and a lot happened from pre-Covid to where we are today. We saw a surge in demand in 2021-’22. We also saw a surge in ridership during that time period, starting in ’23 and tailing off. And that correlates pretty heavily with people returning to the office.”

Interest Rates

With interest rates still high, Speetzen says it has created some fatigue and a lot of pressure in the market. “The tariff situation makes that worse. People are worried because they’re unsure if daily life will return to being more expensive. The report that inflation came down a tick and was slightly better than people expected at 2.8, but every article I read said this has no impact. And I think you have consumers stepping back on big-ticket items.

Speetzen says that dealer inventory will continue to be a big focus in 2025 as Polaris navigates this promo environment. “Just yesterday, we rolled out some promos for finance interest. My message to the team has been that we have to remain agile. We can’t put a promo plan together once a quarter and then look at it. This is a daily thing that we’ve got to manage. And from a tariff standpoint, it changes by the hour, and anything that we would say today will probably be wrong tomorrow.”",https://powersportsbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apolaris_MikeSpeetzen_9097_V1_rgb_web2-edited.jpg,N,,2025-03-13 16:07:40.425074

Software bug at firm left NHS data ‘vulnerable to hackers’

The NHS is investigating whether a software flaw in referrals provider Medefer’s technology could have left patient data vulnerable to hackers.

Medefer, which is a private medical services company, handles around 1,500 NHS patient referrals every month, but a software engineer reportedly discovered a vulnerability in its system last November.

The engineer believes the problem may have existed for more than six years, although Medefer has stressed that there is no evidence that any patient data has been compromised.

The flaw was fixed within days of it being discovered, but the NHS confirmed to the BBC it was looking into “concerns raised about Medefer” and said action would be taken, if necessary.

The discovery comes at a time when hackers are increasingly targeting healthcare providers. Last year, hackers breached an Arizona-based hospice pharmacy, one point Patient Care, in just one example of the sector coming under attack.

Vodafone UK and Ericsson trial AI solutions for improved 5G energy efficiency

Vodafone UK has today announced that it has conducted trials with Ericsson of three new Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) powered software solutions.

The trial, which took place across select London sites, found that the British telco was able to reduce the daily power consumption of its 5G radio units by 33%.

Vodafone harnessed Ericsson’s latest Service Continuity AI App suite with “Intelligent Energy Efficiency”, which claims to “dynamically manage the network’s energy needs without compromising on performance”, supporting operators to reduce both their operating expenditure (OPEX) and carbon emissions.

As part of the trial, Vodafone UK implemented three key use cases: 5G Deep Sleep, 4G Cell Sleep Mode orchestration, and a Radio Power Efficiency Heatmap. These features are designed to work in tandem to measure, predict and optimise energy consumption across the network, with the ability to power down components during low traffic periods and rapidly reactivate them when needed.",https://i0.wp.com/techinformed.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/shutterstock_2102809798.jpg,N,,2025-03-13 16:07:23.231280

“We’re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,” CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.
By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.
Last year, months before filing for Chapter 11, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks.
Shares of Spirit previously issued by Spirit Airlines Inc. was canceled upon its exit from bankruptcy — but it expects to re-list shares, newly-issued under new owners, “as soon as reasonably practicable.”","NEW YORK -- Discount carrier Spirit Airlines has emerged from bankruptcy protection.

The budget airline — known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of yellow planes — said Wednesday that its parent, Spirit Aviation Holdings, exited Chapter 11 after finalizing debt restructuring. The reorganization plan, which received the court greenlight last month, aims to bring the carrier back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals.

“We’re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,” CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.

The restructuring deal allows Spirit to convert $795 million of its debt into equity. The company says it's also received a $350 million equity investment from existing investors to aid future operations.

Spirit filed for bankruptcy back in November, following years of struggles and mounting debt as it failed to bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Florida carrier was particularly hit hard by rising operating expenses and stiffer competition. By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.

Whether Spirit will continue as a standalone airline has also been up in the air, although takeover attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier have proven to be unsuccessful before and during the bankruptcy process. Spirit rejected a third bid from Frontier last month.

While future merger proposals may not be entirely off the table, Spirit signaled Wednesday that it would continue to focus its own growth and offerings. Christie noted that the airline would be ""moving forward with our strategy to redefine low-fare travel with our new, high-value travel options.”

In an evolution from its budget-exclusive roots, Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities. Last year, months before filing for Chapter 11, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks.

In a message sent to Spirit customers Wednesday, Christie continued to point those four travel options from the airline, which he said “let you choose how you want to fly.""

Wednesday's announcement also noted plans to trade shares publicly again, although not immediately. Shares of Spirit previously issued by Spirit Airlines Inc. was canceled upon its exit from bankruptcy — but it expects to re-list shares, newly-issued under new owners, “as soon as reasonably practicable.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/9be8ade6-bcbe-4e9a-810d-4a38b76c5aff/wirestory_edc447376df95d7a0791fc8b22c689cf_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-03-13 19:07:09.454447

Bloomberg reported the company’s Budweiser Brewing Co APAC Ltd unit was looking to make cost cuts of 15% this year by trimming thousands from its headcount, on top of a 16% workforce reduction of 25,000 employees last year.

However, the company was swift to refute the report. “The news report about thousands of job cuts planned for Asia in 2025 is not true,” ABInBev spokesperson told Reuters. “We will continue our long-term investment in China.”

BUD China Sales Falter

ABInBev, which owns premium brands such as Stella Artois and Corona, is facing challenges in its Asia-Pacific business amid weakness in China which is dampening the positive uplift elsewhere. Sales volumes in China fell 19% in the Fiscal fourth quarter, with the contraction accelerating from a 14.2% fall in Q3. The brewer said it is being affected by softness in the Chinese market as customers switched products amid low consumer sentiment. In contrast, the company saw high single-digit growth in South Korea.

Globally beer demand slackened, led by China and Argentina, with total volumes declining by 1.9% in Q4, driven by a 2.1% drop in beer volumes, while non-beer volumes were down by 1.1%. Excluding China and Argentina volumes globally grew by 0.9% across the 2024 Fiscal year but overall performance was “significantly constrained” by weakness in these two countries, the company said, resulting in a total volume decline of 1.4%.

U.S. Market Recovers

But gains from its Michelob Ultra and Busch Light brands that helped drive a return to U.S. sales growth in the third quarter continued as it gained market share again in Q4.

Two years ago, the company laid off 350 employees, about 2% of its corporate staff, in the U.S. amid faltering sales of Bud Light after conservative boycotts over the company’s partnership with influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The backlash is thought to have cost the brewer up to $1.4 billion in lost sales. In January 2024, the company told Bloomberg it had laid off an unspecified number of workers in its U.S. sales division.

Is BUD a Good Stock to Buy?

Overall, Wall Street has a Strong Buy rating on BUD stock based on four analysts offering 12-month price targets in the last three months. The average BUD price target of $69.60 suggests 11% upside.

We experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2015 as compared to the same period in the prior year.
2017 The Company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2017 as compared to the same period in the prior year.
2018 The Company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2018 as compared to the same period in the prior year.
Every single year, Walgreens told investors it was getting worse reimbursement rates, and it expected that trend to continue.","I enjoy Scott Galloway’s podcast Prof G Markets, and I was listening to him and co-host Ed Elson discuss why the private equity giant Sycamore Partners - which specializes in squeezing blood out of failing retailers - is buying Walgreens for $10 billion. Walgreens is America’s second-largest drug store chain, and has been a public company for more than 100 years. “Going private,” particularly to a fund like Sycamore, is an admission of failure.

The trends for Walgreens aren’t good - it has closed a thousand stores since 2018, and plans to shut 1,200 more this year. And if you look at the gross operating income of the U.S. retail segment, it is collapsing.

What’s going on? Well that’s simple. Margins are falling apart.

Galloway and Elson went back and forth on why Walgreens is flailing. The company hasn’t modernized in the age of Amazon. It has too many stores. Bad management. A dumb acquisition of VillageMD in 2021. Etc. And these would seem like reasonable causes, since lots of other retailers are dying in the face of low price competition.

But the real reason Walgreens, and the pharmacy business in general, is dying, is because of a failure to enforce antitrust laws against unfair business methods and illegal mergers. Elson touched on it when he mentioned lower reimbursement rates, but I don’t think people appreciate the full scope of what happened to Walgreens, and to the full pharmacy business in general. This is not a case of bad management, it’s a case of desperate management.

Let’s start by noting that on first blush, Walgreens should be fine. It’s a historic company, and a historically powerful one. In 1901, pharmacist Charles Walgreen created the first Walgreens store, and he was an aggressive and entrepreneurial founder. He did some of his own drug manufacturing, and quickly expanded Walgreens to 100 stores within 25 years. The chain invented the malted milkshake in 1922, and that decade it took advantage of prohibition by selling “medicinal” alcohol. It was also a powerful chain store, not as dominant as A&P, but part of the set of firms that decade who fostered a powerful political backlash from local businesses.

And its scale remained pretty much to the present day. As late as 2015, Walgreens was worth $100 billion, an investor darling and an icon of Wall Street and America. And it’s not like Amazon has come into the drug store space and taken Walgreen’s margin. Yes, there is some competition, but pharmacies are regulated businesses and the consumer doesn’t choose a pharmacy based on price. A doctor prescribes a drug, the consumer goes to the most convenient pharmacy and pays the copay that his or her insurance mandates. It doesn’t matter what pharmacy you choose, it just matters that it’s in your insurance company’s network. After you’ve hit your deductible, the consumer price is the same wherever you go.

Moreover, even today, the other financial numbers from Walgreens aren’t bad. Sales aren’t going gangbusters, but the number is basically increasing, and so are the number of 30-day prescriptions, even though they’ve cut the number of stores every year since 2017. Its expenses, aside from a temporary a spike having to do with an unusual opioid settlement, are manageable. Here are some charts I made from their annual reports making these points.

You’d think Walgreens would be doing fine. But it’s not.

So what’s the explanation? It’s not that the cost of physical pharmaceuticals is higher. Walgreens has market power, and they own part of Cencora, which is one of the major distributors. The problem is unique to the business of pharmacies, which is that its pricing is almost totally out of its control. Normal retailers set pricing by buying wholesale, adding a mark-up, and then selling for the wholesale price plus the markup. And Walgreens does that in a bunch of lines of business, like when you go into the store and get candy or stationary. But in its main line of business - pharmaceuticals - Walgreens doesn’t set prices.

Insurance companies do. And there’s the rub.

In the U.S., a consumer will go into a drug store, in this case Walgreens, after their doctor prescribes medication, and then the consumer will make a copayment. A Walgreens pharmacist then dispenses it. After doing so, Walgreens gets a set reimbursement from that consumer’s insurance company for that medication. How much does it get? Well, those insurance company’s contract with what’s called pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) to manage negotiations with pharmacies. A PBM sets up a network for insurance companies, manages drug prices, and handles all the payment logistics between patients and pharmacies. PBMs negotiate with pharmacies, and set up a pricing agreement on which drugs are covered and how much those pharmacies get reimbursed in return for allowing those pharmacies to serve its customers.

Theoretically, both sides have some leverage in this negotiation. If a pharmacy chooses not to accept the prices and terms offered by those PBMs, then consumers who have an insurance company that uses that PBM just won’t go there. PBMs also have an incentive to give reasonable terms, or at least used to, because it’s valuable to have more pharmacies in your network. After all, an insurance company that doesn’t let its customers shop at popular drug stores doesn’t have as compelling a product.

Pricing wasn’t a big problem for Walgreens when there were lots of PBMs, because it had the ability to say no if the deal was unreasonable, and still maintain a flow of customers. But in the early 2010s, there were a bunch of mergers in the PBM space. Two companies, Express Scripts and Medco Health Solutions, combined in 2012, forming the biggest PBM.

Today, there are really only three PBMs - Express Scripts, Caremark and OptumRx - serving 80% of customers. And if there are three gatekeepers for customers, you really have no choice but to sign on the dotted line, no matter the terms. No business, not even one as large as Walgreens, can afford to lose 20-30% of its revenue, which is what happens if you refuse to do business with one of the big PBMs. Here’s what happened to Walgreens when it got into a fight with Express Scripts in 2012, just after the Medco-Express Scripts merger, which one industry analyst called it an “apocalypse” for the drug chain.

Walgreens eventually came back with its tail between its legs and signed a deal with Express Scripts. At that moment, it became clear that PBMs had all the power, and drug stores had none.

It got worse. In 2015, the third biggest PBM OptumRx bought the fourth largest PBM Catamaran. There were many other mergers, and this graphic is nifty, notably CVS Caremark buying Aetna in 2018. Yes, CVS, a major Walgreens competitor, is setting its revenue, which is insane. (That’s why CVS’s drug stores entered a host of markets while its pharmacy rivals flailed.)

Some may know about PBMs as middlemen who hike the price of drugs to consumers, sometimes taking 50% or more in rebates from drug makers. The Federal Trade Commission noted one example of a PBM marking up drug prices by as much as 7,736%. Other rebating practices are at the heart of the FTC lawsuit on insulin, and should be barred by closing the exemption in the Anti-Kickback statute.

But PBMs also impose costs on the other side of the market, to the pharmacies. In 2015, the big three, with their market power, began lowering reimbursement rates on pharmacies and charging a host of new fees. And that includes doing it even to the second biggest drug store chain in America, Walgreens, which was politically powerful and worth $100 billion at the time. Walgreens flagged it was happening at the time to Wall Street. Here’s the company’s annual report from that year.

We experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2015 as compared to the same period in the prior year.

They also noted that consolidation was now a business risk.

Many organizations in the healthcare industry, including PBM companies and health insurance companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power, which has resulted in greater pricing pressures. For example, in July 2015, OptumRx, UnitedHealth Group’s pharmacy care services business, completed its combination with Catamaran Corporation, with the combined businesses expected to fulfill over one billion prescriptions in 2015 and be the third largest PBM company in the United States…. If this consolidation trend continues, it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services.

Well then, there we go, Walgreens warned in 2015 that monopoly power could choke out its business. And it did. The lower reimbursement rate sentence returned in the 2016 Annual Report, with an additional phrase.

We experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior year… We expect this trend to continue.

Yes, in 2016, Walgreens realized they didn’t have leverage, thus “we expect this trend to continue.” Walgreens also kept the consolidation warning in there, as it did every year thereafter. And every single annual report since has had the same set of sentences. 2017

The Company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2017 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company expects these pressures to continue.

2018

The Company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2018 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company expects these pressures to continue.

2019

The Company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company expects these pressures to continue.

2020

The Company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2020 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company expects these pressures to continue.

2021

The Company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2021 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company expects these pressures to continue.

2022

The Company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2022 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company expects these pressures to continue.

2023

The Company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company expects these pressures to continue.

2024

The Company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company expects these pressures to continue.

Every single year, Walgreens told investors it was getting worse reimbursement rates, and it expected that trend to continue. Every single year, it warned investors that consolidation in PBMs was hurting its business. But rather than trying to get policymakers to act against dominant PBMs, the management got desperate, trying to find ways to imitate CVS without being able to break into the PBM layer. It went global with the acquisition of Boots Alliance, opened a specialty pharmacy, tried to get into clinical care, and bought VillageMD. The corporation even hired its current CEO, Tim Wentworth, from his position leading Express Scripts, which is the PBM that destroyed Walgreens in the first place. But none of it worked, because none of it addressed the unlawful squeezing of its revenue.

One of the big differences between Walgreens and, say, Toys ""R"" Us, another chain that felt the sting of Amazon, is that Walgreens is not just a company, it’s a regulated medical provider. Its pharmacists are licensed, it handles controlled substances, and its employees are caregivers. That imposes significant limits and constraints, such as liability for wrongfully dispensing opioids, but it also gives it an embedded competitive advantage. There’s a reason that it has lasted for 125 years, the local pharmacist is hard to get rid of.

PBMs, however, are engaged in a sort of industry-specific arson. And we can see this dynamic by looking at independent pharmacies writ large, nearly one in three of whom have closed in the last ten years. Today, 46% of U.S. counties now have pharmacy deserts, meaning no pharmacies at all. Walgreens, in some ways, is better set up than most independent pharmacies, because it’s big and has bargaining power in purchasing drugs. It also has a lower cost of capital. But it’s dying regardless.

Three days ago, my organization released a report showing that 326 pharmacies have closed since December of 2024. Why is that month significant? Well, that’s the month Elon Musk tanked legislation to address some of the monopolistic squeezing that PBMs are putting on pharmacies and consumers. Musk later said he didn’t know what a PBM is, but at the time, his beef was that the year-end legislation had too many pages in it.

I guess we can thank Musk for the sale of Walgreens to private equity. Hopefully, Sycamore Partners realizes there’s more money if PBM reform goes through, and tries to use their political leverage to make their investment work out.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8a488c0-4807-4ae4-a484-cc944be6fdb6_978x954.png",N,,2025-03-13 23:06:23.352990

By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.

The budget airline — known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of yellow planes — said Wednesday that its parent, Spirit Aviation Holdings, exited Chapter 11 after finalizing debt restructuring. The reorganization plan, which received the court greenlight last month, aims to bring the carrier back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals.

“We’re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,” CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.

The restructuring deal allows Spirit to convert $795 million of its debt into equity. The company says it's also received a $350 million equity investment from existing investors to aid future operations.

Spirit filed for bankruptcy back in November, following years of struggles and mounting debt as it failed to bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Florida carrier was particularly hit hard by rising operating expenses and stiffer competition. By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.

Whether Spirit will continue as a standalone airline has also been up in the air, although takeover attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier have proven to be unsuccessful before and during the bankruptcy process. Spirit rejected a third bid from Frontier last month.

While future merger proposals may not be entirely off the table, Spirit signaled Wednesday that it would continue to focus its own growth and offerings. Christie noted that the airline would be ""moving forward with our strategy to redefine low-fare travel with our new, high-value travel options.”

In an evolution from its budget-exclusive roots, Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities. Last year, months before filing for Chapter 11, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks.

In a message sent to Spirit customers Wednesday, Christie continued to point those four travel options from the airline, which he said “let you choose how you want to fly.""

Wednesday's announcement also noted plans to trade shares publicly again, although not immediately. Shares of Spirit previously issued by Spirit Airlines Inc. was canceled upon its exit from bankruptcy — but it expects to re-list shares, newly-issued under new owners, “as soon as reasonably practicable.”

Meanwhile — between wider economic turmoil, high-profile plane crashes and other consumer uncertainty — major airlines have issued warnings in recent days about falling demand. Carriers like Delta, Southwest, American have all recently downgraded revenue outlooks for the first quarter.

Niccol, 50, took the helm of Starbucks six months ago and has been swift to roll out changes to reverse slumping sales. Among them, he has simplified its menu by ditching low-performing drinks, set a four-minute goal for fulfilling orders, stopped charging extra for using non-dairy beverages in its drinks and brought back ceramic mugs for in-store customers.

“We have a clear path forward. This path is grounded in reconnecting with who we are when we’re at our best,” Niccol said. “We call it ‘Back to Starbucks.’ It’s about focusing on our brand truths and the role we play in the lives of our customers and our partners and communities. It’s about getting those fundamentals right and then building and innovating from there.”

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, Starbucks reported net revenue of $9.39 billion, slightly down from $9.42 billion in the same quarter of the previous year. Net earnings for the quarter were $780.8 million – a 23.8% decline from $1.02 billion a year earlier.

The budget airline — known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of yellow planes — said Wednesday that its parent, Spirit Aviation Holdings, exited Chapter 11 after finalizing debt restructuring. The reorganization plan, which received the court greenlight last month, aims to bring the carrier back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals.

“We’re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,” CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.

The restructuring deal allows Spirit to convert $795 million of its debt into equity. The company says it's also received a $350 million equity investment from existing investors to aid future operations.

Spirit filed for bankruptcy back in November, following years of struggles and mounting debt as it failed to bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Florida carrier was particularly hit hard by rising operating expenses and stiffer competition. By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.

There are also plenty of younger, but swiftly growing chicken concepts to contend with, like Wingstop, Raising Cane’s, Zaxby’s, Slim Chickens, Dave’s Hot Chicken, and Huey Magoo’s.
McDonald’s nearly 14,000 domestic restaurants insulates the company pretty well against rising competition based on convenience alone.
McDonald’s is not alone That said, McDonald’s is hardly the only chain fortressing itself against a growing number of specialists.
Taco Bell just announced its busy menu plans for 2025, including the prioritization of crispy chicken items and specialty beverages.","An industry trend that has been simmering under the surface for the past couple of years has finally boiled over with McDonald’s announcement that it is going to create three new category teams focused specifically on beef, chicken, and beverages/desserts.

Beef is a no-brainer. McDonald’s got its start as a walk-up hamburger stand, after all, and has since become the largest purchaser of beef in the world. The company plans to maintain its leadership position in the category with the launch of its ""best burgers,” expected in all global markets by the end of 2026, as well as the rollout of a “Big Arch” burger.

Chicken and beverages are where the company believes its biggest opportunities are, however.

Chicken

Chief executive officer Chris Kempczinski recently told investors that the company has the potential to gain another percentage point of chicken share by the end of 2026 through the continued rollout of the McCrispy platform, as well as the return of the snack wrap, the launch of “a new chicken strip offering,” and the promotion of the Chicken Big Mac as a limited-time offering “pulsed in over time.”

The leader of the global chicken team has not been announced yet, but that person no doubt has a tall task. During a video message announcing the new structure, Kempczinski said, “In so many of our categories we’re competing against specialists, like a KFC for example, who single mindedly is devoted to winning in chicken. This category team allows us to have that same level of focus to win in chicken, to win in beverages, to continue to win in beef.”

The number of “specialists” focused singularly on chicken extends well beyond KFC and includes other legacy players like Church’s Texas Chicken, Bojangles, Popeyes, Chick-fil-A, and El Pollo Loco. There are also plenty of younger, but swiftly growing chicken concepts to contend with, like Wingstop, Raising Cane’s, Zaxby’s, Slim Chickens, Dave’s Hot Chicken, and Huey Magoo’s.

The chicken category has driven much of the overall industry’s growth of late thanks in large part to younger consumers’ preference for the protein, its versatility, and its health(ier) halo. But there are also many more options from which consumers can choose. Technomic forecasts chicken chains to achieve a sixth consecutive year of cumulative double-digit sales growth in 2025, and McDonald’s is undoubtedly jockeying for a top position among them.

Beverages/desserts

Meanwhile, it’s clear there is massive consumer demand for specialty beverages, and it became clear in December 2023 — with the introduction of CosMc’s — that McDonald’s also wants a big piece of that growing market. CosMc’s has served as a sort of test concept, offering items such as the Churro Frappé and Sour Cherry Energy Burst. With the launch of the new beverage/dessert category team, led by Charlie Newberger, CosMc’s could play a very different (or expanded) role for the company.

“What we’re learning is there’s an opportunity in that space. As we further refine our plans, you'll hear more about how much of that opportunity needs to come through new units, with something standalone like CosMc's, or how much potential we can capture by doing more within the existing restaurants. There's a lot of thinking about what we might be able to do to capture that opportunity in the current restaurant,” Kempczinski said during the company’s most recent earnings call.

He added that the beverage category, including hot and iced coffee, refreshers, and energy drinks, is growing about twice as fast as the rest of the business.

Still, the threat from “specialists” is also growing quickly. Of the 46 chains Technomic categorizes as coffee or “other beverage/snack,” 42 saw growth in 2023. Chains such as 7 Brew, HTeaO, Scooter’s Coffee, Dutch Bros, Gong Cha, Ziggi’s Coffee, PJ’s Coffee of New Orleans, Swig, and Nektar Juice Bar have all experienced meteoric growth in the past couple of years.

McDonald’s nearly 14,000 domestic restaurants insulates the company pretty well against rising competition based on convenience alone. But when specialized brands like 7 Brew begin popping up in some of those territories, consumers are presented with a very real temptation to go elsewhere if they just want a flavored iced coffee for a 3 p.m. pick-me-up.

There’s also the dessert side of this — long an incremental add-on for quick-service restaurants but now also a greater market share threat from fast-growing concepts such as Jeremiah’s Italian Ice, Handel’s Homemade Ice Cream, Mochinut, Andy’s Frozen Custard, Chip City, Crumbl, and Shipley Do-Nuts.

According to research from Mordor Intelligence, the snacking category as a whole, including desserts, is expected to grow at a staggering clip – from $256.2 billion in 2023 to $559.2 billion in 2028, or a compound annual growth rate of nearly 17%. Again, it’s clear McDonald’s wants a piece of this growing market.

McDonald’s is not alone

That said, McDonald’s is hardly the only chain fortressing itself against a growing number of specialists. Taco Bell just announced its busy menu plans for 2025, including the prioritization of crispy chicken items and specialty beverages. There’s also a couple of creative new desserts on the horizon, like an Ube Strawberry Cookie.

Wendy’s also just announced it will further expand its chicken and beverage offerings as part of its 2025 strategic initiatives. Additionally, the chain plans to get far more creative with its signature Frosty line, including customization options with sauces and mix-ins.

Meanwhile, Jollibee recently launched a new Signature Sips menu, while Shake Shack has been testing more desserts. Late last year, Del Taco introduced a dirty soda option called the Dirty Del. Of note, Taco Bell has also debuted a Dirty Mtn Dew Baja Blast.

During an interview last year, Taco Bell’s chief food innovation officer Liz Matthews said products like specialty beverages and desserts are, “an add-on, an incremental sale, an extra afternoon or late-night trip, a special trip intent.”

As specialized concepts continue to grow at a speedy pace, there is a risk some bigger chains could lose that “special trip intent.” Sure, we’ve seen such specialty categories shakeout in this industry in the past (frozen yogurt comes to mind), but one of McDonald’s objectives with its new “horizontal” structure is to speed up the pace of its innovation. Taco Bell, which is planning to double its menu launches this year over a busy 2024, seems to be doing the same thing. They don’t want to wait around for a potential shakeout. They want to win market share for those specialty items now.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltea7aee2fca050a19/blt252881f16cb75ecf/67d30798ae76f15767f56b08/11_Ube_Strawberry_Cookie.png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-03-13 15:05:46.786225

Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol briefed investors on the progress of the coffee giant’s turnaround program at its investor day Wednesday. He touted a host of changes, most of which had already been publicly disclosed, intended to revive the brand’s coffeehouse image.

But Niccol cautioned the chain is still “in the early days of our turnaround, and [has] much more to do to return the business to growth.”

The company’s medium-term future includes more changes to its in-store experience, he said.

“Imagine coffeehouses that are comfortable and warm with expanded seating options, power outlets and abundant food displays, stores with more separation between the cafe and mobile order experience, featuring new risers and dedicated pickup shelves in select locations to create an intuitive hand-off, and cafes anchored by a redesigned espresso bar that adds a sense of theater,” Niccol said.

Some U.S. stores have already begun testing these features, and the technology to enable them, like a mobile-ordering sequence algorithm.

“The early progress we’ve seen wouldn’t be possible without our Green Apron partners,” Niccol said.

Niccol said the chain has added several benefits, doubled parental leave and increased hours at 3,000 cafes to ensure that it was the best employer in the retail and restaurant sector. The chain is also trying to promote its managers from within.

Jasmine Leli, a Starbucks Workers United member who works at one of the first Starbucks to unionize in Buffalo, New York, told Restaurant Dive that workers issues were intertwined with efforts to revive the brand, and that aesthetic changes in the coffee shop wouldn’t solve operational issues. At her store, Leli said, there are rarely enough workers for the afternoon daypart.

“[Customers] want to be able to get in and get out when they come to pick up their orders, or they come in to place an order. And that's not always possible when you're working with a skeleton crew,” Leli said.

Niccol said Starbucks has invested considerably in its workers since he joined. But one employee has been a disproportionate recipient of that investment. According to a disclosure in the brand’s proxy statement, Niccol’s total compensation, comprised largely of bonuses and stock awards, was $97.8 million in 2024. Comparatively, the median worker, a part-time barista in the U.S. made $14,674 in 2024, per the proxy statement, meaning Niccol received 6,666 times the compensation of a representative worker.

According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the individual poverty line in the U.S. is $15,650. At least 50% of Starbucks workers earn less than this in total compensation per year, per the proxy statement. The median Starbucks worker earned almost exactly half of what the median waiter, fast food cook or foodservice and prep worker earned in 2023, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

“We're watching the CEO make all of this money, and we got less money in raises and they're laying people off. We want our contract to be finalized and we want Starbucks to invest money in the union workers,” Leli said.

Starbucks Workers United responds to investor day with increased pressure

Accompanying the investor day, Starbucks Workers United staged actions, including strikes, in several cities. At least 16 people were detained during sit-ins organized by SBWU, according to a press release emailed to Restaurant Dive.

SBWU members felt let down by the company’s failure to reach a contract with the union, despite its previous statements indicating it wanted to do so by the end of 2024.

Sara Kelly, the brand’s chief partner officer, said Starbucks and the union have engaged a mediator to resolve issues in bargaining for a foundational framework.

Getting to that contract, Leli said, will require a mix of continued workplace organizing, consumer action and pressure on shareholders to persuade the company to invest more in its hourly workers.

Some of the changes made have had unintended consequences, Leli said. Niccol described the elimination of some drinks, as a way to free up Starbucks to pursue culturally driven LTOs and to add new, innovative drinks like the Cortado.

But this hasn’t kept customers from ordering those drinks through laborious customizations in-store, Leli said. A frappuccino with several modifications to resemble a discontinued drink build takes longer to ring up than the old menu item would’ve.

Full transcript - J.P. Morgan Industrials Conference 2025:

Jeff Zekauskas, Analyst, JPMorgan: Hi, good morning. I’m Jeff Zekauskas. I analyze chemicals at JPMorgan. It’s my pleasure this morning to introduce the management of Ecolab. And representing Ecolab is Christophe Beck, who’s been the CEO of Ecolab since 2021.

And in my opinion, Christophe has done a really remarkable job in that the previous CEO of Ecolab was Doug Baker, and he was a very, very capable executive. But when he left Ecolab, we were a little bit post COVID. There were pressures and demand in the institutional business. There were issues around raw material inflation and pricing. And I think Christophe has really managed those issues very, very well in tandem with the Ecolab management and really revived the company from where it was three or four years ago.

So we’re very much looking forward to his presentation. And then he may have some time for questions afterward. Christophe?

Christophe Beck, CEO, Ecolab: Thank you so much, Jeff. Always a pleasure to see you, to be here in New York. Always a special conference for us and always an opportunity to share our success story. We’ve been one hundred and two years in business, which is unusual for an American company. But there are a few, including JPMorgan, by the way, which is great.

So I’ll share with you a bit where we’re coming from, where we are, where we’re going. And as Jeff has mentioned, so we’ll cover a few questions as well at the end. I draw your attention, obviously, on the cautionary statement since we’ll be talking about the near future and the future as well, which is not obvious to fully understand, obviously, since it’s changing a little bit on a daily basis. But we’re really trying as an organization, as a company to focus shareholder. And that’s been true for a very long time.

So for the ones a little bit less familiar with us, what we do? What’s our purpose. Our purpose is to protect what’s vital: people from infections and natural resources and doing it in a way that helps our customers improve performance. Our name, Ecolab, came from Economics Laboratory in 1923 with the promise that we would help customers do better, produce better results at a lower total cost because they use less natural resources and less labor. That was the promise in 1923.

It was always a business promise, a business idea, and it’s remaining one as well even views and sustainability are changing over time. Improving business performance the right way is something that has been at the core of who we are and who we want to be as a company. So we have the means as well of our ambitions, which is important. It’s not just a slogan out there. This is what we’ve been doing and what we’re doing on a day by day basis.

We have 48,000 people. 28,000 people of that team are serving millions of customers in the world. We helped protect one point four billion people from infection last year. We touched a third of the world food production, almost a quarter of the power, the electricity that’s being generated, which is becoming even more important, as we all know, as you know, because of what AI is requiring, and I’m going to come back as well to that in a second. And what’s important as well is that we have 3,000 people in science, in R and D, in digital technology, in data science that are helping us power all the offerings that we are providing to our customers.

And when we think about it, most of what we do is around water. And 70% of what we do is helping customers produce better outcomes while reducing their water usage, their net water usage, and ideally to get to net zero at some point as well. And in many cases, we’ve reached that as well. So we have roughly 10,000,000,000 in sales in water technologies, which makes us as well the largest water company in the world, and that’s been true for quite a while. And we keep growing and performing very well because of that promise.

We are protecting the most trusted brand out there in all industries. We serve 40 different end markets. So it can be in industrials, like many companies that have been presenting over the last few days as well. It can be an institutional market. What it means for us, it’s restaurants, it’s hotels, it’s retail stores, convenience stores where people are going, obviously.

It’s in Life Science, which is the pharma industry for us. And last but not least, best elimination. Those are the bugs that you see. The other ones, you don’t see, but those ones that you see matter too, obviously, which is a great business for us, which is essential for many of the brands that we’re serving, being in retail, being in food and beverage, being in hotels, wherever we serve. But it’s always a B2B promise.

We’re not in the consumer business, as most of you know. When you look at our portfolio, I’m really proud of this one because we have great end markets, and they’re pretty well spread. At the same time, we serve 172 countries, so 40 industries in 172 countries. And when I look back then fifteen years ago, we were in a very different place. Our earnings, 90% or 80% plus, were coming from one business, institutional, hotels and restaurants in The United States.

A great business that has built a great franchise, but that was a bit of a clear focus. That has changed over time. And today, so half our business is in North America and half is outside with a very good geographic coverage. And what’s really interesting is that the heads of those businesses by end market or by geographies is very strong. So we make more or less the same margin within more or less five percentage points, the same in every business and in every market around the world, which is really a great way to build resilience as a company because we never exactly know where the growth is going to come from, especially it’s a short term in terms of geographies or in terms of end markets as well.

Wherever it comes from, we have a healthy balance of mix of earnings, which helps us stay very steady as well, so from an earnings delivery perspective. And talking about margins, we made that promise to get to 20% by 27%, and I feel really good about getting there. We’ve delivered 17% in 2024. I’ve committed to 18% in 2025, and we will get to the 20% by 2027. And it’s not the end of the story, obviously.

So when we get there, there needs to keep building to the next level. And we have many businesses that are already north of 20% today, so we know exactly how to get there. But it’s going to be mostly a top line, a gross margin story. It’s not a cost cutting exercise, even though operating performance is important. But this is not my number one priority when I think about the company, which is why I feel really good about delivering a strong double digit 12% to 15% earnings growth for the long run, for 2025 and for the first quarter as well, leading us towards this 20% margin by 2027, even though the top line does not need to be 5% to 7% in order to deliver this 12% to 1520% operating margin by 2027.

The 3%, four % would be okay. Anything that’s above will help us either invest more in the business or deliver more earnings, which is choice depending on the opportunities that we have in front of us. And the way we look at Q1 right now is probably going to be closer to three than to four, but I feel totally fine with it as well because the team is reacting very nicely to all the market conditions that we are all living in, obviously, in the world currently. And we’re just getting started. One hundred and two years, and I’m preparing the companies not just for 2025, obviously, but for the years to come and hopefully for the next century as well as a company.

So let me jump a little bit more into it. First, the macro trends are maybe not the most inspiring trends for the world, but they are helping us, obviously, keep growing as a company because we can help solve some of them or most of them as well. Thinking about people, we’re going to be a third more people by 02/1950. We will need way more food, way more calories because people are shifting, obviously, so from non meat to meat diets around the world. Energy, we will need almost 50% more by 02/1950, and that’s going to change pretty quickly as well as with artificial intelligence, and I’ll come back to that as well in a second, which leads us to this water stress as well.

Today, the world is roughly at equilibrium where we use as much water as what nature can replenish through natural cycle of rain. And by 02/1930, we expect that gap to be 56%, which is not going to work, obviously, because water is not going to come from outer space. So we will need to reuse and recycle water in order to be able to keep growing as humanity, as businesses and the way we live, obviously. So we have the chance as well, sir, to be the number one in most of what we do in a very fragmented market, which is a good thing. It’s a good position to be.

But it’s important for us to compare ourselves to the very best companies out there, all the names that you’re familiar with as well and not so much to the competitors we have out there because this is not the benchmark I’m looking at. It’s much more the top companies out there in the world wherever they operate as well. And how do we deliver that value so to our customers for the ones a bit less familiar? Well, we bring chemistry expertise, technology, data science to our customers to help them deliver best in class performance. We serve millions of customers in 40 industries.

We know what best in class performance means and help them deliver that best in class performance anywhere around the world as quickly as we can. And that’s the promise that we make to our customers, and it’s really bringing all the strengths of the company anywhere around the world every day, every week, every month, whatever, is the frequency that we need to be there. We will be there for our customers. And we power a lot of what we do for our customers with unique innovation. Our pipeline of innovation keeps growing.

For us, it’s the peak annual sales in five years. That’s the way we define our pipeline. Vitality index is very strong in the company, roughly 30%, which means 30% of our sales are coming from products that we have launched in the last five years. That’s one definition. It’s our definition.

But I like a lot, so the evolution of our pipeline and the vitality as well that it’s bringing up to our business, which is so essential, obviously, so for us to keep growing. And when I think as well about the way we innovate, for a very long time was more incremental innovation, successful, doing so renovating products, programs, offering that we are providing to our customers for a very long time. And we’ve been shifting our focus on innovation that we have half on renovation and half on breakthrough innovation, as you can see, as well on that chart. So helping data centers operate without water or helping microelectronics producers, so called fabs, and I’ll come back to that as well, so to produce more chips with much less water as well. That can be true in a dish room as well in a restaurant because it’s where most of the water is being used as well.

And as I’ve mentioned, salt, pest elimination is a great business for us. And interestingly enough, we have millions of famous mousetraps around the world that we need to go and check very regularly. 95% of them are absolutely empty. It was totally useless to go there, but you don’t know it in advance. Well, we have developed devices, the very best mousetrap, as well, in order to know in advance what’s in there, where is it.

And we can save, obviously, huge time, which is a good thing in terms of operational efficiency for our team, but at the same time, making sure that our customers, the best brands out there, never have or never see as well any activity in their stores or in their production sites. We connect not only those devices, but all the systems that we manage around the world for our customers. We have 100,000 systems remote monitored today. One of the largest clouds as well in the world is Ecolab three d, and we keep growing as well on this one. It’s not only to manage operations, to optimize operations, but with it, we know what’s the performance of every site in every company, in every industry as well around the world, which is a great insight to learn from the best ones how the other ones can get better as well at it.

The way we measure as well the value we’re generating for our customers is called total value delivered, and it’s in three pillars. It depends, obviously, on the industry that we’re serving, but it’s always first a business outcome. It can be an uptime in a data center. Second, it’s the operational cost performance per hour, per data, per burger, whatever that is. And third is the environmental impact in water, energy, waste, especially that you can see on our website because it’s in real time, that we know those numbers and we make sure that we always have the alignment with the customer, that what we’ve saved is really aligned between the two parties and we agree where do we want to go.

And we get to share out of that value that we are delivering to our customers in value pricing, which is why pricing is a strong part of our top line proposition as a company. If you take one example and I’ll share a few so with you, in a lodging property, which is a hotel, obviously, in normal language, well, we start with the dish machine in our restaurant. We move to the laundry room. We touch the housekeeping, the AC, the water management, the pest elimination, the food safety program. We do the audit for guest satisfaction, for brand compliance and so on.

So that’s the way we grow within one property. And then the next step is to do it around the world. We called it the customers, circle the globe in the past. We call it the one e coli proposition today, which is basically providing all services of our company to the main brands of the world out there, not just in one location like that hotel I just mentioned, but in every location around the world to help them get all their properties reach the performance of the best operating one that they have around the world, which is helping us as well drive penetration. We serve 152,000,000,000 market.

$55,000,000,000 is within customers that we already serve today. So we can multiply by four the size of the company by having our current customer use all our services and deliver diverse in class performance while doing so as well. At the same time, so we’re running great businesses that keep getting better, but we’re also in the business of building new businesses, and we’ve done that for a long time. I mentioned Pest Elimination, a great franchise that we started twenty years ago. We went into Water in 2011.

We’ve built a few other businesses as well. I’d like to share with you as well in a second, like Global High-tech, that’s data centers and fabs. It’s life sciences, the pharma industry and especially in bioscience and Ecolab digital, which is an interesting proposition that we’ve done for a very long time for our customers for free and progressively making it the tech way, which ultimately, sir, you pay for the value that you get. I’d like to start with Global Hi tech. If you take a little bit of zoomed out review here, we will need 1,000 new data centers in the next three to five years.

It’s moving very quick. At the same time, 70 fabs, microelectronics producing plants as well in the next five years. One fab requires as much water as the drinking needs of 17,000,000 people, one. And the second largest in the world has thirty three and seven under construction right now. So you can imagine the challenge that, that’s generating as well.

Fabs and data centers in the next five years will require the power of the whole of India and the drinking needs equivalent of The United States. That’s all on top of all the numbers I showed before. That’s the equivalent of 50 new nuclear plants in the next five years. Just to put that in perspective, that’s a really hard one. We won’t be able to build that quick.

So the best way is to improve the performance from a water and energy perspective, both for fabs and for data centers. For us, it’s leading, obviously, in a very big market opportunity. If I think about the data centers, we’ve been shifting our technology. 95% of data centers today are basically big holes with computers in it that are air conditioned. And that’s the way you cool the computers.

That’s shifting now progressively towards this direct to chip technology, which is basically bringing a cold liquid on top of the thousands and millions of chips that you have in the data center. This is a total different technology. We are the leading expert in cooling technology. We’re the leading expert in fluid management. And we know how to manage those operations.

It’s newest technology. We’re helping the tech companies develop the new solutions and put tech in place as well in the newest data centers around the world. And it’s pretty important for them because of what I mentioned before. When you use less water, well, you can produce more data. And when you use less water, it means you need less energy as well.

So you can reuse that energy in order to power even more the data center as well. For those companies, this is essential. It’s a small part of their spend. It’s a huge impact on what they’re trying to accomplish, which is processing more data, obviously. In microelectronics, the so called fabs, really interesting challenge here I shared with you.

So how much water is required to power those fabs? Well, we’re shifting completely the way we’re managing water in those fabs where all the water that’s been used, it’s a whole water process, the production of a microprocessor, because you need to cut the silicium cylinder, you need to polish it, you need to print it, and there’s a bunch of steps as well in between. It’s all done in water, with water, and water needs to be ultra pure. Today, all the water is going through the process, ending up in a wastewater plant and then ending up in a river. And silicium is a heavy metal, which is a little bit problematic.

So you have a quantity issue. You have a quality issue. So what we’re doing for the fabs is basically using and recycling water at every step of the process that wastewater becomes something of the past and not something of the future. We have 25 people in Pyeontak, for instance, in Korea helping do exactly that as we speak in order to make sure that they can produce more in ways that are using less water, especially. Shifting gears on Life Sciences.

We started that business in 2017 by bringing our capabilities in Food and Beverage and in health care, making sure that we could help the pharma company produce safer drugs, more qualitative drugs at the lower total cost. We’ve added as well to it Purolite in 2021, which is an ultrafiltration technology, resin based, protein based, in order to purify biotech products, in order to make sure that they are at the highest level of quality, produced in the highest sterile environment in a clean room as well, very similar to what we do in food and beverage plants or in hospitals as well, but brought together for a very different industry. Really happy that we did it in 2017, that we kept investing as well over the year. It’s an industry that has gone through a transition after the pandemic, but now it’s getting much better again. And it’s a large market, a growth market in a place where there are very few players, and we are very well positioned to capture that growth going forward.

So in a pharma plant, we, as mentioned, make sure that the clean rooms are very sterile, that the environment is as clean as it can be, that the product that’s being produced is also as safe as it can be as well. It’s always the same spirit where we start with one application, we add a lot of applications around it, it’s a penetration game, and ultimately making sure that the overall promise is being delivered. And last but not least, eColab Digital for thirty years, we’ve been using Connected Chemistry, which we invented in 1991. Well, we’ve been doing that for customers for free forever, and that has changed a few years back. That’s why I’ve decided as well that after this first quarter, investors will see what’s the revenue that we’re generating out of Ecolab Digital.

And what’s Ecolab Digital? It’s hardware, devices like your phone, if you think about something closer to you. It’s software subscription and it’s consumption. And it’s a few hundred million today growing very nicely at a very high margin as you can imagine because there is now raw materials obviously in that. So a very promising story.

To bring us to a close, two things. First, we’ve always focused on helping customers reduce impact on people most importantly, what we do for our customers, which is thousand or a million times more impactful than what we do in our own operation as a company. And the commitments that we’ve made externally as well, what we do for customers, One, to take one example, I made a commitment in 2015 that we will help save enough water for the drinking needs of 1,000,000,000 people, and we are perfectly on track to get there. So by 02/1930, that leads to energy savings as well, and it leads to a lot of other things as well that we are tracking on a very regular basis. And our report is coming out, so our growth and impact report, I think, in June, which you will see.

So how we’ve been progressing as well in ’twenty four, which has been a very good story because that’s the way we help our customers do better, make more money and for us, obviously, do even better. Last but not least, I like a lot our financial position, like JPMorgan would be saying. So we have Fortress balance sheet. I’m not going to steal that name, but I feel pretty good about it because we have a great business with great margins. We have great cash flow generation between 90100% of cash flow conversion as well, which is something we’ve been doing for many, many years.

Our balance sheet, we have a 1.7 leverage ratio in 2024. So in a very strong place to whether whatever is coming at us, but most importantly, so to invest in the businesses that have promising growth ahead of them or to do acquisitions as we’ve done a lot as well over time. And obviously, the question on capital allocation, we’ve been very boring steady like that on what our priorities are. It’s always going to be dividend in line with earnings. It’s always going to be second investing in the business and last but not least, so buyback when there is something left.

And it’s been the case for a very long time, the last ten years. We returned close to $11,000,000,000 to shareholders, half in buyback, half in dividends, and that’s going to continue. That’s been the case in the best years. That’s been the case in the more challenging year as well that we might have gone through. So at the end, I feel really good about where the company is, where we’re going.

We have a great promise for customers that need it more than ever. Great opportunities, very good market position as well. We have the means of our ambitions, both in capabilities and in financial resources. And we have the best team in the industry as well that’s going to deliver no matter what for our customers and for our shareholders on a quarter by quarter basis as we’ve done as well in the past. So welcome.

Comments or questions?

Jeff Zekauskas, Analyst, JPMorgan: Okay. Thanks very much, Christophe. Maybe the place to start is you’re confident over your longer term margin goals. And at the beginning of the presentation, you said we can hit these. It says 5% to 7% sales growth, but we can do this even if the sales growth is a little bit less.

Does your confidence come from greater pricing visibility as you look at Ecolab’s businesses going forward? And where does that confidence come from in your pricing, if that’s the case?

Christophe Beck, CEO, Ecolab: Great question, Jeff. And it’s the important question, obviously, here. So the first element is the fact that we’ve been delivering very nice margin growth over the past few years because I can talk about all the plans that we’re going to execute in the years to come. Well, okay, we’re still going to talk about what’s on paper, and it’s a bit of an argument of opinions. The past few years, we’ve had a very good development of our margins.

And the path for the next few years is going to be the same drivers. The first one, yes, is going to be partly the top line. The value price is an important one because it goes straight to the bottom line, as we know as well. And when we talk about price, so for us, it’s a share of the improvement in the performance of our customers that we’re making as well. And this is something that is very sticky.

As you know, pricing has never gone negative in our company. In the worst of times, it always went up, which is a good indication as well, like thirty years back. It’s a long story. It’s also all our new businesses, the one I mentioned in my presentation, being High-tech, Life Science, Digital, all higher margins than the average of the company, even the existing businesses like Institutional. Institutional is at 22% today.

It’s way higher than that in North America. It’s lower than that outside North America. And we’re progressing very nicely outside North America towards the performance of North America. It’s never going to be exactly the same because we don’t have the same critical mass as in large country in here. So that’s another example.

And last but not least, it’s innovation. Innovation, there is zero, but like zero innovation that we bring on the market that’s below the gross margin average of the business that we’re in as well at the same time. And last but not least, there is the one eCola cost performance, which is not my first priority. So in terms of operating performance, we’ve said SG and A are going to improve 20 basis points a year, net of investment as well. So this is not first, this is last.

So that’s the way we’ve delivered it in the past few years, and that’s the way we’re going to deliver it in the next few years.

Jeff Zekauskas, Analyst, JPMorgan: When you think about your major businesses, the institutional business has very high margin. The industrial business is good too, though not as high. Why is that? Why is the institutional business more profitable than the industrial business? And over time, are the larger opportunities in institutional because of its pricing characteristics?

Christophe Beck, CEO, Ecolab: So those two end markets, and it’s groups of end markets, obviously, as you know. So in industrial, what we call water today, it’s a lot of different end markets. It can be primary metals or power generation like data centers and fabs. They don’t have the same margins as we know and the same on the institutional and specialty side as well at the same time. So very different end markets, so for sure.

And the two stories are pretty different. As mentioned before, so INS, you said it, in North America is north of the 22%, which is the average, so for INS globally. And we started in Europe at zero ten years ago. And now it’s close to the company’s average as well. So we’ve demonstrated that we can get to north of 20% in institutional and specialty.

And in industrial, it’s much more of a one e collab approach here, which is really helping customer get this best in class performance that I shared before, helping enterprises to get all their units to the best performing one. That requires a much higher penetration of what we do for them at a much lower cost because we dare anyway adding services to help them get better performance. In institutional, we have higher penetration of our solution than what we have in industrial. Well, the fact that, balls are going to go up are going to help them improve their margin performance, but there will always be a slight difference between I and S businesses and water industrial businesses. The P and L looks very different as well in terms of gross margin and service that we need to provide.

Jeff Zekauskas, Analyst, JPMorgan: So when you’re confident that you’ll hit your 20% margin target, what you’re thinking is with the kind of pricing capabilities we have and some volume growth, we can do it.

Christophe Beck, CEO, Ecolab: Yes. Yes. And it’s not the end of the story. It’s not that 20% that we’re going to stop, we’re going to cruise and I’m going to end up on a beach. That’s not my plan.

I’m not the beach guy, so to begin with. But it’s going to think, how do we get the company to 23% to 25% and beyond? We have businesses that are close to 30% already today. So we know how to get there. And that’s the beauty of our model.

It’s not to do things we’ve never done. It’s to learn from other businesses, from other industries, from other geographies, how to improve as well across the world and across businesses, which is a pretty cool thing we say in the company. There’s always the best idea, the best solution within the company, somewhere in one business, somewhere around the world. We always need to know where is it and then scale it around the world.

Jeff Zekauskas, Analyst, JPMorgan: I think Ecolab says that its raw material inflation in 2025 will be up low single digits. But if you look at phosphate prices, they’re not really moving up. Caustic soda has come down quite a lot. Chlorine has sort of moved a little bit lower. Polyethylene is not moving.

Raw material inflation better than a low single digit growth? Or raw material inflation better than a low single digit growth or your stock?

Christophe Beck, CEO, Ecolab: Absolutely. And I’ve been pretty clear as well on that. I expect that the market is going to be low single. Our impact, what we call delivered product cost, our true P and L impact after all the activities done by our procurement team, our supply chain teams, all our smart people, as you call them, will be a positive story. It will turn into a slight tailwind.

The market itself is more a slight headwind, and you add to the improvement within the company, and it turns into a slight tailwind.

Jeff Zekauskas, Analyst, JPMorgan: Maybe a last question. When it comes to the data centers, are you agnostic as to which cooling technologies they use? That is, is Ecolab vulnerable to particular cooling technologies being developed? Or you can work with the technologies that are on the market?

Christophe Beck, CEO, Ecolab: We have been developed those technologies with the tech companies, with the processes, designers, I want to name them starting with an N, because they know that they will need ways to keep those microprocessors cool in order to use more power to process more data. For us, it’s not a water approach, it’s a cooling approach. And we’re helping develop those new technologies. As mentioned before, the direct to chip technology is something that’s very early in its development. It’s not a proven technology.

It’s a used technology where we learn a lot as well so with the operators. And we have great capabilities to have not just on the direct to chip, but also on the CDU, the Coolant Distribution Unit, which is very close technology that what we use in water, three d T, for cleaning in place in food and beverage plants is the same technology that we can leverage there to really monitor how is the fluid doing, what are the risks of corrosion, what are the risks of scaling, what are the risks of falling, what are the risks of leak as well. We can monitor that, no one else can. And the last step, which is the cooling of the coolant on top of the building. So agnostic, yes, but an active actor of developing those technologies for data centers.

The fact that we’re early on that journey is a very good story because we can position ourselves exactly where the train is going, and I feel really good about the future of that business. Okay.

Jeff Zekauskas, Analyst, JPMorgan: Thank you for your presentation, Chris.

Christophe Beck, CEO, Ecolab: Thank you so much, Jeff. Always a pleasure. Thank you, everyone. Thank you very much.

How to Win Over Gen Z Consumers Restaurants must remain consistent to be magnetic and create a loyal customer base.","Research firm dcdx recently released The Magnetic 100: Restaurants report, which took a look at the brands that Gen Z is talking about most. In order to make this list, a restaurant chain’s customers need to be doing more than spending money – they need to be truly engaged with the brand.

“Magnetism can be measured through how much and how often consumers talk about a brand online and this is all organic, so it’s not skewed by big marketing or influencer budgets,” dcdx director of strategy Mara Stolzenbach told Nation’s Restaurant News.

“Analyzing this type of user-generated content allows us to understand what’s resonating with customers and how they think about a brand.”

The report looked at 100 brands and rated them from “weak” to “magnetic” by analyzing their brand momentum, TikTok followers and segment. Metrics were then derived from popularity and consistency.

Here’s the top 10 most magnetic brands, per the report:

McDonald’s

Wingstop

Starbucks

Chipotle

Taco Bell

Crumbl Cookies

Raising Cane’s

KFC

Chick-fil-A

Subway

Let’s take a closer look at the top five brands and how they made the list.

McDonald’s

Generating 1 billion engagements on its own, McDonald’s claims the top spot on the list as the most magnetic brand, with a score of 89.38. The chain’s popularity goes beyond its food and in fact, much of its engagement has nothing to do with food.

According to Nation’s Restaurant News, memes about drive-thru order mishaps, behind-the-scenes content and viral clarinet performances mimicking air fryers all contributed to it taking the number one spot.

Wingstop

Next on the list, with a score of 87.5, is a chicken-wing chain that has gained popularity among Gen Z through “Mukbang” videos – live-streams that feature a person eating a large amount of food. According to NRN, Mukbang content dominated themes driving conversations for many of the top brands.

Starbucks

After losing popularity last year, Starbucks is back near the top thanks to a return to its roots and limited-time offerings. The coffee chain scored an 87.13 on the magnetism list, with consumers sharing seasonal drink ordering tips and pictures of their personalized cup messages.

That small change of encouraging employees to write personal messages on cups with Sharpies paid off, under the leadership of new Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol.

Chipotle

All press is good press, as Chipotle found out. Criticism over Chipotle’s prices and portion sizes became its biggest content driver over the past year. Customers of the brand started sharing ways to maximize orders and get the best deal, which actually played a key role in the brand attaining a score of 86.84.

Taco Bell

Rounding out the top five on the report’s rankings was the time-tested Mexican chain. Over 40% of Taco Bell’s engagement features storyteller content, with customers sharing life experiences – like gender reveals – with Baja Blasts.

Of the restaurants in the report, the top five brands – along with the number six brand, Crumbl Cookies – drove more than half of the conversation in the restaurant category, with nearly 4 billion engagements, according to an article by Fast Company.

How to Win Over Gen Z Consumers

Restaurants must remain consistent to be magnetic and create a loyal customer base.

“For brands that want to increase their magnetism, restaurants have to overcome a higher threshold of consistent consumer affection,” dcdx CEO Andrew Roth told NRN.

“If consistent love is harder to achieve in the restaurant space, then establishing loyalty demands creating an experience for consumers that sticks with them long after their meal is over.”

Bloomberg reported the company’s Budweiser Brewing Co APAC Ltd unit was looking to make cost cuts of 15% this year by trimming thousands from its headcount, on top of a 16% workforce reduction of 25,000 employees last year.

However, the company was swift to refute the report. “The news report about thousands of job cuts planned for Asia in 2025 is not true,” ABInBev spokesperson told Reuters. “We will continue our long-term investment in China.”

BUD China Sales Falter

ABInBev, which owns premium brands such as Stella Artois and Corona, is facing challenges in its Asia-Pacific business amid weakness in China which is dampening the positive uplift elsewhere. Sales volumes in China fell 19% in the Fiscal fourth quarter, with the contraction accelerating from a 14.2% fall in Q3. The brewer said it is being affected by softness in the Chinese market as customers switched products amid low consumer sentiment. In contrast, the company saw high single-digit growth in South Korea.

Globally beer demand slackened, led by China and Argentina, with total volumes declining by 1.9% in Q4, driven by a 2.1% drop in beer volumes, while non-beer volumes were down by 1.1%. Excluding China and Argentina volumes globally grew by 0.9% across the 2024 Fiscal year but overall performance was “significantly constrained” by weakness in these two countries, the company said, resulting in a total volume decline of 1.4%.

U.S. Market Recovers

But gains from its Michelob Ultra and Busch Light brands that helped drive a return to U.S. sales growth in the third quarter continued as it gained market share again in Q4.

Two years ago, the company laid off 350 employees, about 2% of its corporate staff, in the U.S. amid faltering sales of Bud Light after conservative boycotts over the company’s partnership with influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The backlash is thought to have cost the brewer up to $1.4 billion in lost sales. In January 2024, the company told Bloomberg it had laid off an unspecified number of workers in its U.S. sales division.

Is BUD a Good Stock to Buy?

Overall, Wall Street has a Strong Buy rating on BUD stock based on four analysts offering 12-month price targets in the last three months. The average BUD price target of $69.60 suggests 11% upside.

Did you know that next week we're launching a national campaign that is all about being a crew person at McDonald's?
Now we're a franchise brand, 95% of McDonald's restaurants are not owned by the corporation.
E. coli and the New Crisis Playbook PH: That leads us right up to the E. coli crisis.
And that's really hard to do when you're working with, about 800,000 people in the country who wear a McDonald's uniform.","Five key takeaways:

The “chief impact officer” role was created to streamline government relations, communications, philanthropy and sustainability, community engagement—moving with more speed and delivering greater accountability.

The company was able to respond quicky to the E.coli crisis precisely because it was not siloed, and functions like government relations and communications were able to work together.

The connection and collaboration with the head of supply chain began long before the crisis, and was critical to the company’s crisis response.

When crisis strikes a brand like McDonald’s “we have to address the emotions, not just the facts.”

“We were promoting the power of diversity in our employee ranks, in our franchisee body, in our suppliers, well before the acronym was coined. And I believe that our leadership in that will continue well after any announcement that we made.”

McDonald's needs to attend to many, many, many people of different ideologies and different beliefs, so the company “does terribly in the culture wars.”

Paul Holmes: Michael Gonda is the chief impact officer at McDonald’s and he has very kindly agreed to sit here with me and discuss the last 12 months at McDonald's, which I think it's fair to say were pretty eventful. I want to start by talking a little bit about your role. Your title is chief impact officer. What does that mean?

Michael Gonda: I'm still trying to figure that out, too, so maybe we can sort it out together. It feels very much like a title for now. We started an impact function about three years ago and the recognition was that government relations, communications, philanthropy and sustainability, community engagement, those were spread out across the company.

An example of what happened is our Archways to Opportunity Scholarship Program. We wanted to make sure the world knew about that. We wanted to make sure the program was staying modern and meeting the needs of young people today, that there was one team that could go and tell that story. And the reality is we were spread out across like four or five different departments. And that made it hard for our CEO and then our business leaders to find a single point of accountability.

So we formed the impact team. I'm about three years into my role, and I think last year was testament to this, it's worked pretty well. It's enabled us to work with more precision and more speed than we previously did.

PH: And what's the relationship between the impact function and the communications function? Obviously, there are areas of overlap and convergence.

MG: When we first started, there was a sense of why are we all in the tent together? For those who started in government relations, they saw themselves as hardened professionals who were lobbyists by trade. Why am I in a weekly meeting with communications? So different disciplines may not always see themselves working together.

An insight early on when I started, when I asked the GR team, what do you do for the brand? What is your contribution to the business? “Well, the first half of the year, we're in session and we are trying to identify opportunities or threats to the brand. And the rest of the year, we are building a reputation.”

Great. Did you know that next week we're launching a national campaign that is all about being a crew person at McDonald's? We call it One in Eight, because one in eight Americans have worked at McDonald's. And the answer was no. I was like, isn't that annoying? I mean, your job is to drive reputation for this company, and you have no idea that this suite of tools could be at your disposal? And I think as we found more and more examples like that, there has been a much closer collaboration across disciplines that started by saying, why are we all in the room together? Why are we doing annual plan together?

PH: It does make me wonder how many companies haven't figured out sort of how to bring those disciplines together for maximum effect. But I think maybe the better way to understand what it is that you do and what it is you bring to the company is for us to talk about some of the events from last year at McDonald's, because it felt like from the beginning of the year to the end, your name was being caught up in or associated with a whole plethora of important political, social, economic issues, which is inevitable when you're as ubiquitous as McDonald's obviously is.

Inflation, and the ""$18 Big Mac""

I wanted to start at the beginning of the year, and inflation, and the fact that McDonald’s has always been associated with affordable dining, so it was becoming an issue for you. So tell me a little bit about how that issue started to affect the company and how you formulated a response.

MG: Early in the year, it became clear that we were starting to lose a really important cohort that makes up about 20 to 30% of our daily visits, individuals from households that have income of $45,000 or less. The challenge that cohort was dealing with, not exclusive to them, but the pain they were facing was acutely present and visible with that cohort, and they stopped showing up. It was clear to us that our pricing was a barrier to getting people into our restaurants.

Now we're a franchise brand, 95% of McDonald's restaurants are not owned by the corporation. That means we don't set prices. We can recommend prices as part of national advertising, but we can't say everyone around the world or everyone around the country should sell chicken nuggets for this one price. So when you're seeing data that says a really important cohort is not showing up, the first thing you have to do is to convince your operators, in this case our franchisees, that we needed to launch a national program, a value menu, and we called it a $5 Meal Deal.

Now, we knew that probably in like January, February. But that meal didn't become available to Americans until May. And in that time, you started to see headlines about people not having money to go out. You saw headlines about an $18 Big Mac. But we knew this program was going to launch.

The second thing is we had to correct some misinformation. We became a bit of a political football. Anyone on the left that wanted to find an example of corporate greed would say, there's your $18 Big Mac, discount the fact that that was coming from a franchise restaurant in a singular location so not necessarily representative of national prices. On the right, this was all the failures of Bidenomics manifesting. We knew this program was going to launch, but faith and trust in the brand was just slowly eroding and coverage was getting worse and worse.

PH: Can I ask you a quick sort of interruption question? How do you measure faith and trust in the brand, and is it close enough to real time that you can make decisions?

MG: It depends. We're going to get to E. coli in a moment. You could see degradation in sales and degradation in trust, and volume of coverage, and there's a really clear line across all of them. This was probably less of a clear correlation. It wasn't like on one day something happened or the day of a headline about Big Macs and all of a sudden people stopped coming out. So you had to try to pick different pieces of data to put the story together.

And what we ultimately decided is we were going to get more front-footed about the myths and the facts about our pricing strategy. The president from McDonald's USA authored a letter that said we hear you. Prices have gotten out of control and we are going to do something about it. We went point by point on the misinformation we were seeing.

I was interested to see many people in our industry say that is a terrible idea. It's defensive, it's picking a fight. I disagree. I think when you know you're about to do something, it's really important to clarify the misinformation and say something clearly and succinctly. And we wanted to take some of the anxiety out of the conversation, and I think it actually helped consumers who were worried, even if the $18 Big Mac isn't showing up in my local store, is it coming next week?

We were able to say that that was not the case. In fact, a $5 meal deal is coming next week.

The Candidates Both Worked at McDonald's?

PH: That was, from my perspective, the first of many times that I saw McDonald's in the headlines associated with, tangential to a crisis that was clearly an American crisis. The next incident that registered with me was the controversy that sprang up around Kamala Harris's resume and the fact that McDonald's hadn't been on there, but then she mentioned that she'd worked in McDonald's in her youth.

Now, full disclosure, my first job was as a busboy in a pub in Lancaster, England, and I have never once mentioned that on a resume or a job application. But in this case, it became a source of controversy. There was an accusation that it was fabricated. There didn't seem to be any proof one way or another. And again, McDonald's was dragged into the story.

MG: So I mentioned that a source of real pride for us it that one in eight Americans have worked at McDonald's. So then when you see and hear the vice president of the United States talking with pride about her experience and what that enabled her to go on and do and the confidence that gave her. For many of us in the building and I think across the country, we felt pride.

As practitioners, as communicators, we felt excited because we were trying to get that story out there for a while.

Now, we also serve 90% of the population every year and it's no secret to anyone here that we live in a very polarized environment. So if we are seen as picking any side, we know that we are very likely going to be offending a significant number of our customers. I think that makes our brand a little bit different. I've worked in other brands where we took much clearer and more specific political views because of who our customers were and what they wanted to see from the brand.

McDonald's is different. And McDonald's needs to attend to many, many, many people of different ideologies and different beliefs. I got inundated with emails with different suggestions and ways we could capitalize on the vice president's inclusion and none of that felt authentic or right for the brand.

It was something that was part of her story and we didn't want to step in and we also didn't have the ability, which we ultimately said, to get into the question of whether the vice president worked there or not, just because of how long ago that was and I don't know if you have colleagues at your pub, do they still remember you?

PH: I don't really remember any of them.

MG: I worked at a liquor store at my college and I don't think any of my colleagues can attest to that. So that was something that we just wrestled with and we knew that by saying something we could have easily been seen to be trying to wade in and we just didn't want to get anywhere near that.

Our brand is a great brand. But it does terribly in the culture wars and this became a bit of a culture war.

PH: That leads to the next thing that I wanted to talk about because despite not wanting to get dragged into it you did eventually because one of your franchisees decided to invite Donald Trump to flip burgers for a photo op, which was clearly designed to troll Harris. How did that happen and how do you deal generally with those issues that you may have a corporate position that is strictly neutral, but you have thousands of franchisees around the country, some of whom presumably have very strong opinions one way or another, and have the latitude to act on those decisions?

MG: From April-ish to October, we did have a playbook and we shared it with all of our franchisees. It was nine specific points about keeping the brand safe in an election cycle. And part of that was not hosting political activity in a restaurant, because back to this point, if we serve 90% of the population. We are not a political brand. Political engagements in our restaurants just don't work well for us. It could be counterproductive.

We do regularly welcome and invite elected leaders to our restaurants. And that's really important, because we want people to know and see and understand what it means to run a McDonald's restaurant, what it means to work in a McDonald's restaurant, what it means to frequent a McDonald's restaurant. So opening our doors to everyone is important, it's a core value of ours.

There was a playbook, probably not relevant for this situation. We got a call the week before this visit letting us know that a franchisee had been approached by local law enforcement asking for the president to be able to come and visit. And as anyone can imagine, you kind of get these things through like a text message or an email. You're like, wait, are we talking about visiting a specific location in Pennsylvania? It's like, yeah, we think so.

Closing our door to an elected leader or presidential candidate for a major party, that felt like the wrong thing to do when we have been clear about allowing elected leaders previously to come into our restaurants. And we'd have to start explaining why we were adjudicating on this specific instance. So we're going to support the franchisee in facilitating this visit.

The question then becomes, how do you do it? And how do you explain to people what's going on? We decided that we were not going to talk a lot in advance. It got out, the location of the restaurant on Wednesday. The visit was on Sunday. It was Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, five longest days of my life, as we're trying to figure out just all of the different movements and steps that would that this would entail.

The one thing that was really important to me is that when we spoke we spoke clearly and decisively about why we did this or why this happened and what it means for the brand, which is that McDonald's is deeply important to two very important people. And to make clear to our employees and other stakeholders that this was not a political event that we had gone and secured, but a decision made by an independent business owner.

The reception to the line that we are not red, not blue, but golden, blew me away. I think that chord was people wanting to see the brand try to rise above the political fray. So I hope we did it in this situation, but it was definitely a tightrope.

PH: It does speak to the difficulty, if not impossibility, of staying out of politics, though. The needle is so fine. Threading it is a big challenge.

MG: I totally agree. I think it would have definitely been seen as a political statement had we tried to stop it. We also made sure that the Harris campaign knew that our franchisees were eager to have the vice president at our restaurants as well. I think it is hard to be neutral. You have to work really hard at trying to be even handed. That was certainly what we worked on.

E. coli and the New Crisis Playbook

PH: That leads us right up to the E. coli crisis. Last year set a record for the number and severity of food recalls across the US and this was perhaps the most high profile, not because it was the most serious necessarily, but because it was McDonald's.

Tell me a little bit about how that crisis came onto your radar and how quickly and assertively you were able to respond to it. Because when I talked to people for our crisis review earlier this year, there was a feeling that you'd sort of not only followed the playbook, but updated it for a real-time social media age.

MG: It’s humbling to hear that. It was the minute we landed in Vegas for a franchisee meeting that it was clear that there was a food safety incident, and when you work at a restaurant company or any food company that is the number one fear you have every day. It's emotional for people who work at the company, it's personal, and it becomes scary. You're hearing reports of hospitalizations and illness.

I want to go back to the first question you asked about impact, because I think our ability to respond had a lot to do with how we were organized. We weren't siloed across GR, across communications, we were able to really work together and together right at the beginning. That became very important.

The second thing is our leadership team had spent a lot of time in the two years before that on developing trust amongst the various different parties. So my connection and collaboration with our head of supply chain didn't have to begin on the 21st of October. If it did, I think we would have been toast. Similarly with the head of the US business, there was trust and he understood and knew the role that each of us could play.

So there was a lot of work that went in to us being able to respond effectively as a whole company, as a system.

We got the call from CDC. The way this works is they say we're picking up “signals” and they're getting clusters. Those signals are reports of a specific type of illness and then in a specific geography. And they start interviewing people and saying what have you eaten? And the first few, that list is really long. Then they start to get like four or five common foods and the question is have you had a quarter pounder? And they called us and said, we're confident that there is enough connections here that you need to take action.

What I'm proud of is that there was no debate in the company about whether we should just look at one ingredient and try to contain this. We ended up pulling proactively the quarter pounder in the affected area. I think we went above and beyond right out of the gate. That was so important to maintaining trust with CDC and other health authorities.

PH: Just to kind of circle back to one of the themes of this discussion, management was able to unite around the company's values and principles that you had discussed in the past. What about franchisees? Was there any pushback or reluctance in the franchisee community?

MG: Short answer, no. But the approach needed to be discussed. And we were in a meeting with a thousand franchisees in Las Vegas as this was all happening. So me, the head of our supply chain, the US president, went on stage and said, all right, you're about to get notification in the next few minutes that we'll be recalling quarter pounders in about 900 restaurants.

And what we all aligned on, company and franchisees, are three phases to managing this. I'll be honest with you, we made them up right on the spot. Phase one was rapid response, and that was we were going to do everything we could to demonstrate to public health authorities that our singular focus was on public health. The second phase would be around resumption of selling the product. And the third phase would be repairing any reputational impact.

What we were concerned about, is people might start confusing what phase we were in. If we started in phase one by saying we're the safest food brand in the world, we have never had a food safety incident, that would be a lot like an airline saying right after an incident, this is the first time this happened.

So we wanted to really own it and take responsibility in phase one and not try to be defensive.

Phase two, we would get product back on, and phase three, we would start to rebuild and regain trust that we definitely lost as a result of this food safety incident. So I think the debate with the franchisees was just explaining to them that we would go out and tell our story, but we weren't going to do that in the initial response.

PH: It must be difficult to have patience. We've talked about this now twice, that you know what your plan is, you have a strategy, just as the $5 deal evolved, But in what is a spectacularly real-time crisis, in which people start to second guess companies 10 minutes into an event rather than 10 days or 10 weeks, it must be incredibly difficult to have that discipline and to hold the line as a crisis is evolving?

MG: I mean, one of the best parts of my job is the fact that I work at a franchise business because I get to interact with small business owners all across the country. That said, when something like this happens, it's personal. It is their personal livelihood this is impacting. So it adds a different level of emotion. And it's on us, it's on me to be able to address that reality, make sure that people know that I am acutely aware of what they are going through, and that we've got a plan that can get them through it.

I mean, there's crisis playbook. I've developed them in my time with agencies for other companies, and they're helpful, but every situation is unique to the time that you're in, the environment you're in, the brand that you're working for. And we had to take a very contemporary approach to trying to get our story out there as quickly as we could.

PH: The other thing that impressed me was how fast, articulate, and on message the non-communications people involved in this were. The two voices that stood out were your head of supply chain and your North American CEO, who were recording videos, providing updates, speaking with both empathy and authority. How much of that was something that you had prepared for and how much of it was just two people in the leadership team really rising to the challenge?

MG: I think there's an intuitive sense for everyone at the company that our brand holds a very special place, not to be too reverent about it, but it is an important brand. So when something happens that is disruptive, disappointing, we have to address the emotions, not just the facts.

And that gets done through individuals getting in front of a camera, saying, one, that we own it; two, that it's safe, that we know that we've gotten all contaminated product out of our supply chain, and three, we are going to work with every single person in public health authorities, the federal level, the state level, to make sure that this can't happen again.

I think you need someone, a voice to convey that. So that didn't take a lot of too much hand wringing to select Joe Erlinger, president of our US business, and Cesar Pena, our head of supply chain, to take the lead. It wasn't like, what do you mean we need to go do this? It was more like, OK, when? And the when began immediately. We flew back to Chicago from Vegas and Joe was on the Today Show within about six hours.

PH: Again, from my perspective as an outsider, the turnaround from there's a recall to we're confident that we can bring this product back was really short. Did that create its own challenge that people would say, well, that got fixed suspiciously quickly. How did you deal with bringing the product back?

MG: We tried to bring reporters along on the journey with us. The first day we held a briefing call, and we had like 300 people join the call. And we did that four times throughout the first week. What we tried to explain to them was one, we don't think this is about any sort of lapse in cooking procedures, otherwise you would have seen a much more widespread problem. We knew it was pretty contained, and we tried to really explain that to reporters and make sure they understood, along with health officials, why we were confident that we'd isolated it.

By the time we got to resumption, they weren't questioning whether that was prudent or putting profit over people.

Customers, we needed to make sure that when they walked into a restaurant and they had a question, they got answers to it. And that's really hard to do when you're working with, about 800,000 people in the country who wear a McDonald's uniform. To train 800,000 people on messages is hard.

PH: Let me ask you a question about that, because you talk about reporters, and I wonder the extent to which the media landscape that you deal with in a crisis has changed. So in times of crisis, is it in fact still the mainstream legacy media that have the biggest impact on trust and credibility? Or did you also involve alternative media, independent media, even influences in that process?

MG: I think it's an and, so it wasn't one over the other, but when you're dealing with food safety issues, I think reporters, traditional media, still carry a lot of weight and water. What we talked about in the company, is we need to see them as performing a public service. We had franchisees ask us what they should do when reporters come to their restaurants and set up live shots. And our answer was, thank them and offer them coffee. They're there to try to educate the public on what is safe and what is not.

I think this is true for other industries, aviation and others, traditional media is very important. It's not to diminish alternative media and influencers, but I don't think I'm fully there yet to say you don't need to prioritize traditional media.

The Ireland-headquartered business took back control and distribution of its cider portfolio, which included Magners and Bulmers, from Budweiser supplier AB InBev last year and said it has “exciting plans” for its brands.

The positive outlook came as C&C Group posted a trading update for the 12 months ended 28 February 2024.

It said group revenues were expected to be in line with last year, reflecting growth in its Matthew Clark Bibendum distribution business. This was due to disposing of its non-core soft drinks business in Ireland and its strategic exit from low-margin contract brewing volume, set against softer British cider sales during the summer trading period.

Acknowledging the additional pressures of the macroeconomic environment and last October’s UK Budget, the company said that despite these headwinds, it had made good financial progress and expected to report underlying earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of €76m-€78m (£64m-£65m).

This was modestly below C&C Group’s target due to softer trading in January and February, but reflected recovery versus the prior year’s earnings of €60m (£50m).

Furthermore, Matthew Clark Bibendum’s customer numbers grew 7% in the second half of the 2024 financial year.

The group expected 2026 financial year earnings to be marginally ahead of the current year, and aimed to deliver €100m (£84m) EBIT over the medium-term.

Chief executive Roger White, who joined C&C at the beginning of this year, said there was still “much work to be done to fully realise the potential across the group”, and added: “While the market backdrop remains challenging, we are continuing to support our customers, invest in the business and have some exciting plans to implement this year. I remain confident of the significant long-term opportunity within the business.”

The business is emerging from a turbulent period that saw it post a £96m loss in the year to 29 February 2024 after accounting errors discovered in its previous results.

Last year activist shareholder Engine Capital published a scathing open letter that branded the company a “perennial underperformer” and encouraged it to conduct a strategic review in preparation for a sale. The dispute was subsequently resolved, with the US private investor pledging to “work constructively together” with C&C.

The latest downsizing is part of the company’s plans to reduce operational costs by about 15% this year and comes after it cut 16% of some 25,000 employees last year, one of the people said. This year’s staff reduction would mean thousands more employees will depart the company after 4,000 were already cut last year, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.

China will bear the brunt of the reductions as it accounts for more than 80% of the group’s manpower.

The company has been steadily reducing its headcount over the past few years, with the staff size shrinking about 20% by the end of 2023 from more than 30,000 in 2017.

“As we optimize our operations structure, we are dedicated to fostering innovation and building our workforce to drive our success,” a Budweiser APAC spokesperson said. “For over four decades, we have invested in China, we are confident in its growth potential and remain focused on our strategic priorities.”

Budweiser APAC’s downsizing highlights the predicament of global brewers in the world’s second-largest economy, where consumers are reining in spending amid an economic slowdown and property market slump. The group, controlled by Anheuser-Busch InBev, posted a net loss of $16 million in the fourth quarter, missing analysts’ estimate of a $6.72 million profit. For last year as a whole, profit plunged 15% while revenue declined 9%.

Rival brewers are facing similar challenges. Both volume and revenue dropped for Carlsberg in China last year.

In an effort to drive a turnaround in China, Budweiser APAC has named Yanjun Cheng, a 29-year veteran of the company, to succeed Jan Craps who will step down in April after seven years.

Cheng will need to steer the company through multiple headwinds, including its declining image in the Chinese market.

To help speed up the process, Kempczinski, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, said he’s making changes in leadership and operations in the company aimed at making McDonald’s move faster.

As part of the changes, Jill McDonald, who heads the company’s international division, has been tapped to be the chain’s first chief restaurant experience officer beginning May 1.

She will soon lead a team responsible for the company’s innovation, supply chains, and operations.

“I wanted one person who’s actually looking at all these tech things through the eyes of the restaurant general manager,” Kempczinski said to the Journal. He didn’t share what other changes would be made to speed up the burger making process.

Kempczinski did hint at McDonald’s potentially expanding its drinks menu.

“We just need to make sure that our menu offering doesn’t give somebody a reason why they come to us for their food and they maybe go to the place next door to go get the beverage,” Kempczinski said.

(LEVI) : Free Stock Analysis Report This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).","American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.54 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.50 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.61 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this teen clothing retailer would post earnings of $0.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.48, delivering a surprise of 4.35%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.

American Eagle , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, posted revenues of $1.6 billion for the quarter ended January 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.68 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

American Eagle shares have lost about 31.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -5.3%.

What's Next for American Eagle?

While American Eagle has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for American Eagle: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.31 on $1.16 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.79 on $5.5 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Apparel and Shoes is currently in the top 27% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Another stock from the same industry, Levi Strauss (LEVI), has yet to report results for the quarter ended February 2025.

This jeans maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.7%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

Levi Strauss' revenues are expected to be $1.54 billion, down 1% from the year-ago quarter.

Starbucks is testing potential designs for its coffee shops. | Rendering courtesy of Starbucks

Since he took over as CEO of Starbucks last year, Brian Niccol has unleashed a torrent of changes, many of them designed to return the company to its “third place” coffee-shop roots. Baristas are now writing names on cups. The company has a code of conduct. Customers get free coffee refills. Starbucks is cutting from the menu. It’s marketing all of it.

Yet as the chain works to bring Starbucks more fully back to those roots, it needs to look at the shops themselves.

Speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, Niccol said Starbucks has started testing new designs of its coffee shops. And then he offered some pretty big hints as to what those shops might look like.

“Imagine coffeehouses that are comfortable and warm with expanded seating, power outlets and food displays,” he said. “Stores with separation between the café and mobile orders, featuring risers and dedicated pickup shelves at locations to create an intuitive handoff and anchored by a redesigned espresso bar that adds a sense of theater and enhances the connection between our baristas and customers.”

Details on the “coffeehouse of the future” aren’t yet available. But it’s a logical next step for a company working to balance the needs of its on-the-go customers who use mobile order on their way to work with those who want to stay a while. The company is looking to establish standards for shops that ensure each of them have a more welcoming, coffeeshop feel.

Niccol arrived to Starbucks with a clear sense of what ails the chain, that as it has worked to court more and more mobile and drive-thru customers, it has lost its sense of purpose and what originally led consumers to the chain—that coffee shop feel.

To be sure, Starbucks’ focus on mobile ordering and loyalty members helped the chain become an immense success. Average unit volumes in the U.S. grew by 35% between 2018 and 2023, before its sales dropped. Total system sales grew more than 50%, according to data from Restaurant Business sister company Technomic.

Yet there is a sense that the company went too far. Starbucks built a lot more drive-thrus. It introduced pickup stores without seating. One of them replaced a higher-end Reserve location in downtown Seattle. More broadly, the conflict between the company’s demand for more digital and drive-thru customers and those who want to just have a coffee at a coffee shop contributed to the chain’s weak sales last year.

“We have made mistakes on this one,” Niccol said. “We have to go back and fix it.”

At the same time, Starbucks needs those on-the-go digital customers to keep its sales. It did not become the world’s second-largest restaurant chain purely by focusing on people who spend a couple of hours inside its coffee shops.

Niccol said that requires a balance. But he’s also confident in the company’s ability to do that. “We have the ability to do both,” he said.

Niccol said the company is focused on “delivering great experiences,” whether customers come in and sit down with a ceramic mug of coffee, or they order ahead and the sequence on mobile orders is correct “so people show up when their drink shows up and vice versa.”

“I believe we have the ability to do it,” Niccol added. “We have to bring order to how we do it and support our partners with the right process, standards, equipment to ensure it happens every single time.”

Niccol also got a bit philosophical. The restaurant industry after the pandemic has focused a lot on that digital and drive-thru customer. But restaurants are fundamentally gathering spaces, places for community.

“That third place is probably more necessary than it ever has been,” Niccol said. “Without a doubt, whether you are a teenager, 8-year-old person, somebody in their 50s or 40s, what everybody likes to do is connect with people in their community, in a safe place over a cup of coffee. Hot or cold, Starbucks can play a role.”",https://cdn.informaconnect.com/platform/files/public/2025-03/background/Starbucks%20exterior%20rendering%20company%20copy.jpg?VersionId=RMePTiGLX0jFRbn5h5wojHRJbA6RFpyV,N,,2025-03-12 23:05:51.709323

He indicated that initial responses suggest these changes have been beneficial for Starbucks’ partners, customers, and business operations.

Here are the important takeaways from today’s annual meeting of shareholders

Niccol opened the meeting by emphasizing key insights he’s experienced and heard from customers since joining Starbucks: a commitment to serving the world’s finest coffee, the impact of the company’s incredible green apron partners, and the enduring strength of the Starbucks brand.

“From bean to cup, it’s the people at Starbucks that make us special… The moment of connection between a customer and their barista can mean so much, especially in today’s fast-paced and sometimes isolating world. I’m proud to call them partners, and I’m proud of all they do. Together, it’s what make our brand enduring and iconic,” he said.

Six months after taking the helm as Starbucks chairman and chief executive officer, Niccol acknowledged the current challenges facing the company are real, but its core strengths and opportunities ahead offer great optimism.

“…we have a clear path forward. This path is grounded in reconnecting with who we are when we’re at our best. We call it “Back to Starbucks.” It’s about focusing on our brand truths and the role we play in the lives of our customers, and our partners and communities. It’s about getting those fundamentals right and then building and innovating from there,” he said.

To get “Back to Starbucks,” the company is focused on reintroducing Starbucks to the world, delivering the customer experience to win the morning and at peak, reestablishing Starbucks as the community coffeehouse, and ensuring Starbucks is the unrivaled best job in retail, recognizing that success starts and ends with Starbucks green apron partners.

“As a brand, we have reduced the frequency of discount-driven offers, taken steps to simplify our menu, and overhauled our marketing to remind people what sets us apart — the coffee we make, and the company we keep,” Niccol said. “Early reactions tell me these were the right steps for our partners, our customers, and the business.”

“As we take our next steps “Back to Starbucks,” we’ll continue to enhance the health of our store portfolio. We’re working hard to ensure our coffeehouses have the right vibe…we want to invite customers in, showcase our great coffee, provide a comfortable place to stay, and make them feel like their visit was time well spent.”

With the near-term focus of “Back to Starbucks” on the U.S. business, Starbucks is a global company with significant international opportunity.

“Our operations in many global markets also set an example for our U.S. coffeehouses, with outstanding partners serving customers every day. We have so much potential to keep growing around the world.”

Hobson followed Niccol with remarks of gratitude to Starbucks shareholders for her nearly 20 years of service on the board.

“The current board is stocked with a deep bench of world class business minds, and with Brian now firmly at the helm, I am confident Starbucks is in excellent hands. Together, Brian and the board will guide this company into the future…while remaining laser-focused on driving long-term value for all stakeholders,” Hobson said.

Throughout his remarks, Niccol highlighted his confidence in returning the business to growth. “We’re focused on our “Back to Starbucks” plan. We are moving quickly to execute, and I am pleased at the early reaction to changes we’ve made from both customers and partners. It makes me optimistic for our future.”

CVS confirmed to FOX Business that it will open at least a dozen smaller format locations in select communities across the country over the next year.
However, the company said it is still opening up traditional CVS Pharmacy locations, which contain a full front store and pharmacy.
In addition to the new small-format pharmacies, the company is planning to open nearly 30 CVS Pharmacy locations, including those inside Target stores, this year.
Leventhal believes the CVS’ new store formats could help the company become less reliant on front-of-store customer traffic.","CVS Pharmacy is expanding its footprint. But a major focus is on smaller store formats exclusively offering pharmacy services.

The shift to small-format stores comes as the industry works to rightsize and reduce costs in response to ongoing challenges, including intense competition and shifting consumer preferences.

CVS confirmed to FOX Business that it will open at least a dozen smaller format locations in select communities across the country over the next year.

The new pharmacies, which will average less than 5,000 square feet, will feature a full-service pharmacy with limited over-the-counter products available for purchase and will be designed to meet the community’s specific pharmacy needs.

WALGREENS TO GO PRIVATE IN $10B DEAL

""By taking a customized approach to our footprint that is focused on the specific needs of the communities we serve, we’re continuing to strategically realign our pharmacy footprint to better support patient and ensure the right geographic coverage,"" a CVS spokesperson told FOX Business.

However, the company said it is still opening up traditional CVS Pharmacy locations, which contain a full front store and pharmacy. In addition to the new small-format pharmacies, the company is planning to open nearly 30 CVS Pharmacy locations, including those inside Target stores, this year.

Emarketer senior analyst Rajiv Leventhal told FOX Business that the retail plus pharmacy business model has been difficult for companies like CVS and Walgreens to successfully operate as people increasingly turn to online channels for household items.

The growing number of closures at CVS, Rite Aid and Walgreens in recent years highlights how the industry is attempting to right-size itself after rapidly expanding its footprint. CVS has shuttered hundreds of stores and laid off staff in order to re-prioritize its investments and adhere to the changing customer needs. Between 2022 and 2024, it closed 900 stores, and opened 100 new locations. It plans to close an additional 270 in 2025.

WHY NEIGHBORHOOD PHARMACIES ARE CLOSING

In 2023, Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy and launched a store optimization plan, closing 154 locations. Then, in 2024, Walgreens announced plans to close at least 1,200 stores over the next three years in an effort to reduce costs and turn around its operations. Walgreens has not commented on whether this timeline will change now that the company is going private. Last week, Walgreens, once a $100 billion business, agreed to sell to private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal valued at 10% of that, about $10 billion.

Leventhal expects this move to accelerate, and potentially increase, the number of store closures. He predicts that major companies like Walgreens and CVS will continue closing many of their stores while focusing more on pharmacy services in the locations they keep open.

""Consumers are prioritizing price, speed, and convenience above all. Drugstores locking up items to prevent theft further frustrates shoppers and causes many to abandon in-store purchases,"" Leventhal said. However, he underscored that CVS’ and Walgreens’ recent retail pharmacy struggles are much more about the front of the store than behind the pharmacy counter.

""Patients will always need their medications, and CVS and Walgreens rank first and second in US pharmacy size as measured by total prescription revenues,"" Leventhal added.

Leventhal believes the CVS’ new store formats could help the company become less reliant on front-of-store customer traffic. He also suggests this model could empower pharmacists to play a larger role in patients’ healthcare decisions.

""Doubling down on the steadier business—prescription and over-the-counter medications—is a savvy play,"" he said.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2025/03/1280/720/cvs-pharmacy.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-03-12 16:05:26.639133

After nearly eight and a half decades of being America's favorite fast-food chain, McDonald's has been struggling with a slowdown in sales. This is partly due to growing competition, price increases caused by inflation, and changes in its DEI practices, which have caused persistent backlash and boycotts.

Nonetheless, McDonald's refuses to let all these setbacks hinder its decades-old business or allow its rivals to dethrone it from its highly coveted position.

McDonald's develops a multi-year strategy to accelerate growth

Since announcing its first Accelerating the Arches growth strategy in 2020, which focused on McDonald's (MCD) purpose, mission, values, growth pillars, and foundation of running its restaurants, it has seen immense improvements in its business.

According to the company, McDonald's has grown its digital footprint to over 175 million 90-day active users across 60 markets, generating around $30 billion in systemwide sales to loyalty members in 2024. The fast food chain has also expanded its restaurants faster and introduced global menu innovations worldwide.

However, with the ever-evolving market and consumer trends, maintaining the same growth strategy for multiple years seemed to no longer do it for McDonald's.

Quick-service restaurants have begun specializing in a single product as their main selling point to accelerate growth in record time. They focus on what they do best to dominate that specific market.

Some of McDonald's biggest rivals successfully executing this strategy include Chick-fil-A, which focuses on chicken-based menu items; Dutch Bros, which focuses on beverages; and In-N-Out Burger, which focuses on its burgers.

McDonald's introduces the launch of new specialized teams to compete with its biggest rivals

Unlike many of its rivals, McDonald's refuses to let increased competition dominate the market. Instead of blaming others, it has taken action to fight back against its fast-growing rivals.

On Mar. 11, McDonald's introduced the new Restaurant Experience Team, which brings together operations, supply chain, franchising, development, restaurant design, delivery, and Speedee Labs to execute new innovative ideas and optimize efficiency.

These newly founded teams were created to stand against McDonald's strongest competitors by keeping up with emerging trends, allowing it to stay ahead of the game and continue gaining further market share.

""There’s strong competition within the QSR industry, and success is determined by our ability to gain share. In many markets, McDonald’s is competing against specialists.

In 2024, J&J generated significantly more sales than any company in the life sciences industry at $88.8 billion, which was a 4.3% increase year over year.
In 2023, J&J realized a 6.5% increase in revenue.
The graph shows that $100 invested in J&J back in 2019 would have been worth about $115 in 2024.","In his third year as the CEO of Johnson & Johnson, Joaquin Duato received an overall compensation package worth $24.3 million. It was a 14% decrease from his $28.4 million figure in 2023, when he was the world’s highest-paid Big Pharma chief executive.

The reduction is due largely to calculations surrounding changes in the CEO's pension value from year to year. While his estimated pension value grew by $6.2 million in 2023, the increase was $2.7 million in 2024, according (PDF) to a regulatory filing.

Duato, 62, also saw decreases in his bonus—from $4.4 million in 2023 to $4 million last year—and in his equity awards, which fell from $16 million to $15.7 million from year to year.

J&J also reported that it spent $145,381 on Duato’s use of personal aircraft and $102,779 on home security services last year.

Still, the company has continued to struggle in resolving its talc litigation—which is now in its third bankruptcy effort. In its proxy, J&J said that it “recorded an accounting charge of $5.1 billion related to talc matters in 2024.”

J&J added that it determined it was in the “best interest of the company and shareholders to exclude the $5.1 billion talc settlement charge” from its executive compensation considerations.

""The underlying events and decisions that resulted in the talc-related litigation charges occurred before company executives assumed their current roles,"" the company explained. ""Company executives have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the litigation on behalf of the company and shareholders.""

In addition, a graph charting shareholder returns for peer group companies shows J&J’s returns declining over the past two years while returns for J&J’s peer group companies have increased.

The graph shows that $100 invested in J&J back in 2019 would have been worth about $115 in 2024. But for an index of other large-cap pharma companies, the number was $155.

Duato took the helm at J&J at the start of 2022, succeeding Alex Gorsky, who guided the company for a decade. During his tenure, Gorsky twice collected more than $29 million in annual compensation. In his final year (2021), Gorsky was the highest-paid Big Pharma exec at $26.7 million.

Among other J&J execs, chief financial officer Joseph Wolk saw his compensation decline from $13.9 million to $12.6 million from 2023 to 2024.

Innovative medicines chief Jennifer Taubert received $11.2 million in total compensation last year, while R&D chief John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., collected a $9.3 million pay package.

Having executives focused solely on beverages, for example, can determine where McDonald’s might need to introduce new products, he said.
The Journal reported that McDonald’s is “seeking to regain momentum in a tough environment for fast-food chains.” McDonald’s global same-store sales held steady in 2024 after several years of growth.","McDonald’s is “shaking up its operations and development ranks as it seeks to get new menu items and technology to restaurants more quickly,” according to an exclusive article in the Wall Street Journal.

The move comes as Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski said that recent efforts to develop new sandwiches have taken too long. Kempczinski, who has led the QSR since 2019, told the Journal that McDonald’s strategic plans emphasize greater nimbleness, but that the company needs to deploy new products and technology to restaurants faster and improve coordination with stores.

Kempczinski said he hoped that a year from now, the new innovation structure will help McDonald’s win more market share, particularly in beef, chicken and coffee.

Under the new structure, Jill McDonald will become the restaurant’s first chief restaurant experience officer, effective May 1. McDonald currently heads the company’s international division that includes Europe, Canada and Australia.

According to the Journal, in the new role she will lead a team that works across operations, supply chain, franchising, development, design, delivery and the company’s innovation lab. The group will also include executives overseeing the chain’s beef, chicken and beverage businesses across the globe.

“I wanted one person who’s actually looking at all these tech things through the eyes of the restaurant general manager,” Kempczinski said.

McDonald will “oversee the global chief supply-chain officer, helping to ensure that restaurants have the right equipment and processes for handling new menu items.” Charlie Newberger, who currently helps run the company’s CosMc’s offshoot, will lead work on beverages and desserts.

Kempczinski, previously an executive at Kraft Heinz and PepsiCo, told the Journal that adopting a mindset similar to a consumer packaged-food company can help McDonald’s move faster. Having executives focused solely on beverages, for example, can determine where McDonald’s might need to introduce new products, he said.

McDonald's takes years to introduce new burgers, its CEO says, and he wants to change that.

The chain's chief executive, Chris Kempczinski, said he wants to speed up the process of introducing new burgers and improving existing signature burgers. He made these comments in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published on Tuesday.

Kempczinski says he's switching things up in leadership and operations to make the company move faster. Part of that involves changing the job scopes of his leadership team to roll out new technology and products to its restaurants faster.

Jill McDonald, who heads the company's international division, has been tapped to be the chain's first chief restaurant experience officer starting May 1. McDonald is a retail veteran, having held top roles at Marks and Spencer and Costa Coffee.

She'll lead the team responsible for the company's innovation, supply chains, and operations.

""I wanted one person who's actually looking at all these tech things through the eyes of the restaurant general manager,"" Kempczinski said to the Journal.

He did not elaborate on how else he would speed up the burger development process. Representatives for McDonald's did not respond to a query from Business Insider on the topic, sent outside regular business hours.

In the interview, Kempczinski also hinted at a more extensive drinks menu. He said he would get executives to focus exclusively on beverage development.

He said this would help the company find a way to keep customers in store and buying their drinks rather than going to competitors.

""We just need to make sure that our menu offering doesn't give somebody a reason why they come to us for their food and they maybe go to the place next door to go get the beverage,"" Kempczinski said.

Kempczinski's comments come as the chain posted stagnant financial results in 2024. The chain's global comparable sales declined 0.1% in 2024. It reported a full-year revenue of $25.92 billion.

When markets closed on Tuesday, McDonald's stock traded at $306.8. It has risen about 4% in the past year.

The fast food industry is facing a wave of cost-conscious consumers in the US who are put off by rising fast food product prices. Some are opting to eat at home.

In 2022, Kraft Heinz embarked on a significant expansion project at its manufacturing facility in Garland, Texas, USA.
In 2022, Kraft Heinz also expanded its global operations by acquiring an 85% stake in Germany-based Just Spices GmbH.
In 2024, Kraft Heinz reported progress in its transformation journey, emphasising innovation in flavour, snacking and easy meals.
Additionally, Kraft Heinz expanded the use of its condiments beyond traditional pairings, targeting foods like burritos and tacos.","COVID-19 profoundly impacted global manufacturing, disrupting supply chains, changing the landscape of consumer demand and prompting operational shifts to comply with social distancing guidelines.

We saw the US auto industry experience a notable downturn, with car sales as of yet not returning to 2019 levels.

In Germany, almost 250,000 manufacturing jobs were lost as industries invested heavily in automation.

For Kraft Heinz, the pandemic presented opportunities and challenges.

It mandated social distancing guidelines and pursued key protocols to reduce the spread of the disease, whilst working to strategically adapt to dramatic changes in demand.

With the shift to a 'stay at home' economy and the rise of consumer panic buying in preparation for lockdowns, the manufacturer experienced an unprecedented surge in demand for products like Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Heinz Ketchup, Maxwell House Coffee and Oscar Mayer hot dogs.

To meet this demand, Kraft Heinz adapted and enhanced its resiliency.

All US factories operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week to produce the aforementioned products- an unprecedented level of operation, far greater than typical seasonal demand.

This was possible due to Kraft Heinz's workforce, who showed up ensure a steady food supply during the crisis- employee attendance rates at the manufacturer's factories were among the best in recent years.

The result was that factories like Kraft Heinz's Iowa plant, responsible for producing Oscar Mayer cold cuts, achieved record outputs during the pandemic.

Kraft Heinz has since built on this growth by enhancing its production capabilities and modernising its manufacturing and distribution centres.

This expansion, growing since 2020, is also a reflection of Kraft Heinz's strategic adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies like automation and AI.

Here are just a few examples of how Kraft Heinz has successfully grown since the pandemic.

In 2021 Manufacturing Digital reported on Kraft Heinz's £140 million ( US$189m) investment in its Kitt Green plant near Wigan, UK, Europe's largest food manufacturing facility.

Last year this factory - in a project pursued in collaboration with Carlton Power - became a green hydrogen project, enabling Kraft Heinz to fuel over 50% of the site using hydrogen.

This project is anticipated to finish in 2026.

Kraft Heinz's 2021 investment was the company's most substantial investment in an existing manufacturing site outside the United States in over two decades.

The Kitt Green facility produces approximately 1.3 billion cans of food annually, including iconic products like Heinz Beanz, soups and pasta, with 94% consumed within the UK.

The investment aimed to modernise the site's manufacturing capabilities over four years, focusing on three key areas:

Repatriating sauce production: Bringing the manufacturing of Heinz sauces such as ketchup, mayonnaise and salad cream back to the UK to enhance European capacity.

Upgrading machinery: Implementing state-of-the-art equipment to improve efficiency and product quality.

Enhancing sustainability: Aligning with environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) commitments by reducing the use of non-renewable resources and lowering the facility's carbon footprint.

This modernisation was expected to created 50 new full-time positions and provide upskilling opportunities for existing staff.

The initiative underscored Kraft Heinz's confidence in the UK's post-Brexit economy and its commitment to supporting local manufacturing, inspiring further expansion abroad.

In 2022, Kraft Heinz embarked on a significant expansion project at its manufacturing facility in Garland, Texas, USA.

This initiative involved a capital investment of US$143m, aimed at modernising and upgrading the plant's production capabilities. #

The expansion plans included the addition of two to three new production lines and the modernisation of existing ones.

This development was projected to create approximately 200 new jobs, increasing the facility's workforce to around 1,500 employees.

The project was scheduled to span three years, commencing in 2022 and concluding in 2026.

Kraft Heinz also began a €70 million (US$82.6m) expansion of its manufacturing site in Alfaro, La Rioja, Spain in 2021.

This investment increased the factory's capacity by 50%, enhancing its position as one of the company's most efficient facilities in Europe.

The expansion included the addition of a state-of-the-art processing plant and was expected to generate 39 new permanent jobs in the region.

The Alfaro plant produces a range of Heinz sauces for both local and European markets and processes approximately 25,000 tonnes of locally grown tomatoes annually for the company's Orlando brand.

In 2022, Kraft Heinz also expanded its global operations by acquiring an 85% stake in Germany-based Just Spices GmbH.

Established in 2014, Just Spices is a direct-to-consumer company offering over 170 products, including spice blends, salad dressings and organic options.

Approximately 70% of its sales are online, with the remainder through retailers in Germany, Spain, Austria and Switzerland.

This acquisition aligned with Kraft Heinz's strategy to enhance its direct-to-consumer capabilities and strengthen its presence in the taste elevation market, enabling the company to greater diversify.

In July 2023, Kraft Heinz announced a substantial investment exceeding US$400m to construct a 775,000 square-foot automated distribution centre in DeKalb, Illinois.

This facility was designed to enhance supply chain efficiencies and expedite product distribution to retail and foodservice customers across North America.

Equipped with state-of-the-art automation technology and national railway access, the centre handles more than 60% of the company's foodservice business and approximately 30% of all dry goods.

The project created more than 150 jobs in the region and aligns with Kraft Heinz's environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) goals by implementing sustainable technologies to minimise environmental impact.

In May 2024, Kraft Heinz Canada and Highbury Canco extended their partnership agreement for another four years, ensuring continued production at the Leamington, Ontario facility until the end of 2027.

This extension marked the third consecutive renewal of their collaboration, underscoring the importance of the Leamington plant in Kraft Heinz's operations.

The 2.1-million-square-foot facility employs over 600 Canadians and produces popular products such as Heinz beans, Heinz tomato juice and Classico pasta sauce.

The estimated retail value of products to be produced at this facility over the next four years exceeds US$1bn.

In 2024, Kraft Heinz reported progress in its transformation journey, emphasising innovation in flavour, snacking and easy meals.

The manufacturer introduced new ketchup flavours, including a spicy variant in the US and a pickle-infused option for a tangy taste.

Additionally, Kraft Heinz expanded the use of its condiments beyond traditional pairings, targeting foods like burritos and tacos.

In the easy meals segment, the company launched Heinz Curry Beanz, which generated 60% incrementality and attracted new customers to the category.

Convenience was further enhanced with Heinz Beans snap-pots for microwave use and frozen Kraft Mac & Cheese options.

These initiatives aimed to meet modern consumer demands and strengthen Kraft Heinz's market position.

In addition to producing a range of Heinz sauces for local and European consumption, the Alfaro plant processes around 25,000 tons of locally grown tomatoes each year for the company’s market-leading Orlando brand.

Spain is a key production centre for Heinz in Europe and boosting capability in the region brings the company closer to its ambition to lead the future of food.

This journey not only highlights Kraft Heinz's successful manufacturing strategy of continual expansion and diversification, but also how critical their response was during the pandemic.

By capitalising on opportunity and emerging technologies, they put themselves in a enviable position that created a robust foundation for future growth.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/b8d87e31db2eea0c23764843987a91ae:a15ba7ea22eda5acb0e9d0f48ac889e7/alfaro-team-1.jfif.jpg,N,,2025-03-12 13:08:56.498754

SocGen CEO pledges cost cuts to boost efficiency

Société Générale chief executive Slawomir Krupa has pledged to slash costs at the French bank, declaring that “nothing is sacred” as he seeks to improve efficiency and reduce its high cost base.

In an interview with the Financial Times published on Tuesday, Krupa described SocGen as having “lower levels of efficiency” than its peers and an “overspend” problem that needed to be addressed.

At the end of 2024, the bank’s cost-to-income ratio stood at 69 per cent, one of the highest among major European lenders, though it had fallen by five percentage points compared with the previous year. SocGen has previously said it was targeting a cost-to-income ratio of below 60 per cent by 2026.

As part of his restructuring plans launched in September 2023, Krupa has overseen job cuts and the disposal of non-core businesses in an effort to strengthen capital reserves. He said that IT spending could be further reduced and that decreasing the bank’s dependence on external consultants could further lower its cost base.

Krupa told the FT that the bank had incurred “colossal” restructuring costs, amounting to €613mn last year, but noted these were “disappearing progressively”.

His initial strategy was met with scepticism from investors, but confidence has since improved, with SocGen’s share price climbing over 70 per cent in the past year.

Net-Zero Banking Alliance members to vote on abandoning 1.5C pledge

The Net-Zero Banking Alliance is set to ask its members, which include HSBC and Barclays, to vote on whether to abandon a commitment to align their $54tn in assets with the Paris agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C.

The vote, reported by the Financial Times on Tuesday, comes as the NZBA seeks to retain members following a wave of exits by major US banks.

Since the election of Donald Trump as US president, 14 leading US banks, including Bank of America, Citi and JPMorgan, have withdrawn from the group, arguing they cannot decarbonise their lending and investment portfolios at a pace faster than the broader economy.

The NZBA is now contending with similar warnings from Europe. The FT previously reported that a coalition of leading European banks has threatened to exit unless the group relaxes its rules.

Under the revised proposal, members would pledge to align their activities with the less stringent target of keeping global warming “well below 2C” while making efforts to limit it to 1.5C.

US recession risk now at 40%, warns JPMorgan economist

JPMorgan’s chief economist, Bruce Kasman, warned on Wednesday that the risk of a US recession has risen to 40 per cent from 30 per cent at the start of the year, citing political uncertainty and trade policies as potential threats to the country’s appeal as an investment destination.

“Where we stand now is with a heightened concern about the US economy,” Kasman said in comments reported by Reuters.

JPMorgan currently projects US GDP growth of 2 per cent in 2025. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have both lowered their US growth forecasts to 1.7 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively.

Kasman warned that if President Donald Trump’s proposed reciprocal tariffs, set to take effect in April, are fully implemented, the risk of a US recession could rise to 50 per cent or higher.

“If we would continue down this road of what would be more disruptive, business-unfriendly policies, I think the risks on that recession front would go up,” he said.

ICBC launches $11bn tech fund to boost China’s private sector

Industrial and Commercial Bank of China announced on Wednesday that it has launched an Rmb80bn ($11bn) technology and innovation fund to support the country’s private economy.

The fund will focus on “hard technology” sectors such as semiconductors and advanced manufacturing, rather than “soft” technology like internet services, according to a statement from the state-owned bank.

ICBC chair Liao Lin said the bank would “thoroughly implement directives from central leadership” by turning supportive policies into concrete actions for private enterprises.

He said that the fund is designed as “patient capital”, prioritising long-term investment over short-term gains.

The announcement follows China’s annual parliamentary meeting last week, where policymakers set their key priorities for 2025.

This month, Wellvana paid an undisclosed sum to buy CVS Health's Medicare Shared Savings Program ACO operations in a transaction that also made the Aetna parent company a minority shareholder in Wellvana.

Under the Medicare Shared Savings Program, providers form groups of ACOs and take on risk for fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries. These partnerships often contract with companies such Wellvana, which can pocket savings they help generate.

Wellvana already works with providers assuming risk under the fee-for-service Medicare ACO Realizing Equity, Access and Community Health, or ACO REACH, model and contracts with Medicare Advantage insurers such as Humana and Centene.

The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Why did you make the Medicare Shared Savings Program deal?

We've been going very deep in supporting practices and providing a lot of tech-enabled services. That could be scheduling, value-based care, education and medical management for patients, whereas CVS built scale and has a lighter-touch model. These models make a great marriage and give providers flexibility. Not all providers are going to want the same type of service or the same level of service.

Scale also brings predictability. Predictability enables us to invest more in our provider relationships. It allows us to invest in medical management, invest in documentation, and invest in services and education.

The combined company has about $12.5 billion in medical spending under management and we have approximately 1 million patient lives associated with that medical spend. We have 500 accountable care organization clients. Those clients are a combination of large hospitals, primary care providers or independent physician practices. We now have 300-plus team members and brought about 150 CVS employees into the company through the acquisition.

Are you eyeing additional acquisitions?

We certainly want to continue to partner with additional health systems, primary care and independent providers, and also Medicare Advantage payers. As we look at our network, there is a significant opportunity to expand within our existing provider partners into Medicare Advantage.

What is your outlook for Medicare Advantage under President Donald Trump?

We're bullish long-term. If you look at the growth within the program over the past decade, it's hard to deny the value proposition that patients are seeing in the program. We expect it to continue to grow.

Patients need to have optionality. We're pretty diversified between traditional Medicare programs, like ACO REACH or Medicare Shared Savings Program, and the Medicare Advantage side. That diversification is important. We want our business to look like the panel of our providers.

Regardless of the administration, we do think the Medicare Advantage industry has good tailwinds.

ACO REACH is scheduled to sunset in 2026. How do you feel about its future?

We're optimistic about the program. Medicare set a goal for 100% of patients to be tied to value by 2030. ACO REACH is a key part of that. It's up to 2.5 million lives in the program. It's a pretty significant scale in a pretty short period.

Whether the ACO REACH program becomes permanent, or whether there are higher levels of risk incorporated into the Medicare Shared Savings Program, we feel optimistic that higher levels of risk in traditional Medicare will continue to happen.

Do you assume risk for pharmacy and supplemental benefit costs in your contracts with Medicare Advantage insurers?

We do not take risk on Part D prescription drug benefits today. We're not taking pharmaceutical risk unless it's hitting under Part B for provider-infused drugs, which is only a small percentage of pharmaceutical costs. We do assume risk today on supplemental benefits. It's something that we will continue to evaluate and see if that makes sense for us.

We used to take risk in pharmacy. But with the changes in the Inflation Reduction Act and the uncertainty associated with that in terms of the cost, that is something that we moved away from.",https://s3-prod.modernhealthcare.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/Kyle-Wailes-Wellvana-0325.png,N,,2025-03-12 11:06:15.958597

Recognizing this, a global conglomerate with many lines of business wanted to improve the efficiency of its supply chain and warehouses.

The challenge involved assessing and optimizing the value of the company’s stock in warehouses around the world. The goal is to avoid losses by shipping the highest value items from its warehouses first, but unexpected changes in demand often led to mismatched stock levels.

If stock levels increased, the result was the value of inventory went down because of the surplus. A discount offer on a selling price may incentivize market demand but it lowers the earnings on every item sold. The company wanted to improve detection and forecast changes to market demand to mitigate impacts to its inventory value.

Enabling an optimal supply chain

Maintaining optimal stock value in the longer term requires demand forecasting, warehouse optimization, and cost reduction. The company chose to partner with Capgemini and Google Cloud to implement these capabilities because of their extensive experience with supply chain transformations.

Working with Capgemini and Google Cloud, the company used a data-driven stock quantity-centered approach to better understand the market and consumer demand. It chose a specific isolated market to prototype and test the solution, to create the right template before global deployment. The two elements now working to prevent value loss in the warehouses are:

A generative AI-based chatbot. Built on Google Vertex AI, the Large Language Model (LLM) agent understands user intent, generates database queries on the fly, and interactively provides answers in text, diagrams, graphics, tables, and figures.

A forecast engine. This generated sales and demand forecasts based on historical data for future projects. Typically, the projections covered 30, 60, or 90 days or could stretch to a full year. Improved demand forecast reduces the unexpected mismatch of stock and market requirements, so the company can now be proactive in responding to market conditions.

Maximizing margins, lowering costs

With its two-part solution, the conglomerate has the information to more effectively predict customer demand and make supply chain decisions. Analyzing historical demand patterns and market indicators to generate forecasts helps optimize stock, sales management, and supply strategies. In turn, warehouse optimization means getting the most out of inventory levels to prevent stock value loss and improves overall supply chain efficiency while ensuring resources are more effectively allocated and utilized.

Shortening the period between analytical requests and responses gives the company improved real-time insights into the market and a better picture of current demand. This advanced demand forecasting helps the company avoid loss of stock value and determines how to get the most value from its existing inventory levels, all supporting supply chain efficiency. The prototype solution has demonstrated the potential for more efficient warehouse logistics, substantial cost savings by minimizing storage costs, and maximized profit margins.

Powered by Google Cloud, the solution solves inventory and warehouse issues so the company can proactively manage its supply chain more effectively. A proof-of-concept implementation has been effective in one country, and Capgemini will continue to work with the company to roll out the solution to its global supply chain and other warehouses.",https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Global-conglomerate-client-story-web-page-banner.jpg,N,,2025-03-13 07:04:20.033847

“Like all retailers, we’re constantly evaluating the performance of our stores. Closing a location is always a tough decision, but we’re focused on continuing to provide the products and services our customers value most,” a Shaw’s spokesperson told CBS News Boston.

The chain operates 81 stores across Massachusetts and New Hampshire, with employees at closing locations being offered positions at other nearby stores.

This comes after the December collapse of a huge $24.6 billion merger between Shaw’s parent company Albertsons and Kroger. The deal fell through due to concerns about competition.

Major changes are happening in New England’s grocery stores. Stop & Shop closed seven locations in Massachusetts last year while rolling out a major four-year renovation plan.

After looking at sales data and market patterns, the 150-year-old chain made this difficult decision. Now community members are concerned about job losses and having fewer grocery options in their areas.

As more customers shop online instead of in stores, Albertsons keeps adjusting which locations remain open. It’s part of a larger transformation as grocery stores adapt to new shopping trends.

Positive Points

Kuros Biosciences Ltd (CSBTF, Financial) achieved a remarkable 136% top-line growth in MagnetOs sales, showcasing strong performance across various teams.

The company has expanded its regulatory clearances in both spine and extremities, allowing entry into new markets and increasing the global addressable market.

A strategic agreement with Medtronic has been established, setting the stage for future growth and providing significant market leverage.

Kuros Biosciences Ltd (CSBTF) reported a profitable business with no debt and a $9 million EBITDA, indicating strong financial health.

The company has successfully expanded its international presence, now operating in over 20 countries, which enhances its global footprint.

Negative Points

Despite strong growth, the revenue from Europe remains low at about 1%, highlighting a need for further market penetration outside the US.

The company faces challenges in the extremities market, with a focus on building clinical evidence before aggressively pursuing revenue growth.

There is a delay in expected milestone payments from the Checkmate asset, pushing potential pre-commercial milestones to 2031-2032.

Kuros Biosciences Ltd (CSBTF) is investing heavily in infrastructure and extremities, which may eat into EBITDA margins in the short term.

The ongoing head-to-head trials against DBX and cell-based allografts will not have readouts until 2026-2027, delaying potential market impact.

Q & A Highlights

Q: What are the key assumptions behind Kuros Biosciences' 2025 growth target of at least 60%?

A: Chris Fair, CEO, explained that the growth is driven by the strategic agreement with Medtronic, which has opened over 100 opportunities. The timeline from opportunity to impact is typically four to six months. International expansion and methodical growth in the extremities market are also key factors. The partnership with Medtronic will help accelerate growth in the extremities market by providing quicker access to surgeons.

Q: How is the partnership with Medtronic progressing, and what impact does it have on revenue?

A: Chris Fair stated that Medtronic is a tremendous partner, drawn to Kuros by their clinical evidence. The partnership is in early stages, with opportunities being presented regularly. While specific revenue contributions from Medtronic are not disclosed, the goal is to grow together, leveraging Medtronic's market share to benefit both parties.

Q: What is the strategy for penetrating the foot and ankle market, and how quickly can Kuros achieve significant market share?

A: Chris Fair mentioned that Kuros can grow the extremities business faster than the spine business due to existing hospital registrations. The focus is on building clinical evidence and establishing relationships with key opinion leaders. The second phase, involving greater market penetration, is expected in the second half of the year.

Q: What are the expectations for profitability in 2025, and how will it develop?

A: Daniel Geiger, CFO, indicated that Kuros is in a growth phase, investing in infrastructure and the extremities market. The aim is to at least match the 2024 adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.9%, with potential gradual improvements. Key factors include maintaining a 90% gross margin and optimizing sales and marketing expenses.

Q: Why is Kuros switching its reporting currency from CHF to USD?

A: Daniel Geiger explained that USD is the primary currency for internal budgeting and performance measurement, as most revenues are generated in USD. The switch also aligns with the expanded institutional investor base and facilitates communication with international investors. There are no current plans for a US listing.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C00000WYP.png?5,N,,2025-03-12 06:06:51.510843

Privia Health Q4 2024 Earnings Call: Key Takeaways & Outlook for 2025

How does Privia Health make money?

Privia’s model is pretty interesting. It works across all payors and all payment models (fee for service, MSSP, capitation). In 2024 you can see Privia shied away from full risk (capitation) given MA headwinds and unfavorable environment.

Privia management echoed as much on their 4th quarter earnings call: Privia is after delivering the most value to its primary stakeholders: physicians (and by extension, patients) – and Privia wants to maximize its ability to provide value to those physicians, similar to most other firms in the enablement/MSO space.

So, Privia can benefit both from (1) a high utilization environment through FFS revenue and (2) markets or conditions where it’s appropriate to take risk and expand that book of business.

“We continue to expect headwinds in Medicare Advantage over the next few years, given pressures from elevated utilization trends, phase-in of V28 through 2026 and changes in star scores among other factors. However, the diversification of previous value-based care contracts gives us confidence in our ability to build scale and profitability across the business despite challenges in any one particular program…Ultimately, our goal is consistent and sustainable earnings growth for all medical groups and shareholders year after year.” – Parth Mehrotra

In 2024, Privia Health closed out the year on a strong note, exceeding the high end of all guidance metrics and setting the stage for continued growth in 2025. Privia signed above the high end of its implemented providers (a key economic signal for Privia’s overall business) range – 4,789 in total.

Privia’s current footprint includes 14 states and 1,200 care locations:

2. Revenue Growth and Payer Mix: Diversification Mitigates Medicare Advantage Pressures

Capitated revenue book showed a 2% positive contribution margin, though the Privia team still wants to be pretty conservative around committing fully to downside risk as mentioned. Value-based care diversification across commercial and government contracts provided resilience against sector-wide headwinds. Privia also noted it’s not expecting any sort of bump in growth from its shared savings book of business in 2025 based on ongoing pressures in MA.

This quote on propensity for Privia to take risk is one Parth Mehrotra reiterates often, and it’s a great way to look at value-based care as a whole and every stakeholder having ‘skin in the game’ – over and over, Privia mentions their preference for shared risk being the right approach to value-based care:

“…you have to distinguish between the willingness to take risk and the ability to take risk. We’ve always had the ability to take risk. We do so at the highest level in MSSP as you know. We do capitation in MA with a small book. I don’t think providers wake up every day saying we want to do full risk. I think there’s a lot of noise in the space by entities that jumped into full risk. And I think it’s a misconception that to perform well in value-based care, to perform well in MA, you necessarily need to take full risk. We’ve always said we prefer models where the payer has skin in the game, an entity like Privia that’s enabling has skin in the game and the doctors have skin in the game or the medical groups and the risk entities have skin in the game. And we share it upside and down, and I think that keeps everybody honest.”

5. 2025 Outlook and Guidance: Hitting the Singles and Doubles, Compounding the Biz

Privia continues down the path of solid year over year growth in a capital efficient model. Management expects to reach 5,200+ providers in 2025, around a 10% increase during the year.

In 2025, Privia will continue to hit on core execution, which is pure and simple as the following:

“…first, provider growth to increase density and scale in existing and new markets; second, attribution growth and performance in value-based arrangements; and third, operational improvements and efficiencies that impact the bottom line.” – David Mountcastle

Privia’s operating model in mature markets is also proving out, as the firm expects margin expansion and significant (19%) adjusted EBITDA growth stemming from operating leverage in its most mature markets. It’s also significant from the perspective that Privia seems to be focusing on building out existing density in current markets, and seemingly no short term plans to enter new markets according to commentary around what’s included in its guidance.

I should note Privia has a decent amount of cash on the balance sheet and I wouldn’t be surprised to see it put to use. Management was coy around M&A but we already saw another big deal happen between CVS and Wellvana this week (more on this in the near future) so blood is in the water.

“We’ve said previously, we’re looking at medical groups, risk entities, MSO entities. Given our model, I think we can be very flexible.”

Another interesting point from the analyst Q&A centered around ACO REACH, whether the program receives an extension, and how that might affect Privia’s ability to recruit more provider groups if there’s any fallout there. Privia noted it prefers to say in MSSP, thinks it’s a better model, and that any potential convergence happening between the two would validate that position.

Final Thoughts: A Resilient Growth Story

Privia Health demonstrated another year of strong execution, marked by provider growth, financial discipline, and strategic diversification. While Medicare Advantage remains a challenge across the industry, Privia’s balanced mix of commercial and government contracts provides a uniquely flexible model in the market, which is why Privia has been relatively successful compared to its other VBC peers post-IPO. They’re also going to continue to shy away from capitation and will be careful with taking on full risk. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Privia is disciplined with its approach to growth and is focused on compounding the business by hitting singles and doubles.",https://hospitalogy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/03/Privia-2024-Waterfall.png,N,,2025-03-12 01:04:39.950623

By contrast, brands such as Grill’d, Guzman Y Gomez (GyG), and Crust Pizza reported notable increases in customer frequency and average spend.

The new figures from Fonto found customers visited the golden arches 5% less frequently and spent 5.4% less compared to the same period in the previous year.

It was a different tale for Grill’d, which saw a 14.9% increase in the frequency of purchase, with the average spend per customer rising by 10.6% compared to December 2023. Crust Pizza also reported a 10.5% increase in purchase frequency and a 7.3% rise in spend per customer, despite holding a smaller market share of 3%.

Guzman Y Gomez was also on the up, reporting a 5% increase in customer purchase frequency and an almost 6% increase in spend per customer. The brand's market share rose from 3.0% to 4.2%. GyG announced a 27% increase in revenue, attributing the growth to new store locations meeting increased demand.

Despite a slight drop in average basket size for Crust and Grill’d, the gains per customer outweighed the loss in individual transaction size. GyG and Crust have plans to expand further, with GyG planning to open 30 new stores and Crust planning 12 new locations in 2025. Grill’d opened 16 new locations in 2024 but has not announced specific store plans for 2025.

Fonto's Moments in QSR data, which tracks market share and competitive advantages within the QSR category, highlights these trends. More than 85,000 Australians share their daily financial transaction data with Fonto, which is used to understand buyer behaviour over time. Fonto also surveys fast food customers shortly after purchases to gain insights into consumer behaviour.

Ben Dixon, CEO of Fonto, commented on the shifting dynamics in the fast-food sector: ""We are seeing customers embracing alternatives, especially ones that promote fresher ingredients, even in the fast food space. Where Domino’s has recently faced challenges in product quality, Crust continues to bring customers back, spending more. Where consumers are looking for fresher, higher quality burger alternative, Grill’d is taking share and loyalty away from the larger chains. GyG’s overall brand promise as healthier fast food is also clearly working, with their sales and profit up across the board.""",http://www.mi-3.com.au/sites/default/files/2025-03/6276d168-9ed2-4626-bd56-7eeeaae4c2ad.jpeg,N,,2025-03-12 01:05:17.847716

If the name Mixue Bingcheng doesn't ring a bell, get ready for a frosty introduction. The beloved brand is known for soft-serve ice cream cones that cost the equivalent of just 15 cents, and refreshing beverages that range in price from 30 cents to $1.20.

It's worth noting that Mixue Bingcheng is the world's largest food and beverage chain by store count—there are over 45,000 outlets worldwide. Sales figures are not taken into consideration for this ranking. Most of the outlets are located in China, but you'll also find Mixue Bingchengs in Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaysia.

How do favorites like McDonald's and Starbucks stack up to Mixue Bingcheng's store count? A report from McDonald's notes that by the end of 2023, the restaurant had 41,822 restaurants worldwide, with the United States serving as the country with the most locations—13,457, to be exact. And according to Restaurant Business, at the end of 2023, Starbucks had 38,587 locations globally.

Looks like they've got some catching up to do.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/15/30/1437490386-mcdonalds-logo.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.749xh;0,0.115xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-03-11 19:05:09.125897

Cardinal Health executive pay

Cardinal Health reported nearly $25.7 million in total compensation for Hollar in its most recent disclosure, up 37 percent from the $18.8 million he made the year before, which was his first as CEO.

Hollar’s pay for fiscal 2024 (ended June 30, 2024) included a $1.43 million salary, $20.6 million in stock awards and a $3.1 million bonus. He also received $463,532 in other compensation, most of which was $438,175 worth of personal use of corporate aircraft.

Cardinal Health’s second-highest paid executive was Global Medical Products and Distribution Segment CEO Stephen Mason at $7.3 million in fiscal 2024, up 66% from $4.4 million the year before. Mason’s latest pay package included a $721,038 salary, nearly $6 million in stock awards and a $627,303 bonus.

“Fiscal 2024 marked a year of strong operational execution and financial performance, delivered in tandem with significant strategic progress across the portfolio,” Cardinal Health said in the disclosure, later continuing, “Our executive compensation program is designed to support our long-term growth, with accountability for key annual results.”

Cardinal Health median worker pay and CEO pay ratio

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires publicly traded companies like Cardinal Health to calculate the gap between CEO compensation and pay for its median employee.

Cardinal Health reported the pay of its median worker at $56,119, down 19% from the $69,024 figure the company reported in each of the previous three years.

That means that Hollar’s compensation was 457 times greater than what Cardinal Health’s median employee received, the company said, up from 269 the year before.

As in recent years, Cardinal Health said that median worker was a full-time employee in the U.S., but did not provide a job title. At other medtech companies that offer more details about their median workers than required by the SEC pay disclosure rules, those median medtech workers often hold technical roles such as device design or engineering.

Cardinal Health’s compensation practices won the support of 90% of shareholders who cast an advisory vote at the annual meeting.

The fast food giant is reorganizing its operations to speed up product launches, focusing on “winning” in three key areas: beef, chicken, and beverages.

“We could be moving faster,” CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a LinkedIn (MSFT) post. He added that this involves working in a “more horizontal way.”

Kempczinski explained that the new structure will help McDonald’s implement big ideas across essential functions like operations, supply chain, and restaurant design. By breaking down traditional silos and creating specialized departments, McDonald’s hopes to respond faster to market trends and customer demands.

Part of this shift includes the appointment of a new Restaurant Experience Officer. Jill McDonald, currently in charge of the company’s international division in Europe, Canada, and Australia, will take on the inaugural role. Kempczinski emphasized the need for a single “touchpoint” for all of these tech-driven efforts.

Perhaps most strategically, the team will establish three global category leads for beef, chicken and beverages. This approach challenges category leaders like Yum! Brands-owned (YUM) KFC, which dominates the chicken market.

With consumer confidence dipping and fast food prices pushing customers away, McDonald’s new strategy could be the bump it needs to regain its competitive edge. Kempczinski, who previously worked at Kraft Heinz (KHC) and Pepsi Co. (PEP), believes adopting a consumer-packaged goods mindset will help McDonald’s pick up the pace.

However, this won’t be an easy task. McDonald’s case still faces challenges, including recovering from an E. coli outbreak in Oct. 2024 that hurt foot traffic.

Several restaurant chains, such as Domino’s and Papa John’s, have lowered their financial forecasts, citing cautious spending due to inflation and geopolitical uncertainty – largely tied to President Donald Trump’s looming tariffs.

As McDonald’s works to regain market share, its latest moves could inspire other chains to follow suit. Recent wins, like the return of the Shamrock Shake and Egg McMuffin deal, have been well-received by budget-conscious consumers.

“This allows us to have an even bigger impact on our customers,” he said.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/quartz.com/e408d64674e8cad7aa0101323622e6f2,N,,2025-03-12 11:06:25.731671

For the first quarter of 2025, the company reported $1.68 billion in revenue at a 25.1% operating margin (2).

The company’s revenue was spread across the world with 40% coming from the Americas, 27% from Europe, and 33% from the Asia-Pacific region. The company’s finances were also divided between its various divisions. The Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group (LDG), which provides a wide portfolio of technology platforms and solutions to serve Agilent customers' value chain, such as therapeutic production and the development of critical cancer diagnostics, reported $647 million in revenue, a 4% increase in reported growth (2,3). This exceeded expectations on high-single digit (HSD) growth performance in liquid chromatography (LC) and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS), likely due to positive reception to the company’s newly released LC platform.

Applied Markets Group (AMG), which primarily focuses on the food, environmental, and advanced materials markets, among others, accrued $338 million in revenue; while this is a 4% decrease in reported growth, the company claims this division “[delivered] better than expected revenue versus a very challenging Q1’24 comparison, impacted by the timing of Lunar New Year,” and strong future growth remains expected (2,3). Finally, the Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG) brought in $696 million in revenue with a 1% increase in reported growth, bearing solid mid-single digit growth in providing services and HSD growth in contract revenue.

Padraig McDonnell, president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Agilent, said the company exceeded expectations for core revenue growth and earnings per second (EPS) (1). The company has been working on multiple strategies for growth, including strategic price setting, improving digital ecosystem, and identifying procurement opportunities.

“We have made meaningful improvements to our website, upgrading the user experience on our e-commerce platform by making it easier to find and purchase the products our customers need, helping topline growth. In Q1, our progress continued with digital orders growing high single digits,” McDonnell said. “Our procurement teams have challenged our historical approach and are identifying significant cost-savings opportunities in many of Agilent’s functions.”

Regionally, performance in the Americas grew 3%, Europe 2%, and Asia outside of China grew 2%, all of which were slightly ahead of expectations. While revenue in China declined 4%. Gross margin was 54.7% in the quarter, with operating margins of 25.1%. Altogether, Q1 EPS were $1.31, ahead of expectations and up 2% from Q1 2024. In addition to the discussions on their financial bearings for Q1 2025, Agilent also released documents revealing their financial information from this quarter (5).

The company will be guiding to revenue of $1.61–1.65 billion, approximately an increase of 2.5 to 5.0 percent growth on a core basis and an increase of 2.4 to 4.9% growth on a reported basis (1). Second-quarter non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) EPS are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.28, representing a growth range of 2.5–4.9% (5).

McDonnell also highlighted the company’s recognition as a member of the Global Lighthouse Networks. The World Economic Forum named the companies’ factories in Shanghai, China, and Penang, Malaysia, as part of the networks (6). This recognizes the company’s work in scaling artificial intelligence (AI), 3D printing, robotics, big-data analytics, and industrial internet of things (IIoT). According to the initial press release, Agilent remains the sole analytical and clinical laboratory technology company worldwide to be recognized by the Forum.

“In less than nine months, we’ve made incredible changes that are improving our customers’ productivity in an era when the pace of science is faster than ever… the outcome we’re enabling is faster decision-making so that we can accelerate innovation and create differentiated growth,” McDonnell said. “What we are doing at Agilent is turning a good company into a great one. We are committed to continuous improvement and adapting to changing market dynamics.”

For decades, CVS (CVS) was the go-to convenience store where customers could buy over-the-counter medicine, obtain prescriptions, purchase food staples and snacks, get cosmetics and skincare essentials, and even find last-minute gifts and souvenirs, all in one location.

However, like its rivals, CVS has also fallen victim to the trend of dwindling traditional pharmacies. It has been facing some tough times over the last few years, with front-store sales declining, shoplifting rising, and multiple opioid lawsuits.

In 2021, CVS announced it would close approximately 800 stores over the next three years, with an additional 270 locations this year due to changing consumer behaviors.

Not only have multiple closures been executed, but thousands of the drugstore chain's employees have been laid off. Last year, CVS announced plans to cut nearly 3,000 jobs to reduce costs by $2 billion and increase technology investments.

CVS announces the opening of a dozen smaller locations nationwide

After closing thousands of locations, CVS announced it will open 12 new smaller-format stores across the U.S. over the next year. These locations will focus solely on pharmaceutical products such as medicine and first aid care to better meet the community's specific needs.

This new concept will eliminate CVS's front-store business, as the company has struggled with that sector over the last few quarters.

According to CVS's full-year fiscal 2024 earnings report, comparable front-store sales decreased by 2.1% compared to the same period last year, and total front-store revenues were down by 4.2%.

The new locations will also be smaller, averaging less than 5,000 square feet, less than half the size of a regular CVS store. Smaller-format stores have become incredibly popular in retail because they provide higher profits for less investment.

The retailer has been making some significant changes recently as it desperately tries to improve sales performance.

It's cited losses for over 11 fiscal quarters in a row, with its stock value decreasing by more than 50 percent.

Newly-appointed CEO Ashley Buchanan has been making several moves to right the ship.

One of those efforts includes an amendment to Kohl's Cash and coupons, a highly popular aspect of the shopping experience that it offers.

Customers frequently use the coupons and Kohl's Cash to get deals on merchandise, but have encountered a lot of exclusions and restrictions on products to get the discounts.

The most exclusions Kohl's has ever had on coupons was the highest it's ever been last year, according to what Buchanan explained to investors in a recent earnings call.

EXCLUDE NO MORE

Buchanan promised to eliminate most of the exclusions moving forward, as it was turning away valued shoppers.

""Over the years, our list of excluded brands on our coupon has grown too large with the percent of sales that are excluded from coupons reaching an all-time high in 2024,"" he said.

""This has created confusion and frustration with our loyalist customers.""

""We are in the process of reversing some of these exclusions to simplify the experience and allow our customers to shop with our promotional coupons more consistently,"" Buchanan added.

The CEO also said there would be ""more clarity in our price and value messages,"" and that it would be amplified to ""resonate"" with customers.

""Our goal is to offer quality products at great prices across our entire portfolio, so our customers can more clearly see the value they're getting with their purchase.""

FAILED APPROACH

A shift toward Kohl's roots began in January after attempts from former CEO Tom Kingsbury over the past year didn't get the results Kohl's was looking for.

Kingsbury wanted to attract a younger consumer base with Babies R Us and Sephora locations located within stores.

Some experts like Jean-Pierre Dubé, a research associate with the National Bureau of Economic Research, noted that the ambitious goal left behind longtime Kohl's customers.

""Kingsbury disconnected from their core customer and failed to connect with the younger generation that he was presumably going after,"" Dubé told Fox affiliate WFFT recently.

Dubé added that Kohl's ""hardcore"" shoppers likely felt ""betrayed.""

EXPERT'S WARNING

Michelle Greenwald, a professor at the New York University Stern School of Business, also told the outlet that Kohl's would need to make attractive offers to customers in 2025 to keep them from going elsewhere.

It seems that Buchanan's strategy is in line with this.

""Once customers leave, they find other alternatives that they're happy with,"" Greenwald warned.

""It's not like they're necessarily going to come back.""

""A lot of it, they're going to just lose forever,"" she added.

Kohl's is also still closing at least 27 ""underperforming"" locations in 15 states.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/03/ch-kohls-policy-disruption-off-platform.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-03-11 14:06:32.081563

The company on Tuesday announced a cross-functional Restaurant Experience Team to move faster in bringing vision and ideas to execution. Jill McDonald, currently president of International Operated Markets, will serve as chief restaurant experience officer, effective May 1.

As part of this move, McDonald’s also set up dedicated category teams focused on beef, chicken, and beverage/desserts. Charlie Newburger, VP of marketing strategy and new business ventures, will head the beverage/desserts team. Leaders of the beef and chicken groups will be announced at a later date, the company said.

“The thinking behind this is, so many of our categories, we’re competing against specialists,” McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a video. “We’re competing against somebody, like a KFC, for example, who is single-mindedly devoted to winning in chicken. So this category team now allows to actually have that same level of focus on, do we have what we need, the winning strategies to win in chicken, to win in beverages, to win in beef?”

McDonald’s has spent the past several years highlighting its chicken opportunity. The brand will bring back Snack Wraps later this year and launch a new chicken strip offering. It also plans to bring back the Chicken Big Mac as an LTO. McDonald’s believes it can add another point of chicken market share by the end of 2026. Globally, its signature McCrispy sandwich—a $1 billion brand—is sold in over 70 markets and will be available in nearly all markets by the end of this year. During an investor call in July 2024, Kempczinski said chicken sales were on par with beef sales. He noted the burger chain has a “significant opportunity for growth in chicken” and that its category is twice the size of beef globally and growing at a faster rate.

Additionally, McDonald’s believes in the crafted beverage craze so much that it opened the drink-forward CosMc’s to test iterations and judge customer demand. After debuting in Bolingbrook, Illinois, in December 2023, the prototype added six locations in Texas. The plan is to close three larger second-generation restaurants and open two smaller digital-focused formats in the Lone Star State later in 2025. The menu features a variety of energy drinks, refreshing, non-caffeinated beverages, signature brews, and classic brews. The food menu has two sandwiches and multiple snacking options, like hash brown bites and mini doughnuts.

The McDonald’s Restaurant Experience Team will feature voices from supply chain, franchising, development, restaurant design, delivery, and Speedee Labs. The chain will also use the team to serve as the coordinator for in-restaurant technologies and help GMs determine how to efficiently use them to improve unit economics.

The Restaurant Experience Team is a direct descendant of the Customer Experience Team formed in 2021, which was tasked with interconnecting marketing, menu, and digital.

“It’s just going to make us even better. It’s going to allow us to have an even bigger impact for our customers, an even bigger impact for our restaurant crew, for our franchisees,” Kempczinski said. “So I’m excited about it because it just means all the ideas and the vision that we’re coming up with, we’re going to see it in the restaurants even faster.”",https://www.qsrmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mcdonalds.jpg,N,,2025-03-12 00:04:34.810795

Kohl's stock price has suffered a 55% decrease over the past year.

Kohl's Corp. sales declined 9.4% during the pivotal fourth quarter of 2024 and overall sales were down 7.2% for the year, the retailer said Tuesday.

The fourth quarter, which includes the holiday season, is a critical time for the Menomonee Falls-based company, which reported a profit of $48 million. That compares to a $186 million profit during the 2023 fourth quarter − a 74.2% decline.

In 2024, Kohl's made a profit of $109 million for 2024. That compares to $317 million in 2023 − a 65.6% decline.

For 2025, the company expects a net decrease in sales for the year between 5% to 7% compared to last year.

To save money, the Kohl's board reduced the level of dividend paid to shareholders. In previous quarters, the company regularly paid 50 cents a share to shareholders, but this quarter the company is paying 12.5 cents per share.

New Kohl's CEO Ashley Buchanan, made his first public remarks to analysts and investors. Buchanan said there's opportunity for the company to return to growth but there are some areas to improve.

""A lot of the issues really were self-inflicted over many years of decisions,” Buchanan said. “We have a very loyal customer. When I toured stores, I heard how much they love Kohl’s. And what I realized was we’re kind of making it harder for them to love us.”

Buchanan said changes will take time before the benefits could be realized.

Rough start to 2025

Kohl's started 2025 with cutting 27 stores across 15 states and then followed it up with eliminating roughly 10% of its positions at its headquarters in Menomonee Falls.

The sales decrease continues the company's slide for roughly two years.

In that time, Kohl's has made a number of moves such as adding Babies 'R' Us, expanding women's dresses, moving juniors department near the front, expand gifting, and bringing back jewelry.

And yet no formula has boosted the company's financial results.

Buchanan is the third CEO to lead the company in four years.

Before him was Tom Kingsbury, who led the company from 2023 to mid-January. Before Kingsbury was Michelle Gass, who led the company from 2018 until she left in 2022 to be CEO of Levi Strauss and Co.

In the last 12 months Kohl's stock price has fallen 55%. On Tuesday the stock opened at $12.06 and has fallen roughly 25% to $8.90 during mid-day trading.

In addition to menu and policy changes, Starbucks CEO Brian Nichol messaged employees on Monday that the company has made the ""hard decision” to eliminate 1,100 current support partner roles and several hundred additional open and unfilled positions.

The layoffs do not affect baristas or in-store teams and comes as part of a restructuring the CEO previously announced in January, according to ABC News.

""We are simplifying our structure, removing layers and duplication and creating smaller, more nimble teams,"" Niccol wrote, according to Axios. ""Our intent is to operate more efficiently, increase accountability, reduce complexity and drive better integration.”

More foods and beverages are expected to be removed from the Starbucks menu in the coming months, according to The Hill.

Media Inquiries David Bishop, Partner, Brick Meets Click 847-722-2732, david.bishop@brickmeetsclick.com","Barrington, Ill. – March 11, 2025 – The U.S. Online Grocery segment jumped 31% versus last year, ending February 2025 with $10.3 billion in monthly sales, and more than 80 million households placed one or more eGrocery orders during the month, a record high, according to the Brick Meets Click Grocery Shopper Survey fielded January 30-31, 2025, and sponsored by Mercatus.

February marked the seventh straight period where monthly sales exceeded $9.5 billion and the ninth consecutive period with positive year-over-year sales growth, starting shortly after deeply discounted offers on annual membership and subscriptions began being promoted.

“We are a little more than a half year into eGrocery’s current growth curve, fueled by aggressive offers to lock in customers for at least 12 months,” said David Bishop, partner at Brick Meets Click.

“So far, the response from U.S. households reveals a sizable amount of latent demand that has been unlocked by offering discounts designed to help customers save more money on online grocery orders.”

Delivery continued to post extremely strong results for February 2025, growing more than 45% versus a year ago and registering $4.5 billion in sales. A surge in monthly active users (MAUs) was the predominant growth factor, driven mainly by the rapid expansion of users in the 60+ age group and a YOY rebound in penetration with 18 to 29-year-olds.

Strong gains in order frequency and average order values (AOVs) also contributed to this robust performance, enabling Delivery to finish the month with nearly 44% of eGrocery’s total sales.

Pickup reported very strong gains for February 2025, climbing 19% versus last year, to approximately $4.1 billion in sales. Pickup’s MAU base and order frequency rate both grew YOY, but the primary driver of sales growth was a higher AOV; however, Pickup’s AOV, MAU base, and order frequency all increased at slightly slower paces than Delivery’s.

Despite the monthly sales gain, Pickup’s share of total eGrocery sales fell 400 bps versus last year, closing February 2025 with just over 39%.

Ship-to-Home sales jumped nearly 29% versus the prior year as this method posted almost $1.8 billion in sales. Like Delivery, Ship-to-Home’s YOY gains were driven by a surge in MAUs, which may have been fueled partly by the current in-store environment where various categories are merchandised behind locked plexiglass doors to prevent theft.

While Ship-to-Home order frequency and AOV also climbed versus last year, the gains were more muted than those for Delivery. Overall, Ship-to-Home essentially maintained its 17% share position, ceding just 30 bps of share compared to a year ago.

Building on the strong results for each receiving segment, Supermarket and Mass retailers also had a positive February. Both posted year-over-year gains across the three core drivers of top-line sales: MAUs, order frequency, and AOV.

In addition, the Grocery (which includes Supermarkets and Hard Discounters) and Mass formats reported improvements in repeat intent rates related to Delivery and Pickup services with Grocery closing most of its gap with Mass.

In fact, the likelihood of reusing the same Grocery or Mass service again within the next month finished just 7% below the pre-COVID rate in February, setting a new post-COVID high that surpasses the record set in January 2025.

“Regional grocers are converting first-time shoppers into more loyal customers as evidenced by the rising repeat intent rates, but so is Walmart” said Mark Fairhurst, Chief Growth Marketing Officer, Mercatus.

“While deep discounts have driven a lot of trial, making a good first impression is essential to longer-term success. That means providing a more seamless shopping experience by pairing relevant personalized offers, order fulfilment, and sought-after loyalty rewards to encourage customers to shop online again.”

Given eGrocery’s explosive sales growth of 31% compared to overall grocery spending, which rose less than 5% versus February 2024, online’s share of total grocery spending finished at almost 18%, jumping 370 bps versus last year.

About this consumer research

The Brick Meets Click Grocery Shopping Survey is an ongoing independent research initiative created and conducted by the team at Brick Meets Click and sponsored by Mercatus.

Brick Meets Click conducted the most recent survey on February 28-29, 2025, with 1,698 adults, 18 years and older, who participated in the household’s grocery shopping, and a similar survey in February 2024 (n=1,755). Results are adjusted based on internet usage among U.S. adults to account for the non-response bias associated with online surveys. Responses are geographically representative of the U.S. and weighted by age to reflect the national population of adults, 18 years and older, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

The three receiving methods for online grocery orders are defined as follows:

Delivery includes orders received from a first- or third-party provider like Instacart, Shipt or the retailer’s own employees.

Pickup includes orders that are received by customers either inside or outside a store or at a designated location/locker.

Ship-to-Home includes orders that are received via common or contract carriers like FedEx, UPS, USPS, etc.

McDonald’s latest organizational change goes directly after more specialized fast-food competitors, particularly those in the chicken and beverage categories.

The fast-food giant on Tuesday announced the creation of a new Restaurant Experience Team, an evolution from the company’s customer experience team it created three years ago. The team includes people from operations, supply chain, restaurant design, franchising, delivery and technology.

But it also creates three new global teams focusing on three primary menu categories: beef, chicken and beverages and desserts.

The idea behind those teams is for the company to be more competitive with the growing number of “specialist” concepts with which McDonald’s competes. “We’re competing against somebody like a KFC, which is single-mindedly devoted to winning in chicken,” CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a video announcing the change. “So this category team now allows us to have that same level of focus.”

McDonald’s has long been known for its burgers, of course. But the chain is going after two key markets right now, chicken and beverages. The company is working on several chicken items, including chicken tenders and Snack Wraps. And it plans to bring back the Chicken Big Mac as a limited-time offer.

It has also pushed into beverages with its CosMc’s concept, though those menu items could potentially be folded into McDonald’s restaurants.

Both of those markets are increasingly competitive. Numerous chicken-focused brands—including what is arguably McDonald’s top competitor, Chick-fil-A—are growing rapidly and taking share in the restaurant market. Beverages, meanwhile, are also growing, thanks to the incursion of drive-thru-focused chains like Dutch Bros and 7 Brew.

That said, it’s not just specialists pushing into these areas. Taco Bell, the country’s fourth-largest chain, itself last week said it plans to push more into chicken and beverages—notably with its Live Mas Café in-restaurant beverage concept.

But Kempczinski also said that the team can help coordinate various ideas, initiatives and technologies to support restaurant general managers. “I look at this as being able to take technology now and think about how we actually use all of this to improve our unit economics,” he said.

He also said that the team is about speeding McDonald’s decision-making. Technology and innovation are being added to the chain’s restaurants every day, and the company believes the new team will be able to take this innovation to the restaurants more quickly.

“It just felt to me, we could be moving faster,” Kempczinski said. “And being able to move faster meant that we needed to be working in a more horizontal way and moving faster on the implementation.”",https://cdn.informaconnect.com/platform/files/public/2025-03/background/McDonald%27s%20company%201.jpg?VersionId=grO.9pELJmHwElSglfkxG5BYkegoH7dO,N,,2025-03-11 17:06:28.924321

Victory Chingluh, a subsidiary of Taiwan’s Ching Luh Group, has been downsizing since January, laying off 2000 workers at its facility in Cikupa District.

The company, which manufactures for brands such as Adidas, FootJoy, Mizuno, Nike, and Reebok, also operates factories in China and Vietnam.

According to Tangerang Regency Manpower Department official Desyanti, the company attributed the decision to “soaring operational costs and plummeting market demand”.

Nike’s evolving retail strategy may be a contributing factor. In 2023, the company announced plans to cut up to US$2 billion in costs over three years to “fuel future growth, accelerate innovation at scale, and drive long-term profitability”. Part of this strategy includes streamlining product assortment, increasing automation, and restructuring its organisation.

Meanwhile, Adis Dimension Footwear, Nike’s long-time manufacturing partner in Indonesia, laid off 1500 employees last year in cost-cutting efforts at its factory in Balaraja District.

Desyanti said that while operational expenses and weak demand drove last year’s layoffs, the company has no plans for additional cuts.

Septo Kalnadi, head of the Banten Manpower and Transmigration Agency, explained that these layoffs reflect a broader industry slowdown rather than wage concerns.

“There will be more layoffs next year,” said Kalnadi. “Every day, there was always some company asking for permission for layoffs.”

Last year, Tangerang businesses collectively laid off 12,000 workers.

Full transcript - Barclays 27th Annual Global Healthcare Conference:

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Hi, good morning and welcome to the twenty seventh Annual Barclays Global Healthcare Conference. My name is Andrew Mok. I’m the Facilities and Managed Care Analyst here at Barclays. And I’m pleased to be joined on stage with Mark Kaye, CFO of Elevance and Nathan Rich, VP of Investor Relations. Welcome to the conference.

Let’s start with Medicare enrollment. The latest CMS data shows your total Medicare membership is tracking 35,000 or about 1.5% above the high end of your Medicare Advantage guidance, which you reiterated through an eight ks late afternoon yesterday. Can you help us square the February data with your reiterated guidance, Mark?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Thank you very much for the question, Andrew. And I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you this morning and to Barclays for hosting. I look very much look forward to our conversation. Let me start by emphasizing that our outlook for 2025 Medicare Advantage membership remains unchanged from our fourth quarter earnings call. In the eight ks that we released yesterday, we reaffirmed our MA membership expectations, which includes high single digit growth in individual MA and then planned double digit growth in the group MA stemming from an expansion of existing customer relationships in 2025.

To a specific question, while the CMS February CMS enrollment files accurately reflect our membership, there are a few important factors that we want investors to consider and which inform our full year outlook. First, effective March 1, we will not retain a cohort of our D SNP membership related to a known footprint change in one of our Medicaid states. I do want to be clear that this outcome was expected and factored into our full year membership financial guidance. Also consistent with our fourth quarter earnings call messaging, we expect minimal membership growth over the balance of the year as we maintain our marketing adjustments taken during AEP to optimize our member mix and improve retention. And so taken together, the expected footprint change and lower in year growth provide confidence in our full year guide of 2,200,000 to 2,250,000 Medicare Advantage members.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Got it. Okay. So we’re 35,000 above right now. You’re saying there’s a contract change coming. So that should reduce you about 30,000 or so, and there’s no expected growth for the balance of the year.

So should we be thinking about the upper end or the high end of the range at this point?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: I think I would be comfortable just to say the range of 2.2 to 2.25. Thanks, Andrew.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Understood. So given some of the growth in the retail membership this year, how does year one new member profitability compare to continuing membership? And what are you expecting for this year’s new member cohort specifically?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Generally, first year Medicare Advantage members tend to operate at a slightly negative margin, though this can vary by product and benefit type. And that’s why we were pleased to realize strong growth in our HMO products this year, which have more coordinated care and predictable cost patterns than PPO plans. In addition, the high levels of retention that we saw for 2025 is another important factor in our outlook, as we are better able to improve access to affordable care for members that remain with us.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Got it. And then from a margin perspective, I think you’re expecting fairly stable margins year over year. There seems to be a few moving pieces with the pricing benefit design, membership growth, core utilization and even the STARS headwind. Can you share with us where Medicare margins landed at the end of twenty twenty four? And maybe walk us through the puts and takes to bridge to stable Medicare margins for 2025?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: I’m happy to spend some time to walk through the drivers here. So to start, our Medicare margins in 2024 were in line with our expectations. And as we’ve previously stated, we were below our long term target range. Coming into last year, we created a stable foundation through targeted geographic exits and proactive benefit design changes. And these actions, in addition to disciplined cost management, help offset some of the funding challenges, elevated cost trends, as well as pressure from the year two midnight rule.

For 2025, our guidance anticipates costs are going to remain elevated, but manageable, Strong retention, disciplined cost management and improved recognition of member acuity following elevated utilization trends in recent years support our outlook for margin stability. Additionally, as I mentioned just a moment ago, we were pleased with our composition of membership from both a product and a geographic standpoint. And finally, while it remains early in the year, we feel good about our positioning in Medicare having seen a couple of months of results.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Got it. Understood. And then maybe your comments around 2025 EPS cadence and seasonality imply a steeper ramp to 4Q MLR, which you attributed to both business mix and changes from the IRA. I think PDP and MAPD members in total maybe account for 10% to 15% of total risk membership. Can you help us better understand the expected Part D MLR cadence baked into guidance and how the proportionally small membership base is driving such a strong change in MLR seasonality?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Thanks, Andrew. Let me first take a minute to address our expectations on earnings seasonality. As we stated on our fourth quarter earnings call, we expect over 60% of adjusted EPS to occur in the first half of the year with more than 50% of that to be realized in the first quarter. So with that in mind, as I look at where FactSet consensus stands today, analyst EPS estimates in the first quarter look to be about $1 light compared to our expectations. And this is simply a function of seasonality.

It does not change our earnings expectations for the full year. There are several factors contributing to this more pronounced seasonality. To start, we expect the first quarter MLR to benefit from a favorable calendar with the number of workdays lower than last year. And this is the effect of pulling forward earnings into the first quarter. Second is the impact of the Part D benefit design changes related to the IRA, which will have a meaningful impact on the earnings cadence in Medicare.

And this is going to result in seasonality for Part D being more like our medical benefits business than in past year past years. And then finally, a shift in member mix, namely lower Medicaid membership, higher ACA growth, they’re going to drive more pronounced earnings seasonality again in the first quarter of this year.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: We’ve also seen a severe flu season this year. Do you have any sense of whether that would meaningfully impact 1Q MLR at this point?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Yes. We began the year anticipating an influenza and other influenza like illness season in line with the pre COVID trends, which is somewhat higher than what we experienced during the pandemic era. Incidence rates for these illnesses have actually been running a little bit above even those prudent expectations, which has generated a modest increase in costs so far. Importantly, the acuity of the activity we’ve seen has been consistent with our expectations. And so while there’s still a couple of weeks left in the quarter, there’s always the possibility for a late season respiratory virus activity.

We believe our pricing continues to provide adequate prudence to address the elevated costs we’ve seen so far, and that allows us to be comfortable with the guidance that we’ve given so far.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Got it. So taken all in, reiterating guidance, Q1 EPS consensus is about a dollar light and that reflects the impact of flu as well. Perfect. Understood. So shifting to Medicaid, can you share how composite Medicaid rates developed for oneone renewals and comment maybe how they’re tracking for the upcoming renewal cycle around fourone and sevenone?

Yes, of course. So, January,

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: expectations and reflect early progress towards bringing rates back to a level that will prospectively cover cost trend. We also have early insight into April rates, which is similarly in line with our expectations, though April is a smaller cohort for us. On July renewals, which cover about a third of our membership base, it’s still purely to comment. We’ll get a better picture in the coming months as draft rates are shared. And overall, I would say that the rates we secured thus far have been broadly consistent with our initial expectations, though there is still important work ahead.

We remain in constructive ongoing discussions with our state partners to further align prospective rates with elevated cost trends as we continue to that we continue to observe in our Medicaid portfolio.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Great. And it feels like most of the margin recovery in Medicaid does come from better state rates, which is somewhat passive. Can you help us understand maybe some of the actionable items you can take to items that are in your control to drive better cost outcomes and management?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: We are certainly advocating for rates that fully reflect today’s cost environment, while also driving operational efficiencies that deliver better health outcomes for our members and more value for our state partners. We feel well positioned to consistently rank in the top tier of cost management and quality performance within the markets that we serve. One of the ways that we’re actually innovating in this area is through the rollout of the digital solutions that enhance the member experience and improve outcomes. And just to give you one example here, today we’re using technology to identify members with care gaps and chronic risk factors. Our care management teams then perform proactive outreach to provide early intervention and to guide the member in accessing the care they need.

And in addition, our targeted digital interactions actually helped save members over one point five million hours in 2024 through higher quality provider search functionality and a streamlined call center experience.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Great. Let’s move on to commercial. Several of your peers in the stop loss business called out pressure throughout the back half of the year and even more so in the fourth quarter, but stop loss didn’t seem to be a source of fourth quarter pressure for Elevance. Can you take a step back and give us some more color around what you saw with respect to commercial and stop loss trends and your experience there and why you might have had some differentiated trends?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Thanks for the question. Your observation is spot on. We did not experience the same stop loss pressure seen by others in the fourth quarter and we’re pleased with our overall stop loss performance in 2024. There are several key differences worth noting. First, we primarily sell a bundled stop loss coverage as an ancillary product for self insured groups seeking additional protection against overall claim costs.

Second, only a very small portion of our portfolio is dedicated to specific claims liability coverage for fully insured clients, and that’s an area that others have highlighted as a source of pressure. And then finally, it’s worth just keeping in mind that our total stop loss portfolio is relatively small percentage of our total premiums. And so I’ll simply close by saying, taken a thoughtful and strategic approach to our stop loss business. We have a leadership team with a deep expertise and experience in this area and it’s something we feel quite comfortable with.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Understood. And then pricing aside, specialty pharmacy has been an area of accelerating trend across the broader healthcare industry. What are you seeing with respect to this trend and which book of business

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: And these trends are most And these trends are most pronounced in categories like oncology, autoimmune, dermatologic, placing really upward pressure on overall costs. If I look forward to 2025, we’ve modeled specialty pharmacy or specialty trends to remain elevated. And in particular, we’ve been prudent in assessing how Part D benefit design changes might incentivize different member and provider behavior. And for example, lower cost sharing could drive higher utilization. We’ve also been monitoring the pipeline of new products and expanded indications.

And importantly, we’ve baked these dynamics into our pricing and guidance for 2025. When it comes to approaching specialty pharmacy pricing, we focus on the whole person care rather than just merely unit cost. And through our CalonRx asset, we integrate medical and pharmacy data and utilize predictive analytics to enable more comprehensive management of by expanding value based arrangements, improving care coordination among providers, we aim to deliver total or aim to deliver the lowest net total cost, while still ensuring sort of timely high quality care for our members. And really all of that helps us address today’s cost pressures without losing sight of the clinical outcomes that our members need.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Right. And just given the number of specialty drugs that have increased and the label expansions that we’ve seen, is it more difficult to kind of predict the utilization today than maybe it was five years ago?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: I think I would say we’re managing specialty trend pressure through disciplined pricing and analytics approach. What also helps us here is the integrated pharmacy management, the active support of or active development of new and innovative solutions. And that really allows us to remain confident in the way that we price some of those new solutions and products that come to market.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Great. And then taking a step back, you’ve done a nice job improving commercial margins over the last few years. What’s the trajectory of commercial margins from here? And where do you see the opportunities to expand margins further?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Yes, we’re very pleased with the trajectory of our commercial margin recovery over the last two years. Looking ahead to 2025, we do expect to realize continued improvement, albeit at a more modest pace compared to 2023 and 2024 as repricing initiatives we have executed are materially complete. Long term, we expect earnings growth from our commercial business to be driven by increased membership bolstered by the geographic expansion of our individual ACA products and improved group retention. We also expect earnings growth to come from increased penetration of our integrated medical and pharmacy offering and our innovative affordability and digital solutions such as our suite of patient advocacy products. And finally, I’d say, we remain committed to a prudent approach to pricing that delivers consistent performance and supports membership growth that’s all embedded in our long term earnings growth algorithm.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Great. And there’s been a lot of headlines around DOGE’s efforts to reduce the federal workforce. You have a large federal employee benefits program that represents about 1,600,000 members or $15,000,000,000 in revenue. How are you thinking about the potential changes to that business? And is there anything explicitly considered for 2025?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: That’s a great question. At this stage, any outcome from Doge’s efforts to reduce the federal workforce remain highly uncertain, just given the various legal and regulatory hurdles that are still unfolding. In our latest outlook, we factored in a slight dip in federal employee program membership, but we don’t foresee a material earnings impact since our contract with the federal government is structured on a cost plus basis. Additionally, the geographies where we offer coverage to federal employees significantly overlap with our other lines of business. So we are well positioned to provide affordable coverage to members affected by these potential changes.

And then last comment I’d maybe make here, Andrew, it’s important to note that we serve both active employees and retirees within our federal employee business and would not expect the retiree population to be impacted by these actions.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Understood. You’re also seeing solid growth in the individual ACA market this year despite some new program integrity measures. Can you share what your experience has been so far with respect to February effectuated enrollment, how that came in and how you expect intra year attrition to play out? Yes.

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: And then of course, let me start by saying that we’ve been really pleased with our growth in the individual ACA market over the past several years. We’re encouraged by the results of the open enrollment period for 2025. But to your question, through February member effectuation rates, which represent the proportion of members who have paid their premium have tracked a little bit lighter than we initially expected. And this is likely reflective of the higher percentage of passive renewals this year, as we have seen members, especially those who have enrolled with us during or following redetermination from Medicaid, reevaluate their coverage during this grace period. This dynamic impacts a small portion of our membership base.

We’ve adjusted our membership outlook appropriately and that is reflected in the eight ks last night. So I would say overall, we still feel pretty good about this underlying business. We have appropriately balanced the growth in this market with prudent pricing expectations for 2025.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: When you say a little bit lighter, is that a reflection of just kind of the member premiums paid or do you think that’s more driven by some of the newer measures around failure to reconcile, things of that nature that are driving effectuated enrollment lower?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: There are likely several interacting and complicating attributes that drive this. The net result of that is that we’re seeing slightly lighter effectuation rates than what we expected. We definitely attribute this to those members who have enrolled with us following the redetermination from Medicaid and there are obviously several factors driving that.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Got it. Do you have full visibility into the failure to reconcile at this point?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: We have enough visibility for us internally to look through some dynamics. That would be a great Q1 earnings call question.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Understood. Sticking with the ACA, we’d love to hear how you’re thinking about the potential membership attrition and the impact to the risk pool if Congress allows enhanced subsidies to expire at the end of the year?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Yes. We continue to closely monitor developments in Washington and we remain fully committed to the ACA marketplace. It’s not only an attractive and complementary business for us, but also represents significant long term growth opportunities. This is a particularly relevant as we expand our WellPoint branded plans beyond our 14 blue states. And that’s a key step towards fulfilling our member commitment or our commitment to being a lifetime trusted health partner at every stage of our member’s journey.

With that in mind, the availability of enhanced subsidies has driven increased enrollment over the past few years and extension of those enhanced subsidies would limit potential disruption to individuals and families seeking a continuation of affordable healthcare coverage. Congressional members on both sides of the aisle have expressed support for extending the ACA subsidies and policymakers have a range of options, including full extension, partial or modified extension or even phasing out of the enhanced subsidies. Regarding the risk pool, if the enhanced subsidies do expire, we would expect a reduction in enrollment that would naturally shift the pool’s overall risk profile. And we’ll account for that in our 2026 pricing, drawing upon our broad ACA pricing experience. And then last comment I’ll make here, the ACA risk adjustment program also does provide meaningful stability by transferring funds to carriers and managing higher risk populations.

And so this should help mitigate some of the hypothetical disruption that could occur from any changes in the market.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Are you preparing two sets of pricing at this point, one with the subsidies, one without the subsidies?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: We are definitely thinking through several pricing options, which I imagine will include more than one submission.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Got it. Maybe let’s move on to Carillon. You recently closed on the acquisition of CareBridge late last year, which represents a significant expansion into the home. Can you walk us through the strategic rationale for this deal and any expected contributions to earnings over the next few years?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Yes, absolutely. So in the fourth quarter, we successfully closed on the acquisition of CareBridge. And for those who don’t know, CareBridge is a rapidly growing value based care company that specializes in managing a home and community based services, HCBS, for both the Medicaid and dual eligible population. Key Bridge’s innovative model aligns to Keylon’s whole health approach, which strengthens our ability to serve chronic and complex members, and that’s going to help us further scale our home business within Keylon. Specifically, we see CareBridge serving a scalable or serving as a scalable platform to broaden our home based rich and this includes extending services beyond the HCBS population to high risk Medicaid and dual eligible members, while also expanding into geographies to better support Elavant Health home and community based beneficiaries.

So in short, you can think about the acquisition of Cambridge as enabling us to expand post acute care delivered in the home, build at home elements into specialty care management products already offered by Keyalon services like oncology and then drive improved health plan performance through enhanced member outcomes and reduce costs for LTSS and the D SIP members. So, summarize, we view the acquisition as being strongly aligned with our strategic objectives. It opens up significant white space for growth through the introduction of new capabilities and expansion into key Medicaid and dual eligible markets.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Would you like to get even bigger in the home? And is there a strategic preference for Medicaid first or Medicare first home providers?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Being in the home is one of the four key pillars that we think of within that Keyalon services being among sort of advanced primary care, specialty care, behavioral health and then the home based care is an important avenue for us for continued growth and it integrates very well, allowing us to scale some of the services that we already offer. So clearly a very important acquisition for us.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Great. Well, we’re just about up on time here. So thank you so much, Mark, for the fireside today and enjoy the rest of the conference.

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Thank you very much, Andrew.

The closure of H&M stores is not an isolated case but part of a broader landscape.
Since 2020, more than 18,000 fashion stores have closed in Spain, a trend that reflects the shift of consumers toward digital commerce.","The fashion industry has experienced times of constant change in recent decades. Brands that once dominated the market now face new challenges due to shifts in consumer preferences. This time, it's H&M that has made a drastic shift in its strategy, and its situation in Spain reflects the difficulties of the textile sector.

The fast fashion sector is witnessing significant transformations. H&M, one of the major competitors of Inditex, has begun to close stores massively in our country, a decision that surprises many. This measure is part of a series of adjustments following a drop in its financial results, marking the beginning of a new era for the brand in Spain.

Came to Dethrone Zara and Is Now Closing Its Stores

H&M had established itself as a rival to Inditex, but the latest financial data from the Swedish firm make it clear that the situation has changed. In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported a significant loss of about 258 million euros, which represented a 30% drop in its profits. This plunge in earnings forced H&M to review its market strategies and close several of its stores.

In Spain, the impact has been considerable, as it accounts for 17% of the brand's global closures, highlighting the magnitude of the crisis. Cities like Elche, Orihuela, and Torrevieja have witnessed the closure of stores that, in many cases, affected dozens of employees. These closures are not new for the brand, as in 2021 it was also forced to close major establishments in Madrid, such as those on Gran Vía and Conde Peñalver.

Factors That Have Led to H&M's Decline

The crisis it faces is due to a combination of factors that have affected the entire industry; the change in consumption habits is one of the main issues. The pandemic accelerated the shift to e-commerce, a transition that many brands, including H&M, did not manage with the same agility as their competitors.

Additionally, the increase in production costs and inflation have severely hit the brand's finances. This has combined with competition from new players like Shein and Temu, which have challenged traditional brands with extremely low prices and online business models.

Although H&M has attempted to improve its offerings through new technologies, such as smart fitting rooms and self-checkout kiosks, the competition in the sector is fierce. E-commerce and second-hand fashion continue to gain ground, forcing major brands to rethink their business model.

The closure of H&M stores is not an isolated case but part of a broader landscape. Since 2020, more than 18,000 fashion stores have closed in Spain, a trend that reflects the shift of consumers toward digital commerce. Although spending on fashion increased by 4.89% in 2023, the rise of online shopping and the increase in sustainable alternatives have made physical stores lose relevance.",https://e-noticies.cat/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-stradivarius-zara-cierre-tiendas_1200_800.jpg,N,,2025-03-11 13:07:29.115165

The company, known for its colourful plastic building bricks, said it is increasing investment in online play including building its own development team. It has tripled its number of software engineers since 2022 and launched a successful tie-up with the online game Fortnite.

Niels Christiansen, the chief executive of the Danish toymaker, said the group was trying to create more “hybrid” digital and physical experiences as nine- to 12-year-olds were spending more time online.

“They tend to grow up a bit earlier and orient themselves towards social media,” he said.

Christiansen said the trend was also behind Lego’s tie-ups last year with the sports-related brands Formula One and Nike, which are expected to release the first products this year and hinted there would be more similar tie-ups on the way. “It is so important for us that we are present with exciting experiences and exactly this type of topics and passion points,” he said.

“We are seeing a shift and are trying to be right on it and even leading that shift so we stay super relevant.”

Christiansen said the new investment in digital was a “multi-year journey” and he could not give details of the games now in development. The company has already launched some Lego-branded games using external partners as well as the recent tie-up with Fortnite.

Lego said sales rose by 13% to 74.3bn Danish kroner (£8.4bn), even as the wider toy market slid back by 1%. The group’s Technic and City sets, as well as Harry Potter- and Star Wars-themed games, sold well. Operating profits rose by 10% to 18.7bn kroner despite increased investment in new factories, including in the US and Vietnam.

Christiansen said there were no plans to bring forward the opening of a new factory in Virginia despite the threat of US tariffs on goods being imported from Mexico, where the majority of Lego’s kits for North America are made.

He said the company had experienced “a lot of volatility” in recent years including the effects of the pandemic and increased energy costs. It was unclear if US import tariffs would turn out to be long term or temporary measures so the company’s tactic was “don’t panic”, he added.

“I don’t lie awake at night because of tariffs for Mexico. I would lie awake if I didn’t feel we are sustaining relevance of the product and brand,” he said.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db2bc299da8ed99aada8c2eb2d34b77b750912d7/244_0_3596_2160/master/3596.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=343b903874c9f063a7751579a5b9a699,N,,2025-03-11 10:04:49.320652

The closure of the plant is expected to have a significant impact on the local community, with many businesses relying on the plant for steel supplies.
Verster said the Vereeniging and Newcastle mills, which indirectly support more than 100,000 jobs, supply between 350,000 tons and 400,000 tons of steel products that can’t currently be manufactured by any other companies in South Africa.

The company had initially planned to implement the wind-down of its longs-business in late January but postponed the decision to accommodate outstanding orders and sustain talks with the South African Government. However, these rescue talks have failed, and AMSA has confirmed that it will begin shutting down its blast furnaces in the first week of March, with steel production expected to cease by early April.

In a statement, AMSA expressed its disappointment at the outcome, stating that despite engaging with stakeholders and government bodies, no viable options were found to avoid the wind-down. “Regrettably, despite our best efforts, the parties involved have not been able to find timely solutions required to defer the wind down of the longs business,” read the statement.

The closure of the plant is expected to have a significant impact on the local community, with many businesses relying on the plant for steel supplies. AMSA’s chief executive officer, Kobus Verster, highlighted the concerns that led to the decision, including the scrap Price Preference System and export tax on scrap, port and rail efficiency, the lapsing of provisional safeguards on Hot Rolled Coil, their application for a negotiated pricing agreement with Eskom not being supported, and a looming electricity tariff hike set to go into effect on 1 April.

Verster said the Vereeniging and Newcastle mills, which indirectly support more than 100,000 jobs, supply between 350,000 tons and 400,000 tons of steel products that can’t currently be manufactured by any other companies in South Africa.

Verster expressed his disappointment at the outcome, stating that the decision would have a significant negative impact on the economy, jobs, and the local community. “AMSA is deeply disappointed that our efforts over the last year have not translated into a sustainable solution, resulting in a significant negative impact on the economy, the loss of approximately 3,500 direct and indirect jobs, and a detrimental impact on the local community in Newcastle.”

Pietermaritzburg and Midlans Chamber of Business CEO Melanie Veness echoed these sentiments, stating that the closure would have a huge negative impact on workers and communities. “This is big, from a job perspective but also a sustainability of companies point of view.”

With more than 2,000 of the expected job cuts coming from Newcastle alone, many in the community are concerned about the future.

Over the last five years, the United States has installed about 175 GW of renewables, 13 GW of gas, and 3 GW of nuclear, Ketchum shared.
NextEra’s CEO expects the United States’ first new reactor will fire up sometime in 2031 or 2032, and the first small modular designs to appear in 2035 or later.","(Houston, TX) – Driven by data center development and mass electrification across industries, the current pace of electric demand growth in the United States is unlike anything NextEra Energy president and chief executive officer John Ketchum has ever seen.

“We’re expecting a six-fold increase in power demand over the next 20 years compared to what we saw over the prior 20,” he revealed to a packed room of energy and finance experts at CERAWeek by S&P Global in Houston, Texas, Monday morning.

To meet that demand, Ketchum insists renewable generation needs to be part of the equation, contrasting significantly from sentiments U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright expressed earlier in the day.

“We firmly believe in order to do it, we’re going to have to be able to come up with all-of-the-above energy solutions,” Ketchum quipped. “There’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. We’re going to need all forms of generation- renewables, gas, and nuclear.”

NextEra, which dabbles in everything from transmission to upstream oil and gas pipelines, contracted about 12 gigawatts (GW) of renewables last year. The uniquely diverse energy conglomerate also operates the largest gas-fired generation facility in the United States and is the seventh-largest nuclear operator in the world.

“We get to see it all, and we understand how important this is to our customers,” Ketchum offered.

“The demand is here right now,” he added. “We have to have the generation available to meet that demand. Otherwise, we’re going to have a huge power affordability crisis in this country, with utility bills going through the roof.”

Skyrocketing bills, Ketchum worries, might trigger utility commissions to intervene and demand specific types and timing of generation. That scenario wouldn’t be much fun for anyone, inspiring nearly two dozen Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives to send a letter today asking the Senate not to interfere with the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA’s) clean energy tax credits and threatening to oppose the current budget bill if their request is not met. Its authors and NextEra’s CEO agree that the tax credits and transferability provisions are essential to managing new electric load cost-effectively.

Ketchum, who also serves as chairman of NextEra Energy’s subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company, told CERAWeek attendees that he sees an incredible growth opportunity to put America first under the Trump administration. His company’s capital investment plans speak to that sentiment, exceeding $120 billion over the next four years, easily making NextEra one of the top infrastructure investors in the United States.

“We are fully behind with this administration,” Ketchum confirmed. “We just need to make sure we (meet demand growth) in a smart way that keeps the bill low, because if we have affordability issues, it’s going to be really tough to meet all that demand that we see coming.”

Timing is Everything

Keeping electricity prices manageable will depend on the strategic deployment of new generation sources to meet demand. Over the last five years, the United States has installed about 175 GW of renewables, 13 GW of gas, and 3 GW of nuclear, Ketchum shared. NextEra is happy to build any and everything, but the company’s CEO notes there’s a timing difference concerning when varying generation solutions can be brought to market and associated cost discrepancies.

He would know, as no entity has built more gas-fired generation in the U.S. over the last two decades than NextEra has. The company’s last completed facility, a commercial plant in Fort Lauderdale, was brought online in 2022 at the cost of $785 per kilowatt (kW).

“If we wanted to build that same gas-fired combined cycle unit today? $2400 per kW,” estimated Ketchum at CERAWeek. He assessed the cost of gas fire generation to have more than tripled over the last few years, crediting supply constraints (amidst increased demand) and significant qualified labor shortages.

“To get your hands on a gas turbine and to actually get it built across the market, you’re really looking at 2030, or later,” Ketchum confessed.

Plus, lots of the trained workforce that knew how to build gas-fired facilities is gone, having either retired or moved onto other things. Ketchum notes the limited labor available is spread thin, too, building out data centers, constructing LNG terminals, tinkering at chemical companies, and more.

“We have a real shortage of labor supply in this country,” Ketchum reiterated.

The bridge to new nuclear looks to be even longer than the wait time for a gas turbine. NextEra’s CEO expects the United States’ first new reactor will fire up sometime in 2031 or 2032, and the first small modular designs to appear in 2035 or later.

That leaves wind, solar, and batteries, renewable energy workhorses whose contributions have been explicitly minimized by the current administration, including by former fossil fuel executive Wright.

“Renewables are ready to go right now because they’ve been up and running,” Ketchum told the room.

“Don’t get my comments wrong,” he implored. “We are going to need it all.”",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Gerke-Workspace-2040-x-1360-px-15-1536x1024-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-11 13:07:34.424134

The jobs have been cut gradually since 2023, when the company had a workforce of 11,000 in the Netherlands, the paper said.
“We have not seen any investment in the Netherlands, only cuts and the disposal of units,” said spokesman Patrick Meerts.
Philips’ 2024 annual report shows that the workforce in the Netherlands has gone down by 2,336 over the past two years.
Philips had a workforce of 220,000 25 years ago, of whom 40,000 were in the Netherlands.","An ongoing reorganisation at medical technology company Philips has led to the loss of 2,600 jobs in the Netherlands, 700 more than expected, the Financieele Dagblad reported on Tuesday. The unions expect even more jobs to go, given the reorganisation is set to continue until the end of this year.

The jobs have been cut gradually since 2023, when the company had a workforce of 11,000 in the Netherlands, the paper said. Philips had previously stated it would reduce its Dutch workforce by 1,900.

Unions say they fear further job losses, particularly given that the company announced last month it aims to cut spending by a further $500 million. The company has now posted a loss for three consecutive years.

The FNV trade union said it fears the company is in the process of withdrawing from the Netherlands altogether. “We have not seen any investment in the Netherlands, only cuts and the disposal of units,” said spokesman Patrick Meerts. “We are concerned.”

Philips said in a reaction that the Netherlands will remain the company’s “beating heart”. However, it said, the relatively large number of job losses in the Netherlands is due to a new, more decentralised way of working.

“We are giving more responsibility to the business units,” the spokesman said. Most business units, the FD reported, are based abroad.

Philips’ 2024 annual report shows that the workforce in the Netherlands has gone down by 2,336 over the past two years. That total includes some 400 jobs in Drachten after the company shifted some production to Indonesia and China. Other jobs have been cut at its central research lab, formally Natlab.

A further 250 jobs have gone already this year, following cuts at two separate units and the sale of a small subsidiary, the FD said.

Philips had a workforce of 220,000 25 years ago, of whom 40,000 were in the Netherlands. The company, which has divested its lighting division, television arm, and domestic appliances production, now has a workforce of 69,000 worldwide.",https://www.dutchnews.nl/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_1800.jpg,N,,2025-03-11 07:03:54.009941

His 2023 total compensation package was more than $20 million, ranking him ninth among regional executives, the Houston Chronicle reported.

Although the personal computer and printer business was acquired by HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise concentrated on enterprise technology solutions and products like servers, data storage infrastructure, networking equipment, IT infrastructure management software, and consulting.

The Spring-based tech giant will reduce its workforce by roughly 5 percent by a combination of layoffs and normal turnover over the next 18 months.

The workforce reduction program, approved by HPE’s board on Thursday according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, aims to address operational challenges and inventory issues that have affected the company’s performance.

“We could have executed better,” admitted CEO Antonio Neri during the conference call with analysts. Neri specifically highlighted problems within HPE’s server unit, pointing to a rapid shift in market demand toward the newest graphics processing units (GPUs), which has left the company burdened with excessive inventory of older models.

HPE Announces Global Layoffs, Impacting Houston Workforce

The layoffs will impact HPE’s global workforce of more than 60,000 employees, though it is unclear how many of them will be lost in the Houston region, where the company has approximately 2,000 employees.

HPE has offices in both Spring, where it has its headquarters at the City Place campus and Houston, based on its 2024 annual report.

HPE moved its corporate offices from San Jose, California, to Spring in 2020, opening up a huge footprint in the city. The reorganization is one of dramatic transformation for one of the largest employers in the area.

The company estimates to achieve approximately $350 million in cost savings in the reductions and similar savings in the future to the end of fiscal year 2027. The reduction plan will be phased in and will be fully effective by the fiscal year 2026.

Chief Financial Officer Marie Myers, during the earnings call, indicated that she has some apprehensions about additional threats to the company, namely mentioning the potential of new tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports in the next year.

The cuts are set to take place at a time when Neri is one of Houston’s better-compensated executives. His 2023 total compensation package was more than $20 million, ranking him ninth among regional executives, the Houston Chronicle reported.

HPE Restructures, Cuts Jobs

HPE also became an independent company in 2015 when the former Hewlett-Packard was divided into two. Although the personal computer and printer business was acquired by HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise concentrated on enterprise technology solutions and products like servers, data storage infrastructure, networking equipment, IT infrastructure management software, and consulting.

The restructuring is a continued reorganization within the tech sector as businesses cope with shifting market conditions, supply chain challenges, and economic headwinds.

For HPE, the layoffs are an attempt to rationalize operations and boost profitability amidst these sector-wide challenges.

Local business leaders are monitoring for possible impacts on the Spring and Houston economies because HPE has become a significant corporate presence after relocating its headquarters to Texas.

There has been no statement from community leaders regarding the announcement or potential relief for impacted employees.

Throughout this 18-month implementation phase, HPE must contend with the dual challenge of rightsizing its workforce while preserving operational capacity and marketplace competitiveness in the fast-changing enterprise technology environment.",https://techstory.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-15-at-3.05.39-PM-125x125.png,N,,2025-03-11 04:04:44.822656
