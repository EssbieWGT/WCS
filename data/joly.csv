“A lot of work goes into making the county run, and this should be a cohesive group, working for Laurens County.","Five industrial prospects will have made, or will be in the process of making, their ways through the Laurens County Council incentives and approval process as the new year begins.

Briefed on the projects at their Jan. 12 meeting, Council gave unanimous approval to various incentives, fee in lieu of taxes agreements, and industrial park assignment measures. Just one of the five prospects was named - before 3rd and final reading, prospects generally are referred to by code-names for competitive reasons.

Adeptus USA LLC was identified as the industry behind a $93 Million, 126 new jobs prospect in the former Michelin distribution center at Metric Road, Laurens. A public hearing and final reading of the ordinance was conducted, and the industry will be included in the Octagon Industrial Park, which is not a physical place but a collection of industries located in various places (in a collaboration with Greenville County).

Project Floyd is a $68.6 Million, 50 jobs project in the Hunter Industrial Park, Laurens, going into an existing building. Council took the unusual step of having a public hearing before final reading - the industry had a last-minute issue with its real estate closing, but since the public hearing had been advertised (as though the project was going to get final reading), it was allowed to go forward.

Project Diamond is a new industry coming to the Clinton area in the city limits. It’s a $9 Million, 70 new jobs project. Previously, council was told it will behind the Nordsom plant, and at Monday’s meeting it was referenced that it would be “behind the truck stop”. This was the 2nd of 3 readings, and council gave 2nd reading to an ordinance to create the Clinton Industrial Park (in a collaboration with Spartanburg County; of the revenues, 25% goes to School District 56, 25% to the City of Clinton, 25% to Laurens County, and 25% to the Laurens County economic development fund).

Project Palmetto is a company moving its headquarters to Laurens County, with a $19 Million, 57 new jobs project. An inducement resolution and first reading of an ordinance were approved unanimously. Discussion indicated it will be in The Connexial Center, a local/state industrial area off I-385 near Gray Court.

Finally, Project Basel amends a current industrial agreement, as an existing industry changes its agreement with a $49 Million original investment that now is over $109 Million. Its ordinance was approved “by title only,” and Council Vice-chairman Matthew Brownlee abstained from this vote.

In other business, council heard from Treasurer Cynthia Burke that her office would become just the 3rd in the state, behind Spartanburg and Aiken, to provide one-stop-shopping for vehicle registrations, reducing the amount of time standing in line at the Treasurer’s Office to pay vehicle taxes and then at the DMV to pay for and acquire licenses plates and renewal stickers.

Council agreed to buy 1 & 3 Gallon St., Laurens, for $75,000 to facilitate a stormwater improvement project that is federally funded.

Council agreed to have a second meeting quarterly on the 4th Monday to allow citizens to bring forth any topic they want to the governing body. This is in place of public comments at the 2nd Monday regular meeting which now are for agenda items only.

Pertaining to the Potters Field burial ground for indigent people (near the county airport), Council agreed that the Laurens County Chamber of Commerce Foundation can be designated as a collection point for anyone who wants to donate money to the burial ground’s upkeep. At least one donation already has been made, council was told.

In Council Comments, members wished the audience and the public a good new year. Brownlee introduced the council to his fiancee, saying they had become engaged on Jan. 1, and said he had asked her to attend at least one meeting to “see what she was in for.” Council Member Arthur Philson Jr. provided county department heads with certificates showing his appreciation for their work, and for the work of their employees.

Serving his first year on council, Philson said, “This year, I’d like to see the penny sales tax people get together and come up with items that need to be addressed. The county needs an audit, we have been through 2-3 county administrators and no money has been counted. We need a county pay raise for these people, we have people making $12/hour — $15/hr should be the minimum for county salaries. We have people moving from one department to another for pay. And all these housing developments, I’m learning. Show me where the money’s at.”

Council Chairman Jeff Carroll did not respond directly but he made it clear that county finances are audited independently every year. “The county administrator can help you know where the money is. It’s budget time and that is an opportunity for everyone to learn how government works, how things are funded,” he said. “A lot of work goes into making the county run, and this should be a cohesive group, working for Laurens County. We want to start this year good and calm, and (to employees) thank you for what you do.”",https://beta.creativecirclecdn.com/clinton/original/20260116-133715-ae3-Development%20Hunter%20Park.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 04:58:59.668520

Guerlain’s Spring 2026 Blooming Denim collection applies circular fashion sourcing to beauty packaging through a collaboration with LVMH’s Nona Source.

Guerlain’s Spring 2026 lineup places sustainability and material innovation at the forefront with the launch of Blooming Denim, a makeup collection developed in collaboration with circular design platform Nona Source. The partnership applies fashion-industry textile reuse to the packaging, marking one of Guerlain’s most visible experiments to date with circular sourcing at the product level.

At the core of the collaboration is Nona Source, a platform founded in 2021 to redistribute unused luxury fabrics, including deadstock and offcuts from couture and ready-to-wear production. Backed by LVMH, Nona Source was created to reduce textile waste by reconnecting dormant materials with designers and brands looking to integrate circular economy principles into new products. The fabrics are sourced from existing inventories rather than newly manufactured textiles, lowering material waste while preserving luxury-grade quality.

For Blooming Denim, Guerlain selected upcycled denim offcuts originally produced for luxury fashion houses and reworked them into decorative cases for several of its best-known makeup lines. The denim is transformed through dyeing, embossing, embroidery, and gold screen-printing, allowing the material to function both structurally and visually rather than as a surface-level sustainability gesture.

How Blooming Denim is applied across the collection

The most prominent application appears in Rouge G, Guerlain’s refillable lipstick line. Denim-wrapped cases are offered in three floral finishes — Cherry Blossom, Denim Flora, and Red Rose — each designed to reinforce collectability while maintaining the brand’s existing refill model. Six new lipstick shades accompany the cases, developed to align with the collection’s color palette rather than functioning as stand-alone launches.

Ombres G introduces an exclusive eyeshadow harmony that pairs metallic and matte textures inspired by denim hardware and floral tones, while Météorites Blooming Glow revisits the 02 Cool/Rosé shade with the addition of a denim-blue pearl. Both products are housed in denim-covered packaging using the same upcycled sourcing approach.

The collection also includes KissKiss Bee Glow Oil in two new floral shades, extending the Blooming Denim story across lip care while maintaining consistency with Guerlain’s existing formulations and packaging formats.

Guerlain launches rolling out in 2026

Beyond Blooming Denim, Guerlain’s broader 2026 portfolio spans skincare, fragrance, and lifestyle. Orchidée Impériale Gold Nobile Goldessence expands the ultra-premium skincare line with an activating lotion positioned as the first step in the routine. The formula was developed over three years and uses a two-phase system designed to improve skin texture and radiance.

In fragrance, La Petite Robe Noire Parfum introduces a more concentrated version of the existing franchise, formulated with French beetroot alcohol from responsible farming. The bottle incorporates recycled glass and a bio-based cap, continuing Guerlain’s material sustainability commitments within fragrance packaging.

Additional launches include L’Homme Idéal Cologne Forte, which uses alcohol derived from upcycled pea crop waste, and Absolus Allegoria Tabac Sahara, formulated with more than 90 percent naturally derived ingredients and packaged in recycled glass produced in France.

How L’Oréal Is Testing Sustainable Innovation at Scale

L’Oréal has revealed the first cohort for L’AcceleratOR, its €100 million sustainable innovation program, selecting 13 companies focused on packaging, ingredients, circular systems, and emissions data. The group was chosen from nearly 1,000 applicants and represents the first pilot phase of the five-year initiative, which is designed to identify, test, and potentially scale sustainability-focused technologies across the company’s global operations and the wider beauty industry. https://www.loreal.com/en/press-release/sustainable-development/-l-oreal-announces-the-first-13-change-makers-chosen-to-join-its-eur-100-million-sustainable-innovation-l-accelerator-program/ Launched in 2024, L’AcceleratOR was created to move beyond concept-stage innovation and toward commercial deployment, with a particular emphasis on solutions that can be piloted within existing industrial systems. The program is operated in partnership with the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, which is overseeing a structured support phase centered on pilot readiness and business integration. https://www.cisl.cam.ac.uk/ Rather than narrowing its scope to a single sustainability challenge, L’Oréal has positioned the accelerator around a broad set of operational priorities, including low-carbon materials and energy, nature-sourced ingredients, water resilience, the reduction of fossil-based plastics, circular manufacturing processes, and inclusive business models. The composition of the first cohort reflects that approach, with selected companies spanning physical materials, chemical inputs, waste transformation, and digital infrastructure. https://www.esgtoday.com/loreal-backs-13-climate-nature-and-circularity-solutions-startups/ Packaging, Materials, and the Push Away From Fossil Inputs Several of the selected companies focus on rethinking packaging formats that remain deeply embedded in beauty supply chains. United Kingdom-based Pulpex is developing recyclable paper bottles intended to replace rigid plastic packaging, while Japan’s Bioworks produces bioplastics derived from sugarcane and other plant-based feedstocks. Sweden’s Blue Ocean Closures and PULPAC are advancing fiber-based packaging systems designed to reduce both material complexity and carbon intensity, and Estonia’s RAIKU transforms natural wood into protective packaging alternatives traditionally made from petroleum-based foams. https://esgpost.com/loreal-selects-first-13-start-ups-for-laccelerator-sustainability-programme/ Ingredients and formulation inputs are also central to the cohort. France-based Biosynthis focuses on renewable and biodegradable raw materials, while U.S. company P2 Science applies green chemistry principles to develop bio-sourced fragrance and ingredient components. Another U.S. firm, Oberon Fuels, converts wood and pulp waste into renewable dimethyl ether suitable for aerosol formulations, addressing a category that has historically relied on fossil-derived propellants. https://esgpost.com/loreal-selects-first-13-start-ups-for-laccelerator-sustainability-programme/ Circular Systems and Measuring What Matters Circularity solutions appear throughout the cohort, including Belgium’s Novobiom, which uses fungi to break down complex waste streams into higher-value materials, and France’s REPLACE, which has developed a single-step process to convert multi-layer waste into new durable products. From Brazil, Gàs Verde contributes biomethane production technology aimed at reducing fossil fuel use in industrial energy and transport. https://esgpost.com/loreal-selects-first-13-start-ups-for-laccelerator-sustainability-programme/ The only data intelligence company selected, United Kingdom-based Neutreeno, focuses on supply-chain emissions measurement and reduction, reflecting the growing role of digital infrastructure in meeting climate targets and regulatory expectations. https://www.esgtoday.com/loreal-backs-13-climate-nature-and-circularity-solutions-startups/ The thirteen companies will now enter a CISL-led support phase focused on pilot readiness, with opportunities to run six- to nine-month pilots and, if successful, scale solutions across L’Oréal’s operations. Ezgi Barcenas, Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer at L’Oréal, described the approach as intentionally collaborative, saying, “To accelerate sustainable solutions to market, we are being even more intentional and inclusive in our pursuit of partnerships through L’AcceleratOR. We are really energized to be co-designing the future of beauty with CISL and these 13 change-makers.” https://www.esgtoday.com/loreal-backs-13-climate-nature-and-circularity-solutions-startups/ L’AcceleratOR sits within the company’s broader ten-year sustainability strategy, which includes goals to reach one hundred percent renewable energy, source at least ninety percent bio-based materials in formulas and packaging, reduce virgin plastic use by fifty percent, and significantly cut Scope One, Scope Two, and selected Scope Three emissions by 2030. https://www.loreal.com/en/commitments-and-responsibilities/

The recent slide reflects renewed concerns around slowing AI monetization and increased competition from rivals, but sharp drops like this often raise a tougher question: is the weakness temporary, or a sign of deeper cracks in the story?

Before judging its downturn reslience, let’s look at where Adobe stands today.

Size: Adobe is a $123 Bil company with $24 Bil in revenue currently trading at $296.12.

These metrics point to a Strong operational performance, alongside Moderate valuation – making the stock Attractive. For details, see Buy or Sell ADBE Stock

That brings us to the key consideration for investors worried about this fall: how resilient is ADBE stock if markets turn south? This is where our downturn resilience framework comes in. Suppose ADBE stock falls another 20-30% to $207 – can investors comfortably hold on? Turns out, the stock has fared worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns, based on (a) how much the stock fell and, (b) how quickly it recovered.

Parker-Hannifin Investment Narrative Recap

To own Parker-Hannifin, you need to be comfortable with an industrial business that blends cyclical exposure with disciplined execution and a long dividend track record. The latest strong quarter and raised guidance support the near term earnings catalyst, while the biggest risk, in my view, remains the company’s growing reliance on aerospace and the possibility that a slowdown there could offset otherwise solid performance.

Among recent developments, the raised fiscal 2026 guidance, calling for total sales growth of 4.0% to 7.0% and adjusted EPS of US$29.60 to US$30.40, feels most relevant. It reinforces why analysts have been lifting price targets and why many observers are focused on how much of this momentum is tied to aerospace strength and how resilient those earnings could be if industrial demand stays muted.

Yet behind the record results and dividend streak, investors should be aware of how concentrated Parker-Hannifin has become in...

Parker-Hannifin's narrative projects $22.9 billion revenue and $4.0 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 4.9% yearly revenue growth and about a $0.5 billion earnings increase from $3.5 billion today.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Three fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$677.90 to US$907.86 per share, showing how far apart individual views can be. Against this spread, the reliance on aerospace as a key earnings driver gives you a clear focal point for weighing how different scenarios might affect Parker-Hannifin’s longer term performance.

Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.

Illustrations

You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.

You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

David Guggina, who has been the chief e-commerce officer of Walmart U.S., has been promoted to CEO of the division — the company’s biggest and most important business.

John Furner, who has held that job for about six years, was named top boss of the company in conjunction with the retirement of outgoing CEO Doug McMillon.

Guggina joined Walmart from Amazon.com Inc. about eight years ago, quickly moving up through the ranks at the retail chain. He has led the online business in the U.S. since last January after running supply chain operations.

By broadening delivery areas and cutting shipping costs, the digital business has been fueling growth in the U.S. and is reaching profitability.

He is tasked with leading the unit that generates hundreds of billions of dollars in sales against the backdrop of discerning shoppers, weakening consumer sentiment and persistent woes about the job market.

Competition continues to be fierce in the U.S., with peers Costco Wholesale Corp., Target Corp. and Aldi Inc. investing to keep prices low and improve shopping experiences. Amazon has been increasingly encroaching on Walmart’s turf, signaling its intent to further expand its physical footprint and grocery offerings.

“A key part of maintaining our momentum is making sure we have the right structure to win,” Furner wrote in a memo to staff, adding that the company is making changes to increase efficiency and allow divisions to focus more on customers.

Walmart is entering a consequential period of change as McMillon retires at the end of the month. He is credited with transforming the company into a digital powerhouse from a brick-and-mortar retailer.

The Bentonville, Ark.-based company is now racing to get ahead of the artificial intelligence race, incorporating the technology across operations including shopping. Its market capitalization is inching toward $1 trillion — a first for a U.S. retailer — on the heels of strong growth and tech investments.

The company also named Latriece Watkins, chief merchant for Walmart U.S., as the CEO of Sam’s Club. The club chain is opening new stores and remodeling existing locations in the U.S., as it seeks to grow its membership and compete against bigger rival Costco.

Chris Nicholas, chief of Sam’s Club, will now serve as the boss of Walmart International. China, India and Mexico are among the markets driving growth for the international business. He is succeeding Kathryn McLay, who is leaving the company. She was once viewed as a potential successor to McMillon.

Elsewhere, Seth Dallaire has been promoted to chief growth officer for the company. He has led advertising, membership and other non-retail units at Walmart U.S. He will also help guide expansion strategies for Walmart’s marketplace business. Those businesses are helping fuel profit growth.

All changes are effective Feb. 1.

↑ X NOW PLAYING Why YouTube Is The 'Crown Jewel' In Google's Media Empire

Wall Street analysts have mixed views on the threat to Google from an OpenAI advertising push.

On the one hand, big brands and other advertisers could move a portion ad budgets that Google garners to a new option — ChatGPT. But for OpenAI, adding the digital infrastructure to sell advertising will be challenging. Also, OpenAI would not want to damage the ChatGPT user experience.

However, OpenAI is still unprofitable and needs revenue sources beyond subscriptions, analysts say.

""The question of when not if surrounding OpenAI's aspiration for ads persists,"" RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson said in a recent report. ""Given the rails of distribution necessary to run an effective ads product, we'd look at a scaled ramp of ads by OpenAI as unlikely to pose noticeable disruption risk to Google's search numbers for several years at least.""

Bank of America analyst Justin Post, though, does expect an eventual impact on Google's core business.

""According to press reports, OpenAI is targeting $200 billion revenue by 2030, which includes roughly $41 billion from new products, including advertising,"" Post said in a report.

""A key question for Alphabet sentiment in 2026 is whether ad budgets on OpenAI will represent incremental spend or will come at the expense of existing search budgets. We believe OpenAI ad growth will likely be a mix of both: New AI-native ad formats and better performance are improving advertiser outcomes and willingness to spend, effectively increasing the overall digital advertising addressable market. At the same time, as OpenAI captures a growing share of usage and intent, a portion of budgets is likely to shift from incumbent platforms.""

Google Stock: OpenAI Rivalry Grows

At Mizuho Securities, analyst Lloyd Walmsley downplayed the near-term threat to Google.

""OpenAI is signaling interest in monetizing ChatGPT through advertising, but our recent conversations with multiple ad experts indicate near-term prospects continue to appear to be slow-moving,"" Walmsley said in a report. ""We understand the company plans a fresh outreach with ad agencies and advertisers. Feedback suggests industry players are pressing for concrete plans rather than speculative concepts. One industry contact estimates that a scaled ad model is unlikely before 2027 to 2028, with any meaningful sales efforts requiring pilots by mid-2026 to capture second-half advertisers' budgets.""

The IBD Methodology: How To Invest In Stocks While Managing Risks

Meanwhile, Alphabet plans to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 4.

New search competition from OpenAI's ChatGPT, Perplexity and others has forced Google to overhaul its search results. ChatGPT delivers answers to search queries, while Google's business model has been based on providing weblinks.

Google began deploying AI Overviews in the U.S. in mid-2024, with conversational summaries topping links for many search queries. Google also has introduced ""AI-mode,"" as an option for traditional search users. AI mode is still in the early stages of monetizing via ads, a Deutsche Bank report said.

Meanwhile, OpenAI in October announced an artificial intelligence-powered web browser called ChatGPT Atlas. The Atlas browser features agents that complete tasks on the internet as well as an opt-in memory feature that improves search results.

Google Technical Ratings

On the stock market today, Google stock fell about 1% to 329.57. Google stock has climbed about 5% in 2026 after surging 65% last year.

In late 2025, Google introduced its newest artificial intelligence system: Gemini 3. Google improved the chatbot's ability to code, search and create images. Gemini 3 is battling against OpenAI's GPT-5 and Anthropic's Claude family in reasoning performance reviews.

Google stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A. That institutional ownership rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of a C grade as neutral.

Further, Google stock holds a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. IBD's Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.

Cencora ( (COR) ) just unveiled an update.

On January 12, 2026, Cencora, Inc. amended its existing revolving credit agreement, increasing total commitments by $1.0 billion to $5.5 billion, enhancing its overall liquidity profile. On the same date, the company secured a new senior unsecured multi-year term loan facility totaling $1.5 billion in two tranches and a separate $3.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured term loan facility, both primarily to finance its proposed acquisition of the remaining majority equity interests in OneOncology, refinance OneOncology’s existing debt and cover related fees and expenses, with the loans bearing interest at SOFR- or base-rate benchmarks plus ratings-based margins and subject to leverage and other customary covenants and events of default. Together, these new term facilities fully displaced the previously arranged $4.5 billion bridge financing commitment, reducing it to zero, and further embedded major relationship banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, Société Générale and MUFG in Cencora’s capital structure through roles as lenders, advisors, underwriters and securitization counterparties, underscoring the scale and importance of the OneOncology transaction for the company’s financing strategy and banking relationships.

The most recent analyst rating on (COR) stock is a Buy with a $415.00 price target. To see the full list of analyst forecasts on Cencora stock, see the COR Stock Forecast page.

Spark’s Take on COR Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, COR is a Neutral.

Cencora’s strong financial performance and positive earnings call sentiment are major strengths, driving the score. However, high leverage, potential overvaluation, and technical indicators suggesting bearish momentum are notable risks.

Hormel Foods Investment Narrative Recap

To own Hormel Foods, you need to believe in the resilience of its branded retail portfolio as it works through margin pressure from higher input costs and slower revenue growth. The appointment of Domenic Borrelli to lead the Retail unit does not immediately change the near term focus on rebuilding profitability or the key risk around persistent commodity inflation and the lag in passing through higher costs to consumers.

The most relevant recent development alongside Borrelli’s hire is Hormel’s 2026 guidance, which calls for US$12.2 billion to US$12.5 billion in net sales and US$0.96 billion to US$1.03 billion in operating income. Retail leadership execution will be central to how the company tracks against these targets, particularly as it balances pricing, mix and innovation against evolving consumer preferences for alternative and clean label proteins.

However, investors should also be aware of the risk that input cost volatility and slower pricing pass through could...

Hormel Foods’ narrative projects $13.0 billion revenue and $952.2 million earnings by 2028. This requires 2.5% yearly revenue growth and about a $197.7 million earnings increase from $754.5 million today.

, a 10% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Five members of the Simply Wall St Community see Hormel’s fair value between US$24.36 and US$47.20, underscoring how far opinions can spread. You should weigh these views against the risk that ongoing commodity cost volatility and slower retail pricing pass through continue to pressure margins and the company’s progress toward its 2026 earnings goals.

The net asset value (NAV) of a closed-end fund is the market value of the underlying investments (i.e., stocks and bonds) in the Fund’s portfolio, minus liabilities, divided by the total number of Fund shares outstanding. However, the Fund also has a market price; the value at which it trades on an exchange. If the market price is above the NAV the Fund is trading at a premium. If the market price is below the NAV the Fund is trading at a discount.

Performance returns for the Fund are total returns, which includes dividends, and are net of management fees and other Fund expenses. Returns are calculated assuming that a shareholder reinvested all distributions. Past performance cannot predict future investment results.

Performance will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown. Performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of taxes that shareholders would pay on Fund distributions or the sale of Fund shares. Shareholders must be willing to tolerate significant fluctuations in the value of their investment. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including loss of principal.

Sources of distributions to shareholders may include ordinary dividends, long-term capital gains and return of capital. The final determination of the source of all distributions in 2025 for tax reporting purposes will be made after year end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Based on current estimates a portion of the distributions consist of a return of capital. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year’s distributions) contained in shareholder 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year.",https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20260116202294/en/2694783/22/Business_Wire_Logo-_FINAL.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 18:03:49.934662

According to OpenAI’s blog post, the company plans to test ads “at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service.” Ads will be labeled and separated from the answer.
OpenAI is not the only AI company exploring advertising revenue.
Financial pressures and a changing tune OpenAI’s advertising experiment reflects the enormous financial pressures facing the company.
“As we introduce ads, it’s crucial we preserve what makes ChatGPT valuable in the first place,” Simo wrote.","On Friday, OpenAI announced it will begin testing advertisements inside the ChatGPT app for some US users in a bid to expand its customer base and diversify revenue. The move represents a reversal for CEO Sam Altman, who in 2024 described advertising in ChatGPT as a “last resort” and expressed concerns that ads could erode user trust, although he did not completely rule out the possibility at the time.

The banner ads will appear in the coming weeks for logged-in users of the free version of ChatGPT as well as the new $8 per month ChatGPT Go plan, which OpenAI also announced Friday is now available worldwide. OpenAI first launched ChatGPT Go in India in August 2025 and has since rolled it out to over 170 countries.

Users paying for the more expensive Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will not see advertisements.

According to OpenAI’s blog post, the company plans to test ads “at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service.” Ads will be labeled and separated from the answer.

In example screenshots shared by the company, the ads look like blocked off sections of the chat window with a small image and some advertising copy. Asking ChatGPT for places to visit in Mexico could result in holiday ads appearing, for instance.

“Our enterprise and subscription businesses are already strong,” Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, wrote in the blog post. “We believe in having a diverse revenue model where ads can play a part in making intelligence more accessible to everyone.”

OpenAI’s announcement follows the company’s April 2025 introduction of shopping features to ChatGPT Search. At that time, OpenAI’s Adam Fry told Wired that product recommendations were “not ads” and “not sponsored,” but it felt like a potential step in that direction at the time.

OpenAI is not the only AI company exploring advertising revenue. Google began testing AdSense ads in chatbot experiences through partnerships with AI startups in late 2024.

Financial pressures and a changing tune

OpenAI’s advertising experiment reflects the enormous financial pressures facing the company. OpenAI does not expect to be profitable until 2030 and has committed to spend about $1.4 trillion on massive data centers and chips for AI.

According to financial documents obtained by The Wall Street Journal in November, OpenAI expects to burn through roughly $9 billion this year while generating $13 billion in revenue. Only about 5 percent of ChatGPT’s 800 million weekly users pay for subscriptions, so it’s not enough to cover all of OpenAI’s operating costs.

Not everyone is convinced ads will solve OpenAI’s financial problems. “I am extremely bearish on this ads product,” tech critic Ed Zitron wrote on Bluesky. “Even if this becomes a good business line, OpenAI’s services cost too much for it to matter!”

OpenAI’s embrace of ads appears to come reluctantly, since it runs counter to a “personal bias” against advertising that Altman has shared in earlier public statements. For example, during a fireside chat at Harvard University in 2024, Altman said he found the combination of ads and AI “uniquely unsettling,” implying that he would not like it if the chatbot itself changed its responses due to advertising pressure. He added: “When I think of like GPT writing me a response, if I had to go figure out exactly how much was who paying here to influence what I’m being shown, I don’t think I would like that.”

Along those lines, OpenAI’s approach appears to be a compromise between needing ad revenue and not wanting sponsored content to appear directly within ChatGPT’s written responses. By placing banner ads at the bottom of answers separated from the conversation history, OpenAI appears to be addressing Altman’s concern: The AI assistant’s actual output, the company says, will remain uninfluenced by advertisers.

Indeed, Simo wrote in a blog post that OpenAI’s ads will not influence ChatGPT’s conversational responses and that the company will not share conversations with advertisers and will not show ads on sensitive topics such as mental health and politics to users it determines to be under 18.

“As we introduce ads, it’s crucial we preserve what makes ChatGPT valuable in the first place,” Simo wrote. “That means you need to trust that ChatGPT’s responses are driven by what’s objectively useful, never by advertising.”",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/openai_glowing_green-1152x648.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 20:01:21.386878

Amendment to Revolving Credit Facility

On January 12, 2026, Cencora, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an Incremental Facility and Amendment Agreement (the “Amendment”) to that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended by the Amendment, the “Revolving Credit Agreement”), dated as of June 4, 2025, among the Company, the borrowing subsidiaries party thereto, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent.

The Amendment increased the aggregate amount of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement by $1.0 billion to $5.5 billion.

The foregoing description of the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

Multi-Year Term Loan Facility

On January 12, 2026, the Company entered into a Term Credit Agreement (the “Term Credit Agreement”), among the Company, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, in connection with the previously announced proposed acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of the majority of the outstanding equity interests that the Company does not currently own in OneOncology. The Term Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured term loan facility of $1.5 billion consisting of two tranches: (a) $500 million (“Tranche One Loans”) and (b) $1.0 billion (“Tranche Two Loans” and together with Tranche One Loans, the “Term Loans”). Tranche One Loans mature two years from the date on which they are drawn. Tranche Two Loans mature three years from the date on which they are drawn. The Company will use the proceeds of the Term Loans to pay a portion of the consideration in respect of the Acquisition, to repay existing debt of OneOncology and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. The funding of the Term Loans is subject to customary conditions, including the consummation of the Acquisition.

The Term Loans will bear interest at a rate equal to either a Term SOFR rate or a Daily Simple SOFR rate (each as defined in the Term Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin, or an alternate base rate, plus an applicable margin, in each case based on the Company’s public debt ratings by S&P Global Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch, Inc. Such applicable margins range from 75 basis points to 125 basis points over both the Term SOFR rate and the Daily Simple SOFR rate and 0 basis points to 25 basis points over the alternate base rate, as determined in accordance with the provisions of the Term Credit Agreement. The Company has also agreed to pay a ticking fee that will, commencing on April 1, 2026, accrue at specified rates based on the Company’s public debt ratings, ranging from 5.5 basis points to 15 basis points on the daily amount of unused commitments under the Term Credit Agreement. The Company has the right to prepay the Term Loans at any time, in whole or in part and without premium or penalty (other than, if applicable, any breakage costs). The Company may also choose to reduce its commitments under the Term Credit Agreement at any time.

The covenants contained in the Term Credit Agreement are substantially similar to the covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Term Credit Agreement includes limitations on indebtedness of subsidiaries, liens, fundamental changes and asset sales and a covenant requiring compliance with a financial leverage ratio not to exceed 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter (which may be increased to 4.50 to 1.00 at the Company’s election as of the last day of any fiscal quarter during which the Company closes a material acquisition). The Term Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (which are in some cases subject to certain exceptions, thresholds and grace periods) including, but not limited to, nonpayment of principal and interest, failure to perform or observe covenants, breaches of representations and warranties and certain bankruptcy-related events.

The foregoing description of the Term Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Term Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

364-Day Term Credit Facility

On January 12, 2026, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “364-Day Term Credit Agreement”), among the Company, the lenders party thereto and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, in connection with the Acquisition.

The 364-Day Term Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured term loan facility of $3.0 billion (the “364-Day Term Loan”). The 364-Day Term Loan matures 364 days from the date on which it is drawn. The Company will use the proceeds of the 364-Day Term Loan to pay a portion of the consideration in respect of the Acquisition, to repay existing debt of OneOncology and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. The funding of the 364-Day Term Loan is subject to customary conditions, including the consummation of the Acquisition.

The 364-Day Term Loan will bear interest at a rate equal to either a Term SOFR rate or a Daily Simple SOFR rate, plus an applicable margin, or an alternate base rate, plus an applicable margin, in each case based on the Company’s public debt ratings by S&P Global Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch, Inc. Such applicable margins range from 87.5 basis points to 112.5 basis points over both the Term SOFR rate and the Daily Simple SOFR rate and 0 basis points to 12.5 basis points over the alternate base rate, as determined in accordance with the provisions of the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement. The Company has also agreed to pay a ticking fee that will, commencing on April 1, 2026, accrue at specified rates based on the Company’s public debt ratings, ranging from 6 basis points to 10 basis points on the daily amount of unused commitments under the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement. The Company has the right to prepay the 364-Day Term Loan at any time, in whole or in part and without premium or penalty (other than, if applicable, any breakage costs). The Company may also choose to reduce its commitments under the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement at any time.

The covenants contained in the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement are substantially similar to the covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Agreement. The 364-Day Term Credit Agreement includes limitations on indebtedness of subsidiaries, liens, fundamental changes and asset sales and a covenant requiring compliance with a financial leverage ratio not to exceed 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter (which may be increased to 4.50 to 1.00 at the Company’s election as of the last day of any fiscal quarter during which the Company closes a material acquisition). The 364-Day Term Credit Agreement contains certain representations, warranties and events of default (which are, in some cases, subject to certain exceptions, thresholds and grace periods) including, but not limited to, non-payment of principal and interest, failure to perform or observe covenants, breaches of representations and warranties and certain bankruptcy-related events.

The foregoing description of the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

Termination of Bridge Financing Commitment

As previously disclosed, in connection with the Acquisition, the Company obtained $4.5 billion in bridge financing commitments to fund the Acquisition. As a result of entering into the Term Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement, such bridge financing commitments have been automatically reduced by $4.5 billion, which is the amount of the commitments under the Term Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement, to zero.

Other Relationships

Certain of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement, and their affiliates, have various relationships with the Company and are providing in connection with the Acquisition, have in the past provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, commercial banking, derivative transactions and financial advisory services to the Company and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they will receive, have received and may continue to receive fees and commissions. In particular, in connection with the Acquisition, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., an affiliate of Citibank, N.A., is serving as lead financial advisor to the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, an affiliate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., is serving as financial advisor to the Company. In addition, BofA Securities, Inc., an affiliate of Bank of America, N.A., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., an affiliate of Citibank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, an affiliate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, an affiliate of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., an affiliate of BNP Paribas, and Société Générale Corporate & Investment Banking, an affiliate of Société Générale have served as joint book-running managers, and certain affiliates of the other lenders have served as underwriters, in connection with past senior note offerings by the Company, and such affiliates may serve similar roles in future securities offerings by the Company. In addition, certain of the lenders serve various roles in connection with a $1.5 billion receivables securitization facility to which the Company’s subsidiaries, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, ASD Specialty Healthcare, LLC, and Amerisource Receivables Financial Corporation (“ARFC”), are a party and pursuant to which accounts receivables are sold on a revolving basis to ARFC, a special purpose entity. MUFG Bank, Ltd. serves as administrator and a purchaser under the program. Certain of the other lenders or their affiliates also serve as lenders or purchasers under this securitization facility.

However, a new breed of biotech companies are leveraging AI and advanced data technologies in an attempt to accelerate and streamline the process.
Chai Discovery, an AI startup founded in 2024, is one such company.
Last Friday, Chai also announced a partnership with Eli Lilly, a deal in which the pharmaceutical giant will use the startup’s software to help develop new medicines.
The startup’s deal was announced shortly before Eli Lilly said it would also collaborate with Nvidia on a $1 billion partnership to create an AI drug discovery lab in San Francisco.","Drug discovery, the art of identifying new molecules to develop pharmaceuticals, is a notoriously time-consuming and difficult process. Traditional techniques, like high-throughput screening, offer an expensive scattershot approach — one that is not often successful. However, a new breed of biotech companies are leveraging AI and advanced data technologies in an attempt to accelerate and streamline the process.

Chai Discovery, an AI startup founded in 2024, is one such company. In a little over 12 months, its young co-founders have managed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars and rally the backing of some of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, making it one of the flashiest firms in a growing industry. In December, the company completed its Series B, bringing in an additional $130 million and a valuation of $1.3 billion.

Last Friday, Chai also announced a partnership with Eli Lilly, a deal in which the pharmaceutical giant will use the startup’s software to help develop new medicines. Chai’s algorithm, called Chai-2, is designed to develop antibodies — the proteins necessary to fight illnesses. The startup has said it hopes to serve as a kind of “computer-aided design suite” for molecules.

It’s a critical moment for Chai’s particular field. The startup’s deal was announced shortly before Eli Lilly said it would also collaborate with Nvidia on a $1 billion partnership to create an AI drug discovery lab in San Francisco. This “co-innovation lab,” as it’s being called, will combine big data, compute resources, and scientific expertise, all in an attempt to accelerate the speed of new medicine development.

The industry isn’t without its detractors. Some industry veterans seem to feel that — given how difficult traditional drug development is — these new technologies are unlikely to have a major impact. However, for every naysayer, there seem to be just as many believers.

Elena Viboch, managing director at General Catalyst — one of Chai’s major backers — told TechCrunch that her firm is confident that companies that adopt the startup’s services will see results. “We believe the biopharma companies that move the most quickly to partner with companies like Chai will be the first to get molecules into the clinic, and will make medicines that matter,” Viboch said. “In practice that means partnering in 2026 and by the end of 2027 seeing first-in-class medicines enter into clinical trials.”

Aliza Apple, the head of Lilly’s TuneLab program — which uses AI and machine learning to advance drug discovery — also expressed confidence in Chai’s product. “By combining Chai’s generative design models with Lilly’s deep biologics expertise and proprietary data, we intend to push the frontier of how AI can design better molecules from the outset, with the ultimate goal to help accelerate the development of innovative medicines for patients,” she said.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cvZZmc1_FvJIHDtJ2Ykkaw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_finance_785/3f5e08d2ec791ff8f8eebc2cd6aed023,N,,2026-01-16 17:06:00.570352

However, the company is making a strong push, fueled by three new or adjusted perks, to entice tens of millions of U.S.-based Gold Star members to upgrade to Executive status.
A second dangling carrot was added for Costco's Executive members on June 30, 2025.
Although Costco aims to provide value to all 81.4 million of its members worldwide, encouraging domestic Gold Star member upgrades is vital to its long-term success.
Keeping Executive members happy and ensuring that renewal rates remain in the low-to-mid 90% range in the U.S. and Canada is paramount to the company's success.","For the last three years, the talk on Wall Street has centered on the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential to positively impact corporate growth and the lives of billions worldwide. But based on addressable opportunity, the global retail industry dwarfs the AI market.

According to a report from Mordor Intelligence, the worldwide retail industry is expected to expand from a $27.3 trillion market in 2025 to an estimated $36.9 trillion opportunity by 2030. For those keeping score at home, this translates to a compound annual growth rate that exceeds 6%.

Although the retail industry is highly competitive, businesses that are able to stand out can reap significant rewards. Examples of leading retailers include e-commerce titan Amazon (AMZN +0.40%), retail kingpin Walmart (WMT +0.42%), and warehouse club Costco Wholesale (COST +0.72%).

Arguably, no retailer has had a more unique path to success than Costco, whose membership-based operating model fuels its growth.

Differentiation has been central to Costco's long-term success

Based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were more than 1 million private retail establishments in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2024. While Costco isn't competing with all 1 million-plus businesses, it's constantly battling to stay relevant and attract shoppers to its stores. Some of the strategies it relies on are straightforward, while others are truly unique.

For example, Costco uses its size to its advantage. Similar to Amazon and Walmart, it purchases products in bulk, which lowers the per-unit cost of each item. These cost savings can be passed along to its shoppers, thereby allowing it to undercut local stores and national grocery chains on price. Few retailers can match the value proposition that Costco brings to the table for its members.

To build on this point, Costco offers a wide range of basic necessities, including groceries and toiletries, as well as a broad assortment of discretionary goods. These necessities ensure shoppers will come to its stores in any economic climate. While the margins tend to be razor-thin on groceries, it takes just one or more discretionary item purchases for a shopper's trip to be highly profitable.

Costco also enhances the lure of its warehouses by carrying rare or one-off items, such as luxury jewelry and gold bars/ingots.

But the most significant differentiating factor for Costco Wholesale is its memberships. Members pay $65 (Gold Star and Business) or $130 (Executive) annually for the right to shop in its stores. It's only natural for these individuals to want to get the most out of their membership fee. This makes Costco a prime destination for large shopping trips and works toward keeping consumers within its ecosystem.

Costco is introducing and updating perks to encourage Executive-level upgrades

As of the end of its fiscal first quarter for 2026 (Nov. 23, 2025), Costco had 81.4 million paying members worldwide, 39.7 million of which were Executive cardholders. However, the company is making a strong push, fueled by three new or adjusted perks, to entice tens of millions of U.S.-based Gold Star members to upgrade to Executive status.

For instance, when the company enacted its first membership fee increase since 2017 on Sept. 1, 2024, it also lifted the maximum annual 2% cash back reward from $1,000 to $1,250 for its Executive members. While purchases of gas, tobacco, alcohol (in most states), Costco gift cards, and membership fees don't count toward this 2% cash back reward, most in-store and online purchases will.

A second dangling carrot was added for Costco's Executive members on June 30, 2025. Beginning at the midpoint of last year, the company's highest-tier cardholders would receive a $10 monthly Instacart credit for same-day online delivery orders above $150 in the U.S. and Canada. Management fully understands the convenience that online shopping offers -- and 20.5% digitally enabled comparable sales growth in the fiscal first quarter suggests this perk is hitting home.

The third and easily most polarizing perk that Costco Wholesale bestowed on its Executive cardholders is special shopping hours. Beginning Sept. 2, 2025, Executive members can shop in Costco's stores exclusively from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. on weekdays and Sundays, and from 9 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. on Saturdays. CEO Ron Vachris has noted in quarterly conference calls since implementing these new shopping hours for its top-tier members that it's had a positive impact on sales.

Although Costco aims to provide value to all 81.4 million of its members worldwide, encouraging domestic Gold Star member upgrades is vital to its long-term success. Membership fees account for the lion's share of Costco's profits and provide the necessary margin buffer to undercut other retailers on price.

Even though Executive cardholders account for less than 49% of paying members, their purchases totaled 74.3% of net sales for Costco during the fiscal first quarter of 2026. Keeping Executive members happy and ensuring that renewal rates remain in the low-to-mid 90% range in the U.S. and Canada is paramount to the company's success.

With Costco aggressively targeting membership upgrades, expect new perks to be added or adjusted in the new year (and beyond).",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F851245%2Fcostco-wholesale-warehouse-groceries-staples-discretionary-retail-gdp-inflation.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-16 17:05:49.971029

The New Standard for Institutional Finance The deployment of 20,000 AI agents at BNY marks the definitive end of the ""experimentation phase"" for generative AI in the financial sector.
The key takeaways are clear: agentic AI is no longer a futuristic concept; it is an active, revenue-impacting reality.","In a move that signals a tectonic shift in the digital transformation of global finance, BNY (NYSE: BNY), formerly known as BNY Mellon, has officially reached a massive milestone in its AI strategy. As of January 16, 2026, the world’s largest custody bank has successfully deployed tens of thousands of ""Agentic Assistants"" across its global operations. This deployment represents one of the first successful transitions from experimental generative AI to a full-scale ""agentic"" operating model, where AI systems perform complex, autonomous tasks rather than just responding to prompts.

The bank’s initiative, built upon its proprietary Eliza platform, has divided its AI workforce into two distinct categories: over 20,000 ""Empowered Builders""—human employees trained to create custom agents—and a growing fleet of over 130 specialized ""Digital Employees."" These digital entities possess their own system credentials, email accounts, and communication access, effectively operating as autonomous members of the bank’s workforce. This development is being hailed as the ""operating system of the bank,"" fundamentally altering how BNY handles trillions of dollars in assets daily.

Technical Deep Dive: From Chatbots to Digital Employees

The technical backbone of this initiative is the Eliza 2.0 platform, a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration layer that represents a departure from the simple Large Language Model (LLM) interfaces of 2023 and 2024. Unlike previous iterations that focused on text generation, Eliza 2.0 is centered on ""reasoning"" and ""agency."" These agents are not just processing data; they are executing workflows that involve multiple steps, such as cross-referencing internal databases, validating external regulatory updates, and communicating findings via Microsoft Teams to their human managers.

A critical component of this deployment is the ""menu of models"" approach. BNY has engineered Eliza to be model-agnostic, allowing agents to switch between different high-performance models based on the specific task. For instance, agents might use GPT-4 from OpenAI for complex logical reasoning, Google Cloud’s Gemini Enterprise for multimodal deep research, and specialized Llama-based models for internal code remediation. This architecture ensures that the bank is not locked into a single provider while maximizing the unique strengths of each AI ecosystem.

Initial reactions from the AI research community have been overwhelmingly positive, particularly regarding BNY’s commitment to ""Explainable AI"" (XAI). Every agentic model must pass a rigorous ""Model-Risk Review"" before deployment, generating detailed ""model cards"" and feature importance charts that allow auditors to understand the ""why"" behind an agent's decision. This level of transparency addresses a major hurdle in the adoption of AI within highly regulated environments, where ""black-box"" decision-making is often a non-starter for compliance officers.

The Multi-Vendor Powerhouse: Big Tech's Role in the Agentic Shift

The scale of BNY's deployment has created a lucrative blueprint for major technology providers. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) played a foundational role by supplying the hardware infrastructure; BNY was the first major bank to deploy an Nvidia DGX SuperPOD with H100 systems, providing the localized compute power necessary to train and run these agents securely on-premises. This partnership has solidified Nvidia’s position not just as a chipmaker, but as a critical infrastructure partner for ""Sovereign AI"" within the private sector.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are also deeply integrated into the Eliza ecosystem. Microsoft Azure hosts much of the Eliza infrastructure, providing the integration layer for agents to interact with the Microsoft 365 suite, including Outlook and Teams. Meanwhile, Google Cloud’s Gemini Enterprise is being utilized for ""agentic deep research,"" synthesizing vast datasets to provide predictive analytics on trade settlements. This competitive landscape shows that while tech giants are vying for dominance, the ""agentic era"" is fostering a multi-provider reality where enterprise clients demand interoperability and the ability to leverage the best-of-breed models from various labs.

For AI startups, BNY’s move is both a challenge and an opportunity. While the bank has the resources to build its own orchestration layer, the demand for specialized, niche agents—such as those focused on specific international tax laws or ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) compliance—is expected to create a secondary market for smaller AI firms that can plug into platforms like Eliza. The success of BNY’s internal ""Empowered Builders"" program suggests that the future of enterprise AI may lie in tools that allow non-technical staff to build and maintain their own agents, rather than relying on off-the-shelf software.

Reshaping the Global Finance Landscape

The broader significance of BNY’s move cannot be overstated. By empowering 40% of its global workforce to build and use AI agents, the bank has effectively democratized AI in a way that parallels the introduction of the personal computer or the spreadsheet. This is a far cry from the pilot projects of 2024; it is a full-scale industrialization of AI. BNY has reported a roughly 5% reduction in unit costs for core custody trades, a significant margin in the high-volume, low-margin world of asset servicing.

Beyond cost savings, the deployment addresses the increasing complexity of regulatory compliance. BNY’s ""Contract Review Assistant"" agents can now benchmark thousands of negotiated agreements against global regulations in a fraction of the time it would take human legal teams. This ""always-on"" compliance capability mitigates risk and allows the bank to adapt to shifting geopolitical and regulatory landscapes with unprecedented speed.

Comparisons are already being drawn to previous technological milestones, such as the transition to electronic trading in the 1990s. However, the agentic shift is potentially more disruptive because it targets the ""cognitive labor"" of the middle and back office. While earlier waves of automation replaced manual data entry, these agents are performing tasks that previously required human judgment and cross-departmental coordination. The potential concern remains the ""human-in-the-loop"" requirement; as agents become more autonomous, the pressure on human managers to supervise dozens of digital employees will require new management frameworks and training.

The Next Frontier: Proactive Agents and Automated Remediation

Looking toward the remainder of 2026 and into 2027, the bank is expected to expand the capabilities of its agents from reactive to proactive. Near-term developments include ""Predictive Trade Analytics,"" where agents will not only identify settlement risks but also autonomously initiate remediation protocols to prevent trade failures before they occur. This move from ""detect and report"" to ""anticipate and act"" will be the true test of agentic autonomy in finance.

One of the most anticipated applications on the horizon is the integration of these agents into client-facing roles. While currently focused on internal operations, BNY is reportedly exploring ""Client Co-pilots"" that would give the bank’s institutional clients direct access to agentic research and analysis tools. However, this will require addressing significant challenges regarding data privacy and ""multi-tenant"" agent security to ensure that agents do not inadvertently share proprietary insights across different client accounts.

Experts predict that other ""Global Systemically Important Banks"" (G-SIBs) will be forced to follow suit or risk falling behind in operational efficiency. We are likely to see a ""space race"" for AI talent and compute resources, as institutions realize that the ""Agentic Assistant"" model is the only way to manage the exponential growth of financial data and regulatory requirements in the late 2020s.

The New Standard for Institutional Finance

The deployment of 20,000 AI agents at BNY marks the definitive end of the ""experimentation phase"" for generative AI in the financial sector. The key takeaways are clear: agentic AI is no longer a futuristic concept; it is an active, revenue-impacting reality. BNY’s success with the Eliza platform demonstrates that with the right governance, infrastructure, and multi-vendor strategy, even the most traditional financial institutions can reinvent themselves for the AI era.

This development will likely be remembered as a turning point in AI history—the moment when ""agents"" moved from tech demos to the front lines of global capitalism. In the coming weeks and months, the industry will be watching closely for BNY’s quarterly earnings to see how these efficiencies translate into bottom-line growth. Furthermore, the response from regulators like the Federal Reserve and the SEC will be crucial in determining how fast other institutions are allowed to adopt similar autonomous systems.

As we move further into 2026, the question is no longer whether AI will change finance, but which institutions will have the infrastructure and the vision to lead the agentic revolution. BNY has made its move, setting a high bar for the rest of the industry to follow.

© Copyright 2025 Capital Markets Elite Group – All Rights Reserved","Novo Nordisk A/S shares surged in U.S. trading after U.K. regulators cleared a triple-dose of the company’s flagship obesity drug, heightening rivalry with Eli Lilly & Co. in the $100 billion weight-loss market.

The Danish drugmaker’s American depositary receipts climbed 3.2% in premarket trading Friday following the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency’s approval of a 7.2-milligram weekly dose of semaglutide—three times the previous 2.4-mg limit. The higher dose requires three separate injections and is restricted to adult patients with obesity. Eli Lilly shares dipped 0.3%.

Market Dynamics Shift

The approval comes as Novo encounters increasing pressure from Lilly’s Zepbound, which has achieved considerable market share despite Novo’s early-mover position with semaglutide-based treatments. Ozempic received FDA approval for Type 2 diabetes in 2017, with Wegovy following for chronic weight management in 2021.

Novo’s counterstrategy centers on product diversification. The company launched an oral Wegovy formulation in the U.S. on January 5, with a U.K. regulatory decision anticipated by year-end.

Revenue Projections

Speaking at this week’s J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, Novo CEO Mike Doustdar pointed out the oral medication’s strategic importance. “Right now, we are being judged by how many patients are being switched between Eli Lilly and us,” Doustdar said. “A big part of those people don’t want an injection. They’re waiting for the pill.”

Berenberg analysts project the oral version could generate approximately $1 billion in 2025 revenue, possibly counterbalancing headwinds from U.S. pricing pressures and patent expirations. The bank’s base-case scenario forecasts $2 billion by 2027, with upside potential to $6 billion if Novo leverages its first-mover advantage.

Competitive Landscape

Lilly is developing orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 competitor expected to launch this year following last month’s FDA application submission. December data showed orforglipron enables patients to maintain weight loss after transitioning from injectable treatments, including Wegovy and Zepbound, with participants switching directly from maximum tolerated injectable doses to oral formulations.

For non-Asian medical device manufacturers trying to expand into Asian markets, having the right mindset from the beginning helps, Khong told MD+DI.
In essence, the approach ensures that device manufacturers rely on the local supply chain, local components, local packaging — everything local, Khong said.
Rewards to reap Medical device companies will likely face many challenges initially when they start their journeys to access Asian markets.
In the medical device manufacturing category, Japan was the largest and India the fastest-growing market in 2024.","Medical device manufacturers can’t afford not to consider entering potentially lucrative Asian markets. Reported to be about $31.77 billion in 2024, the Asia Pacific medical device contract manufacturing market is expected to reach $100.90 billion by 2033, according to a report by Grand View Research.

Medical device manufacturers based in the United States and Europe, however, find that the road to market approval in Asian countries is complicated, differs by country, and requires local alliances or partnerships.

Right mindset for starters

Asia should not be treated as a single, homogeneous market. Rather, Asia is made up of several distinct regions with different regulatory maturity, market behavior, and go-to-market requirements, according to Meng Khong, U.S. CEO of SotaTek, a health-technology development firm that helps bridge gaps for medical device and other industry players’ access in and out of Asia and Singapore.

For non-Asian medical device manufacturers trying to expand into Asian markets, having the right mindset from the beginning helps, Khong told MD+DI. For example, don’t think that having FDA clearance or European Union market approval is an in. It’s not. And don’t think that once you’re in a part of Asia, your product will have easy access to all Asian markets. It won’t.

“Because of these differences, companies that succeed in Asia typically design or redesign their products with specific regional and local contexts in mind, rather than assuming a single FDA-cleared or globally approved product can be lightly localized and deployed across all Asian markets,” he said.

Eyes wide open

Understanding local market requirements and policies and having strategies in place are key, he said.

“When you go into a local market, you need to test according to the local environment and user scenarios. Not all the Asian markets have good Wi-Fi, for example. And all have different data regulatory requirements. For example, Indonesia and China cannot allow patients’ data to go out of the country,” he said.

As Asia’s number one manufacturing destination, China is a worthy market, with a huge population and an insatiable hunger for medical device technology — notably wearables. China’s regulatory requirements, however, make for “an extensive and painful experience,” which often means designing and manufacturing a device from the ground up, according to Khong.

Companies like San Diego, CA-based Illumina opted instead to establish a hub in Singapore, paving the way to an easier entry into the Chinese market. Singapore, South Korea, and Japan are stable, predictable, more open markets. Companies like to establish regional hubs in those countries because there are few surprises. Regulatory requirements are pretty predictable, according to Khong.

Right now, probably 60% of medical device company regional hubs are being set up in Singapore, Khong said. Medtronic, GE HealthCare, and Siemens Healthineers have hubs there.

China’s rules, on the other hand, favor a made-in-China strategy. Khong said there are several terms used to refer to the strategy, including China Localization 2.0 (supply chain and technology localization) and “Made in China 2025” (industrial localization), among others. In essence, the approach ensures that device manufacturers rely on the local supply chain, local components, local packaging — everything local, Khong said.

According to an October 13, 2025, China Briefing, “China’s new government procurement policy introduces a 20 percent price evaluation advantage for qualifying domestic products and sets clearer standards for what counts as ‘Made in China.’ This poses real challenges for foreign businesses — especially those with offshore production — but also creates a more transparent and fairer competitive environment. To stay competitive, companies should proactively localize production, strengthen compliance systems, and align with evolving standards to seize new opportunities in China’s vast public procurement market.”

Potentially good news is China also has the China Plus One, or C+1, policy, which encourages investment (manufacturing and supply chain operations) not only in China but also in other Asian countries, according to Source of Asia.

This is to avoid overreliance on a single source country, and can help U.S. and European medical device manufacturers who have established hubs in these partnering countries to help gain access to the China market.

Countries like Malaysia, Thailand, India, and Vietnam are among the countries actively positioning themselves for China Plus One. Malaysia is a long-established medical device manufacturing hub, according to Khong.

More encouraging news: once medical device manufacturers from abroad get over the initial regulatory hurdles, testing their devices on humans may not be as big a deal as in the United States.

For example, China is big in wearable devices and has many more brands than the United States, according to Khong.

“The U.S. is much more regulated, and devices have to go through a longer experimental cycle before being launched in the market. In Asia, the common practice is that they do have regulations, but they tend to have devices partner very closely with the regulatory body and the healthcare system, so they test out the systems much earlier in [real-world] cases. Asia has a big population base, both for validating devices and having digital innovation. It makes it much more feasible to enforce that kind of clinical trial in real time,” he said. “That makes wearable devices very affordable and very easy for us to try and obtain.”

Khong’s breakdown of Asian markets

Khong offered these summaries to help device manufacturers think about the Asian markets.

Rewards to reap

Medical device companies will likely face many challenges initially when they start their journeys to access Asian markets. But those that survive will reap the long-term financial benefits.

“Asia already occupies 60% of the global population,” Khong said.

In the medical device manufacturing category, Japan was the largest and India the fastest-growing market in 2024. On the basis of the therapeutic area segment, the cardiovascular devices segment held the largest therapeutic market share in 2024, while Asia’s surgical instrument segment is expected to grow the fastest during the forecast period, according to Grand View Research.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt14ac89070d5e4751/blt4101363f07713089/696a93afffd73f719f9c9749/Untitled_design_-_2026-01-16T133623.946.png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-16 17:05:13.261179

New Year’s resolutions, made in good faith, are beginning to wobble, and new gym memberships are already collecting dust. But behind a familiar start to 2026 lies a very different story about how a record-breaking 2025 ended.

New data from Adobe Digital Insights, powered by Adobe Analytics, shows that, during November and December 2025, UK shoppers splashed a record £26.9 billion online (up 4.1% from 2024), signalling the highest online spending Christmas period on record.

Across 2025, online spend reached £118.5 billion, up 2.8% on 2024 – another record-breaker. That annual growth may look modest at first glance, but it masks a strong finish.

The impressive performance over the festive period was driven by sharper discounts, budget-busting spending on key days, and a noticeable shift in how people researched and bought products.

GenAI is now part of the shopping routine

One of the clearest signals from this year’s data is how rapidly GenAI is moving from novelty to habit.

Traffic to retail sites from AI sources grew 329% year-over-year during the holiday period, with AI-driven referrals on Boxing Day up 685% on 2024 figures. While the overall numbers are still relatively small, the direction of travel is pretty conclusive: More shoppers are using GenAI tools to research products, compare options, and hunt for deals before they ever land on a retail site.

What matters more than where AI shows up is how it’s being used. Shoppers are increasingly trusting these tools to help them make informed purchases, using them to compare options, weigh up value, and make confident decisions before they buy.

As more AI services add shopping features and integrations, this behaviour is only going to accelerate in 2026. For retailers, that means visibility within these tools is becoming just as important as visibility in search or social feeds.

Mobile experience still makes or breaks conversion

Clearly, GenAI is setting the benchmark for how quickly online shoppers expect to move. By the time a shopper clicks through to a retail site from tools like ChatGPT or Gemini, they’re often already in ‘buy mode’. They’ve done their research, and the retailer’s site is purely for the purchase. Barriers to making the purchase, like long registration journeys or extra steps before reaching the checkout can quickly kill this positive momentum and see the sale head somewhere else.

Our research shows many of these journeys are now happening on mobile. During the holiday period, £16.5 billion was spent on mobile devices, rising 14.1% from 2024 and accounting for 61.5% of total online spend. While online spending on mobile devices has outstripped desktop or laptop spending in the UK for several years, the rise of GenAI search means the context has changed. Mobile experiences now need to match the speed and simplicity of the discovery tools (increasingly GenAI) that lead shoppers there in the first place.

Big sales days inspire shopper confidence

Black Friday once again stood out as the single biggest online shopping day of the year, with £1.16 billion spent. Cyber Weekend delivered £3.8 billion, and Boxing Day passed £500 million as shoppers shifted from buying gifts for others to searching for gifts for themselves.

What makes these ‘eventised’ shopping moments most interesting is the behaviour behind them. Across the year, consumers are highly price driven, often trading down and searching for the cheapest option. During the holiday period, and especially on major sales days, that mindset shifts.

Our data shows that when the price is right, shoppers are happy to trade-up to more premium items. The deeper discounts on offer over the holiday period and the increased sense of urgency over Cyber Weekend, prompted shoppers to go for the best they could afford rather than the cheapest they could find. Across November and December Adobe Analytics data shows the share of the most expensive items sold across different categories was 14% higher compared with the rest of 2025.

Where UK retailers stand heading into 2026

The UK retail picture at the end of 2025 is one of deliberate, informed shoppers who are ready to spend (and in some cases, spend big), but only when the conditions, value and experience feels right. Retailers that understand those moments and meet those expectations will be set up for success in 2026.

It stocked up on naloxone (Narcan), a drug that reverses an opioid-related overdose, said former Plumas County Public Health Agency Director Andrew Woodruff.
The opioid epidemic of today is “silently killing people.” Gary Sanderson, Plumas County alcohol and drug administrator Sanderson said the opioid epidemic of today is “silently killing people.” As these new challenges arose, Reinert said county health officials began implementing programs for medication-assisted treatment, syringe exchange and substance-use disorder counseling.
“It’s kind of a blessing in disguise.” Nicole Reinert, Plumas County Public Health Agency director “It’s kind of a blessing in disguise,” Reinert said.
Blust explained that Westwood is included in the Plumas County data despite being part of Lassen, not Plumas County.","Fifteen years ago, Plumas County had one of California’s highest rates of opioid prescriptions, as well as one of the highest overdose death rates. By 2016, prescriptions were down and the death rate followed. That year zero opioid-related deaths were reported.

This positive statistical trend, however, masks an uncomfortable local reality: Since 2016, Plumas County’s opioid epidemic has shifted from legal prescriptions to underground sources, and the death rate has begun to rise. That is driving public health officials to adjust their approach.

Responding to the spotlight

The community of just under 20,000 residents came under an opioid epidemic spotlight after data compiled from the California Department of Public Health, from 2009 to 2013, found that Plumas County had the highest death rate of deaths from prescribed opioids in the state. The worst year was 2010 with a rate of 40.16 per 100,000 residents, according to the California Overdose Surveillance Dashboard.

The Plumas County Public Health Agency immediately went to work. It launched a campaign to add education around opioids in schools and in the community. It stocked up on naloxone (Narcan), a drug that reverses an opioid-related overdose, said former Plumas County Public Health Agency Director Andrew Woodruff.

In 2015, the county had strengthened its efforts to combat the local epidemic through collaboration with Modoc, Lassen and Sierra counties. They formed the Northern Sierra Opioid Coalition in January 2016. The coalition implemented a series of programs, said Woodruff. Among them were educating the community and prescribers about opioids, and handing out more free naloxone.

Pharmacies and hospitals got on board, working together to implement a prescription drug monitoring program, said Plumas County Public Health Agency Director Nicole Reinert. They created a database so the various pharmacies and hospitals can monitor prescriptions to avoid misuse.

The impacts were almost immediate: In 2016 zero deaths related to opioids were reported; only one death was reported the following year.

Going underground

Then something shifted. While opioid prescriptions continue to fall, deaths began to rise. From 2017-2021, death rates bounced between one and two annually. In both 2022 and 2023 three deaths were reported. In 2024 there were four. Public health officials attribute this in part to the way the epidemic has changed as prescriptions dropped.

“It started from overprescribing,” said Reinert. When intervention programs reduced that availability, people turned to illicit street drugs. They had no legal source to feed their addiction, she said, “and now we’re seeing fentanyl.”

While fentanyl is new to the area, methamphetamine has been prevalent for decades. As prescriptions for opioids have fallen, these two drugs are showing up together, said Gary Sanderson, Plumas County’s alcohol and drug administrator.

“A lot of the methamphetamine is causing people to test positive for fentanyl as well,” he said. Non-prescription methamphetamine is increasingly laced with fentanyl. “With more fentanyl in the meth, there is a higher risk to the community for overdose deaths,” Sanderson added.

Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, has a very high potency that can be fatal even in low amounts. Sanderson said he doesn’t believe that people go straight to heroin or meth. “Typically individuals might go to the black market, through friends or connections, to find the same prescriptions they were being given before,” he said.

Some people have told him the drugs they bought through the black market weren’t the same as the ones being prescribed, potentially leading to addiction to other substances, Sanderson said.

The opioid epidemic of today is “silently killing people.”

Sanderson said the opioid epidemic of today is “silently killing people.”

As these new challenges arose, Reinert said county health officials began implementing programs for medication-assisted treatment, syringe exchange and substance-use disorder counseling. But funding and resources posed a challenge as they worked to expand access and care.

$6.9 million opioid settlement

In 2018, Plumas joined other counties and cities across California to sue pharmaceutical companies and drugstores who were “accused of misleading marketing practices,” Reinert said. Among them were Johnson and Johnson, Teva, Allergen, Wallgreens, Wallmart, CVS and Kroger, Reinert said.

They won. The financial award from these lawsuits, which is dispersed in annual allotments, can only be spent on mitigating the opioid epidemic. The first of the funds came in late 2022. The county expects to receive a total of $6.9 million over an 18-year span, Reinert said.

But the funds, overseen by the county administration officer, sat untouched from 2022 until Reinert’s appointment in April 2024. The public health agency had no permanent director during that period, part of a spate of department head vacancies that peaked at 19 of 26 positions between 2020 and 2022. Six department heads submitted their resignations between June and September 2023.

The initial installment of settlement funds built interest over the two years, reaching $2 million by the time Reinert assumed her role as director. She immediately requested oversight of the fund.

“It’s kind of a blessing in disguise.”

Nicole Reinert, Plumas County Public Health Agency director

“It’s kind of a blessing in disguise,” Reinert said. “We’re now able to work systematically in the county to distribute it with this large amount.”

Reinert and her team gathered data and reached out to partners for the best way to spend the money. Almost immediately, she put some into the Plumas County Behavioral Health Department’s wellness centers, which were struggling financially at the time. The Chester and Quincy wellness centers provide community assistance programs, such as help with applications, wellness groups and counseling, and financial assistance. They also contain Haven machines, which offer harm reduction tools. These machines are being stocked partially through funding from the settlement.

The public health department is working to help expand services at the Plumas County Intervention and Resource Center through North Star Navigation Center, PCIRC’s shelter service.

Reinert and Sanderson noted that transportation, time and access to services can be challenging for some people. Reinert intends to use some of the settlement funds to hire a nurse to provide education and wound care via a mobile outreach van. She also plans to use some of the settlement funds for transportation to treatment centers.

“These are really remote sites that often don’t get a lot of services at all,” Reinert said. “We’re trying to meet them where they’re at and trying to expand.”

Reinert also plans to put part of the settlement funding toward support for incarcerated individuals. People suspected of being under the influence may soon have a medical wristband to monitor signs of an overdose, allowing health officials to react quickly.

“The [Plumas] jail is working to purchase a body scanner upon entry, just to ensure there aren’t additional substances,” Reinert said. “If these substances are found, this will not be additional tools for prosecution — this is simply for prevention.”

After people are released from jail, public health officials hope to offer Brixadi, a once-a-month injection used to treat moderate to severe opioid addiction. There is also a fund for people who can’t afford treatment, Sanderson said.

Naloxone (Narcan)

When the opioid epidemic was first identified, one of the earliest public health interventions focused on training the community to use naloxone.

Public Health Coordinator Danielle Blust explained that the stigma surrounding naloxone has remained throughout this process. Some believe that offering naloxone encourages users to continue taking opioids. Other forms of stigma include people believing they don’t need naloxone because of who the drug is intended for.

Blust explained why everyone — with or without addiction issues — should have naloxone: “It isn’t just people who take drugs recreationally, but also those who take them because of their health.”

Blust and Reinert both compared naloxone to a fire extinguisher: “Everyone should have one at their house,” Blust said. “You never want to use it, but you’ll be grateful to use it when you have it.”

“You never want to use it, but you’ll be grateful to use it when you have it.”

Danielle Blust, Plumas County Public Health Agency coordinator

Blust said that as community members, it’s important to know the signs of an overdose and to always carry naloxone. “If you notice someone’s lips are blue, or their skin is pale, or they’re having complications breathing,” those are all signs of an overdose, she said.

Naloxone is provided by the county public health department and the behavioral health department at no charge. The settlement money is also being used to purchase more naloxone.

Challenges in the data

The county public health department gathers the majority of the data on opioid overdoses. But gathering and interpreting data comes with its own set of difficulties. Plumas County has limited data for several reasons, including its small population, which makes gathering extensive information challenging. Other constraints include resources and staffing limitations, Reinert said.

As the epidemic has moved underground, often health officials have to rely on word of mouth.

“When we’re giving out Narcan through the harm reduction program, and people are reporting ‘I had three friends last week who overdosed and one died.’ That’s how, at times, our county has to gather some of the data,” Sanderson said.

Blust explained that when someone with underlying health conditions dies their death may be attributed to that health concern — even when opioid overdose plays a role. To make interpreting data even more difficult, the county’s size means that even one death can greatly increase percentages and change how the county compares with others, Sanderson said. The California Overdose Surveillance Dashboard isn’t completely reliable either. Blust explained that Westwood is included in the Plumas County data despite being part of Lassen, not Plumas County.

Sanderson was skeptical about the zero deaths reported in 2016. “I don’t think it was ever zero,” he said, explaining that the absence of deaths was likely related to reporting issues.

Reinert noted that the county’s epidemiologist has been looking at recent opioid overdose data. “We have collected local quantitative data through surveys regarding drug use, needs and readiness for treatment, which we are processing internally,” she said. This data will be paired with emergency room visits, uses of naloxone and monitoring vital statistics.

Looking forward

Plumas County remains under the state average for opioid prescriptions. But the wave of the underground epidemic has brought new challenges. With the opioid settlement money now being used, officials are optimistic that expanded services will bring positive change.

“This settlement funding is going to be a huge help for this community overall,” Reinert said. Without it, she was skeptical that any of the new programs could be implemented.

Sanderson said many people struggling with addiction feel judgment and shame, which keeps them using substances in the dark, stopping them from seeking support. He said that we need to begin looking at addiction as “a complex interplay between choice and disease.”

As settlement money funds more initiatives and projects, expanding access and care should help combat the opioid epidemic.

“I think we’re moving in the right direction,” Reinert said. “I see momentum not just with partners but with the community. We’re all going to have to work together.”",https://plumassun.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PXL_20260112_214351990-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 18:03:40.583959

We are aiming to bring approximately €2 billion into the economy through Enterprise Ireland high-value jobs and continued exports.","I want to return to the issue of the fact that ten ministers have not paid back money owed to the public funds, in some cases tens of thousands of euro, seven months after it was requested. When I questioned Deputy Chambers, who is the Minister responsible for the NSSO, the body which will deal with these repayments, he said he is not privy to the interactions between Ministers and the NSSO and that he does not know the identity of the ten. The Minister has made a stout defence of the fact that those ten have not yet paid back the money. I want to put a number of questions and I expect direct answers. Does the Minister know who the ten Ministers are who have so far not paid back the thousands of euro they owe the public purse? How many of them are Fine Gael Ministers? From where was the information the Minister put on the record of the Dáil today in their defence elicited, if it was not from the individual Ministers? Crucially, when are the Ministers going to cough up and pay back the money they owe the taxpayer? I ask for direct answers please.

This is questions on promised legislation but I will respond directly to Deputy Doherty, as I have been very clear in relation to the NSSO. This is an error by the NSSO and Ministers are engaging with the NSSO. I do not know, nor should I know, the identity of anyone's payroll matters in the State. I do know from dealing with the NSSO because, as I said, between underpayment and overpayment everyone who served and gave a salary sacrifice in government, with regard to the decision to reduce salaries by 10%, was affected. This is why it is critical-----

In the week when special school classes were announced for 2026, I need to raise with the Minister the case of River Valley Community National School in Swords. It is not looking for a class in 2026; it is looking for a class now. This is in agreement with the NCSE. The school is a developing school in good but interim accommodation. It is being refused by the Department of education the provision of an autism class right now only because it is in temporary accommodation, even though it has the space. I ask, please, because I will continue to bring this up, will the Department meet the patron body and the principal on site to get this matter over the line? Autistic children are being let down, as are mainstream children and the staff. This can be resolved, please, Minister.

Compliance with the law is not a gift for X to give to this State but this is the benevolent tone in which it announced this morning that it will indeed comply with law in jurisdictions where that law exists.

This belated assurance for geo-blocking, which in itself is hugely problematic because it can be so easily circumnavigated, is too little, too late. It is not surprising that we are hearing this tone from this tech company because kid gloves is the approach that this Government and this State has taken to dealing with big tech and the harms it is wielding on society. The response over the last two weeks has been chaotic and it has taken a Minister of State in the Minister, Deputy Burke's Department to actually cajole this Government into action. I want to hear an update on what is happening with the Attorney General and his analysis of the law. I want to know if the Garda investigation, which we heard about yesterday in committee, has finally reached the doors of X on Fenian Street, and I want to hear what further Government action is going to happen so that we can take off those kid gloves and wrestle back control from big tech on the absolute havoc it is wreaking on society.

The Housing Agency is finding new ways to exclude people from the remediation scheme. We have already seen the system fail when pyrrhotite in concrete was ignored. The agency has now introduced a new method to refuse access, stretching IS 465 and selectively presenting facts. The approach will not withstand scrutiny and must be addressed. The decision has been independently reviewed by engineers and a legal expert, both concluding it is wrong. Reliance on an appeals process to correct such decision is reactive, costly and causes harm to homeowners. The Minister has the authority and responsibility to act proactively and treat the decisions as a test case and set a fair, consistent standard before people are affected. This matter goes beyond a single property. Now that this has been brought to the Government's attention, will the Minister intervene to stop this and review the test case or will it be allowed to continue? I want a simple ""Yes"" or ""No"".

Obviously, I am not the Minister for housing, but I will take this issue up with him. I would point out that the Government has been very proactive in protecting homeowners in Donegal. I acknowledge all those homeowners who have applied for the current scheme, which was enhanced, and the work done throughout our communities to ensure people and families are protected, because that is a primary concern of the Government for all those families that are affected in Donegal. I will raise the specific issue Deputy Ward brought up with the Minister for housing.

In Ireland, we use over 200 million single-use tea and coffee cups a year. That equates to at least 20,000 cups an hour. That is a staggering figure. Coffee cups are, according to Irish Business Against Litter, among the top five most littered items in the country according to a recent survey. Most of these cups cannot go into recycling bins because of the polyethylene lining used in the paper, making them non-recyclable. The Government had proposed a 20 cent levy as well as other measures. As the Minister knows, the litter issue is one thing, but the long-term environmental damage is another. When is the Government going to use or amend the Circular Economy and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022 to bring in a refundable deposit? Along with other products that I have referred to before such as the vaping material and nitrous oxide canisters, they are littering our country and we need to have something with a behavioural impact as well as increased fines.

In County Offaly, renewable energy developments are mainly located on peatlands around Rhode, Croghan, Edenderry, Banagher and Cloghan. These projects require abnormal load vehicles of up to 135 tonnes on 16-axle trailers. The damage caused by one trip of one of these vehicles is equivalent to one year of normal traffic. As a result, these peat-based roads now require annual maintenance, placing major pressure on our local authority roads budget and taking funding away from other roads that also need work.

Offaly has historically carried the heaviest load in providing power to this country and we are doing so again through renewable energy. We are simply asking for a fair crack of the whip and that separate, dedicated funding be provided to Offaly County Council for these road projects.

I am very proud to come from a small village called Kinnitty where we have benefited significantly from multimillion euro investment in the public realm, public services and the development of the Slieve Bloom mountain bike trails. However, in the last 12 months, we have lost our post office and our last shop, which had served the community for decades. Thankfully, a 68-year-old man, Mr. Jodie Flaherty, has stepped into the breach to open a new shop. However, it is a reflection of the challenges in the market conditions and trading environment for micro-businesses in small villages right across the country. I appreciate the measures the Minister has introduced through, for example, the local enterprise office in terms of supports, but there is a concern around viability. I ask the Minister and the wider Government to ensure there are further measures to make sure the viability of our micro-businesses in the best interests of our public good, our economic good and our social good.

I acknowledge the huge work Deputy Clendennen is doing in being a firm advocate for our small family businesses. I know, as Minister for enterprise, that they employ two thirds of people right across our community. We have taken a number of initiatives this year around viability and worked to ensure that they are more viable, including setting up our small business unit and working with our cost of doing business advisory forum, which is looking at the interoperability of regulators that are currently on our landscape and ensuring we are doing things faster and being agile as an economy. We also have a huge amount of work to do, as is outlined in the programme for Government, related to other viability measures. We will work with Deputy Clendennen to ensure our small businesses continue to grow. As I pointed out in my earlier contribution, all 13 sectors of the economy are in a strong growth phase right now.

Yesterday, the Irish Wheelchair Association and other disability organisations had a session in the audiovisual room. They gave some stark facts and figures to us. Sometimes, we all get lost in statistics and figures. The reality for people with disabilities is that they are affected far more by the high cost of living - approximately 16% more. They are in need of some form of a one-off payment now. This winter and the next few months can be severe and extremely cold. At present, they are receiving huge electricity and gas bills, some up to €500. They told us they were in a position where they had to give up a few meals a week to heat their homes and stop their home dialysis treatment and go to their local hospital to save on their electricity bills. There are a few cases where they stopped recharging their mobile wheelchairs.

I ask that the Government consider a one-off targeted payment of €400, with an estimated cost of €145 million. Considering the surplus billions of euro that is in the coffers at the moment, it is a very modest ask for the most vulnerable people in the country. As they say themselves, they are 22% of the invisible minority.

During Leaders' Questions, I raised quite clearly what the Government was doing for people who were most vulnerable, particularly the 15% increase in our fuel allowance, of which one in four households is now in receipt of, to reflect the challenges related to the cost of living. I also mentioned the social welfare increase for carers, those with disabilities and those on the margins of society of €10 per week. There are further interventions that assist people through the social welfare code. I always point out that the community welfare office is ready to assist people if they have any one-off shocks or meet a liability they are unable to discharge. I assure people that the Government will continue to work to support people with disabilities. In 2026, we have a record budget for disability services - this is a fact - and the Government wants to continue to support that sector.

The importance of public transport and connectivity in rural areas cannot be emphasised strongly enough. In that regard, I acknowledge the tremendous work of Alan O'Connell, manager of Kerry Local Link, and his staff. As a councillor, I called a number of years ago for a hop-on, hop-off bus service on the Ring of Kerry. Today, thankfully, there are several buses going in both directions but there is a great need for additional routes. The tender process for the Killarney to Mallow route is complete and we await funding.

I will raise three other important routes: Beaufort to Killorglin via Whitefield; Kate Kearney's Cottage at the world-famous tourist attraction, the Gap of Dunloe, to Beaufort village and on to Killarney town; and from Dooks in Glenbeigh to Cromane and on to Killorglin town. Will the Minister ask the Minister for Transport to allocate the necessary funding to the NTA for the Connecting Ireland mobility scheme to allow these important routes to proceed?

The Deputy is right to highlight the opportunity Mallow presents and has presented for some time to HSE south west to provide step-down facilities and other healthcare facilities, particularly to help with the discharge from Mercy and Cork University Hospital. There have been beds there that have been available. I am having a full seminar with HSE south west on 5 February, when I will go through all of that in detail, including making sure all the beds funded are opened on time and in a timely way, as well as making sure all discharge pathways that currently exist are being fully utilised by all model 3 and model 4 hospitals there.

I am supporting a local family in Drogheda in dire straits because of a mind-boggling decision made by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to bring forward an arbitrary deadline of 1 October for parents seeking special class or special school placement for their child in the upcoming academic year. Eight-year-old Alfie has a diagnosis of developmental language disorder and global delay sensory overload which means he cannot deal with change, has issues eating and drinking, needs help with toileting, wets and soils himself regularly and has severe anxiety and stress along with no sense of danger. He has been hospitalised owing to stress responses and mental health difficulties. The challenges he faces have increased since moving to mainstream education and his mam advises that only following hospital admissions in early October did she begin pushing for special class placement and learned of this deadline. They have secured a place in a special class in a different school that would meet Alfie's needs but the application could not be completed without a letter of eligibility from the NCSE. The school closes to applications tomorrow.

I do not like raising individual issues on the floor of the House but, having contacted the local SENO and the NCSE to plead for flexibility in the deadline, I have been told the facility to issue the letter of eligibility has ended. It is completely unacceptable the NCSE's refusal to issue a letter of eligibility will mean Alfie or any other child could not complete an application for a special school placement. For the sake of these vulnerable children, this arbitrary deadline needs to be scrapped.

My office has been inundated with telephone calls from worried carers in receipt of carer's benefit and carer's allowance. A number of them received letters from the Revenue this week and last week telling them they are liable for tax. Does the Minister accept many of these carers were unaware there was a tax payment due or a burden upon them? Will his Department consider exemptions and thresholds for transition and protection of carers affected to ensure they are not penalised. Carers are among the most vulnerable people in our community. The Minister mentioned how big our welfare system is and how big the budget is. I find it entirely unfair people who are giving up and sacrificing and are getting out of the house to get a break for a couple of hours while caring for and committing to their families are receiving worrying letters from Revenue saying they are being audited, owe tax and will be paying tax on their carer's benefit or carer's allowance.

I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue. I am a firm advocate for carers. We in society owe a huge debt for the work they do. That is why the Government is responding through supports and is on a trajectory to abolishing the means test for carer's allowance to demonstrate our support for the sector. The taxation is based on other income people may have received. The Taoiseach has sought a briefing on this. It was raised in the House earlier this week. We can revert to the Deputy in due course.

In December the IDA published its annual results for 2025, stating it has secured a record 323 investment proposals, representing a 38% increase on the previous year, and expected to deliver over 15,000 new jobs. In Wexford last year, Bank of New York Mellon disposed of 310 highly skilled jobs. The workers lost their jobs and the offices are on the market in an IDA business park in Wexford town. This is an ideal opportunity to acquire a really good suite of offices in a building that an IDA company could move into. I urge the Minister to impress upon the IDA to purchase this building and secure employment - perhaps replacement employment for the 310 workers of BNY Mellon who lost their jobs in Wexford.

I thank the Deputy for raising this very important matter. I assure him the IDA is liaising with BNY on the building and a future occupant for it. That will be to the forefront for any building that becomes vacant because of a change in operations, like BNY had in terms of its consolidation. We will do everything we can to get a replacement tenant in it. One of the things I am really driving the IDA on is the dispersement of jobs. We need to see a strong proportion going to regional areas. It has hit 56% or 57% and we hope that will continue throughout the remaining four years of the current strategy.

I raise the horrific case of a peaceful working family in Finglas who suffered the terrible trauma of being petrol bombed out of their home. Their house was destroyed in the arson attack and they just made it out alive because of the brave actions of one of the children, Amanda Uwase, who is in the Gallery today. She went back into the burning home and rescued her younger brothers and sister. Her mother works as a carer and was rescued by the fire services. However, the response from the Government and the State to this terrible attack on peaceful working people in Finglas has been absolutely outrageous in its silence. The family has been left homeless. This is not good enough. Where is the response from the Minister for justice to find the perpetrators, bring them to justice and be tough on such a heinous crime? Is the lack of response because these are disadvantaged communities?

I want to acknowledge Amanda's presence and say how proud of her I am. I saw her report on the news. The work she has done in tertiary education has been exemplary. As an Irish Government Minister, I want to say that she and her family are really welcome in our country. My heart goes out to her on what she has had to experience.

I will say to Amanda that we have an independent justice system in our country. I absolutely assure her that An Garda Síochána will investigate this heinous crime in full and ensure that someone is brought to justice for it. I also acknowledge the huge contribution that people who come from many different countries make in ours. I am very proud of the one in five people working in our economy right now who were not born in Ireland. They make a contribution to our healthcare and hospitality sectors. Many of them keep the cornerstones of our economy together. Amanda, you are very brave. Keep the faith. This country will have your back.

Families in Kildare North are still reporting that their children do not have confirmed secondary school places for September. This is despite the apply to school pilot programme the Minister for education introduced in Celbridge and other locations around the country to provide earlier clarity and reduce duplicate applications. The overlap between towns in Kildare North is delaying offers and leaving parents and, more importantly, sixth class children in complete uncertainty. If this pilot is genuinely producing more robust data, then that information needs to be used to identify where additional capacity is required. This is particularly pertinent to Maynooth Community College, Maynooth Post Primary School and Salesian College Celbridge. I ask the Minister to ask the Department of education and the Minister how the data from the apply to school pilot is being used to ensure that the children still awaiting places in Kildare North receive timely offers and how it will inform capacity planning moving forward.

What specific measures are the Minister's Department and Enterprise Ireland undertaking to ensure that SMEs in Ireland stay up to date with advancements in AI and digital technologies as they grow at a rapid rate? Local enterprise offices, LEOs, have been very good at giving grants to small companies but what I am talking about are mid-range SMEs that would like to get involved with Enterprise Ireland but sometimes struggle to do so. What steps can we take this calendar year and next year as we look forward? These changes in our society are huge. Rapid improvements are being made and we need to get them into our companies to ensure that we stay in touch with technologies and companies from outside Ireland.

I thank Deputy Neville for raising this very important issue and for the work he is doing for the enterprise sector to ensure rewards for enterprise are very much embedded in our economy. A number of offers are currently going through Enterprise Ireland. We have doubled the value of the innovation voucher, which is a huge assistance with tertiary education. It provides for a great deal of the commercialisation of research that can be seen taking place in our economy. The grow digital voucher offers up to €5,000 for smaller businesses. To support them, we also have bespoke schemes offered by Enterprise Ireland for cybersecurity, business consultancy and process innovation. These allow businesses to see how bringing in artificial intelligence can result in greater productivity and, critically, allow workers to work on other areas, focusing on growing business and bringing more revenue streams into the economy.

We have seen record growth among Enterprise Ireland companies this year. Exports were worth €36 billion, which is something never heard of before. We want to continue that growth, add 75,000 additional jobs over the next five years and see growth in research, development and innovation, where the tax credit will help. We are aiming to bring approximately €2 billion into the economy through Enterprise Ireland high-value jobs and continued exports. I will work with the Deputy to help companies to start growing in scale through the schemes we have over the coming years.

I will try not to be.

How does the Government justify ploughing ahead next Thursday with a Bill that still allows the counselling notes of victims of sexual assault, rape and child sexual abuse to be accessed in trials despite all it has been told in recent months and years about how damaging and traumatising that is? I refer to the Criminal Law and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2026. This provision should never have been contained in this Bill because it is such an important issue. It has been thrown in with pepper spray, street furniture and a million other things in order to get it passed. On 22 December, the Minister said that he was going to look at further amendments but the Bill has appeared with no further amendments. People are still going to have to choose between therapy and trial. The only change is that, instead of the person waiving their right, it will now be passed over to a judge for a disclosure hearing on whether the counselling notes should be allowed. This does not take away the chilling effect of your notes being accessed. It forces the victim to choose between proceeding with a trial or proceeding with therapy. It is absolutely disgusting that any law that allows this exists. The Government has had ample opportunity to outlaw it completely.

It emerged this morning at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts that there had been a significant overspend on an IT system for SUSI grants, which has now cost almost three times the originally budgeted figure of €2.2 million. The Comptroller and Auditor General drew attention to this at this morning's meeting. The project, titled ""My SUSI"", began in 2015 and by 2024 it had run to €6.4 million, although it is still only at the pre-project phase. What does the Government know about this? What oversight is the Department providing?

I understand this is an historical issue. As far as I am aware, there was a write-down on the project in 2021. Value for taxpayers' money is paramount. The project should deliver. As the Deputy has said, the project is ongoing. It is an important and fundamental system but it must be delivered efficiently in a cost-effective manner. I have asked for a full inquiry and will update the Deputy and the House as that goes on.",https://www.oireachtas.ie/_resources/themes/oireachtas/img/og-hoo-logo.svg,N,,2026-01-16 17:05:06.276895

Maplebear Inc has demonstrated robust financial performance, with a revenue of $3.63 billion and a three-year revenue growth rate of 20.8%. The company's profitability is underscored by a net margin of 14.15% and an operating margin of 15.3%. Additionally, the gross margin stands at an impressive 74.46%, indicating efficient cost management.

Maplebear's balance sheet reflects strong financial health, with a current ratio of 3.64 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.01, suggesting minimal leverage. The company's Altman Z-Score of 6.52 indicates a low risk of financial distress. However, insider activity reveals a warning sign, with 21,495 shares sold in the past three months.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

Maplebear's valuation metrics suggest a relatively attractive entry point. The P/E ratio of 21.87 is close to its three-year low, while the P/S ratio of 3.14 and P/B ratio of 3.06 are near their one-year lows. Analyst sentiment is mixed, with a target price of $50.55 and a recommendation score of 2.4, indicating a moderate buy.

Our approach reimagines a 100-year old process, which helps us deliver lower-cost, more resilient ammonia production regardless of energy source.
Ammobia's novel technology enables economical ammonia production at any scale and proximity to demand – essential as these applications mature.
Radaelli brings decades of experience in process technology innovation and in the ammonia market.
""After 30 years developing and commercialising ammonia technology, I've seen every incremental improvement attempted in this industry,"" said Radaelli.","With the new financing, the team has revealed its plans to build a pilot facility to de-risk its reactor technology and select a customer cohort for commercial demonstrations.

Ammobia’s funding round, which included investors such as Shell Ventures, ALIAD (Air Liquide), MOL Switch (Mitsui OSK Lines), and Chevron Technology Ventures, reflects ongoing interest in the potential for innovation in the global ammonia market. As the second most-produced chemical worldwide, ammonia feeds half the world's population through fertilizers.

However, standard Haber-Bosch production relies on the volatile natural gas supply and requires extreme conditions that favour centralised, capital-intensive facilities. Ammobia’s Haber-Bosch 2.0 leverages novel material science, process design, and commercially available components to improve ammonia’s affordability, transportability, and independence from fossil-fuel-exporting regions, minimising supply shock exposure and enabling long-term energy resilience.

""The ammonia industry is at an inflection point,"" said Karen Baert, CEO and Co-Founder of Ammobia. ""If we want to lower costs and cut emissions in existing ammonia markets – while enabling ammonia’s untapped value in energy and maritime fuel – we need production technology designed for where the world is headed, not where it has been. Our approach reimagines a 100-year old process, which helps us deliver lower-cost, more resilient ammonia production regardless of energy source. Ammobia’s technology that solves for economic pressures and supply chain instability also creates a pathway to deep decarbonisation – meaning we are positioned to serve both the industry's immediate needs and its long-term transformation.""

Ammobia’s proprietary thermochemical synthesis technology brings a suite of advantages to fuel and power sectors, chemical manufacturing, fertilizer producers, and energy storage and transportation ecosystems.

""Ammonia is rapidly emerging as a critical fuel and energy carrier, creating significant new market opportunities,"" commented Tomoaki Ichida, CEO at MOL Switch, the venture capital arm of global shipping company Mitsui OSK Lines. ""Traditional production has served existing markets well, but meeting this growing demand requires a diversified approach. Ammobia's novel technology enables economical ammonia production at any scale and proximity to demand – essential as these applications mature. For MOL, backing a team with the technical expertise to deliver production at half the conventional capex strengthens our ability to decarbonise shipping.""

Ammobia recently added Guido Radaelli to its leadership team, where he is now Chief Engineering Officer. Radaelli brings decades of experience in process technology innovation and in the ammonia market. ""After 30 years developing and commercialising ammonia technology, I've seen every incremental improvement attempted in this industry,"" said Radaelli. ""What Ammobia has achieved isn't incremental – it's a fundamental shift that changes the economics across the value chain.""

The seed round also added Katapult Ocean, AIR Capital, Alumni Ventures, and Motivate Fund to Ammobia’s cap table, with follow-on capital from existing investors such as Starlight Ventures, Collaborative Fund, Arosa Capital and Zero Infinity Partners. Ammobia’s investments now total US$13.5 million, including dilutive and non-dilutive capital.",https://dlgivnpf6gg8w.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/environment-tree-01.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 16:02:33.177131

Payment data and reporting can reveal where there’s room to improve performance and conversion.

For many merchants, this evaluation may surface an uncomfortable reality: The payments foundation that supported yesterday’s success may be limiting tomorrow’s growth.

As merchants plan for what’s ahead in 2026, many are taking a closer look at whether their current payments foundation can keep pace with evolving customer expectations and the accelerating pace of commerce innovation.

Legacy or fragmented payment solutions make it difficult to keep pace, and their limitations become increasingly difficult to ignore. Missing preferred payment methods, inefficient fraud checks or disconnected reporting introduce unnecessary layers of operational complexity and can create friction at the very moment customers are ready to convert.

Adobe’s recent holiday analysis found that 7 in 10 site visits occurred on mobile devices, and buy-now-pay-later orders grew 11% year over year. These shifts underscore the importance of fast, familiar and flexible checkout experiences.

How merchants are simplifying payments to unlock growth

A more modern, unified approach to payments helps merchants move beyond the constraints of outdated or fragmented systems. By consolidating where and how payments are activated, managed and optimized, merchants can reduce operational complexity while creating a more flexible foundation for future innovation.

Payment Services is built directly into Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source, streamlining how payments are implemented across the shopper journey and reducing the resource demands typically associated with adding new payment methods.

Beyond simplifying the implementation of current and future payment innovations, a cohesive payments experience can also drive meaningful operational efficiency. When finance, e-commerce and customer experience teams share a single view of payment activity, they spend less time reconciling data and can respond more quickly to issues or opportunities as they arise.

ParkingZone, a parking supply company in the United States, streamlined its workflows after consolidating its payment processes through Payment Services for Magento Open Source.

By shifting to a single dashboard, ParkingZone saves five to six hours each week. The centralized view also improved how transactions are reviewed, making it easier to distinguish legitimate activity from suspicious attempts. Since adopting Payment Services, fraudulent transaction flags have decreased by 47%, which helps protect revenue and creates a smoother experience for the business and its customers.

Nite Ize, a manufacturer of outdoor and mobile accessories, saw similar efficiencies. After implementing Payment Services for Adobe Commerce, the company quickly added digital wallets such as Apple Pay and PayPal to its product pages. Customer response was immediate, showing how readily shoppers adopt familiar payment options when they encounter them within the purchase journey. Nearly 50% of credit card payments shifted to these faster, more convenient options.

“When customers find a Nite Ize product they love, they want to buy it instantly, not fill out forms and enter credit card information,” said Brian Lambert, e-commerce and digital manager at Nite Ize.

Together, these examples illustrate how modernizing payments is about creating a simpler, more resilient payments foundation — one that supports growth today while making it easier to adapt as customer expectations and commerce innovation continue to evolve.

Building resilience and growth into 2026

Merchants that modernize and adopt a unified payments solution gain benefits that extend well beyond the payment methods they offer. Beyond enabling new options at checkout, staying current reduces the long-term cost of operational complexity and builds a foundation that can adapt as commerce evolves.

That adaptability will matter throughout 2026, as competition remains strong and customer expectations continue to rise. Even incremental improvements at checkout can create a measurable impact. Research from Adobe and PYMNTS shows that 97% of merchants with annual revenues under $25 million saw e-commerce sales improve after expanding their payment options. For merchants of all sizes, simplifying how customers pay has become a reliable way to strengthen loyalty and support long-term growth.

Payments may appear at the final step of the shopper journey, but they touch every part of the business. When merchants treat payments as a strategic capability, rather than a background utility, they gain clearer insight, faster decision-making and greater confidence to test and evolve. It’s an approach that positions merchants to enter 2026 with more control, greater resilience and a stronger path to growth across every channel.",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/01/lucrative-gaming-static-MR-1.webp,N,,2026-01-16 14:03:01.801670

They will need no supporting structures. Dutch 3D printing R&D start-up MX3D has invented a 3D printing technique whereby multi-axis industrial robots are able to print strong, complex structures anywhere without needing a print bed, IB Times writes in a report.

The material used is a metal that melts and then solidifies within seconds, fast enough for it not to fall down into the water.

Aided by the geometry of the overall bridge design, the material is able to print horizontally without bending.

""We start with a piece of metal attached to the canal bank. The robots start from one side of the canal, they print their own support structure, so essentially it prints its own bridge. It stands on the floor of the bridge, 3D prints out more and keeps moving"", MX3D’s CTO Tim Geurtjens told IB Times.

""We have the same physics as everyone else, but it looks like it’s gravity-defying. We put a drop of metal, drop by drop at a time and it solidifies. But you could also print tubes, and then print layer over layer of tubes"", adds Geurtjens.

The 3D printed bridge project is a collaboration between MX3D, designer Joris Laarman, Autodesk, construction firm Heijmans and several other partners, including French welding specialists Air Liquide.

Geurtjens says MX3D's software could change the future of robotics. He said: ""Our software translates CAD model software into welding strategies, and then translates that into the Rapid software used by ABB to tell the robot how to move"".

This target represents a 35% upside from the current price of $88.84, aligning with the broader analyst consensus of ""Strong Buy"" and targets ranging from $99 to $140, according to InvestingPro data.

The research firm believes the PEN acquisition will strengthen Boston Scientific’s durability and support its double-digit revenue and EPS growth profile over the mid to long term, despite acknowledging that the narrative on BSX heading into 2026 is more complex compared to the past two years. The company has demonstrated impressive 21.6% revenue growth in the last twelve months and maintains a healthy PEG ratio of 0.87, suggesting reasonable valuation relative to growth expectations.

Truist noted some timing considerations around the deal, as it comes while Boston Scientific’s electrophysiology growth is slowing and ahead of the CHAMPION catalyst, which carries some binary risk.

The firm expects Boston Scientific’s narrative to gradually become more positive following fourth-quarter results and the CHAMPION readout, with additional growth drivers coming into focus in the second half of 2026 and beyond.

Boston Scientific, a medical device manufacturer, continues to expand its portfolio through strategic acquisitions like Penumbra to maintain its growth trajectory in the medical technology sector.

In other recent news, Boston Scientific has announced a definitive agreement to acquire Penumbra for approximately $14.5 billion. This acquisition is structured as a cash and stock transaction, with Penumbra stockholders having the option to receive either cash or Boston Scientific shares. Analysts from Needham have maintained a Buy rating for Boston Scientific, emphasizing the strategic fit of the acquisition in the mechanical thrombectomy and embolic device market. Morgan Stanley also views the acquisition positively, noting projected synergies of $200 million by the third year, which could enhance sales and reduce administrative costs.

Stifel analysts have praised the acquisition for expanding Boston Scientific’s product offerings in the neuro and peripheral venous markets. In a separate development, Boston Scientific is set to acquire Valencia Technologies, a company specializing in treatments for bladder dysfunction. This acquisition will integrate Valencia’s FDA-approved eCoin System into Boston Scientific’s urology portfolio. These strategic moves indicate Boston Scientific’s efforts to strengthen its market presence and diversify its product offerings.

I'm a little, I would say one part I'm surprised because Kat did phenomenal work at Walmart International.

But then I'm not surprised because when you have ever you have a new CEO come in like John Furner taking over Doug Millan, they all want to put their own leaders in, they all want to put their stamps on the all business, but I am surprised by this one.

Brian, what I will say is I've had the chance to chat with Kath McLay a a quite a few times. She is an incredible executive.

She came to the company just a few years ago. She joined as Sam's Club CEO. She went on to lead Walmart International and in in my opinion, as bad as it is to say, I think that this this is a big loss for Walmart moving forward.

But under John Furner, I know that this morning, Kath McLe the news came out last night that she was departing Walmart effective quite soon. and this morning they announced new C suite executive change-ups. Of course, as you just noted,

a similar path to what Kath had gone. The former, or rather current CEO of Sam's Club will move into Walmart International. Also also worth noting that the gentleman David Gugina, who oversaw e-commerce for Walmart US, will now move into the US CEO role for Walmart, overseeing all store operations, all retail operations for Walmart.

So a similar, uh, you know, journey to John Furner. Uh, David really has led the momentum behind the e-commerce growth that you've seen for Walmart over the past few years. And so, I'm really eager to see how David takes on this role overseeing the the US operations for Walmart moving forward, especially in this environment where convenience, uh, really matters as well as value for the US consumer. and I'm extremely eager to see where Cath goes next. I I I think very highly of her.

For decades, grocers—especially regional and multi-regional options—served as the natural starting point of the shopping journey. Even as e-commerce grew, and marketplaces like Instacart inserted themselves between the shopper and the store, the customer still began with the grocer. The grocer's identity and what it stood for— ""I shop at H-E-B, not X"" or ""I shop at Publix, not Y""—still mattered in the customer's mind, even when the transaction flowed through an intermediary.

That era is ending. The introduction of Instacart checkout inside ChatGPT signals the emergence of a new hierarchy. For the first time, shoppers can start the journey somewhere else: They simply initiate a conversation about their purpose for shopping, e.g., ""I want to make apple pie,"" and everything that follows takes place without the grocer entering the conversation.

What Instacart tried to disintermediate, AI will displace.

This white paper explores what this shift means for grocery, the lessons from industries that have already been disrupted, and the strategic moves required for regional players to preserve their relevance. While the disruption will unfold gradually, the stakes are immediate. When AI becomes the starting point of the customer journey, power moves upstream and grocers that fail to assert themselves risk becoming invisible in their own category.

India tariff impact: India remains one of the few major economies without a trade deal with Washington, despite facing a 50% tariff rate — among the highest in the world. The levies have dealt a heavy blow to India’s labour-intensive sectors, especially textiles, handicrafts, apparels, gems and leather.

India’s recent spate of signed and proposed free-trade agreements may not be sufficient to offset the impact of US tariffs on the South Asian country’s exports, economists at Barclays Plc said.

“While the FTA spree certainly bodes well for making international trade more seamless, it may not necessarily result in higher exports large enough to offset the US tariff-inflicted pain,” Barclays economists Aastha Gudwani and Amruta Ghare wrote in a report on Friday.

India remains one of the few major economies without a trade deal with Washington, despite facing a 50% tariff rate — among the highest in the world. The levies have dealt a heavy blow to India’s labour-intensive sectors, especially textiles, handicrafts, apparels, gems and leather. The US is India’s largest overseas market, accounting for 19.3% of total exports before the tariffs were imposed.

The lack of certainty on the trade deal has pressured the rupee and forced New Delhi to dole out $5 billion to protect Indian exporters. It has also sharpened India’s focus on trade negotiations with partners including the European Union, as it seeks to shed a protectionist image by lowering trade and non-tariff barriers long bemoaned by investors.

Still, many of the newer agreements — including those signed with Oman and New Zealand last year — are unlikely to deliver a major boost to India’s exports, given relatively small trade volumes.

“The sheer scale of things doesn’t add up,” Barclays economists said. “For example, in case of electrical machinery, after the US, the three large trading partners are UAE, Netherlands and the UK. But these three cumulatively do not make up for the market size that the US offers.”

They added that of India’s top 20 export markets, it has free trade agreements or is actively negotiating such deals with 16 countries — including the US — and those markets together account for 51% of total trade.

“The real test lies in translating these agreements into tangible export growth,” including whether they strengthen India’s industrial base, Barclays said.

About 70% of India’s exports to the US face “serious threat” if the 50% tariffs persist, according to the report. Sectors such as leather and apparel, gems and jewelery, home furnishings and marine exports would bear the brunt.

The expected India–EU FTA would be a “big step towards export diversification and greater trade openness with a large bloc,” the economists said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President António Luís Santos da Costa are set to visit India later this month, raising expectations that the two sides could move closer to signing an agreement after years of negotiations.

The digital consultation tool, available on tablets and smartphones, helps plastic surgeons personalize planning for patients. It enables the vizualization of potential outcomes during breast augmentation consultations.

According to Johnson & Johnson, most plastic surgeons still use physical sizers and before-and-after galleries to guide conversations about outcomes when it comes to breast procedures. J&J’s Arbrea Breast Simulator Surgeon App for Mentor helps to deliver a personalized 3D simulation in about 60 seconds.

The company says the process enhances clinical discussions in real time and helps patients visualize how different options could look.

Johnson & Johnson said a recent study underscored the need for solutions that better help patients visualize outcomes during consultations. Published in Aesthetic Surgery Journal Open Forum, the study found that, while 68.4% of women surveyed considered the procedure, only 17.5% underwent the procedure. Just 7.2% of those consulted proceeded to surgery.

Two separate studies showed the positive impact of the Abrea app on the consultation experience, the company said. In one study, patients rated the app 3.4 out of 4 for how closely it matched their final surgical result. In another, clinics reported conversion rates that reached as high as 87% for consultations using the app.

“The Arbrea Breast Simulator Surgeon App for Mentor gives surgeons an easy-to use digital tool that helps transform their augmentation consultations into clear, patient-centered conversations,” said Alenka Brzulja, worldwide president, Aesthetics & Reconstruction, MedTech, Johnson & Johnson. “Many women spend months or even years considering breast augmentation. By allowing them to visualize potential outcomes in seconds, this app brings clarity to the decision-making process, supports a more confident, personal choice, and has been shown to help patients feel ready to make decisions more quickly.”",https://www.massdevice.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Johnson-Johnson-MedTech-Updated-Logo-770x500-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 13:03:52.402199

Mounting Competitive and Strategic Pressures The primary source of current pessimism stems from doubts surrounding Adobe's AI strategy.
The pure AI revenue figure of approximately $250 million appears modest relative to the corporation's overall scale.
The path forward for Adobe hinges on demonstrating tangible, AI-driven growth to restore Wall Street's faith.","Adobe finds itself navigating a significant crisis of confidence, with its stock price plunging to lows not seen since November 2022. A confluence of analyst downgrades and mounting skepticism over its artificial intelligence roadmap has placed substantial pressure on the software giant's equity. As competitive threats intensify, investors are questioning whether the company can regain its footing.

Despite the prevailing negative outlook, Adobe's underlying business performance remains robust. The company's most recent fourth-quarter results exceeded expectations, reporting earnings per share of $5.50. Its operational margin continues to demonstrate impressive strength at 46%. Furthermore, the valuation has contracted significantly, with the stock now trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of approximately 18.5—its most attractive level in years.

However, a low valuation alone is failing to serve as a compelling buy thesis for market participants. Analysts argue that for a sustained recovery to take hold, Adobe must provide concrete evidence that its AI initiatives are materially accelerating revenue growth. The upcoming Summit Conference in April is viewed as a critical event for the company to address these concerns. Until then, the stock, which closed yesterday at $304.09, is expected to remain under a microscope.

A Wave of Analyst Downgrades

The opening weeks of 2026 have proven disappointing for Adobe shareholders. Several major investment banks have concurrently revised their ratings downward. Goldman Sachs initiated coverage with a sell recommendation, attaching a price target of just $290. Oppenheimer also downgraded the stock, citing eroding confidence in the company's leadership. This trend was followed by Jefferies and BMO Capital Markets, both of which slashed their price targets substantially.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Adobe?

The consensus among experts is clear: market sentiment has shifted decisively. Baird analyst Rob Oliver captured the mood starkly, observing that even seemingly inexpensive software stocks can remain cheap for an extended period when investor morale is severely depressed.

Mounting Competitive and Strategic Pressures

The primary source of current pessimism stems from doubts surrounding Adobe's AI strategy. While management emphasizes that one-third of its annual recurring revenue is already influenced by AI, analysts see a lack of proof that this is translating into accelerated growth. The pure AI revenue figure of approximately $250 million appears modest relative to the corporation's overall scale.

Simultaneously, competitive pressures are escalating on two fronts. In the entry-level segment catering to students and freelancers, the platform Canva is gaining substantial market share. Additionally, Apple is challenging the premium segment with a competitively priced suite of creative applications. The concern is not an immediate loss of market leadership in the enterprise sector, but rather a gradual fragmentation of the price-sensitive mass market.

PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) stock rose 2.8% after the lender’s profit jumped 25% in the fourth quarter, as the U.S. bank earned more from interest payments and cashed in on a dealmaking rebound.

Regions Financial (NYSE:RF) stock dropped 1.9% after the lender reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings that fell short of expectations, despite posting revenue growth and solid full-year performance.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) stock gained 1%, adding to the previous session’s gains after the world’s largest contract chipmaker posted stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter net profit and said demand from the AI industry remained strong.

Novo Nordisk (CSE:NOVOb) stock gained 4.3% after the U.K. regulator approved a maximum dose of up to 7.2 milligrams per week of the drugmaker’s weight-loss drug Wegovy for patients with obesity.

JB Hunt Transport Services (NASDAQ:JBHT) stock slumped 4.1% after the logistics company reported mixed fourth quarter results, with revenue declining from the previous year.

Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) stock fell 1% after Morgan Stanley downgraded its stance on the food and beverage company to “underweight” from “equal-weight”, saying it faces significant exposure to emerging competitive pressures that threaten its topline and margin recovery prospects.

MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) stock dropped 2% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the casino operator to “underweight” from “equal-weight”, citing challenged Las Vegas trends after the first quarter amid a ""reversion to the mean"" on demand.

Not “I dabble now and then” paid-up, but full-fat, all-you-can-eat access to the entire Adobe Creative Cloud Pro suite.
I didn’t want to break years of Adobe workflows overnight, or risk mangling countless Photoshop and InDesign files I still rely on.
Out of the 24 applications bundled into my Adobe Creative Cloud Pro plan, I was regularly using just three.
So I clicked “Change Plan,” fully expecting a minor saving.","For years, I was a fully paid-up Adobe pro. Not “I dabble now and then” paid-up, but full-fat, all-you-can-eat access to the entire Adobe Creative Cloud Pro suite. Twenty-four apps. Every tool. The lot. And for a long time, I did what many of us do: I rode the wave of discounts, retention deals, and loyalty pricing, convincing myself that I was beating the system.

Then reality landed with a thud!

Come April, when my deal expired, my monthly bill was set to jump to a massive 66.49 a month. That’s 797.88 a year, and at that point, I refused. No software – no matter how industry-standard, clever, or entrenched – gets a free pass at nearly eight hundred a year just because it always has.

Now, I could have gone nuclear. I’ve already started seriously considering Affinity as a long-term alternative for photo editing, and frankly, the value proposition is very hard to ignore. I also briefly considered “acquiring” the software from a corner of the internet populated by people with parrots, eye patches, and questionable morals – but as tempting as that moment was, I do actually like some of the newer features Adobe has been rolling out, and I prefer my karma, and my files intact.

The bigger issue was continuity. I didn’t want to break years of Adobe workflows overnight, or risk mangling countless Photoshop and InDesign files I still rely on. So instead of burning the house down, I did something far more effective: I opened my account and actually looked at what I was paying for. That’s when the penny dropped!

Out of the 24 applications bundled into my Adobe Creative Cloud Pro plan, I was regularly using just three. Photoshop, every single day, across both my laptop and desktop. Lightroom, almost exclusively on my phone for image editing on the move. And InDesign for flyers, posters, birthday cards, and assorted print work – because once a journalist, always a journalist.

Everything else? Untouched. Forgotten. Digital dust. So I clicked “Change Plan,” fully expecting a minor saving. What I didn’t expect was daylight robbery – in my favour. I ditched the all-singing Pro bundle, opted for the Photography Plan (which neatly covers Photoshop and Lightroom), and then added InDesign as a standalone app. That was it.

No phone calls. No arguments. No “Are you sure?” guilt-tripping. And just like that, I’d slashed my Adobe bill by 503 a year – 24.53 a month. Yes, 41.96 a month for three apps is still a chunk of change, and if you want to go fully free or low-cost, there are absolutely other routes you can take. But for my workflow, this was the sweet spot.

The cherry on top? Because I made this change mid-billing cycle, Adobe actually refunded me 22 dollars. So effectively, I got InDesign for free for a month – something I never thought I’d see in my lifetime.

The lesson here isn’t “Ditch Adobe at all costs.” It’s this: stop paying for software out of habit. Subscription creep is real, and Adobe is banking – literally – on you not checking what you actually use. Cull the apps you don’t touch, downgrade without guilt, and take back control of your monthly outgoings.

If you’re looking for a sign to save some serious dosh, this is it. Go and look at your Adobe subscriptions. You might be shocked at just how much money you’re setting fire to every year!",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qoCP4gBk4dBxBWTrhxGc8A-1339-80.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 09:02:12.528168

Music and live experiences are powerful passion points for this generation, and Lollapalooza India sits at that intersection,” she said.
Advt Nivea is participating at Lollapalooza India for the first time in 2026, marking its first-ever association with a music festival in India.

Fashion retailer H&M is returning to Lollapalooza India in 2026 for its second consecutive year.","Live music has emerged as one of the fastest-growing segments of India’s entertainment economy, shedding its earlier niche status to become a mainstream cultural and commercial force. PwC’s Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2025–29 estimates the market expanded more than fivefold from USD 29 million in 2020 to USD 149 million in 2024, with revenues expected to climb to USD 164 million by 2029 as large-format festivals, international tours and digitally native audiences scale the business.

That shift is evident in the demand for marquee events. Tickets for Lollapalooza India 2026 were snapped up within minutes, underlining the festival’s growing pull among young consumers. Scheduled to return to Mumbai’s Mahalaxmi Racecourse on 24-25 January, the event will feature the India debuts of Linkin Park and Playboi Carti, alongside a multi-genre line-up spread across four stages.

With ticket prices ranging from INR 5,999 to INR 47,999 and a sell-out achieved months in advance, Lollapalooza India reflects the rise of experience-led, destination-focused music consumption.

The festival made its India debut in January 2023 in Mumbai through BookMyShow Live, marking its first entry into Asia. While core sponsorship categories in India broadly mirror the US, beverages, fashion, travel, payments and technology, the local edition emphasises experiential and culture-led activations, with brands integrating wellness, beauty, fashion and digital storytelling tailored to young audiences.

Launched in the US in 1991 by musician Perry Farrell as a touring alternative rock festival, Lollapalooza evolved into a destination-format event in Chicago in 2005 and has since expanded globally across Latin America and Europe. In the US, sponsors such as Bud Light, Coca-Cola, T-Mobile, Toyota, Chase, Airbnb, Hulu, Dunkin’, Kraft Heinz, Ulta Beauty and Hollister activate at scale through stages, lounges and city-wide experiences, reflecting a mature sponsorship ecosystem.

From media exposure to cultural participation

For brands, the rise of live music has shifted marketing strategies. Lollapalooza is now valued not just for sponsorship but as a platform for cultural engagement and lasting connections. Traditional media and digital campaigns still offer reach, but Gen Z and millennials who make up most festival-goers prefer interactive, participatory experiences over one-way messaging.

Geetika Mehta, managing director, Nivea India, said the shift reflects a change in how younger consumers relate to brands. “Younger consumers do not want to be marketed to. They want brands to be part of their culture and passion points. Music and live experiences are powerful passion points for this generation, and Lollapalooza India sits at that intersection,” she said.

Advt

Nivea is participating at Lollapalooza India for the first time in 2026, marking its first-ever association with a music festival in India. Mehta said the relevance of skincare at a festival is contextual rather than constructed. “When you are at a music festival–sun, sweat, long hours outdoors, skincare becomes genuinely relevant. We are not forcing our way in; we are meeting a real need within a cultural context that already matters to them,” she said.

The growing pull of festivals is also reshaping travel behaviour around live music.

Amanpreet Bajaj, country head for India and Southeast Asia at Airbnb, said music-led travel is increasingly influencing how young Indians plan trips. “Music has quickly become one of the most powerful cultural forces shaping how young Indians travel today. We are seeing a clear shift away from calendar-led trips towards experience-led journeys, where live concerts and festivals act as gateways to discovering new cities, neighbourhoods and communities,” he said.

Advt

According to Bajaj, Gen Z audiences are increasingly drawn to travel that allows them to participate in cultural moments rather than simply attend events. “For Gen Z, travel is about being part of a cultural moment and engaging more deeply with a destination,” he said.

Airbnb has partnered with Lollapalooza India to curate artist-led and city-based experiences with actor Siddhant Chaturvedi, including behind-the-scenes access, intimate sessions with musicians Ankur Tewari, OAFF and Savera, and a walkthrough led by festival director Raashi Sanghvi. Bajaj said the impact of concert-led travel extends beyond accommodation. “Concert-led travel often brings groups of friends together, encourages longer stays and supports local cafés, cultural spaces and neighbourhood businesses,” he said, adding that the experiences are designed to deepen participation and encourage exploration beyond the festival venue.

According to Varun Koorichh, vice-president marketing and portfolio head – premium and luxury, Diageo India, audiences today value not only the line-up but also the atmosphere, social connection and the ‘in-between’ moments that festivals create. “These environments have evolved from entertainment destinations into cultural milestones,” he said. “Live events create spaces where people are open, emotionally engaged and seeking discovery, allowing brands to demonstrate craft and quality through experiences that feel earned.”

Designing engagement in a fragmented attention economy

Festivals present a challenge that conventional media does not. Attention is fragmented across multiple stages, social interactions, food zones and content creation. Brands that fail to offer immediate value are ignored.

Beer brand Budweiser, owned by AB InBev, is returning to Lollapalooza India again in 2026 after participating in previous editions. Vineet Sharma, vice president, marketing & trade marketing, AB InBev India, said the festival occupies a distinct cultural position. “While traditional media provides reach and digital platforms drive frequency, they lack the visceral impact of a lived experience. We view Lollapalooza as a platform for emotional currency,” he said.

According to Sharma, the brand’s role has shifted from visibility to cultural integration. “We are not just present there; we are shaping youth culture. When a brand integrates with the right intent, it becomes part of the consumer’s personal festival narrative,” he said.

Budweiser’s Brew District has evolved into a utility-led zone combining grooming stations, viewing decks and curated food pairings with music programming through the BUDX platform. Sharma said passive branding no longer works in a festival environment. “At a festival of this scale, passive visibility is insufficient. We focus on immersive ecosystems that put the fan experience at the centre,” he said.

Mehta added Nivea’s focus was on participation rather than presence. “You have to give people something worth stopping for. This generation values self-expression and rejects one-size-fits-all,” she said. The brand’s activation includes a personalised music experience built around the “Baddie But Softie” theme, where attendees answer a few questions to generate a customised song reflecting their festival persona. On-ground elements extend into personalised photo booths, face painting and charm stations.

Fashion retailer H&M is returning to Lollapalooza India in 2026 for its second consecutive year. Amit Kothari, head of marketing, H&M India, said the festival aligns naturally with how younger audiences experience fashion. “Music festivals create a shared cultural moment where audiences actively participate rather than passively consume. Brands are most relevant when they show up in spaces that feel authentic and experiential,” he said.

At Lollapalooza India 2025, H&M introduced an interactive runway that allowed festival-goers to step into the fashion experience, alongside personalised album cover creation linking music and style. In 2026, the brand has expanded its footprint with a dedicated H&M Beauty experience zone and curated backstage performances.

Measuring impact beyond the festival weekend

Large-format festival partnerships involve multi-crore investments, prompting brands to rethink how success is measured. According to industry sources, lead sponsorships at Lollapalooza India typically range between INR 2 crore and INR 3 crore, while secondary brand associations cost between INR 50 lakh and INR 1.5 crore, depending on placement and scale of activation. These investments extend beyond visibility, covering experiential build-outs, content creation and post-event amplification.

Sharma said Budweiser evaluates the festival as a long-term asset. “We treat Lollapalooza as a strategic investment, not a tactical weekend play. We track shifts in brand equity, attributes and sentiment post-event. The real value is when a consumer chooses the brand weeks later because of a connection made at the festival,” he said.

Mehta said Nivea entered its first festival partnership with similar expectations. “Immediate sales lift is not the primary metric. We are building long-term equity with a generation that has choices and expects relevance,” she said. For H&M, Kothari said success is assessed through a mix of brand consideration, engagement, member recruitment and qualitative feedback gathered through post-event surveys.

Koorichh said Diageo assesses impact through both tangible and emotional metrics, including dwell time, participation, organic content creation, brand recall, trial-to-purchase ratios and post-festival performance across on-trade and off-trade channels. He added that each brand in Diageo’s portfolio plays a distinct role, from large-scale discovery and trial to digital storytelling and art-led inclusivity initiatives designed to sustain engagement beyond the event.

The impact of festivals is increasingly extending beyond brand metrics. As cited in the PwC report, event tourism is rising, with half a million fans travelling for concerts in 2024 and VIP ticketing recording triple-digit growth. Large-scale events are also driving spending in hospitality, transport, retail, and employment. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) recognises India’s live events economy as a strategic cultural and economic asset, with policy support for infrastructure upgrades and public-private partnerships.

(PCNA) today announced U.S. retail deliveries of 76,219 vehicles in 2025, surpassing the previous record of 76,167 vehicles in 2024. Despite an evolving market, this marks the strongest sales year in PCNA’s history.

New car sales were not the only record set in 2025. Porsche Approved Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) sales reached a new high of 48,092 units. This represents an 11 percent increase over 2024, and underscores continued demand across the brand.

""Driven by the loyalty and enthusiasm of our customers for the incredible cars we offer, we have achieved stability and even growth to set a new record in a market that experienced profound change in 2025,” said Timo Resch, President and CEO of PCNA. ‟We are grateful to every Porsche Center and everyone at PCNA for striving to exceed the expectations of our customers – an approach we will take with us into 2026, as we look forward to exciting new cars reaching U.S. roads for the first time. These will include the mighty new 911 Turbo S and the Cayenne Electric – which joins the existing gas and Hybrid models on-sale today.”

The Macan led the sales results, achieving its best year to date with 27,139 units sold, driven by strong demand for both its internal combustion and electric variants – while the Cayenne followed with 20,314 deliveries.

Two-door sports cars maintained healthy demand, with 911 sales totaling 13,574 units and the 718 reaching 6,399 units as production neared its end. Notably, December was the strongest month ever for 911 deliveries.

Panamera deliveries rose 16.8 percent year-over year with sales totaling 4,651.

The Taycan model line accounted for 4,142 deliveries in 2025.

ID8,BNY Mellon,2026-01-16 11:16:24+00:00,Global Finance Magazine,Building The Tokenized Future | Global Finance Magazine,Gilly Wright,,,,,https://gfmag.com/technology/building-the-tokenized-future/,"Goldman Sachs has focused on derivatives, trading, and platform creation via its GS DAP (Digital Asset Platform) for digital bond issuance, which it plans to spin out into an industry utility.
Citi Integrated Digital Assets Platform (CIDAP), for example, enables firm-wide development and testing of use cases and capabilities across digital assets while meeting institutional-grade security and compliance needs.

The lack of a verified identity layer, by contrast, has been a primary barrier to widespread digital asset adoption.","Global banks are bringing traditional and decentralized finance together as they race to devise the plumbing of a new financial system.

The world of finance is de-bifurcating. On one side stands the bedrock of TradFi (traditional finance): established security and compliance. On the other, the velocity of DeFi (decentralized finance): 24/7 efficiency and programmable money. The question is when these two worlds will merge, not if.

Banks are racing to bring them together, driven by a powerful trifecta: maturing technology, a clearer regulatory landscape, and most critically, a roar of sustained client demand. The strategy for bridging the gap is clear: build the foundational infrastructure, secure the assets via custody, and develop compelling institutional trading products.

As they do so, global banks including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, and Societe Generale are laying the foundational plumbing for a new financial system, leveraging blockchains to move money and assets for greater speed and lower cost. Each is adopting a slightly different strategic focus.

Different Banks, Different Playbooks

JPMorgan, through its Kinexys platform, uses a private distributed ledger for high-volume, cross-border payments tokenized as JPM Coin, focusing on 24/7 programmability and integrating digital identity for compliance: an internal, tokenized settlement rail for wholesale banking.

Goldman Sachs has focused on derivatives, trading, and platform creation via its GS DAP (Digital Asset Platform) for digital bond issuance, which it plans to spin out into an industry utility.

HSBC and Societe Generale are bridging TradFi and digital formats. HSBC’s Orion platform tokenizes real-world assets (RWA) like gold and bonds, creating a “digital vault” for asset management and fractionalized trading. SG-FORGE by Societe Generale connects to public blockchains, notably by issuing the EU-compliant stablecoin, EUR CoinVertible (EURCV). Making EURCV available on external crypto exchanges creates a direct, interoperable settlement pipe linking DeFi liquidity with regulated interbank settlements.

These initiatives collectively digitize core banking functions, constructing the tokenization infrastructure for what their devisers hope will be the future of finance. Integrated tokenization platforms that marry the security of TradFi with the efficiency of digital ledger technology can make banking safer, faster, and programmable, they argue.

Citi Integrated Digital Assets Platform (CIDAP), for example, enables firm-wide development and testing of use cases and capabilities across digital assets while meeting institutional-grade security and compliance needs. Built on an internal, blockchain-agnostic infrastructure, CIDAP bridges traditional applications and blockchains. By offering digital asset services directly via traditional client integration channels, it eliminates the need for clients to manage complex blockchain technologies.

Citi Services’ digital assets strategy is always driven by two “North Stars”: meeting client needs and ensuring safety and soundness, says Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of Partnerships and Innovation, Services. “The shift to digital assets is fundamentally a response to evolving commercial models and the desire for 24/7 financial support,” he explains.

While Citi is building internal infrastructure to upgrade its internal banking rails, Standard Chartered has built standalone companies to service the open crypto market. Institutional clients want access to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin via a trusted banking partner, says René Michau, global head of Digital Assets: “This preference is often rooted in fiduciary requirements or internal policies that steer them away from unregulated crypto exchanges.”

Standard Chartered’s digital asset solutions, leveraging capabilities built by Zodia Custody, are deployed in response to identified client requirements, adds Margaret Harwood-Jones, global head, Financing and Securities Services: “For us, client-sector knowledge, a comprehensive business understanding, and proven expertise in today’s post-trade space remain fundamental building blocks in developing the right product propositions.”

In addition to solving problems for clients, digital assets can create new revenue streams.

Standard Chartered is excited about the tokenization of money market funds, citing a successful collaboration with China Asset Management to increase distribution to retail clients in Hong Kong. This not only drives new revenue, says Harwood-Jones, but it increases liquidity, offers opportunities for managing collateral quicker, and promotes financial inclusion.

Bank-Grade Digital Money

Stablecoins and tokenized deposits are emerging as foundational elements for instantaneous settlement.

Strong client adoption has greeted Citi’s launch of tokenized deposits via Citi Token Services, Chatterjee reports. Citi Token Services for Cash uses interbranch tokenized deposits to enable real-time, 24/7 instant payments, significantly enhancing liquidity management. Further demonstrating its momentum, Citi announced in November that the platform is integrating euro transactions and expanding its footprint to Dublin, enabling clients to transfer both US dollars and euros globally.

Thanks to developments such as these, an increasing volume of capital market flows incorporate blockchain-based settlement, crypto investment, and the tokenization of funds, says Amit Agarwal, head of Custody, Citi Investor Services. Banks like Citi are finding their opportunity in the continuing necessity of a trusted, central provider to safeguard these emerging assets.

“Our clients consistently express a desire for the same bank-grade security, safety, and compliance they currently experience when dealing with traditional assets,” says Agarwal. “Therefore, as the digital asset space expands, the requirement is to maintain this identical standard of safety and security.”

A central issue in the DeFi revolution is how to build trust and ensure compliance in a new, borderless ecosystem. Standard Chartered’s brokerage model for crypto trading provides clients with regulated access, Michau notes; a bank-facing solution offers a specific, regulated risk profile, which differentiates it from an unregulated crypto exchange.

The lack of a verified identity layer, by contrast, has been a primary barrier to widespread digital asset adoption.

The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) addresses this concern with its Verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI), which makes identity and credentials portable across multiple infrastructures, creating a “trust anchor” to verify legal person identification, says Alexandre Kech, CEO of GLEIF. Solving “verification of identity” is key to enabling mass tokenization, he argues, because it allows the ecosystem to confirm details like “is an accredited investor” in real-time, moving away from heavy upfront processes.

Adding the ‘Trust Layer’

The need for trust extends to the assets themselves. Kech highlights the risk of fake tokens and copycats like the phony JPM coin that appeared hours after the real one was issued, underscoring the need for smart contracts that can reliably link a token to its legitimate issuer: a capability that can be developed within platforms like CIDAP.

As the world’s leading custody bank, BNY Mellon aims to serve as the “trust layer” for the evolving digital economy; its core strategy is to provide an agnostic platform for all assets, digital and traditional alike, by offering secure safekeeping and administration. Citi, likewise, expects to launch a dedicated digital assets custody capability this year, starting with crypto assets and validated by a recent successful live pilot transaction involving secure custody of Ethereum tokens.

DBS, meanwhile, operates a proprietary DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx), offering trading, custody, and tokenization services to accredited investors and aims on expanding its DBS Token Services for programmable payments to institutional treasuries.

The integration of TradFi and DeFi is not a distant goal but a present reality, catalyzed by sustained client demand for 24/7 efficiency and institutional-grade security. As major institutions move beyond experimentation to build robust, interoperable infrastructure and tokenization platforms, they are positioning themselves not merely as participants, but as the architects of a tokenized future that is both safe and accessible.",https://s44650.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tokenization-scaled.png,N,,2026-01-16 06:59:43.527161

In a significant move to fortify the cyber defenses of Europe’s key institutions, a consortium including Capgemini, Airbus Protect, PwC, and Nviso has been selected to handle cybersecurity across 71 European institutions, bodies, and agencies. This partnership marks a strategic step in securing digital infrastructure against evolving cyber threats.

Scope and Duration of the Partnership

The contract awarded, known as the MC17 FREIA Cyber Framework Contract, represents one of the European Commission’s pivotal initiatives for digital protection. Encompassing an extensive range of cybersecurity services, the contract is valued at several million euros and extends over a four-year period, giving ample time to implement comprehensive security measures.

Comprehensive Cybersecurity Coverage

The appointed consortium covers all three critical segments of the cybersecurity framework:

Incident Management: Handling and responding effectively to cyber incidents as they arise.

Governance and Risk: Steering institutional policies to mitigate risks and maintain compliance.

Training and Technical Expertise: Enhancing skills and knowledge across all involved entities to stay ahead of threats.

By spanning the entire cybersecurity value chain—from preventative strategies to active incident response and upskilling—these efforts ensure a holistic defense posture.

Supporting Regulatory Compliance and Digital Transformation

This collaboration also helps institutions navigate and comply with a slew of critical cybersecurity regulations, including:

NIS2 Directive

Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)

EU Cybersecurity Act

Cyber Resilience Act

In the rapidly changing digital landscape, adherence to regulatory standards is non-negotiable. This framework contract doesn’t just shield the institutions but also enables the secure advancement of their digital transformation initiatives.

The Consortium’s Vision and Commitment

The consortium’s representatives emphasize a blend of technical expertise, strategic foresight, and agile operations to meet today’s cybersecurity challenges. The selection for all three portions of the framework contract reflects trust in their ability to deliver complex security programs on a grand scale.

By joining forces, Capgemini, Airbus Protect, PwC, and Nviso aim to enhance resilience, adapt to emerging threats, and provide unified protection that helps European institutions stay one step ahead.

Impact on Logistics and Beyond

While this move primarily targets cyber defense for institutional infrastructure, the ripple effects on logistics are notably relevant. Robust cybersecurity fortifies supply chain operations from the digital core, ensuring secure data exchange and protecting sensitive freight and shipment information. With an increasing volume of logistics operations relying on digital platforms for tracking, distribution management, and freight forwarding, cyber resilience helps prevent disruptions that could cascade through global transport networks.

Cybersecurity Area Role in European Institutions Impact on Logistics Incident Management Rapid detection and response to threats Minimizes shipment delays due to cyber incidents Governance and Risk Implements risk mitigation strategies and compliance Ensures secure handling of confidential logistics data Training & Expertise Builds cyber skills and awareness Empowers logistics operators to handle cyber risks smartly

Why the Right Cybersecurity Partner Matters

Choosing the right ally to defend against cyber threats is no small feat. It’s like finding a vigilant sentinel who not only guards the gates but anticipates where trouble might creep in next. By integrating extensive technical knowledge and strategic operations, the consortium is positioned to deliver consistent protection while adapting rapidly to new challenges.

If you pull all the levers, you can change work.","When AI is introduced to a workplace, it sparks excitement for some, and anxiety for others.

While some employees may see technology as a means of enhancing their ability to complete their role – improving productivity and reducing repetitive tasks – others may see it as a step towards making their job obsolete.

At IBM, the answer is neither simple nor threatening because the company is putting its people at the heart of its AI strategy.

In an exclusive conversation with IBM’s Jon Lester, Vice President of HR Technology, Data & AI, UNLEASH explores how the technology giant is using AI agents not just to automate tasks, but to empower its 270,300 employees to learn, adapt, and thrive in the future of work.

Placing employees at the heart of AI transformation

For Lester, “openness and transparency” is the cornerstone of ensuring employees feel empowered by emerging technologies.

However, HR leaders also need to demonstrate a solid understanding of how these technologies work, to then confidently translate this to the workforce.

Lester highlights that, when used correctly, agents can bring the workforce a number of benefits, such as increasing productivity and freeing up employees’ time. However, it can also raise the question: What will happen to us when new technology comes in?

“One of the big things we talk about is that as a headline number, IBM has given back $3.5 billion in the last two years of productivity back to IBMers. We think agents will accelerate that even more,” he shares.

“This can feel threatening. But at IBM, the message is clear: your job will change – but we want you to lead that change.”

Agents can therefore be used to complete tasks that employees tend to find undesirable – such as moving data around and responding to the same queries multiple times a day.

This is where transparency comes into play, as Lester insists leaders must make their workforce aware that “constant change is going to happen”, but that they should assure the business wants to “invest in the workforce that lead it”.

He says: “This is a really important first step from our leadership – putting them in the middle of the change and investing in people to give them time to rethink and retrain.”

A practical way IBM has made this concept a reality is by creating AI solutions to make learning easier.

In fact, in 2016 the average IBM employee spent 31 hours a year learning new skills. In 2024, that figure had almost tripled to 87 hours. Part of this change has been from shifting the approach from ‘it’s nice to learn a new skill’ to ‘it’s actually on the individual – but the company will facilitate it’.

Lester highlights that this approach has played a “big part” in creating new roles that didn’t exist a few years ago, but which “have now evolved in every single part of the organization”.

When I look internally at HR, 80% of the new roles that have emerged are HR people learning completely different skill sets, always based on their core capability, like great employee experience,” Lester reflects.

“We are seeing traditional roles go through this, and we’ll see more roles change with Gen AI.

“But people will evolve into roles that we probably don’t even imagine today, and I think that’s the bit that we have to make sure we, as an organization and as a leadership, are very clear around. There are going to be some great opportunities.”

Integrating LLMs into the workforce

The rise of AI agents will force a rethink of how work is done. Unlike traditional assistants that guide people through predefined processes, agents can deliver task-driven outcomes end-to-end – changing what’s possible.

By implementing AI agents, IBM has tangibly improved its HR processes, for example, through the development of the concept Ask HR – a digital employee support capability. All FAQs and policies were moved to Ask HR, meaning employees could engage through the chat capability to have any questions answered.

Employees can also transact through it. It becomes an open API, so they can link to the underlying systems and do a job transfer or book a day off, for example, simply by chatting to the digital assistant.

As this was traditional AI – natural language processing – IBM has now shifted the assistant to LLMs, meaning it’s evolved from an assistant to an agent.

Now, when an employee prompts Ask HR, an agent will classify what they’re asking for and will route them to a specific domain within the HR content. The domain could be compensation, payroll, or learning.

When this was set, Lester highlighted that they then needed to ensure it was compliant, admitting “we’ve learned that the hard way at times”.

To achieve this, IBM created individual domains, “each with their own LLM”, to get 90% compliance.

“‘Chunking’ your content up into smaller groups enables you to go quicker.

“But the agent at the top then has to understand what you’re asking, to then send you to the right domain with the particular version of the LLM to generate the right answer. That took us a while to set up,” he explains.

Now, HR is split into 27 of these domains, with Lester boasting IBM has “very, very good compliance within the responses”.

Content that is created for AI-ingestion has also been a key learning for Lester and his team.

“When we first tried to ingest our 7,000 policies, only half of them could actually be ingested into a LLM because we hadn’t figured out what makes good content for AI to read,” he shares.

“We have now worked out how to do this and have built a template that all policy documents must follow and these can now be automatically ingested.”

Lester explains that although this is a common issue for teams, it also highlights the conversation around the convergence of HR and IT.

Most content within an organization will never be consumed by a human anymore,” he says. “It will be consumed by an agent.

“You have to therefore shift the way you’re designing your policies and your content for agents to read and ingest it into what we call a vectorized database.”

Finding the right HR levers to pull

By speaking with Lester, it was clear that his one key take away message was: educate yourself. In fact, he believes that it is down to the individual to “understand the art of the possible around what AI can do today.”

He adds: “You’ve got to understand LLMs, you’ve got to be able to engage with them, and you’ve got to be able to start to understand the implications of this on what it is that you do and what you’re a specialist at.”

From here, he advises leaders to “figure out the value that this can bring”. To help IBM employees achieve this, leaders promote the mantra: eliminate, simplify, automate.

This stops employees from “doing work that adds no value”, while “simplifying the rest, and automating a great process” to “build a value case”.

“Start small, but just go for it,” he notes. “Probably one of the biggest things we’ve shifted in IBM is we’re removing the stigma of failure – allowing employees to fail.

Hopefully fail fast and fail cheap, but fail and then learn, iterate, and then succeed hugely.”

Lester also reiterates the importance of implementing agents and Gen AI that is “relevant to the business.”

“Make sure it’s relevant to your function, to you, your team, and to your work, because I think we spend a lot of time doing stuff that doesn’t have any relevance.”

Concluding, Lester highlights the importance of relevancy, as he doesn’t “think every company has that”.

“I don’t think we’ve [IBM] always had relevancy,” he admits. “I think we sometimes try things and realize it was interesting – but not relevant – and continued with it. We’ve then had to learn to stop doing it.

“Having those checks and balances as a leader, in particular an HR leader, is really important to a value case. Everything we’ve done before has enabled us to adapt to agents.”

When HR leaders are faced with a problem, they therefore shouldn’t just “throw the tech at it”, but rather work to “figure out the relevance of the value and the transformation, not just the transference”.

“People just transfer a bad process onto different tech, and they just waste their money,” Lester says.

Understand there are all these levers to pull. If you pull all the levers, you can change work. You can reinvent work, and then you get the relevancy.”",https://www.unleash.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cropped-UNLEASH_Favicon_512x512-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-16 06:00:13.214901

In President Donald Trump’s second term, the United States has continued to pledge disaster aid, albeit at a much lower level than before.
If the United States were to resume its investments in disaster risk reduction, it could keep future such bills as low as possible.
In Central America, droughts, storms, and extreme heat—all exacerbated by climate change—have eroded rural livelihoods and pushed families to leave the region.
Slashing the United States’ international climate-resilience funding and decimating the institutions that deliver it is not fiscal prudence or putting Americans first.","Climate change is an expensive problem. According to the insurance and risk management firm Aon, economic losses from natural disasters worldwide amounted to $313 billion in 2022 and $380 billion in 2023. The World Bank reported in 2019 that in low-income and middle-income countries, weather-related service disruptions and poor maintenance of infrastructure cost households and businesses between $390 billion and $647 billion a year. As global average temperatures continue to rise, the financial services company S&P Global estimates that annual losses from physical climate risks, including extreme weather and sea-level rise, could reach 3.2 to 5.1 percent of world GDP by 2050.

Investment in early warning systems, infrastructure improvements, alternative water storage, and drought-tolerant crops can lessen the pain. The Global Commission on Adaptation, an initiative started by two international policy organizations, has found that every dollar invested in such climate-resilience measures yields between $2 and $10 in avoided losses and economic gains. The World Resources Institute, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization, puts the median yield even higher: a 2025 study of climate-resilience projects in 12 countries around the world found over $10 in benefits for every dollar invested over a ten-year period.

And when the United States invests in climate resilience abroad, it generates benefits at home. For years, Washington has funded such programs through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other federal agencies, making modest investments to mitigate the effects of overseas disasters. This aid has helped keep important supply chains intact and valuable markets open, reduce migration pressures, and prevent China from gaining more ground in developing countries, effectively serving as an inexpensive insurance policy for American prosperity, security, and influence.

The Trump administration has slashed these foreign assistance programs in the name of reducing costs. It cut over 80 percent of USAID’s 6,200-plus grants and contracts, including almost 100 percent of those that have something to do with climate. But Washington’s retreat from international climate-resilience efforts is a false economy. Any initial savings could quickly be erased as disasters worsened by climate change drive price increases, displace people who may show up at U.S. borders, create conditions that criminal and extremist groups exploit, and enable China to expand its footprint—turning a supposed budget cut into a costly mistake.

INVEST NOW

For decades, American leaders have recognized that investments in international development pay for themselves. In 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called for a dramatic increase in spending for foreign assistance to help address local problems before they become crises that would demand U.S. military action. In 2013, Jim Mattis, at the time the general in charge of U.S. Central Command, made the case for international engagement in blunter terms, opining that if the State Department were not funded fully, the U.S. Defense Department would ultimately “need to buy more ammunition.” The 2021 National Intelligence Estimate on Climate Change further underscored the point that climate change creates problems for Washington in the form of geopolitical tensions and instability abroad.

Modest outlays for climate-resilience projects are all the more important as continued greenhouse gas emissions make weather increasingly erratic. According to the Global Commission on Adaptation, just 24 hours of advance warning of a hazardous event can reduce damages by almost 30 percent. An investment of $800 million in early warning systems would avoid $3 billion to $16 billion in losses every year, a double-digit return, in addition to the lives saved. And according to the International Federation of the Red Cross, climate-resilient development could reduce the number of people needing humanitarian assistance because of weather disasters from 100 million in 2019 to 68 million by 2030 and just ten million by 2050.

Under prior administrations, U.S. agencies invested in climate risk reduction programs. In Malawi, for instance, USAID and NASA worked with the central government, as well as regional and local institutions, between 2019 and 2021 to strengthen an early warning system for floods. The U.S. agencies helped integrate satellite data into an existing UN-supported system that used sensors to monitor river levels upstream of flood-prone areas. After the updates, what had once provided only a few hours’ notice of a flood gave up to two weeks’ advance warning. When Tropical Storm Ana and Cyclone Gombe struck in 2022, local authorities were able to send text-message alerts to vulnerable communities three to four days in advance. According to the Malawian government, the early preparations enabled by those warnings prevented $40 million in losses. The American taxpayer supplied less than $100,000 for the technology transfer to set up this system and less than $1 million a year to operate a regional hub staffed by local hydrometeorologists.

Economic losses from natural disasters worldwide amounted to $380 billion in 2023.

A similar effort in Central America also yielded large payoffs. After Hurricane Mitch, a Category 5 storm, killed 10,000 people in 1998 in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, USAID, NASA, and other government agencies helped create a regional flood monitoring network. NASA provided real-time monitoring of floods and forecasting of floodwater movement within 24 hours of rainfall. Hydroelectric dam operators in Honduras used this information to manage the release of dammed water to prevent flooding downstream. When Hurricanes Eta and Iota—both Category 4 storms—hit in 2020, the system was credited with a dramatic reduction in loss of life. The Red Cross was also able to use the flood information to inform rescue efforts in places where the organization had no previous experience, and fatalities across Central America totaled fewer than 250.

Early warning systems are particularly vital in places where disasters have become routine. In Bangladesh, where much of the land sits barely above sea level and is covered with a lattice of rivers, climate change has made flooding more frequent and intense. The U.S. government invested in early warning systems designed to help local authorities incorporate satellite data into their forecasting systems, and in 2022, USAID and NASA provided timely and location-specific weather advisories to 250,000 farmers across the country. Those advisories can determine whether a family harvests a crop before disaster strikes or loses it to rising waters. A 2023 USAID study estimated that the agency’s climate information saved these Bangladeshi farmers an average of $467 each, a significant amount in a country where the average annual income is below $3,000.

International climate assistance delivers the most immediate benefit in lives saved and economic losses avoided in the countries where disasters occur, but the United States saves money, too. For one, investments in climate resilience reduce demand for humanitarian aid. In President Donald Trump’s second term, the United States has continued to pledge disaster aid, albeit at a much lower level than before. After the Category 5 storm Hurricane Melissa hit Jamaica, the Bahamas, Cuba, and Haiti, for example, Washington announced millions in direct aid to the countries affected. In December 2025, the administration also announced a $2 billion pledge for delivery of humanitarian assistance through the UN. If the United States were to resume its investments in disaster risk reduction, it could keep future such bills as low as possible.

SAVE LATER

International climate-resilience efforts offer secondary savings for the United States, too. These programs help keep farmers who lose their harvest because of climate change from switching to illicit crops such as coca, which can end up in drugs destined for the U.S. market. They also help people preserve their livelihoods, making it less likely they will have to leave home after a disaster and try to migrate to other countries, including the United States.

In Central America, droughts, storms, and extreme heat—all exacerbated by climate change—have eroded rural livelihoods and pushed families to leave the region. A 2023 study in Scientific Reports found that droughts during the growing seasons in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras between 2012 and 2018 coincided with a 71 percent rise in emigration to the United States. According to the Inter-American Development Bank, extreme heat was a particularly strong predictor of migration for Salvadoran farm families, and households lacking access to credit were three times more likely to migrate under these drought and heat conditions.

Investment in climate-resilient agriculture reduces these pressures. Through Feed the Future, a bipartisan initiative to fight global hunger, poverty, and malnutrition that operated from 2010 to 2025 across 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, USAID supported the adoption of drought- and disease-tolerant crops, efficient irrigation, and animal and plant disease prevention. In Honduras, USAID worked to address coffee rust—a plant disease exacerbated by warmer, wetter weather that can cause crop loss, which in turn can motivate a farmer to migrate—and helped 16,000 farm families and agribusinesses adopt technologies to increase harvests in 2021. That same year, in Guatemala, USAID created 30,000 jobs across the food value chain, generated $76 million in agricultural sales, and drove an additional $10 million in public and private financing into its projects. Across all its programs, Feed the Future helped 34 million people in 2024 alone to improve agricultural practices, access financing, and reduce their farms’ climate risk, giving them less reason to leave home in search of better conditions.

Investments in international development pay for themselves.

Other Feed the Future projects benefited the United States in various ways. In 2021, for instance, USAID worked with the Department of Agriculture to stop the transmission of African Swine Fever, a highly contagious disease whose geographic spread is increasing with rising temperatures, among pigs in Hispaniola. Those efforts were pivotal in preventing transmission to pigs in the United States, where the outbreak threatened the multibillion-dollar domestic pork industry. Working with American companies, USAID also helped ensure that, even as climate change affects their crops, farmers abroad can continue to supply Americans with foods that cannot be grown in the United States, such as coffee, avocados, certain spices, cocoa, vanilla, and tropical fruits.

Many sub-Saharan countries are suffering major agricultural losses caused by climate change, making international trade in staples such as maize, wheat, and rice more volatile. In 2023, USAID and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation worked with more than 80 African seed companies to distribute drought-resistant seeds to seven million farming families cultivating 20 million acres. The seeds boosted crop yields by an average 25 percent, cut food costs for about 44 million people, and added around $1.5 billion to the African continent’s GDP in one year. Farmers who also adopted climate-resilient techniques such as precision irrigation and cover crops saw their incomes rise by more than 20 percent. This kind of protection for agricultural markets can reduce food price shocks, which can lead to political unrest, food insecurity, and ultimately migration.

Foreign assistance in climate resilience also helps reduce opportunities for terrorist organizations and other criminal elements to recruit. Armed insurgents find it easier to enlist new members when harvests fail and livelihoods vanish. In the Sahel, al-Qaeda affiliates and Islamic State (or ISIS) militants prey on communities that lose their farms to drought. Reducing the damage of extreme weather can stem extremist recruitment and criminal activities such as human trafficking. In 2021 and 2022, USAID worked with the World Food Program and ARC Replica, an insurance initiative launched by the African Union agency African Risk Capacity, to help the governments of Mali and Burkina Faso purchase drought insurance policies. When devastating droughts happened in 2022 and 2023, those policies triggered payouts of $15 million to affected farmers in Mali and $7 million in Burkina Faso, supporting more than 434,000 people. For less than $1 million out of USAID’s budget each year, the program likely helped protect people in the region from criminal groups that feed on hunger and despair.

Similar preventive investments have paid dividends in the Middle East. In Basra, the economic hub of southern Iraq, years of rising temperatures and declining water quality fueled public anger and sparked violent protests, including riots in 2018 that shut down much of the city. USAID stepped in to equip the Basra Water Management Committee with data systems and training to track salinity, manage resources, and improve water distribution. The result was better access to clean water, greater agricultural productivity, and fewer local conflicts—all for less than $1 million. Resilience efforts such as this can bolster fragile states and reduce the need for humanitarian intervention. A few million dollars spent early can help the United States avoid spending hundreds of millions later when state failure may require emergency relief, a counterterrorism response, and refugee assistance.

BILLS COME DUE

Just because the United States has cut its climate programs does not mean all international adaptation efforts have ceased. In many cases, China has stepped in, spending the past few months positioning itself as the provider of choice for early warning systems and climate information. Across Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific, Beijing is promoting solar farms, dams, and other projects under the banner of “South-South cooperation.” Such efforts are sorely needed, but when they are driven by China, they come with costs. Many of these projects include predatory lending conditions, contributing to soaring sovereign debt in developing countries and hampering long-term economic growth. With more debt to service, these countries have less money to spend on education, food subsidies, and fresh water supplies—all of which help prevent conflict.

And while Beijing’s offers of climate assistance make China an indispensable partner, Washington’s withdrawal makes it appear apathetic and unreliable. USAID spent more than $2 million on climate resilience in Mongolia in 2022; in March 2025, after Trump shuttered USAID, China launched a climate-resilience project in the country in cooperation with the International Federation of the Red Cross. The result is that in Mongolia, whose large copper deposits give it outsized geopolitical and economic heft, China has gained clout and the United States has lost it. Influence follows investment, and soft power tends to accrue to those offering solutions.

Slashing the United States’ international climate-resilience funding and decimating the institutions that deliver it is not fiscal prudence or putting Americans first. The small savings it produces are only temporary. The costs of these cuts will resurface both at home and abroad, be it in supply chain disruptions, migratory pressures, heightened security threats, higher disaster-response bills, or reduced diplomatic options as China binds other countries more tightly into its sphere of influence. The smarter course is to invest now—in the early warning systems that save lives, the seeds that secure harvests, the insurance that cushions shocks, and the diplomatic partnerships that keep countries stable and open to U.S. global leadership.",https://cdn-live.foreignaffairs.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2026/01/14/2020-12-11T181132Z_599950467_RC26LK989HVS_RTRMADP_3_STORMS-HONDURAS.jpg?itok=B9wraZHt,N,,2026-01-16 07:00:39.107374

The last two weeks brought encouraging momentum for the industry, from record-breaking capital raises around JPM to Massachusetts leading the nation on patient access reforms. While policy challenges from Washington persist (we’ll have more to say about the White House announcement just hours ago), I’ll be heading to DC next week for conversations on the industry’s challenges and opportunities. We remain committed to advocating for policies that support innovation and ensure patients can access the breakthrough treatments our industry develops.

JPM 2026: The 2026 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, held in San Francisco, CA, opened with renewed momentum in biotech capital markets, with companies raising $4.9 billion in the week leading up to the event, including $2.6 billion in public offerings, making this the strongest start to the year on record, and $2.29 billion in private rounds. MassBio was in San Francisco for the week, hosting events and connecting with members.

Massachusetts life sciences companies made significant announcements, demonstrating the state’s continued leadership in healthcare innovation. Charles River Laboratories unveiled two strategic acquisitions totaling over $500 million to strengthen its non-human primate supply chain and biopharmaceutical testing capabilities. Additionally, Biogen showcased a revitalized pipeline focused on neuroscience and rare disease, while Boston Scientific highlighted explosive growth, projecting 15% annual growth for at least another three years.

Beyond corporate presentations, the conference also spotlighted broader regulatory concerns as former FDA official Richard Pazdur warned that the firewall between political appointees and drug reviewers has been breached, raising questions about transparency in the agency’s new voucher program that could impact the approval pathway for drugs being developed across the country.

Prior Authorization Reforms: Governor Healey announced nation-leading reforms to streamline prior authorization processes, making it faster and easier for Massachusetts patients to access the medications they need. The new regulations will reduce administrative barriers that delay care, ensuring patients can get timely access to the innovative treatments developed by the Commonwealth’s life sciences industry. I’m honored to have been appointed to the Governor’s Working Group on healthcare cost reduction, where we’ll work to find creative solutions that balance affordability with patient access to breakthrough therapies.

Pharma Tariffs and MFN Update: According to a new “Letter of Agreement”, the Department of Commerce appears to have concluded its Section 232 investigation into pharmaceutical imports. The document outlines the latest framework for MFN drug pricing deals and recent momentum in onshoring. According to the law, President Trump has 90 days to decide whether to act based on the report’s findings, so we can expect to see such actions within the next few months.

FDA Issues Guidance on Modernizing Statistical Methods for Clinical Trials: The FDA published draft guidance to facilitate the use of Bayesian methodologies in clinical trials for drugs and biologics. The agency emphasized that Bayesian approaches, which combine current trial data with relevant prior information, can help reduce development costs and timelines while maintaining rigorous safety and efficacy standards. According to FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, providing clarity on these modern statistical methods will help sponsors bring more treatments to patients faster and more affordably.

2026 Health Package Outlook: Congress continues to debate a healthcare package, with some members intent on reviving bipartisan priorities. The current focus of the package includes PBM reform and increased control on Medicare outpatient spending, along with renewing existing programs, such as telehealth options and community health centers. Senate Finance Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-OR) recently referenced the 26-0 Committee vote in favor of PBM overhaul in 2023, and feels upbeat about getting it over the finish line, Meanwhile, Senate Finance Chairman Mike Crapo (R-ID) noted “broad support here and at the White House” for the PBM bill, which would “delink” the price of a drug from PBM compensation in Medicare Part D. Extension of ACA subsidies are likely to be excluded from any such legislation.

NSCEB Releases New Biotech Regulatory Recommendations: The National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology (NSCEB) released new analysis and 83 policy options to modernize and accelerate U.S. regulatory review of biotechnology products across medical, plant, microorganism, and animal sectors. Across the 22 medical recommendations, there is an emphasis on predictability and transparency to ensure faster clinical trials and promote more efficient manufacturing. The proposals aim to streamline fragmented processes, reduce regulatory burden, and help U.S. innovators compete globally, particularly against China, while maintaining safety standards. NSCEB leadership emphasized that faster, more predictable oversight will strengthen national security, attract investment, and support economic growth.

MPS lifted by rumours of UniCredit taking Delfin's stake

Contacts on the matter took place before Christmas, sources said

UniCredit dismissed any prospects of a deal on Thursday

Delfin says it acts in country's best interest, MPS doing well

MILAN, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Delfin on Friday ruled out ongoing talks to sell its Monte dei Paschi stake, closing ranks around CEO Luigi Lovaglio as speculation over a potential approach from UniCredit (CRDI.MI), opens new tab for the bank drives shares higher.

Speculation over Delfin's intentions has mounted in recent weeks after MPS's takeover of Mediobanca turned it into a pivotal investor in insurer Generali (GASI.MI), opens new tab, a financial heavyweight whose ownership is watched closely in Rome and by Italy's largest banks.

The Week in Breakingviews newsletter offers insights and ideas from Reuters' global financial commentary team. Sign up here.

Delfin, owned in equal parts by the eight heirs of late Ray-Ban billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio, said it was not currently in talks with UniCredit or others to sell all, or part, of the MPS stake.

Shares in MPS have gained recently, lifted by analysts' studies about a potential combination with UniCredit, following press reports about the latter looking to buy Delfin's stake.

With a 17.5% stake, Delfin is the main shareholder in MPS, which last year acquired bigger rival Mediobanca in hectic consolidation in Italian banking.

EXECUTIVES HELD END-OF-YEAR DISCUSSIONS

Sources have told Reuters there had been contacts before Christmas between UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel and Delfin Chairman Francesco Milleri over UniCredit's potential interest in the stakes Delfin holds in MPS and Generali.

UniCredit on Thursday dismissed as ""pure invention"" at present the idea it could buy Delfin's MPS stake, adding it constantly analysed potential targets and sometimes held discussions with them but that did not necessarily lead to a transaction.

MPS CEO Lovaglio, hired by Italy's Treasury in 2022 to turn the bank around, is now fighting to secure another term in April.

Italy rescued MPS in 2017 acquiring a 68% stake which it has since cut below 5%, lastly by bringing onboard Delfin and other domestic investors as shareholders.

Delfin said it was a long-term financial investor aiming to create the most value both for its shareholders and the country as a whole.

""As such, also in light of an overall performance in line with goals relating to profitability and extracting value from the stakes it holds, Delfin renews its full support for MPS top management and the bank's strengthening path,"" it said.

That suggests investors are starting to reassess whether software companies can defend their pricing power as AI capabilities expand, RBC noted.
""While headline risk is not new (we saw announcements from OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
An April report from AlixPartners found that roughly 100 software companies were being ""squeezed"" by AI-driven competition.
The analysts warned that the AI overhang on software ""may remain"" and ""could spread"" as Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google accelerate their pace of announcements.","Last fall, OpenAI sent shockwaves through the software industry. Now, Anthropic is doing the same.

A new wave of announcements from Anthropic this week revived fears that generative AI could undermine the economics of traditional software companies.

In a research note published Wednesday, analysts at RBC Capital Markets said a flurry of recent product launches from Anthropic, including new AI tools for productivity and healthcare, has coincided with a broad selloff across the software sector and could deepen concerns that AI is becoming a competitive threat rather than a tailwind.

On Sunday, Anthropic rolled out Claude for Healthcare & Life Sciences, which includes HIPAA-ready enterprise tools. The next day, it unveiled Claude Cowork, an AI agent that handles document generation and file management. And then on Tuesday, it announced the expansion of Labs, an internal incubator team that tests and showcases experimental AI products.

Shares of Salesforce, Workday, Intuit, and Snowflake fell sharply after this barrage of news, losing between 6% and 13%. That suggests investors are starting to reassess whether software companies can defend their pricing power as AI capabilities expand, RBC noted.

""While headline risk is not new (we saw announcements from OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. cause material intra-day swings in stock prices throughout 2025), we believe the velocity of innovation and announcements from the model providers could continue to weigh on the broader software landscape throughout 2026,"" RBC analysts wrote.

No longer ""AI-proof""

For years, SaaS companies have justified recurring subscription fees by packaging productivity features, analytics, automation, and domain expertise into proprietary tools. But AI threatens to flatten that value proposition by turning many of those features into on-demand capabilities accessible through a single interface.

The anxiety isn't new. Last year, OpenAI triggered a similar sell-off after demonstrating a suite of internal workplace tools built on top of its models. An April report from AlixPartners found that roughly 100 software companies were being ""squeezed"" by AI-driven competition.

Perhaps most concerning for investors is that AI's reach now appears to be extending into vertical software, an area long viewed as relatively insulated because of regulatory complexity and domain expertise.

RBC analysts said Anthropic's healthcare-focused tools suggest that assumption may no longer hold. By integrating directly with industry databases such as PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov, and by offering specialized agent skills tailored to medical workflows, AI providers are beginning to encroach on niches historically served by specialized vendors.

""We've viewed vertical software as one pocket of software that is likely to be viewed as 'AI-proof' (for now), given the deep domain, regulatory nuance, and workflow expertise required to be successful,"" RBC's note stated. ""That said, recently announced Claude for Healthcare & Life Sciences suggests the AI bear narrative contagion could spread to some vertical names, and they may prove to be less defensive (at least from a multiple perspective) than originally thought.""

Continuing its acquisition streak, Marlborough-based medical device manufacturer Boston Scientific has entered into an agreement to purchase Penumbra, a California-based healthcare company, to the tune of $14.5 billion. Penumbra develops and manufactures medical devices to treat blood flow and clot complications caused by heart and blood vessel disorders, including strokes, heart attacks, and aneurysms, according to a Thursday press release from Boston Scientific. ""Penumbra is a well-established company with an experienced, high-performing team, and this acquisition offers Boston Scientific an opportunity to enter new, fast-growing segments within the vascular space,"" Mike Mahoney, Boston Scientific chairman and CEO, said in the release. Penumbra’s products assist in blood clot removals and the control of hemorrhaging, such as catheters and coils. “The addition of Penumbra can expand access for these novel technologies to more patients and customers around the world, further enhancing our revenue and margins over time with proven offerings that have a history of growth and innovation,” Mahoney said in the release. Boston Scientific will acquire Penumbra for $374 per share through both cash and company stock, totalling the $14.5-billion purchase price. The manufacturer anticipates financing approximately $11 billion in cash. Once the transaction is completed, Adam Elsesser, Penumbra's chairman and CEO, will join Boston Scientific’s board of directors. The acquisition is expected to be finalized this year. ""Our decades-long development of therapies for challenging medical conditions has focused on deep innovation for complex diseases so that we can offer physicians novel solutions to transform patient care,"" Elsesser said in the release. ""I am grateful for the amazing people who have contributed to this work and look forward to uniting our efforts and shared values as we come together with Boston Scientific."" Boston Scientific is using A&O Shearman, with an office in Boston, and Washington D.C.-based Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP as legal advisors in the transaction. Penumbra is using Perella Weinberg Partners as financial advisor and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP as legal advisor. Both are based in New York City. Boston Scientific’s most recent purchase agreement comes just days after the manufacturer announced it would acquire Valencia Technologies, a California-based company specializing in the treatment of bladder dysfunction.

The New York-based carrier didn't specify what caused Wednesday's disruptions, but confirmed that it was resolved by 10:20 p.m. EST. Verizon previously said it had deployed its engineering teams to address ""an issue impacting wireless voice and data services.""

""Today, we let many of our customers down and for that, we are truly sorry,"" Verizon wrote in updates shared on social media. A spokesperson later added that the company would give those affected a $20 account credit through Verizon's app, which on average ""covers multiple days of service,"" and directly contact its business customers with compensation.

Online data tracker Downdetector showed that Verizon customers began to report issues with their service around 11 A.M. CDT on Wednesday. Reports appeared to peak in the early afternoon, but remained elevated later in the day. Downdetector said it had received a total of over 1.5 million reports before 4 p.m.

Impacted users said their phones were in ""SOS"" mode or had other no signal messages. In cities like New York, alerts warned that the outage may disrupt 911 calls -- urging residents to try landlines and devices from other carriers, if available, or visit a local police or fire station in-person in case of an emergency.

Other major hubs impacted by Verizon's failure included Houston, Philadelphia, Dallas and Miami, per Downdetector. But many consumers across the country said they experienced disruptions.

A handful of outage reports for other carriers also bubbled up on Wednesday -- but companies like T-Mobile and AT&T quickly confirmed online that their services were operating normally. Both suggested that their customers may have encountered issues contacting people with Verizon's service, however.

When cellular outages happen, some phone companies also urge consumers to try to connect to Wi-Fi and use internet calling.

When two different models, such as the RTX 5060 8GB and RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, share the same memory capacity, the higher-tier model (the RTX 5060 Ti) will be prioritized for supply.
Similarly, if the RTX 5060 Ti, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5080 are all 16GB models, the highest-tier model among them, the RTX 5080, will receive supply priority.
Regarding the top-tier GeForce RTX 5090 and GeForce RTX 5090 D v2, these models are not subject to this specific prioritization mechanism.
This implies that NVIDIA intends to streamline its SKU lineup, concentrating its main supply on the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, RTX 5080, RTX 5090 D v2, and RTX 5090.","RTX 50 series allocation prioritization is in place, here’s how it works

We have an update on a recent rumor from Board Channels. The claim was that NVIDIA is prioritizing RTX 50 cards with 8GB memory. That appears partially true, but only for one tier of the lineup.

HKEPC reached out to its sources and says a board-partner allocation prioritization scheme is in place, but it works differently. In short, NVIDIA is reducing the number of SKUs board partners can choose from. The prioritization is not based on GPU class. It is based on memory capacity.

NVIDIA’s new RTX 50 GPU memory class prioritizations

8GB: RTX 5060, RTX 5060 Ti

12GB: RTX 5070 (undecided yet)

16GB: RTX 5060 Ti, RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5080

24GB: RTX 5090D V2

32GB: RTX 5090/D (treated as one SKU)

As we read it, if three RTX 50 cards share the same memory capacity, NVIDIA prioritizes the highest SKU. For example, among 16GB models, NVIDIA has RTX 5060 Ti, 5070 Ti, and 5080 SKUs, and the 5080 allocation would be prioritized. Since the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is now said to be deprioritized, the RTX 5060 Ti focus would shift to the 8GB model, which is likely where the first report came from.

NVIDIA is not making any prioritization changes for the RTX 5090, 5090D, or 5090D V2 yet. These are also the most expensive models, and look to be the easiest to find in stock, despite the sharp price increases. The RTX 5070 is not yet decided, it’s the only desktop model with this memory configuration.

The report doesn’t mention laptop SKUS at all, so from our understanding, this allocation does not affect this market segment yet.

HKEPC posts explains everything in detail:

If a model like the RTX 5060 Ti has both 8GB and 16GB versions, NVIDIA will focus on supplying the 8GB version.

When two different models, such as the RTX 5060 8GB and RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, share the same memory capacity, the higher-tier model (the RTX 5060 Ti) will be prioritized for supply.

Similarly, if the RTX 5060 Ti, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5080 are all 16GB models, the highest-tier model among them, the RTX 5080, will receive supply priority.

The AIC partner also disclosed that it has not yet been decided whether the RTX 5070 12GB will have to “make way,” meaning its memory allocation could be redirected to the higher-end RTX 5080.

Regarding the top-tier GeForce RTX 5090 and GeForce RTX 5090 D v2, these models are not subject to this specific prioritization mechanism. However, due to the general memory shortage, their supply volume will inevitably be affected.

This implies that NVIDIA intends to streamline its SKU lineup, concentrating its main supply on the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, RTX 5080, RTX 5090 D v2, and RTX 5090. The supply for other models will be significantly reduced.

We will see if this means there will be more RTX 5060 Ti 8GB and RTX 5080 on the market moving forward.

Digital S&P 500® Index-Linked Global Medium-Term Notes, Series A, due

The notes will not bear interest. The amount that you will be paid on your notes on the stated maturity date (expected to be the second scheduled business day after the determination date) is based on the performance of the S&P 500® Index (which we refer to as the underlier) as measured from and including the trade date to and including the determination date (expected to be between 15 and 17 months after the trade date). If the final underlier level on the determination date is greater than or equal to 80.00% of the initial underlier level (set on the trade date and is expected to be the closing level of the underlier on the trade date), you will receive the maximum settlement amount, which is expected to be the threshold settlement amount (expected to be between $1,065.60 and $1,077.10 for each $1,000 face amount of your notes). If the final underlier level is less than 80.00% of the initial underlier level, the return on your notes will be negative.

You could lose your entire investment in the notes. Any payment on the notes, including any repayment of principal, is not guaranteed by any third party and is subject to (a) the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC and (b) the risk of exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power (as described on page PS-3 of this pricing supplement) by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

To determine your payment at maturity, we will calculate the underlier return, which is the percentage increase or decrease in the final underlier level from the initial underlier level. On the stated maturity date, for each $1,000 face amount of your notes, you will receive an amount in cash equal to:

·if the underlier return is greater than or equal to -20.00% (the final underlier level is greater than or equal to 80.00% of the initial underlier level), the maximum settlement amount; or

·if the underlier return is negative and is below -20.00% (the final underlier level is less than the initial underlier level by more than 20.00%), the sum of (i) $1,000 plus (ii) the product of (a) $1,000 times (b) 1.25 times (c) the sum of the underlier return plus 20.00% (in which case you will receive less than $1,000).

Because we have provided only a brief summary of the terms of your notes above, you should read the detailed description of the terms of the notes found in “Summary Information” on page PS-2 in this pricing supplement.

Your investment in the notes involves certain risks, including among other things, our credit risk and the risk of exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page S-9 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes” beginning on page PS-13 of this pricing supplement so that you may better understand those risks.

Pricing Supplement dated January , 2026

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES

The final terms for the notes will be determined on the date the notes are initially priced for sale to the public (the “trade date”) based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the trade date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement.

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables, such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the trade date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the notes might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the notes on the trade date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the notes and our estimated value of the notes is expected to result from several factors, including any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the notes. These other costs will include a fee paid to iCapital Markets LLC, an electronic platform in which an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, who is acting as a dealer in connection with the distribution of the notes, holds an indirect minority equity interest, for services it is providing in connection with this offering.

Our estimated value on the trade date is not a prediction of the price at which the notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another

PS- 2

affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the trade date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the trade date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the initial issue date of the notes because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes and other costs in connection with the notes that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the notes. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial issue date of the notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes” on page PS-13 of this pricing supplement.

You may revoke your offer to purchase the notes at any time prior to the trade date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the notes prior to their trade date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.

CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the notes), by acquiring the notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the notes may have at law if

PS- 3

and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Purchase at amount other than face amount: the amount we will pay you at the stated maturity date for your notes will not be adjusted based on the issue price you pay for your notes, so if you acquire notes at a premium (or discount) to face amount and hold them to the stated maturity date, it could affect your investment in a number of ways. The return on your investment in such notes will be lower (or higher) than it would have been had you purchased the notes at face amount. Also, the stated threshold level would not offer the same measure of protection to your investment as would be the case if you had purchased the notes at face amount. See “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes—Risks Relating to the Notes Generally—If You Purchase Your Notes at a Premium to Face Amount, the Return on Your Investment Will Be Lower Than the Return on Notes Purchased at Face Amount or a Discount and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will Be Negatively Affected” on page PS-13 of this pricing supplement.

Cash settlement amount (on the stated maturity date): for each $1,000 face amount of your notes, we will pay you on the stated maturity date an amount in cash equal to:

·if the final underlier level is greater than or equal to the threshold level, the threshold settlement amount; or

·if the final underlier level is less than the threshold level, the sum of (1) $1,000 plus (2) the product of (i) $1,000 times (ii) the buffer rate times (iii) the sum of the underlier return plus the threshold amount (in which case you will receive less than $1,000).

Any payment on the notes, including any repayment of principal, is not guaranteed by any third party and is subject to (a) the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC, and (b) the risk of exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Initial underlier level (to be set on the trade date): , the closing level of the underlier on the trade date

Final underlier level: the closing level of the underlier on the determination date, subject to adjustment in limited circumstances as provided under “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-91 of the accompanying prospectus supplement; and subject to market disruption events and non-trading days as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Equity Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-87 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

PS- 4

Underlier return: the quotient of (1) the final underlier level minus the initial underlier level divided by (2) the initial underlier level, expressed as a percentage

Threshold level: 80.00% of the initial underlier level

Threshold amount: 20.00%

Threshold settlement amount (to be set on the trade date): expected to be between $1,065.60 and $1,077.10

Cap level (to be set on the trade date): expected to be between 106.56% and 107.71% of the initial underlier level

Maximum settlement amount (to be set on the trade date): expected to be the threshold settlement amount

Trade date:

Original issue date (settlement date): expected to be three scheduled business days following the trade date

For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the determination date be postponed by more than five trading days.

Stated maturity date (to be set on the trade date): a specified date that is expected to be the second scheduled business day after the determination date. The maturity date will be postponed if the determination date is postponed due to the occurrence or continuance of a market disruption event or a non-trading day on the determination date. In such a case, the maturity date will be postponed by the same number of business days from but excluding the originally scheduled determination date to and including the actual determination date. The maturity date will also be postponed if that date is not a business day. See “Terms of the Notes—Payment Dates” on page S-46 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and “Reference Assets—Indices—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Equity Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-87 of the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Closing level: as provided on page S-86 of the accompanying prospectus supplement. The closing level of the underlier reported on the Bloomberg Professional® service (“Bloomberg”) page may be lower or higher than the official closing level of the underlier published by the underlier sponsor. In certain circumstances, the closing level of the underlier will be based on the alternate calculation of the underlier described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-91 of the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Business day: as defined under “Terms of the Notes—Business Day” on page S-47 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

PS- 5

Use of proceeds and hedging: as described under “Use of Proceeds and Hedging” on page S-115 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

Tax consequences: you should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion, when read in combination with those sections, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the notes.

Based on current market conditions, in the opinion of our special tax counsel, it is reasonable to treat the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with respect to the underlier. Assuming this treatment is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the notes (including redemption at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the notes. This gain or loss on your notes should be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if you hold your notes for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of notes at the original issue price. However, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may not respect this treatment, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the notes could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the “constructive ownership” regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the notes.

ERISA: as described under “Benefit Plan Investor Considerations” on page S-101 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

Supplemental plan of distribution: we will agree to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “agent”), and the agent will agree to purchase from us, the face amount of the notes at the price specified on the cover of this pricing supplement. The agent will commit to take and pay for all of the notes, if any are taken. The agent proposes initially to offer the notes to the public at the initial issue price set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement, and to certain unaffiliated securities dealers at that price less a concession not in excess of 0.92% of the face amount.

PS- 6

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment for the notes on the original issue date, which is more than one business day following the trade date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on any date prior to one business day before delivery will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement and should consult their own advisor.

We have been advised by Barclays Capital Inc. that it intends to make a market in the notes. However, neither Barclays Capital Inc. nor any of our affiliates that makes a market is obligated to do so and any of them may stop doing so at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity or trading market for the notes.

Calculation agent: Barclays Bank PLC

CUSIP no.: 06749FCX5

ISIN no.: US06749FCX50

Conflicts of interest: Barclays Capital Inc. is an affiliate of Barclays Bank PLC and, as such, has a “conflict of interest” in this offering within the meaning of Rule 5121 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. Consequently, the offering is being conducted in compliance with the provisions of Rule 5121. Barclays Capital Inc. is not permitted to sell notes in this offering to an account over which it exercises discretionary authority without the prior specific written approval of the account holder.

FDIC: the notes are not bank deposits and are not insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) or any other governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES

The following table and chart are provided for purposes of illustration only. They should not be taken as an indication or prediction of future investment results and are intended merely to illustrate the impact that the various hypothetical closing levels on the determination date could have on the cash settlement amount at maturity assuming all other variables remain constant.

The examples below are based on a range of final underlier levels that are entirely hypothetical; no one can predict what the closing level will be on any day throughout the term of your notes, and no one can predict what the final underlier level will be on the determination date. The underlier has been highly volatile in the past—meaning that the closing level has changed considerably in relatively short periods—and its performance cannot be predicted for any future period.

The information in the following examples reflects hypothetical rates of return on the notes assuming that they are purchased on the original issue date at the face amount and held to the stated maturity date. If you sell your notes in a secondary market prior to the stated maturity date, your return will depend upon the market value of your notes at the time of sale, which may be affected by a number of factors that are not reflected in the table below, such as interest rates, the volatility of the underlier and our creditworthiness. In addition, assuming no changes in market conditions or our creditworthiness and any other relevant factors, the value of your notes on the trade date will, and the price you may receive for your notes may, be significantly less than the initial issue price. For more information on the value of your notes in the secondary market, see “Risk Factors” on page S-9 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes—Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market—The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if Any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, if Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May Be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes” on page PS-17 of this pricing supplement. The information in the table also reflects the key hypothetical terms and assumptions in the following box.

Key Hypothetical Terms and Assumptions Face amount $1,000 Cap level 106.56% of the initial underlier level Threshold settlement amount $1,065.60 Threshold level 80.00% of the initial underlier level Buffer rate 125.00% Threshold amount 20.00% Neither a market disruption event nor a non-trading day occurs on the originally scheduled determination date No change in or affecting any of the underlier stocks or the method by which the underlier sponsor calculates the underlier Notes purchased on original issue date for the initial issue price noted on the cover page of this pricing supplement and held to the stated maturity date

Moreover, we have not yet set the initial underlier level that will serve as the baseline for determining the underlier return and the amount that we will pay on your notes, if any, at maturity. We will not do so until the trade date. As a result, the actual initial underlier level may differ substantially from the closing level of the underlier prior to the trade date.

For these reasons, the actual performance of the underlier over the term of your notes, as well as the amount payable at maturity, if any, may bear little relation to the hypothetical examples shown below or to the historical closing levels of the underlier shown elsewhere in this pricing supplement. For information about the historical closing levels of the underlier during recent periods, see “The Underlier—Historical Closing Levels of the Underlier” below. Before investing in the notes, you should consult publicly available information to determine the levels of the underlier between the date of this pricing supplement and the date of your purchase of the notes.

PS- 10

Also, the hypothetical examples shown below do not take into account the effects of applicable taxes. Because of the U.S. tax treatment applicable to your notes, tax liabilities could affect the after-tax rate of return on your notes to a comparatively greater extent than the after-tax return on the underlier stocks.

The levels in the left column of the table below represent hypothetical final underlier levels and are expressed as percentages of the initial underlier level. The amounts in the right column represent the hypothetical cash settlement amounts, each based on the corresponding hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level), and are expressed as percentages of the face amount of a note (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of a percent). Thus, a hypothetical cash settlement amount of 100.000% means that the value of the cash payment that we would deliver for each $1,000 of the outstanding face amount of the notes on the stated maturity date would equal 100.000% of the face amount of a note, based on the corresponding hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) and the assumptions noted above.

Hypothetical Final Underlier Level

(as Percentage of Initial Underlier Level) Hypothetical Cash Settlement Amount

(as Percentage of Face Amount) 150.000% 106.560% 140.000% 106.560% 130.000% 106.560% 120.000% 106.560% 110.000% 106.560% 106.560% 106.560% 105.000% 106.560% 102.500% 106.560% 100.000% 106.560% 95.000% 106.560% 90.000% 106.560% 80.000% 106.560% 79.999% 99.999% 75.000% 93.750% 50.000% 62.500% 25.000% 31.250% 0.000% 0.000%

If, for example, the final underlier level were determined to be 25.000% of the initial underlier level, the cash settlement amount that we would deliver on your notes at maturity would be 31.250% of the face amount of your notes, as shown in the table above. As a result, if you purchased your notes on the original issue date at the face amount and held them to the stated maturity date, you would lose 68.750% of your investment (if you purchased your notes at a premium to face amount, you would lose a correspondingly higher percentage of your investment). In addition, if the final underlier level were determined to be 80.000% or more of the initial underlier level, the cash settlement amount that we would deliver on your notes at maturity would be limited to the threshold settlement amount, or 106.560% of each $1,000 face amount of your notes, as shown in the table above. As a result, if you purchased your notes on the original issue date and held them to the stated maturity date, you would not receive more than the threshold settlement amount for each $1,000 face amount of your notes, regardless of the extent to which the final underlier level may be greater than 80.000% of the initial underlier level.

The following chart also shows a graphical illustration of the hypothetical cash settlement amounts (expressed as a percentage of the face amount of your notes) that we would pay on your notes on the stated maturity date, if the final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) were any of the hypothetical levels shown on the horizontal axis. The chart shows that any hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) of less than 80.000% (the section left of the 80.000% marker on the horizontal axis) would result in a hypothetical cash settlement amount of less than 100.000% of the face amount of your notes (the section below the 100.000% marker on the vertical axis) and, accordingly, in a loss of principal to the holder of the notes. The chart also shows that any hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level)

PS- 11

of greater than or equal to 80.000% (the section right of the 80.000% marker on the horizontal axis) would result in a capped return on your investment.

The cash settlement amounts shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on closing levels for the underlier that may not be achieved on the determination date and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your notes on the stated maturity date or at any other time, including any time you may wish to sell your notes, may bear little relation to the hypothetical cash settlement amounts shown above, and these amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the notes. The hypothetical cash settlement amounts on notes held to the stated maturity date in the examples above assume you purchased your notes at their face amount and have not been adjusted to reflect the actual issue price you pay for your notes. The return on your investment (whether positive or negative) in your notes will be affected by the amount you pay for your notes. If you purchase your notes for a price other than the face amount, the return on your investment will differ from, and may be significantly lower than, the hypothetical returns suggested by the above examples.

Please read “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes—Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market—Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of Your Notes” on page PS-16 of this pricing supplement.

We cannot predict the actual final underlier level or what the market value of your notes will be on any particular trading day, nor can we predict the relationship between the closing level of the underlier and the market value of your notes at any time prior to the stated maturity date. The actual amount that you will receive, if any, at maturity and the rate of return on the notes will depend on the actual initial underlier level, cap level and threshold settlement amount that we will set on the trade date and the actual final underlier level determined by the calculation agent as described above. Moreover, the assumptions on which the hypothetical returns are based may turn out to be inaccurate. Consequently, the amount of cash to be paid in respect of your notes, if any, on the stated maturity date may be very different from the information reflected in the table and chart above.

PS- 12

Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes

An investment in the notes involves significant risks. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the notes. Investing in the notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the underlier or any of the underlier stocks, i.e. the stocks composing the underlier. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

You May Lose Your Entire Investment in the Notes

You can lose your entire investment in the notes. The cash payment on your notes, if any, on the stated maturity date will be based on the performance of the underlier as measured from the initial underlier level set on the trade date to the closing level of the underlier on the determination date (also referred to as the “final underlier level”). If the final underlier level is less than the threshold level, you will lose 1.25% of the face amount of your notes for every 1% that the final underlier level is less than the threshold level. Thus, you may lose your entire investment in the notes, which would include any premium to face amount you paid when you purchased the notes.

Also, the market price of your notes prior to the stated maturity date may be significantly lower than the purchase price you pay for your notes. Consequently, if you sell your notes before the stated maturity date, you may receive far less than the amount of your investment in the notes.

Your Maximum Payment on the Notes Is Limited to the Threshold Settlement Amount

Your ability to participate in any change in the value of the underlier over the term of your notes will be limited because of the maximum settlement amount (which is equal to the threshold settlement amount), which will be set on the trade date. The maximum settlement amount will limit the cash settlement amount you may receive for each of your notes at maturity, no matter how much the level of the underlier may rise beyond the initial underlier level over the term of your notes. Accordingly, the amount payable for each of your notes may be significantly less than it would have been had you invested directly in the underlier.

If You Purchase Your Notes at a Premium to Face Amount, the Return on Your Investment Will Be Lower Than the Return on Notes Purchased at Face Amount or a Discount and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will Be Negatively Affected

The cash settlement amount will not be adjusted based on the issue price you pay for the notes. If you purchase notes at a price that differs from the face amount of the notes, then the return on your investment in such notes held to the stated maturity date will differ from, and may be substantially less than, the return on notes purchased at face amount or a discount to face amount. If you purchase your notes at a premium to face amount and hold them to the stated maturity date, the return on your investment in the notes will be lower than it would have been had you purchased the notes at face amount or a discount to face amount. In addition, the impact of the threshold level and the cap level on the return on your investment will depend upon the price you pay for your notes relative to face amount. For example, while the threshold level will still provide for an increase in the return on the notes if the final underlier level is greater than or equal to the threshold level but less than the cap level, if the final underlier level is less than the threshold level you will incur a greater percentage decrease in your investment in the notes than would have been the case for notes purchased at face amount or a discount to face amount. Similarly, if you purchase your notes at a premium to face amount, the cap level will only permit a lower return on your investment in the notes than would have been the case for notes purchased at face amount or a discount to face amount.

PS- 13

The Stated Maturity Date of the Notes Is a Pricing Term and Will Be Determined By Us on the Trade Date

We will not fix the stated maturity date until the trade date. The term of the notes could be as long as the high end of the range set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement. You should be willing and able to hold your notes for up to the high end of the range set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement. The stated maturity date selected by us could have an impact on the value of the notes.

Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Levels of the Underlier on the Dates Specified

Any payment on the notes will be determined based on the closing levels of the underlier on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable value of the underlier determined at any other time.

No Interest or Dividend Payments or Voting Rights or Rights to Receive Any Underlier Stock

As a holder of the notes, you will not receive interest payments. As a result, even if the amount payable on the stated maturity date exceeds the face amount of your notes, the overall return you earn on your notes may be less than you would have earned by investing in a non-index-linked debt security of comparable maturity that bears interest at a prevailing market rate. In addition, as a holder of the notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive cash dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the underlier stocks would have. Furthermore, investing in the notes will not make you a holder of any of the underlier stocks. Your notes will be paid in cash and you will have no right to receive delivery of any underlier stocks.

The U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of an Investment in the Notes Are Uncertain

There is no direct legal authority regarding the proper U.S. federal income tax treatment of the notes, and we do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS. Consequently, significant aspects of the tax treatment of the notes are uncertain, and the IRS or a court might not agree with the treatment of the notes as prepaid forward contracts, as described above under “Key Terms—Tax consequences.” If the IRS were successful in asserting an alternative treatment for the notes, the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the notes could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, in 2007 the Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on various issues regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. Any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should review carefully the sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders,” and consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the notes (including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by the 2007 notice), as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

Credit of Issuer

The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the notes and, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you might not receive any amount owed to you under the terms of the notes.

PS- 14

You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the notes), by acquiring the notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the notes or receiving a different security from the notes, which may be worth significantly less than the notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underlier

Adjustments to the Underlier Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes

The underlier sponsor may add, delete, substitute or adjust the underlier stocks or make other methodological changes to the underlier that could affect its performance. The calculation agent will calculate the value to be used as the closing level of the underlier in the event of certain material changes in or modifications to the underlier. In addition, the underlier sponsor may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of the underlier at any time. Under these circumstances, the calculation agent may select a successor index that the calculation agent determines to be comparable to the underlier or, if no successor index is available, the calculation agent will determine the value to be used as the closing level of the underlier. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the underlier and, consequently, the value of the notes. See “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-91 of the accompanying prospectus supplement, as modified by “Supplemental Terms of the Notes” above.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

We and Our Affiliates, and Any Dealer Participating in the Distribution of the Notes, May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect Your Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest

We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the underlier or its components. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other

PS- 15

financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

Furthermore, if any dealer participating in the distribution of the notes or any of its affiliates conducts hedging activities for us in connection with the notes, that participating dealer or its affiliates will expect to realize a projected profit from such hedging activities, and this projected profit will be in addition to any selling concession that the participating dealer realizes for the sale of the notes to you. This additional projected profit may create a further incentive for the participating dealer to sell the notes to you.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the calculation agent for the notes. As calculation agent, we will determine any values of the underlier and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the notes. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underlier” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the notes.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

Lack of Liquidity

The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the notes. The notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your notes to maturity.

Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of Your Notes

In addition to the level of the underlier, the value of the notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that may either offset or magnify each other, including: the expected volatility of the underlier; the time to maturity of the notes; the dividend rates on the underlier stocks; interest and yield rates in the market generally; supply and demand for the notes; a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events; and our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Expected to Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes

The estimated value of your notes on the trade date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your notes and the estimated value of the notes is expected as a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated

PS- 16

intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the notes. These other costs will include a fee paid to iCapital Markets LLC, an electronic platform in which an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, who is acting as a dealer in connection with the distribution of the notes, holds an indirect minority equity interest, for services it is providing in connection with this offering.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might Be Lower If Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market

The estimated value of your notes on the trade date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated values referenced above might be lower if such estimated values were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to Be Inaccurate and May Be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions

The estimated value of your notes on the trade date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions that may be purchasers or sellers of notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, If Any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May Be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes

The estimated value of the notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions (described above under “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of Your Notes”), and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the notes, secondary market prices of your notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your notes, and any sale prior to the maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you.

The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy the Notes in the Secondary Market and the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements at All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the trade date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the notes on the trade date, as well as the secondary market value of the notes, for a temporary period after the initial issue date of the notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the

PS- 17

notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your notes.

PS- 18

The Underlier

The underlier consists of stocks of 500 companies selected to provide a performance benchmark for the U.S. equity markets. For more information about the underlier, see “Indices—The S&P U.S. Indices” in the accompanying underlying supplement.

In addition, information about the underlier may be obtained from other sources, including, but not limited to, the underlier sponsor’s website (including information regarding the underlier’s sector weightings). We are not incorporating by reference into this pricing supplement the website or any material it includes. Neither we nor any agent or dealer for this offering makes any representation that this publicly available information regarding the underlier is accurate or complete.

Historical Closing Levels of the Underlier

You should not take the historical levels of the underlier as an indication of the future performance of the underlier. The closing level of the underlier has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. Any historical upward or downward trend in the closing level of the underlier during any period shown below is not an indication that the underlier is more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time during the term of your notes. We cannot give you any assurance that the future performance of the underlier or the underlier stocks will not result in a loss on your initial investment on the stated maturity date.

Neither we nor any of our affiliates make any representation to you as to the performance of the underlier. The actual performance of the underlier over the term of the notes, as well as the cash settlement amount, may bear little relation to the historical levels shown below.

The following graph sets forth the historical performance of the underlier based on the daily closing levels from January 4, 2021 through January 13, 2026. The closing level of the underlier on January 13, 2026 was 6,963.74. The dotted line indicates a hypothetical buffer level of 80.00% of the closing level of the underlier on January 13, 2026. The actual buffer level will be equal to 80.00% of the initial underlier level.",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2026-01-16 10:02:29.716734

Those contradictions were enough for U.S. District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers to deny OpenAI’s motion for summary judgment on Thursday, allowing Musk’s fraud claims against the company to proceed to trial.
The company also said that Musk’s claims were time-barred because he should have known about the reported fraud by 2019, when OpenAI publicly announced its for-profit subsidiary.
She denied Microsoft’s motion to dismiss claims that it aided and abetted a breach of fiduciary duty, pointing to internal communications that suggested awareness of potential issues with OpenAI’s nonprofit donors.
Notes from a Microsoft meeting in October 2020 show the company discussed effectively owning OpenAI and considered Musk’s perspective on what they referred to as a closed OpenAI.","(CN) — In September 2017, Elon Musk sent an ultimatum to the leaders of OpenAI, the artificial intelligence nonprofit he co-founded and funded with tens of millions of dollars.

“Either go do something on your own or continue with OpenAI as a nonprofit. I will no longer fund OpenAI until you have made a firm commitment to stay or I’m just being a fool who is essentially providing free funding for you to create a startup,” the billionaire said then.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded the next day, “I remain enthusiastic about the non-profit structure!” Greg Brockman, another co-founder, made similar assurances.

However, in personal notes, Brockman wrote that he could not honestly say the company was committed to remaining a nonprofit, warning that if it shifted to a for-profit structure just a few months later, any claim of commitment would be a lie.

Those contradictions were enough for U.S. District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers to deny OpenAI’s motion for summary judgment on Thursday, allowing Musk’s fraud claims against the company to proceed to trial.

The trial is scheduled to start April 27 and run through the end of May.

In a 32-page order, the Barack Obama appointee in the Northern District of California found enough evidence to create factual disputes about whether OpenAI’s founders deceived Musk about their intentions to maintain the organization’s nonprofit structure.

“Brockman’s electronic notes could be read to suggest that Brockman intended to deceive,” Rogers wrote.

Musk donated about $38 million to OpenAI between 2016 and 2020, saying the company’s founders agreed from the start that the technology would be owned by a foundation, used for the benefit of the public and not structured to generate private profit.

But by 2019, OpenAI had created a for-profit subsidiary and started taking billions in investment from Microsoft. The company also moved some of its intellectual property and employees from the nonprofit to commercial entities.

OpenAI attempted to dismiss the case on multiple grounds, arguing that Musk lacked legal standing to sue because he donated through intermediary charitable funds rather than directly to the organization. But Rogers rejected that argument.

“Holding otherwise would significantly reduce the enforcement of a large swath of charitable trusts, contrary to the modern trend,” she said.

The company also said that Musk’s claims were time-barred because he should have known about the reported fraud by 2019, when OpenAI publicly announced its for-profit subsidiary. But Rogers found genuine disputes about when Musk discovered or should have discovered the full extent of the structural changes, noting he continued donating to OpenAI through September 2020.

Rogers also addressed Microsoft’s role in OpenAI’s transformation. She denied Microsoft’s motion to dismiss claims that it aided and abetted a breach of fiduciary duty, pointing to internal communications that suggested awareness of potential issues with OpenAI’s nonprofit donors.

In March 2018, Microsoft’s Chief Technology Officer wrote: “Ideologically, I can’t imagine that they funded an open effort to concentrate [machine learning] talent so that they could then go build a closed, for-profit thing on its back.""

Notes from a Microsoft meeting in October 2020 show the company discussed effectively owning OpenAI and considered Musk’s perspective on what they referred to as a closed OpenAI.

OpenAI is now valued at roughly $500 billion and among the world’s most prominent AI companies.

Musk, who resigned from OpenAI’s board in February 2018 and has since launched a competing AI venture called xAI, has become one of the company’s most vocal critics.

Representatives for Musk, Sam Altman and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/03/musk-vs-altman.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2026-01-16 03:59:25.121555

“IBM Sovereign Core offers an AI-ready sovereign stack, providing organizations with control, ensuring compliance and operational autonomy.
Unlike approaches that layer sovereignty controls onto existing architectures, Sovereign Core makes sovereignty an inherent property of the software itself.
“The sovereign AI conversation has focused on data residency, but that’s only part of the equation,” said Sanjeev Mohan, Principal, SanjMo.
“IBM Sovereign Core addresses the harder question: who controls the system and can you prove it to regulators?","IBM announced, the industry’s first AI-ready sovereign-enabled software for enterprises, governments and service providers to build, deploy and manage AI-ready sovereign environments. Organizations around the world are facing a growing imperative to exercise control over their technology infrastructure. Driven by evolving regulatory requirements, and the need for auditable governance, enterprises and governments are seeking self-managed environments where they maintain complete operational authority, particularly as they deploy AI workloads that amplify sovereignty concerns.

Digital sovereignty goes beyond data residency. It encompasses who operates and controls the technology environment, how data is accessed and governed, where workloads execute, and under whose jurisdiction AI models run. Yet most organizations lack a destination to land, modernize, and re-host applications under sovereign control, including applications that will incorporate AI capabilities, and have continuous compliance reporting capabilities. “Gartner predicts that more than 75% of all enterprises will have a digital sovereignty strategy by 2030, often sovereign cloud strategies1.”

“As AI adoption accelerates in India, businesses will need to innovate while meeting tightening regulatory requirements and controlling sensitive data and AI workloads. It is crucial as large language models and agentic workflows often process sensitive data, and maintaining local authority is essential for confident AI adoption,” said Sandip Patel, Managing Director, IBM India & South Asia. “IBM Sovereign Core offers an AI-ready sovereign stack, providing organizations with control, ensuring compliance and operational autonomy. It is designed for flexibility and is part of our long-standing commitment to empowering clients with an open hybrid cloud approach. Sovereignty solutions built on open-source foundations and open standards helps ensure organisations are not ‘locked in’ to infrastructure or ‘locked out’ of entering the innovation ecosystem.”

IBM Sovereign Core will help customers achieve verifiable sovereignty and full operational control. Sovereign Core is purpose-built software to build, deploy, and manage cloud-native and AI workloads under an organization’s own authority, within chosen jurisdictions, built on Red Hat’s open source foundation. Unlike approaches that layer sovereignty controls onto existing architectures, Sovereign Core makes sovereignty an inherent property of the software itself. Organizations can gain:

Customer-operated control plane: organizations maintain direct operational authority over software operations, deployment decisions, and system configurations without intermediation from a vendor not in region.

In-boundary identity and keys: all authentication, authorization, encryption keys, and access management remain within jurisdiction boundaries under customer control.

Ongoing compliance enablement and generated evidence of continuous compliance: comprehensive operational data, system telemetry, and audit trails are generated, stored, and managed within the sovereign boundary, including automated identity.

Governed AI inference: AI model deployment and hosting, local GPU clusters, local inference execution and agent operations occur under local governance with traceability and oversight, without exporting data to external providers.

Ease of deployment: delivering sovereignty at scale with consistency and flexibility allowing organizations to stand up isolated environments with built-in multitenancy capabilities within a matter of days of deployment; choice of hardware and infrastructure.

“The sovereign AI conversation has focused on data residency, but that’s only part of the equation,” said Sanjeev Mohan, Principal, SanjMo. “IBM Sovereign Core addresses the harder question: who controls the system and can you prove it to regulators? IBM takes a holistic approach spanning data, operations, technology, and assurance, with continuous monitoring. As AI moves into production, that kind of ongoing accountability becomes non-negotiable.”

“AI is accelerating the pace at which sovereignty questions move from theory to daily operations,” said Erik Fish, Director of Geotechnology at Eurasia Group. “As geopolitics, regulation, and data governance increasingly converge, governments and enterprises must move while demonstrating clear control over critical data and infrastructure. The challenge is no longer a trade-off between openness and sovereignty, but governing data, access, and infrastructure amid growing regulatory and geopolitical constraints.”

Customers can deploy IBM Sovereign Core in the environment of their choice – whether in on-premises data centers, supported in-region cloud infrastructure or through IT Service Providers. IBM is collaborating with IT Service Providers globally, starting with an initial rollout in Europe with Cegeka in Belgium and the Netherlands and Computacenter in Germany. These partnerships allow local operational independence and compliance management, while enabling IT Service Providers to offer differentiated sovereign services to enterprises preparing for and running AI-scale workloads.

“As organizations navigate increasingly complex compliance and regulatory requirements, we’re seeing strong demand for digital platforms and software that allows sensitive data to remain within controlled, compliant boundaries,” said Gaetan Willems, VP Cloud & Digital Platforms, Cegeka. “Partnering with IBM to offer a pre-architected solution through our in-country environment enables us to deliver enterprise-ready software to our clients, while allowing them to address local compliance standards.”",https://etedge-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IBM.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 12:04:57.301120

Driverless hazmat trucking is now a live federal rulemaking issue — PHMSA’s HM‑266 ANPRM spotlights what changes when no trained human operator is on scene (and what tank fleets should prioritize in their comments).

Electronic shipping papers + emergency response information look like the first high-impact modernization — because first responders and inspectors still need fast, verifiable access to hazmat details when the cab is empty.

Security plans, cybersecurity, and hazmat employee training are likely to extend beyond the driver — toward remote operations centers, telematics workflows, and clearer “who is accountable” definitions that over-the-road tank stakeholders can shape now.

PHMSA is gathering industry input in HM‑266 on how hazmat compliance should work in highly automated transportation systems.

Driverless hazmat trucking has moved from concept-stage debate to an active federal regulatory question — and PHMSA is now openly asking how the Hazardous Materials Regulations should function when there may be no human operator at the scene. That single change ripples through nearly every “routine” hazmat assumption: who presents shipping papers, who secures a scene, who detects a developing leak, who communicates with first responders, and who is accountable for actions that used to be performed by a trained driver at the equipment. For more news and updates on PHMSA’s regulatory initiatives, see our PHMSA coverage.

PHMSA’s December 4, 2025, Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) is not an approval of autonomous hazmat operations. It is also not a ban. It is, however, a clear signal that driverless hazmat trucking is being evaluated in the same regulatory frame as drones, delivery robots, and other highly automated transportation systems — and that the agency is mapping where the current rules rely on human presence, where they can be modernized, and where safety expectations may need to rise rather than relax. For additional insights into this ANPRM and related regulatory moves, visit our ANPRM archive.

For tank truck carriers, shippers of bulk liquids, third-party logistics firms, and the technology companies building automated driving systems, the practical takeaway is simple: the government is inviting detailed, operationally grounded input right now. Comments on Docket PHMSA‑2024‑0064 (HM‑266) are due March 4, 2026. The quality of those comments will influence what PHMSA proposes later — and how quickly the industry sees movement on electronic documentation, remote emergency response information access, security plans, training definitions, and loading/unloading controls. To stay current on coverage tied to day-to-day tank operations and regulation, see our TankTransport reporting.

Driverless hazmat trucking: What PHMSA is asking in the ANPRM

USDOT’s PHMSA is exploring how hazardous materials rules may need to adapt when commercial vehicles operate without an on-scene driver.

PHMSA’s ANPRM (HM‑266) sits in the HMR ecosystem (49 CFR Parts 171–180) and asks stakeholders to identify regulatory barriers, safety gaps, and workable modernization options for highly automated transportation systems. For hazardous transport stakeholders, several question clusters matter more than others because they are unavoidable if a cab is empty.

1) Special permits as the near-term bridge – PHMSA acknowledges that innovators have historically used special permits to conduct operations that do not cleanly fit existing rules. The special permit pathway effectively acts as a “controlled exposure” mechanism: PHMSA can allow limited, monitored activity while gathering evidence. For driverless hazmat trucking, special permits are likely to remain a key bridge while the agency evaluates more permanent rules.

For industry players, that means two practical choices:

Treat special permits as a temporary workaround and wait.

Or treat special permits as a design constraint and build operations that can be safely permissioned and audited.

A detail worth emphasizing: special permits are not just paperwork; they are a forcing function. They push operators to define controls, reporting, and limitations precisely enough for PHMSA to evaluate.

2) Shipping papers and emergency response information without a driver – PHMSA is explicitly probing what happens when there is no one to hand an officer or firefighter a document packet. This is one of the most immediate and solvable problems, and therefore one of the most likely early areas of regulatory change.

The operational reality for tank fleets is blunt: if a driverless tractor-tank combination is involved in an incident, the responder’s first minute is about hazard identification, isolation distances, ignition sources, and exposure risk. If the load is misidentified, everything downstream can worsen. So PHMSA is pressing for solutions that maintain speed, accuracy, and security of information access.

3) Hazard communication when the “human explanation layer” disappears – Placards and markings remain a core external safety layer. Still, responders often rely on a trained driver to confirm details and explain status (e.g., “no leak observed,” “valves closed,” “product is stabilized,” “vapor cloud present,” “I shut off pump”). In driverless hazmat trucking, that information has to come from somewhere else: sensors, remote operators, or incident notification systems. PHMSA’s questioning points toward a world where hazard communication becomes partly physical (placards) and partly digital (trusted, immediate data access).

4) Training and the redefinition of who is responsible – PHMSA’s hazmat employee training regime is foundational. Automation does not eliminate human responsibility; it redistributes it. A remote operations center employee supervising autonomous trucks might, for particular duties, become functionally analogous to a driver. A dock operator may become responsible for tasks a driver used to perform. Even software changes might need human sign-off in a safety management system.

This raises a practical question that the ANPRM effectively asks: Who counts as the hazmat employee in a distributed autonomous operation, and what training do they need to meet the spirit of the HMR?

5) Security plans and cybersecurity – PHMSA’s security planning requirements already exist for specific materials and operations. Automation tightens the loop between security planning and cybersecurity. If an automated driving system or remote communications channel is compromised, the risk profile changes. PHMSA is signaling openness to revisiting expectations for security plans in light of remote connectivity and unattended operations.

Cybersecurity is not just IT. It becomes part of hazmat safety engineering. A hacked vehicle carrying hazardous materials is not a generic cyber event; it is a potential public safety incident. For more reporting tied to cyber risk, operational resilience, and connected-fleet exposure, see our Cybersecurity coverage.

6) Packaging, loading, and unloading as “system interfaces.”

Bulk hazmat moves still hinge on packaging integrity and hazard communication — PHMSA is now evaluating how those pillars translate to automated operations.

Tank packaging standards and loading/unloading procedures are not abstract; they are where releases begin. In conventional operations, drivers often serve as a procedural checkpoint. Remove that checkpoint, and the facility or automated equipment must absorb it. PHMSA is asking where the current rules assume human verification and how that should be replaced.

This is the area where stakeholders can provide the most valuable “ground truth,” because tank loading practices vary widely by commodity and facility. If the endgame is driverless hazmat trucking, then the entire transfer process must be designed for safety, assuming no experienced driver is present to notice abnormalities, stop a transfer, or intervene.

Driverless hazmat trucking: Which hazmat pillars break without a human?

PHMSA’s ANPRM effectively spotlights a set of “hazmat pillars” that are stable in human-operated transport but become fragile in an autonomous environment. For an industry-insider audience, it helps to describe these pillars as specific, testable failure modes rather than general topics.

Pillar A: Documentation access and authenticity – A responder needs the correct information fast. An inspector needs verifiable compliance evidence. A carrier needs a record that survives litigation. A shipper needs assurance that the right product is declared and handled. If the documentation is digital, you must solve: access control, offline resilience, authenticity, and auditability.

Pillar B: Scene stabilization – In traditional discussions of driverless hazmat trucking, people jump straight to collision avoidance. But hazmat outcomes often hinge on what happens after the vehicle stops moving: the first minutes of scene control, ignition source management, establishment of the isolation perimeter, and leak confirmation. A driver often does some of this by training and instinct. Without a driver, the system must provide a substitute: alerting, remote assessment, clear responder interfaces, and safe states (valves, brakes, shutdown).

Pillar C: Role clarity and accountability – Who is responsible for ensuring the shipping paper is accurate? Who is responsible for hazard communication? Who is responsible for monitoring an abnormal condition mid-route? If multiple humans touch the operation across time and distance (shipper, loader, remote supervisor, safety manager), PHMSA will need an enforceable accountability model. Industry can either help define that model now, or risk having a model imposed later that does not match operational reality.

Pillar D: Security resilience – Hazmat security planning has traditionally focused on theft, diversion, and misuse. Automation adds remote access pathways and software dependencies. The security pillar becomes a joint physical-cyber domain: cameras, locks, geofencing, command authentication, incident escalation, and tamper detection.

Pillar E: Transfer safety (loading/unloading) – Bulk transfer is where minor errors become significant events. If you want driverless hazmat trucking to scale, the transfer process must be engineered to prevent wrong product loading, wrong compartment loading, overfill, hose failure, mis-valving, and incompatible connections, without relying on a driver to act as the last manual check.

These pillars are why PHMSA’s ANPRM is a big deal to tank transportation: it invites the industry to say, in detail, how to rebuild each pillar.

Driverless hazmat trucking: How could electronic shipping papers and ER info work?

Electronic shipping papers are often discussed as a convenience upgrade. For driverless hazmat trucking, they are closer to a prerequisite. But “electronic” is not a single design; it is a set of architectural choices with safety consequences.

A practical, enforceable approach tends to include several features:

1) Multiple access paths (because networks fail) – If a responder must access emergency response information, the system should not depend on a single cellular carrier, cloud provider, or device. Industry comments that propose resilient access, such as cached information in a secure onboard module plus a remote database, are more credible than comments that assume always-on connectivity.

2) Authentication and least-privilege access – A significant objection to naive digital shipping paper concepts is that they could expose sensitive information to unauthorized parties. If a system allows anyone to retrieve detailed hazmat data via a simple QR code, it may increase security risks. A more balanced approach is role-based access: first responders and inspectors can obtain details quickly through verified channels, while the general public can only see limited hazard class indicators already available on placards.

3) Fast retrieval under stress – In real incidents, responders do not want an app that requires multiple logins, multi-step navigation, and perfect connectivity. The winning design will be the one that works in gloves, rain, smoke, and noise.

4) Clear mapping to the Emergency Response Guidebook model – Responders often think in ERG terms: ID number, guide number, isolation distances, and immediate hazards. Electronic emergency response information should mirror how responders actually operate, not how shippers store data.

5) Audit trail and legal defensibility – For compliance and post-incident investigations, digital systems should log who accessed shipping information, what changed, and when. If a shipper updates a shipping description, the platform should retain the full revision trail so inspectors and investigators can verify exactly what was available at the time of transport.

Electronic shipping papers also solve a practical gap: they can speed first-responder access and reduce documentation errors across conventional fleets, while also enabling the unique requirements of driverless hazmat trucking**.

Driverless hazmat trucking: How will emergency response and scene control work?

This is the “hard part” that separates a plausible policy conversation from a marketing narrative.

Driverless hazmat trucking policy ultimately gets measured at the scene: responder access, secure shutdown, and clear accountability when something goes wrong.

If a driverless tank truck is involved in a crash, several questions arise immediately:

What alerts first responders — automatically and with enough detail?

A driver typically calls it in. Without a driver, the system must detect abnormal events and trigger a notification. A credible model may include automatic crash detection, rollover detection, valve position sensors, pressure/vacuum monitoring, and leak detection tied to an incident notification workflow.

Who communicates with responders in real time?

A remote operations center could provide a communications bridge. But that only helps if responders can reach it quickly and it has actionable information, not generic scripts. You can position the remote operations center as the “digital driver,” but then training and accountability become central.

How does the vehicle enter a safe state?

In a conventional operation, a driver may shut down the engine, set the brakes, and close the valves. In driverless hazmat trucking, you need engineered safe states: automatic shutdown logic, protected emergency stop functions, and perhaps remote disable features designed to prevent misuse while enabling responders to control risk.

How do responders secure the scene if the vehicle can move or behave unpredictably?

If an automated driving system is damaged but still powered, responders need a standard way to confirm the vehicle will not move. Industry often discusses “first responder interaction guides” for automated vehicles; PHMSA’s ANPRM provides a forcing function to align that concept with hazmat realities.

What about secondary risks — fire, ignition sources, or incompatible exposures?

A tank truck incident is not only about the product; it’s about the environment. Many serious hazmat events involve compounded factors: collisions, fires, nearby vehicles, weather, drainage, population density, and time-to-response. Automation must fit that reality rather than pretend it away.

“How will firefighters get shipping papers if there is no driver?”

“Who do responders call if an autonomous hazmat truck crashes?”

“Can an inspector place an autonomous truck out of service?”

“What happens if connectivity is lost in a remote area?”

Those are not rhetorical questions; they are the operational acceptance tests for driverless hazmat trucking. For more reporting tied to deployment realities and policy friction points, explore our AutonomousTrucks archive.

Driverless hazmat trucking: What should fleets, shippers, and tech firms do now?

PHMSA’s ANPRM spotlights a practical question: how do responders get accurate hazmat details fast when there’s no driver to brief them?

The ANPRM stage is where PHMSA is collecting raw operational data, precisely the kind of information tank fleets can provide better than anyone else.

As HM‑266 develops, the most consequential stakeholder input tends to be operational: specific scenarios, measurable safety outcomes, and enforceable controls. For OTR tank stakeholders, the themes below are most likely to shape what PHMSA can credibly modernize — and the conditions that could attach to any future automated hazmat moves.

1) Define “no human present” scenarios and the minimum control set – Driverless hazmat trucking raises predictable “no on-scene operator” situations that regulators, enforcement, and responders will use as real-world test cases. Examples include:

Rollover with product release risk

Minor collision with uncertain leak status

Disabled vehicle on the shoulder

Loss of GPS or connectivity mid-route

Attempted tampering during a stop

Loading rack abnormal event (overfill alarm, hose rupture)

Across those scenarios, regulators will look for layered controls that are understandable at the scene and auditable after the fact: detection, notification, a defined safe state, a responder-facing interface, and a clear accountability chain.

2) Favor performance-based outcomes that can be verified – Where technology and operating models vary, performance-based requirements can be easier to implement and enforce than a single prescriptive design. In driverless hazmat trucking, this often translates into outcomes such as “emergency response information is accessible to authorized responders within a defined time under degraded connectivity,” rather than mandating a specific platform or vendor architecture.

3) Modernize electronic shipping papers without creating a security exposure – Electronic shipping papers and emergency response information are central to HM‑266 because the driver cannot serve as the “human distribution mechanism” for documents. Any credible approach must balance speed of access with security and integrity. Stakeholder submissions frequently emphasize:

Access control and authentication for responders and inspectors

Offline and degraded-mode operation (including caching and redundancy)

Cybersecurity practices and incident response expectations

Auditability and record retention (including revision history)

Standardized data fields that support interoperability

4) Treat remote operations centers as safety-critical functions – If remote personnel will supervise, intervene, or communicate with first responders, regulators are likely to evaluate the remote operations center as part of the safety case — not as a back-office convenience. Expect scrutiny around:

Training requirements for remote operators as hazmat employees (where duties align)

Staffing, fatigue management, and escalation coverage

Authority boundaries and intervention protocols

Logging requirements for decisions, alerts, and interventions

Secure communications and access management

5) Address loading/unloading explicitly, with tank-specific operating detail – For bulk liquids, transfer operations are often where risk concentrates, and driver involvement varies by facility and commodity. If driverless hazmat trucking is contemplated beyond limited highway segments, PHMSA and the industry will need clarity on what changes at the rack and at the customer site — especially where drivers currently serve as a procedural checkpoint. Common focus areas include:

Which tasks shift to facility control versus carrier control

What automation is already in place (interlocks, overfill prevention, emergency shutdown)

What additional safeguards are required when no driver is present

How to prevent wrong-product or wrong-compartment events

How to manage abnormal events and stop-transfer authority

6) Build for responder and enforcement usability, not just system capability – At the incident scene and during roadside inspections, usability is a safety feature. Regulators and responders will focus on whether information and control pathways are clear, fast, and reliable without a driver. Practical expectations that surface repeatedly include:

A standardized way to confirm the vehicle cannot move and to place it in a safe state

Fast, verifiable access to shipping papers and emergency response information

Clear placarding/identifiers that support digital lookup without increasing public exposure

Reliable contact pathways to a trained support function (e.g., a monitored operations center)

Joint familiarization or exercises with local responders where operations are planned

7) Expect phased change: documentation and security first, full autonomy later – Many of the earliest regulatory changes under HM‑266 are more likely to involve documentation, data access, and security expectations — because they strengthen today’s hazmat operations and also address the “no driver with paperwork” problem. Broader permissions or assumptions for unattended hazmat operations, especially involving loading/unloading, are likely to take longer and require clearer evidence and enforceable safeguards.

8) Watch the parallel tracks that will determine real-world feasibility – PHMSA is only one part of the operating environment. FMCSA decisions on operational safety requirements and exemptions, state-level autonomous vehicle rules, and evolving expectations around cybersecurity and connected-vehicle safety can all influence what is practicable, even if hazmat rules modernize. For fleets and shippers planning investments, those parallel tracks are often as decisive as the HMR changes themselves.

Where Driverless Hazmat Trucking Rules Are Headed

Key Developments:

PHMSA launched HM‑266 (Docket PHMSA‑2024‑0064) via ANPRM on December 4, 2025, formally opening the door to HMR modernization for highly automated transportation systems, including highway freight.

Comment deadline is March 4, 2026, creating a near-term window for tank fleets, shippers, and technology providers to influence PHMSA’s problem framing before an NPRM is drafted.

Scope spans the core HMR architecture (49 CFR Parts 171–180), not a single narrow fix, meaning future updates could touch documentation, hazmat employee training, security plans, packaging, and transfer operations.

PHMSA is explicitly stress-testing “human-dependent” compliance steps, especially:

Shipping papers & emergency response information when there is no driver to present documents or call for help.

Hazard communication effectiveness when the “human explanation layer” disappears.

Training definitions when operational responsibilities shift to remote staff and facility personnel.

Security plans + cybersecurity as remote connectivity and unattended equipment change threat models.

Loading/unloading controls where tank-transfer risk is often highest.

Special permits remain the practical bridge in the near term, signaling that pilots and controlled deployments may continue while permanent rules are evaluated.

Highway autonomy is being treated as a cross-agency issue, with PHMSA’s hazmat framework intersecting FMCSA operational safety rules and the real-world enforceability needs of roadside inspection and incident response.

Early regulatory movement is most likely to start with “data and documentation,” because digital shipping papers, authenticated responder access, and standardized emergency response information can improve safety for conventional fleets and enable the prerequisites for driverless hazmat trucking.

Tank-specific realities are implicitly in play (bulk surge, rollover sensitivity, transfer interfaces, abnormal event handling), making OTR tank stakeholder comments uniquely valuable compared to generic autonomous trucking input.

Enforcement and responder usability are emerging as acceptance tests, not afterthoughts: any viable approach must keep inspections, out-of-service authority, and incident command workable without relying on a driver.

(1)Because dealers who purchase the Notes for sale to certain fee-based advisory accounts may forgo some or all selling concessions, fees or commissions, the public offering price for investors purchasing the Notes in such fee-based advisory accounts may be between $992.50 and $1,000 per Note. Investors that hold their Notes in fee-based advisory or trust accounts may be charged fees by the investment advisor or manager of such account based on the amount of assets held in those accounts, including the Notes.

(2)Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, based on our internal pricing models, is expected to be between $901.20 and $981.20 per Note. The estimated value is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. See “Additional Information Regarding Our Estimated Value of the Notes” on page PS–5 of this pricing supplement.

(3)Barclays Capital Inc. will receive commissions from the Issuer of up to $7.50 per $1,000 principal amount Note. Barclays Capital Inc. will use these commissions to pay variable selling concessions or fees (including custodial or clearing fees) to other dealers. The actual commission received by Barclays Capital Inc. will be equal to the selling concession paid to such dealers.

Investing in the Notes involves a number of risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page S-9 of the prospectus supplement and “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-12 of this pricing supplement.

The Notes will not be listed on any U.S. securities exchange or quotation system. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these Notes or determined that this pricing supplement is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

The Notes constitute our unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. The Notes are not deposit liabilities of Barclays Bank PLC and are not covered by the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme or insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency or deposit insurance agency of the United States, the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction.

CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES

The range of the estimated values of the Notes referenced above may not correlate on a linear basis with the range of any other term of the Notes as may be set forth in this pricing supplement. We determined the size of such range based on prevailing market conditions, as well as the anticipated duration of the marketing period for the Notes. The final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public, which we refer to as the Initial Valuation Date, based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the Initial Valuation Date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement.

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates, and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes may be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is a result of several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes.

Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately six months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes which we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-12 of this pricing supplement.

You may revoke your offer to purchase the Notes at any time prior to the Initial Valuation Date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the Notes prior to the Initial Valuation Date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.

SELECTED PURCHASE CONSIDERATIONS

The Notes are not appropriate for all investors. The Notes may be an appropriate investment for you if all of the following statements are true:

●You do not seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and you can tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates.

●You understand and accept that you will not participate in any appreciation of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, and that your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes.

●You can tolerate a loss of a significant portion or all of the principal amount of your Notes, and you are willing and able to make an investment that may have the full downside market risk of an investment in the Least Performing Reference Asset.

●You do not anticipate that the Closing Value of any Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on any Observation Date or below its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date.

●You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure.

●You are willing and able to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset.

●You understand and accept the risks that (a) you will not receive a Contingent Coupon if the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date and (b) you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value.

●You understand and accept the risk that, if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, the payment at maturity, if any, will be based solely on the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset.

●You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets.

●You are willing and able to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity and that you may not be able to reinvest your money in an alternative investment with comparable risk and yield.

●You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the Reference Assets.

●You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed.

●You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes.

●You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority.

The Notes may not be an appropriate investment for you if any of the following statements are true:

●You seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and/or you cannot tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates.

●You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of any or all of the Reference Assets rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes.

●You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose some or all of the principal amount of the Notes in the event that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset falls below its Barrier Value.

●You anticipate that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will decline during the term of the Notes such that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more Observation Dates and/or the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Barrier Value.

●You are unwilling or unable to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and/or do not understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset.

●You do not understand and/or are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets.

●You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE ON A SINGLE CONTINGENT COUPON PAYMENT DATE

The following examples demonstrate the circumstances under which you may receive a Contingent Coupon on a hypothetical Contingent Coupon Payment Date. The numbers appearing in these tables are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. These examples do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions:

■Hypothetical Initial Value of each Reference Asset: 100.00*

■Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)*

*The hypothetical Initial Value of 100.00 and the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and do not represent a likely Initial Value or Coupon Barrier Value for any Reference Asset. The actual Initial Value for each Reference Asset will be equal to its Closing Value on the Initial Valuation Date and the actual Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset will be equal to 70.00% of its Initial Value.

Example 1: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date.

Reference Asset

Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date

RTY Index

100.00

NDX Index

75.00

SPX Index

80.00

Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its respective Coupon Barrier Value, you will receive a Contingent Coupon of $7.708 (0.7708% of the principal amount per Note) on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date.

Example 2: The Closing Value of one Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date and the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date.

Reference Asset

Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date

RTY Index

Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date.

Example 3: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date.

Reference Asset

Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date

RTY Index

68.00

NDX Index

SPX Index

45.00

Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date.

Examples 2 and 3 demonstrate that you may not receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is below its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes.

Example 2: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 140.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is 90.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 105.00.

Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date).

Example 3: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 70.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is 65.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 60.00.

Because Reference Asset C has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset C is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold. Because, however, the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date.

Example 4: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 135.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is 50.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 110.00.

Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $500.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + [$1,000 × Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset]

$1,000 + [$1,000 × -50.00%] = $500.00

In addition, because the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date.

Example 4 demonstrates that if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your investment in the Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You will not benefit in any way from the Reference Asset Return of any other Reference Asset being higher than the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset.

If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, you may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. Any payment on the Notes, including the repayment of principal, is subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC.

SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS

An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Assets or their components, if any. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

●Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss — The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes.

●Potential Return is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of Any Reference Asset — The potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes. You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, even though you will be exposed to the depreciation in the value of the Least Performing Reference Asset if the Notes are not redeemed and the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value.

●You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes — The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the related Observation Date is greater than or equal to its respective Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its respective Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes.

●Because the Notes Are Linked to the Least Performing Reference Asset, You Are Exposed to Greater Risks of No Contingent Coupons and Sustaining a Significant Loss of Principal at Maturity Than If the Notes Were Linked to a Single Reference Asset — The risk that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and lose a significant portion or all of your principal amount in the Notes at maturity is greater if you invest in the Notes as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of a single Reference Asset. With multiple Reference Assets, it is more likely that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the specified Observation Dates or less than its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date, and therefore, it is more likely that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and that you will suffer a significant loss of principal at maturity. Further, the performance of the Reference Assets may not be correlated or may be negatively correlated. The lower the correlation between multiple Reference Assets, the greater the potential for one of those Reference Assets to close below its Coupon Barrier Value or Barrier Value on an Observation Date or the Final Valuation Date, respectively.

It is impossible to predict what the correlation among the Reference Assets will be over the term of the Notes. The Reference Assets represent different equity markets. These different equity markets may not perform similarly over the term of the Notes.

Although the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance may change over the term of the Notes, the Contingent Coupon rate is determined, in part, based on the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance calculated using our internal models at the time when the terms of the Notes are finalized. A higher Contingent Coupon is generally associated with lower correlation of the Reference Assets, which reflects a greater potential for missed Contingent Coupons and for a loss of principal at maturity.

●You Are Exposed to the Market Risk of Each Reference Asset — Your return on the Notes is not linked to a basket consisting of the Reference Assets. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each Reference Asset. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to each Reference Asset. Poor performance by any Reference Asset over the term of the Notes may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by any increases or lesser declines in the value of any other Reference Asset. To receive a Contingent Coupon, the Closing Value of each Reference Asset must be greater than or equal to its Coupon Barrier Value on the applicable Observation Date. In addition, if the Notes have not been redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will be exposed to the full decline in the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of each Reference Asset.

●The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk — Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The amount of any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes is based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Reference Assets. The amount of such coupon payments will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would have been had the expected volatility of the Reference Assets been lower. As volatility of a Reference Asset increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the Closing Value of that Reference Asset on one or more Observation Dates will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value and (b) the Final Value of that Reference Asset will be less than its Barrier Value.

Accordingly, you should understand that a higher coupon payment amount reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive coupon payments with respect to one or more Observation Dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the amount of such coupon payments been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than the expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive coupon payments and/or that you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above.

●Early Redemption and Reinvestment Risk — While the original term of the Notes is as indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity, as described above, and the holding period over which you may receive any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes could be as short as approximately six months.

The Redemption Price that you would receive on a Call Settlement Date, together with any coupon payments that you may have received prior to the Call Settlement Date, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after the relevant Call Settlement Date. The fact that the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold.

It is more likely that we will redeem the Notes at our sole discretion prior to maturity to the extent that the expected interest payable on the Notes is greater than the interest that would be payable on other instruments issued by us of comparable maturity, terms and credit rating trading in the market. We are less likely to redeem the Notes prior to maturity when the expected interest payable on the Notes is less than the interest that would be payable on other comparable instruments issued by us, which includes when the value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value. Therefore, the Notes are more likely to remain outstanding when the expected interest payable on the Notes is less than what would be payable on other comparable instruments and when your risk of not receiving a Contingent Coupon is relatively higher.

●Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the Dates Specified — Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Reference Assets determined at any other time.

●Contingent Repayment of Any Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Redemption — You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any redemption. Although the Notes provide for the contingent repayment of the principal amount of your Notes at maturity, provided that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, or upon any redemption, if you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of each Reference Asset has increased from its Initial Value. See “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below.

●Owning the Notes is Not the Same as Owning Any Reference Asset or Any Securities to which Any Reference Asset Provides Exposure — The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights that holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure may have.

●Tax Treatment — Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

●Credit of Issuer — The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.

●You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority — Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either

case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Reference Assets

●Historical Performance of the Reference Assets Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Reference Assets Over the Term of the Notes — The value of each Reference Asset has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of a Reference Asset is not an indication of the future performance of that Reference Asset over the term of the Notes. The historical correlation among the Reference Assets is not an indication of the future correlation among them over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Reference Assets individually or in comparison to each other over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of any Reference Asset.

●We May Accelerate the Notes If a Change-in-Law Event Occurs — Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the Notes or a Reference Asset or its components, or engaging in transactions in them, the Calculation Agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. However, if the Calculation Agent elects not to accelerate the Notes, the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

●Each Reference Asset Reflects the Price Return of the Securities Composing that Reference Asset, Not the Total Return — The return on the Notes is based on the performance of the Reference Assets, which reflects changes in the market prices of the securities composing the Reference Assets. The Reference Assets are not ""total return"" indices that, in addition to reflecting those price returns, would also reflect dividends paid on the securities composing that Reference Asset. Accordingly, the return on the Notes will not include such a total return feature.

●Adjustments to Any Reference Asset Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes — The sponsor of any Reference Asset may add, delete, substitute or adjust the securities composing that Reference Asset or make other methodological changes to that Reference Asset that could affect its value. The Calculation Agent will calculate the value to be used as the Closing Value of that Reference Asset in the event of certain material changes in or modifications to that Reference Asset. In addition, the sponsor of any Reference Asset may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of that Reference Asset at any time. Under these circumstances, the Calculation Agent may select a successor index that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to that Reference Asset or, if no successor index is available, the Calculation Agent will determine the value to be used as the Closing Value of that Reference Asset. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of any Reference Asset and, consequently, the value of the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

●The Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with Non-U.S. Securities Markets — Certain component securities of the NDX Index are issued by non-U.S. companies in non-U.S. securities markets. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities, such as the Notes, involve risks associated with the securities markets in the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities, including risks of volatility in those markets, governmental intervention in those markets and cross shareholdings in companies in certain countries. Also, there is generally less publicly available information about companies in some of these jurisdictions than there is about U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC, and generally non-U.S. companies are subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements and securities trading rules different from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws.

●The Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with Small Capitalization Stocks — The RTY Index tracks companies that are considered small-capitalization companies. These companies often have greater stock price volatility, lower trading volume and less liquidity than large-capitalization companies, and therefore securities linked to the RTY Index may be more volatile than an investment linked to an index with component stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less stable financially than large-capitalization companies and may depend on a small number of key personnel, making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies are often subject to less analyst coverage and may be in early, and less predictable, periods of their corporate existences. Such companies tend to have smaller revenues, less diverse product lines, smaller shares of their product or service markets, fewer financial resources and less competitive strengths than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

●We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Reference Assets or their components, if any. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Reference Assets and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, the Calculation Agent may be required to make discretionary judgements relating to the Reference Assets, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and this pricing supplement. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes is Expected to be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might be Lower if Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

●The Estimated Value of the Notes is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to be Inaccurate and May be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes — The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees,

commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you.

●The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy The Notes in the Secondary Market And the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements At All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes — Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes.

●Lack of Liquidity — The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your Notes to maturity.

●Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes — The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including:

othe market price of, dividend rate on and expected volatility of the Reference Assets or the components of the Reference Assets, if any;

ocorrelation (or lack of correlation) of the Reference Assets;

othe time to maturity of the Notes;

ointerest and yield rates in the market generally;

oa variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events;

osupply and demand for the Notes; and

oour creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.”

In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt.

Sale, exchange or redemption of a Note. Assuming the treatment described above is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including upon early redemption or redemption at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes (assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position referred to above). This gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss unless you hold the Notes for more than one year, in which case the gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the Notes at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your Notes between the time your right to a Contingent Coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the Contingent Coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your Notes prior to an Observation Date but that can be attributed to an expected Contingent Coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue.

As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Non-U.S. holders. Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat Contingent Coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes.",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2026-01-16 06:00:07.339594

Alshaya is one of the world’s largest brand franchise operators, offering an unparalleled choice of well-loved international brands to customers across the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe. From H&M and Starbucks to Shake Shack and The Cheesecake Factory, Alshaya operates more than 70 international brands with a simple mission: deliver the experiences customers want, with the brands they love, in the ways they choose.

Five years ago, Alshaya’s digital operations were as complex as its brand portfolio. Each brand had its own direction and the investment required to keep up with this was huge. At one point, the company was coordinating eight separate technology providers just to keep things moving. This fragmentation slowed production, created redundant workflows, and made it difficult to deliver consistent experiences across channels.

This wave of fleet renewal is poised to reshape the competitive landscape, with these carriers investing heavily in next-generation jets designed to enhance passenger comfort, fuel efficiency, and overall operational performance.

Globally, 793 commercial aircraft were delivered in December alone, with U.S. airlines securing a substantial portion of these new models. The influx of advanced Airbus aircraft, featuring cutting-edge technology and improved environmental performance, underscores a strategic commitment by major carriers to modernize their fleets and position themselves for growth in 2026 and beyond.

Fleet Expansion and Competitive Dynamics

Delta Air Lines: Strategic Growth Amid Competition

Delta Air Lines concluded 2025 by taking delivery of seven new Airbus jets in the final quarter, including A321neo, A220-300, and A350-900 models. These additions arrived just ahead of the busy holiday travel season, increasing capacity and offering passengers upgraded amenities. Over the course of the year, Delta received a total of 38 new aircraft, reflecting its dedication to operational efficiency and enhanced customer experience.

This ambitious fleet expansion occurs amid intensifying competition from low-cost carriers such as Frontier and JetBlue. While some investors remain optimistic about Delta’s strong on-time performance and profitability, others express caution due to the growing threat posed by budget rivals and the potential for shifting pricing strategies. In addition to its Airbus acquisitions, Delta is also focusing on expanding its premium cabin offerings, with new Boeing 787 Dreamliners set to join its fleet. This initiative aims to capture rising demand from both business and leisure travelers, potentially influencing broader market dynamics as competitors respond with their own strategic adjustments.

Frontier Airlines: Accelerated Growth in the Budget Sector

Frontier Airlines maintained its rapid expansion by taking delivery of ten new Airbus jets—including A320neo and A321neo models—in the last quarter of 2025. The Denver-based carrier is leveraging these fuel-efficient aircraft to reduce operating costs and increase seating capacity, thereby reinforcing its position in the ultra-low-cost market segment. Frontier’s aggressive fleet renewal signals confidence in sustained post-pandemic travel demand and suggests the potential for further consolidation among low-cost carriers as competition intensifies.

Industry Outlook

The surge in Airbus deliveries to Delta, Frontier, JetBlue, and American Airlines is transforming the U.S. aviation sector. As these airlines modernize their fleets, passengers can anticipate improved travel experiences and greater operational efficiency. However, the industry continues to face challenges stemming from economic uncertainty and evolving competitive pressures. Carriers are likely to adjust pricing and capacity strategies in response to these dynamics to safeguard their market positions.

As 2026 approaches, the impact of these record-setting aircraft orders will continue to influence the trajectory of U.S. air travel, establishing new standards for innovation and service in the skies.",https://pub-a51e4d676a044eb380faeff15def343e.r2.dev/c64e073ca81e47858e2bd366920bdcdb.avif,N,,2026-01-15 21:01:33.668523

The trial focused on tokenized bonds, covering delivery-versus-payment settlement, interest payouts, and redemption events. Banks acted as paying agents, custodians, and registrars. The success proves that digital assets can integrate with existing infrastructure, simplifying adoption for financial institutions.

This trial builds on Swift’s broader efforts in digital finance. Previous initiatives included ISO 20022 blockchain interoperability with HSBC, fiat and digital currency settlement with Citi, and digital asset exchange trials with Northern Trust and the Reserve Bank of Australia.

Swift Advances Tokenized Settlements With Major Banks

Swift also partnered with UBS Asset Management and Chainlink to bridge tokenized assets with traditional payment systems. These steps show a clear direction toward interoperable financial networks that span conventional and emerging technologies.

The trial saw SG-Forge, a blockchain subsidiary of Société Générale, employ digital assets and stablecoins in settling tokenized bonds. Other institutions that took part in this trial were BNP Paribas, acting as the paying agent, and Intesa Sanpaolo, acting as the custodian.

This trial proved that it is possible for tokenized bonds to employ financial messaging infrastructure without losing the benefits that come with blockchain technology.

In this way, financial institutions can move through digital assets without necessarily having extensive knowledge of blockchain technology. By managing multiple platform transactions as a unified process, Swift has managed to simplify the process of settlement and increase scalability in the market through interoperability and standardization of digital financial solutions.

Building a Shared Ledger for the Future

Swift’s trials having concluded, it is set to incorporate a blockchain-based ledger system into its existing architecture. The common ledger should help to achieve real-time and 24/7 cross-border payment capabilities.

This will ensure a safe environment for transactions, ensuring synchronization between the timing and results for all involved parties. The ledger system of Swift is based on its messaging and API platform and is expanding into the digital world.

State of play: Lurie framed his first year as mayor as a reset after a period of stalled progress on entrenched city challenges, casting progress on public safety and street conditions as the foundation of recovery.

He touted affordability as the next, harder chapter that will determine whether families and businesses can remain in the city long term.

Lurie — a Levi Strauss heir who ran on the promise of restoring public safety — cited broad improvements, noting falling crime and traffic deaths, rebounding police recruitment, fewer homeless encampments, and rising downtown foot traffic and office leasing.

To maintain momentum, he argued, the city must now prioritize turning those gains into lasting change.

What they're saying: ""Our recovery is underway — the work now is to make it durable for everyone,"" Lurie said while speaking to a crowd of supporters, city and state officials, and residents at Angelo J. Rossi Playground in the Richmond.

The big picture: Lurie's affordability-first message aligns him with a growing bloc of Democratic leaders nationwide prioritizing cost-of-living relief.

Zoom in: Lurie announced a wide-ranging plan called the ""Family Opportunity Agenda"" to make housing, child care, education, food, health care, and transportation costs more affordable for residents.

A central pillar of the plan is universal access to child care for San Francisco families with children under age 5. Starting this month, the city is expanding free and subsidized care at more than 500 providers citywide.

Families of four earning under $230,000 will qualify for free child care, while those making up to $310,000 will receive a 50% subsidy.

""When tech booms, opportunity grows, but so does anxiety about rising rents, displacement and a boom-and-bust cycle that has historically left far too many people behind,"" Lurie said. ""Opportunity and stability must rise together for every resident in every neighborhood.""

Zoom out: Lurie also hopes to stabilize public transit funding, push for more government changes like charter reform, simplify permitting processes and close the city's budget deficit.

Approach 2: Compagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin Société en commandite par actions Price vs Earnings

For a profitable business, the P/E ratio is a useful yardstick because it links what you pay for the shares to the earnings the company is already generating. It helps you gauge how many euros the market is willing to pay today for each euro of current earnings.

What counts as a “normal” or “fair” P/E depends on how the market views a company’s growth prospects and risk profile. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually means a lower multiple is more typical.

Michelin currently trades on a P/E of 13.38x. That sits below the Auto Components industry average P/E of 20.55x and also below the peer average of 17.92x. Simply Wall St’s proprietary Fair Ratio for Michelin is 12.69x. This Fair Ratio aims to estimate the P/E you would expect for the company after accounting for its earnings growth outlook, industry, profit margins, market value and risk characteristics. Because it is tailored to Michelin’s own fundamentals, it offers a more targeted reference point than broad industry or peer comparisons alone.

With the actual P/E of 13.38x slightly above the Fair Ratio of 12.69x, the shares look modestly expensive relative to this metric.

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce Narratives. Narratives are simply your story about a company connected directly to numbers like your fair value, revenue, earnings and margin assumptions, so that its business story, financial forecast and fair value all line up in one clear view.

On Simply Wall St, Narratives live on the Community page and are easy to use, even if you are not a valuation expert. They show you a fair value based on your assumptions and set that against the current price so you can decide whether the gap between value and price is large enough for you to consider buying or selling.

Narratives also update automatically when new information arrives, such as news or earnings. This means your view on Compagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin Société en commandite par actions can evolve in real time without you rebuilding a model from scratch. You can see, for example, how one investor might focus on a higher fair value closer to €43.00 based on confidence in premium mix and margins, while another might anchor around €28.00 because they are more cautious about competition, regulation and volume risks.

Broadening S&P 500 earnings growth expected in 2026

Tech sector's dominance challenged by valuation concerns and AI uncertainty

NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - After years of watching technology stocks drive the U.S. bull market, investors are betting the rally will broaden to industrial, healthcare and small-cap companies, with a chance they can catch up and assert market leadership.

Stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab, Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab and Broadcom (AVGO.O), opens new tab have buoyed the market's enduring rally, in which the S&P 500 (.SPX), opens new tab has risen over 90% since the bull market began more than three years ago.

But investors have become wary of expensive tech valuations amid uncertainty over the AI theme that propelled market gains, concerns that helped other stocks make inroads.

Shares of industrial, healthcare and small-cap companies have outperformed the S&P 500 since the end of October, while the tech sector has declined. That rotation was on display on Wednesday as the S&P 500 tech sector (.SPLRCT), opens new tab fell more steeply than broader market indexes.

""There is a lot of hope that this is going to be the year where we are going to see some true broadening of leadership,"" said Angelo Kourkafas, senior global investment strategist at Edward Jones. ""The conditions are likely in place for that broadening to happen, especially when you sprinkle in and consider elevated valuations, there are some pockets of value that can be found looking beyond technology.""

Fourth-quarter earnings reports in coming weeks will factor into the broadening trend's durability. A wide swath of sectors is expected to show solid profits in 2026.

""Strategists have been predicting better earnings for a long time, but I really think it has legs this year,"" said Nanette Abuhoff Jacobson, global investment strategist at Hartford Funds. ""We're starting to see the AI benefits filtering through to such a broad collection of sectors.""

'AVERAGE' S&P 500 STOCK NOT SO AVERAGE

Tech and tech-related stocks led much of the bull run that began in October 2022, just before the launch of chatbot ChatGPT that sparked enthusiasm for AI-linked shares.

Late last year, the trend began to turn. One factor has been concerns AI investments would not yield sufficient returns to justify elevated valuations, investors said.

""With some questions being raised on tech, investors are looking at, what are other areas that I could invest in,"" said Keith Lerner, chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services.

In another sign of broadening, the equal-weight version of the S&P 500 (.SPXEW), opens new tab, which is a gauge for the average stock in the index, has gained over 5% since the end of October. That tops a 1% rise for the standard S&P 500, which is more heavily influenced by heavyweight stocks.

EARNINGS GROWTH FOR ALL SECTORS

More expansive profit growth stands to support wider stock gains. Each of the 11 S&P 500 sectors is expected to show earnings up at least 7% this year, according to LSEG IBES.

Megacaps have been responsible for a huge chunk of earnings growth, but their advantage over smaller companies is shrinking. The ""Magnificent Seven,"" which includes Nvidia, Alphabet and Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab, are expected to grow earnings by 23.5% in 2026, against a 13% rise for the rest of the S&P 500, according to Tajinder Dhillon, head of earnings research at LSEG.

""If, in fact, that gap in earnings growth narrows between the Mag 7 and everyone else, I think we'll get a broadening,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Investment Management. ""If it doesn't, then it's likely the Mag 7 will continue to be leadership.""

In a report this week titled ""The Broadening Is Underway,"" Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson said the median S&P 500 stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 19 times, against a P/E of 22 for the cap-weighted index.

Improving valuations on top of strong earnings for the median or average stock could be a ""wildcard"" for 2026, Wilson said in the report.

TECH'S DOMINANT MARKET PRESENCE

To be sure, tech's massive presence - the sector accounts for one-third of the S&P 500's weight - means it likely will remain a force in U.S. stocks, while the market may struggle if tech falters.

Over the past decade, the S&P 500 has never gained at least 10% on an annualized basis when the tech sector has lagged the aggregate performance of the other 10 S&P 500 sectors during those periods, according to Citi Wealth.

Meanwhile, tech is generating outsized profits. The sector is expected to increase earnings by over 30% in 2026, against 15.5% for the S&P 500 overall.

After last year recommending clients overweight in ""growth"" stocks, which include tech and other AI-exposed names, Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers, said he has been suggesting to investors that they balance more with ""value"" stocks, which include financials and industrials.

But Matt Lyteson, IBM’s CIO and VP of technology platform transformation, said IBM has been a leader in AI for years.

Some analysts believe it’s more of a PR than a product problem.

The market has seen IBM “significantly” lag behind Microsoft in AI and cloud growth because of the focus on tailored solutions rather than scalable cloud services for the public, according to Seeking Alpha’s 2025 reporting.

Making a case. But Matt Lyteson, IBM’s CIO and VP of technology platform transformation, said IBM has been a leader in AI for years. His goal is to capitalize on IBM’s technology and scale it for the enterprise.

“We very quickly asked ourselves: ‘What does agentic AI look like at the enterprise scale, and what are we going to focus on?’” Lyteson said. “When we think about the enterprise context, the real value is doing these end-to-end workflows.”

Lyteson believes it’s “great” that companies can garner attention with AI consumer experiences, but enterprises have a totally different set of questions and concerns, including how to ensure agentic identity management, equality of interactions with team members, or safety with interactions.

“Those are all the things that IBM is addressing head on,” Lyteson said. “Quite frankly, the market’s ignoring that.”

What’s the issue? While Microsoft has Copilot and Google has Gemini, IBM isn’t driving AI adoption via a single product or platform, which can make it hard to determine its place in the AI conversation, according to Rick Villars, group vice president of worldwide research at IDC.

“What IBM does—how we assess their impact—is [that] their strength as an organization broadly is with larger enterprises globally,” Villars said. “They’re at the core of many businesses.”

But the broader market, Villars said, doesn’t have high visibility into IBM’s solutions or deployment, and therefore the company is judged by how effectively it helps customers navigate through the AI craze.

“It’s a complex story that they have, and so they have to deal with that…Because as they’ve pivoted as a company, they’re in midstream of story development,” Villars said. “They have a very loyal customer base of people who want to read the story and want to see the drafts and everything else, but go beyond that and to build that presence.”

Issues with Watson. IBM’s AI tool Watson, which could be seen as synonymous with Microsoft’s Copilot, was spun into existence almost 20 years ago as a platform for competing on Jeopardy!. In 2020, IBM released a beta version of Watson Assistant that acted as a chatbot, combining machine learning, transfer learning, and deep learning techniques onto a single platform.

IBM then released Watson Health in 2015, designed to help with cancer research and other healthcare challenges, which subsequently ran into significant challenges and was sold off parts to a private equity firm in 2022.

Now, IBM has Watsonx, an umbrella term for the company’s portfolio of AI products. As of December 2025, Watsonx can monitor agents at runtime, giving IT pros insight into how their agentic AI is performing and how users are interacting with it.

The old Watson, Villars said, is not the same as Watsonx: “While they’re very different, it does affect how people see what IBM was doing or is doing, so it’s something that they have to work hard to be very clear about what they’re explaining and what it is. I’d say it’s a challenge that they do face.”

What we can expect to come. There’s one area where IT professionals can expect to see IBM go more in-depth: data governance,which remains a key part of agentic AI.

Villars said this is more about data in motion, as a result of agentic AI focusing on “event-driven activity” (such as when a software or smartphone company tracks how people use a particular app).

“IBM has an amazing event stream…but they didn’t have a very AI-connected way of making that event information consumable,” Villars said. “I think you’re going to see announcements around how they can.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/6e46a9d6cee5cbeafe3f7505927f0df1dbbb09c7-5000x3327.jpg?rect=0,351,5000,2625&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2026-01-15 16:02:22.331440

01/15/2026 - 02:01 PM

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - January 15, 2026) - Masivo Silver Corp. (TSXV: MASS) (OTC Pink: GNYPF) (""Masivo"" or the ""Company"") reports that ongoing field operations at its newly optioned Cerro Colorado Project in Sonora, Mexico, will significantly ramp up with field crews, drill crews and equipment mobilizing to the project preparation for its 1500 meters Phase I drill program.

With environmental approvals in place and private property access agreement, current activities include rehabilitation of access routes, construction of drill pads, and site preparation required to support drilling. These steps represent the final stages of preparation prior to commencement of drilling.

Project Advancement Highlights and Ongoing Field Activities

Masivo is currently undertaking the following activities at Cerro Colorado:

Mobilized field crews, drill crews and required equipment to site

Rehabilitation of access routes to priority target areas

Construction of drill pads for the Phase I program

Secured drilling contractors and water-supply infrastructure

Finalizing logistics to support continuous drilling

The Phase I drill program has been designed to test a number of priority targets identified through surface sampling, geological mapping, and review of historical data. The Company's initial drill program is designed to test targets with strong potential for a silver discovery.

Historical Sampling Highlights and Geological Context

Historical records from the Consejo de Recursos Naturales No Renovables (now the Servicio Geológico Mexicano- SGM) document high grade Silver, Gold and base metal values from underground workings on the property.

A historical sample reportedly collected in November 1972 by Ing. Adalberto Vázquez P. from, what is now a collapsed tunnel, on the main mineralized structure returned values of 2,200 g/t silver (Ag) and 4.57 g/t gold (Au).

Approximately 400 meters northeast, a second historical sieve sample taken from mine dump material associated with another collapsed tunnel on the same concession reportedly returned values of 1,840 g/t silver (Ag), 4.8 g/t gold (Au), 3.06% copper (Cu), 4.5% lead (Pb) and 2.92% zinc (Zn).

These historical samples are selective in nature and may not be representative of broader mineralization. However, they provide geological context and support the presence of a multi-metal mineralizing system, which has informed current target selection.

Management Commentary

David Coburn, President and CEO of Masivo Silver Corp., commented:

""We are excited to launch our maiden drill program at Cerro Colorado. After significant effort compiling historical information, completing detailed geological mapping, and carrying out systematic sampling, we have selected what we believe are the most geologically compelling targets. There is scale potential as seen with the historical sampling over a large mineral system footprint. The upcoming drill program is designed to test these targets for the potential to make a Silver discovery.""

Senior Geologist Jorge Rafael Gallardo added:

""The historic samples at Cerro Colorado clearly demonstrate that this is a productive mineral system capable of returning high grades over a significant footprint . While these results are selective and historical in nature, they provide invaluable geological insight and strongly support our current targeting strategy. We are confident that the upcoming drill program is designed to properly evaluate the scale and continuity of this mineralized system.""

Technical Oversight

The Phase I drill program has been designed and will be carried out under the supervision of Jorge Rafael Gallardo, Senior Geologist, together with Mark Bailey, P.Geo., and Brian Brewer, P.Geo., who is the Qualified Person as defined under NI 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the technical content of this news release.

CEOs from JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon to Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan warned that interference with the outgoing Fed chair could undermine the foundation of the U.S. economy. Their comments come as President Donald Trump ramps up his public pressure on the Fed, which he has spent the past few months criticizing over its perceived reluctance to cut interest rates. Those efforts have included threatening to fire Powell and nominating loyalists to fill the central bank’s board vacancies.

The administration’s attempt to twist the Fed’s arm reached a crescendo earlier this week, when Powell revealed that the central bank had received subpoenas from the Department of Justice (DoJ) related to the $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed headquarters in Washington, D.C. According to Powell, the probe is a thinly veiled attempt to push for faster rate cuts. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,” he said in a statement.

Wall Street executives might not back all of Powell’s decisions. But one thing they broadly agree on is that the Fed’s autonomy is key to a sustainable economy—one free from short-term political pressures.

“Everyone we know believes in Fed independence,” said Dimon during a recent call with reporters. “Anything [that] chips away at that is probably not a great idea, and in my view will have the reverse consequences,” added the CEO, who noted that the DoJ’s investigation could eventually lead to higher inflation expectations and interest rates over time.

Dimon’s comments marked a departure from the executive’s earlier stance. He has managed to stay in Trump’s good graces by striking a more measured tone on policy disagreements. He also drew a rebuke from the President himself, who called the JPMorgan head “wrong” and suggested that Dimon “probably wants higher rates—maybe he makes more money that way.”

Much of Wall Street has sought to remain on Trump’s good side so far in his second term. But the President’s escalating attacks on the Fed appear to have crossed a line for many banking leaders, prompting an outpouring of support for Powell. Jeremy Barnum, JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, echoed Dimon earlier this week, telling reporters that “loss of Fed independence tends to lead to steeper yield curves and other damage to ongoing economic dynamism,” with the potential to harm both the U.S. economy and “global economic stability.”

Robin Vince, head of the Bank of New York Mellon, also criticized the investigation, calling it a “counter-productive” move that could put the bond market at risk. “Doing things that are going to detract from that agenda don’t seem like the best things to do now,” he said.

It is “fair game” to offer critical commentary on the Fed’s decisions, including whether policymakers are acting too quickly or too slowly, according to Moynihan. But the Bank of America CEO draws the line when it comes to threatening the central bank’s autonomy, which he described as essential to American prosperity. “An independent Fed provides an anchor in this country to a success that all of us believe in,” he told CNBC yesterday (Jan. 14).

Support for Powell has extended beyond sitting CEOs to former economic officials. More than a dozen past leaders, including former Fed chairs Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan, issued a statement on Jan. 12 warning that such attacks have “no place” in the U.S. They described the approach as akin to how “monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly.”",https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/GettyImages-2235991263.jpg?quality=80,N,,2026-01-15 17:03:05.297478

Instacart (NASDAQ:CART), the online grocery delivery service, saw its stock price drop by 3.3% during the afternoon trading session. This decline followed news that Kroger, a major grocery retailer, has expanded its delivery services through partnerships with Uber Eats and Postmates. With this move, Kroger now offers delivery from nearly 2,700 stores nationwide, including brands such as Ralphs and Fred Meyer. As a result, Kroger's full product lineup is now available on popular on-demand delivery platforms, putting it in direct competition with Instacart. Investors reacted with concern, fearing that this convenient alternative could erode Instacart’s share of the market, sending the stock to its lowest point in almost two months.

Market reactions to news can sometimes be exaggerated, and significant price drops may create opportunities to purchase strong companies at a discount. Is this a good moment to consider buying Instacart shares?

Understanding the Market’s Response

Instacart’s stock is known for its volatility, having experienced 18 swings of more than 5% over the past year. In this context, today’s decline suggests that investors view the latest news as significant, though not enough to fundamentally alter their outlook on the company.

The last notable movement occurred 24 days ago, when Instacart’s shares fell by 2.2% after the company announced the end of a controversial pricing strategy and agreed to pay $60 million to settle with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

This pricing strategy relied on artificial intelligence to display different prices for the same product to different customers. The practice was discontinued after consumer advocacy groups raised concerns, prompting an FTC investigation. The $60 million settlement addressed claims that Instacart misled customers by advertising free deliveries while still imposing mandatory service fees, and by enrolling users in its paid membership program without clear consent. These incidents have sparked questions about Instacart’s business ethics and customer trust.

Since the start of the year, Instacart’s stock has dropped 10.3%. At $39.40 per share, it currently trades 25.9% below its 52-week high of $53.15, reached in February 2025. Investors who purchased $1,000 of Instacart stock at its IPO in September 2023 would now see their investment grow to $1,169.

The reverse stock split removed the risk that the company could be delisted from the Nasdaq exchange for falling below the $1 per share minimum pricing requirement, but it was also followed by a substantial valuation pullback for the stock. While a higher share price can sometimes be attractive from a psychological standpoint for some investors, reverse stock splits are often followed by big sell-offs.

Lucid stock also lost ground following fundraising moves. In November, the company announced that it had completed sales of new stock. The company generated roughly $962.4 million in proceeds from the sale to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) and other institutional investors, and it used roughly $752.2 million to repurchase outstanding 1.25% convertible senior notes due to mature this year. While the share sale gave the company some extra flexibility, it once again had a dilutive impact for shareholders.

Why Lucid stock has continued to stall in 2026

At the beginning of 2026, Lucid published its Q4 and full-year production and delivery numbers for 2025. The company produced 18,378 vehicles last year and delivered 15,841 vehicles -- good for growth of 104% and 55%, respectively. While production has gone up dramatically, growth for deliveries appears to be decelerating.

On Jan. 6, Baird published new coverage on Lucid and maintained a neutral rating on the stock. On the other hand, the investment firm lowered its one-year price target on the stock from $17 per share to $14 per share.

Lucid stock has continued to lose ground in response to the underwhelming deliveries data and new analyst coverage. The stock has fallen 1.8% year to date despite the Nasdaq Composite index climbing 1.9% across the stretch.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F850620%2Fgettyimages-83077315-copy.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-15 18:03:50.167987

People are perfectly comfortable using generative AI at home.
Second is generative AI or natural language processing.
Machine learning and generative AI belong in the hands of everyday employees.
The rest will be left explaining to their boards why billions were spent for pennies in return.","Deloitte's 2025 analysis reveals that only 6% of organizations see AI deliver ROI within a year, while most projects take two to four years to break even, if they ever do. That gap between expectation and reality is quickly becoming a career risk. Boards are no longer asking whether AI is strategic. They are asking why the returns are missing and who is accountable.

The problem is that AI works, but our approach doesn't. In most organizations, AI is treated as a centralized, technical initiative. It lives in IT. It is managed by a small group of specialists. It is rolled out through long, expensive programs designed to ""transform the enterprise."" Frontline employees, the people who actually sell, operate, analyze, and serve customers, are largely spectators. That approach almost guarantees disappointment.

I see another dynamic at play as well: anxiety. People are perfectly comfortable using generative AI at home. They will ask the AI questions, plan trips, or explore ideas without hesitation. At work, that confidence evaporates. Employees worry about policies, compliance, making mistakes, or ""doing AI wrong."" So, they step back and wait for permission. Or worse, they wait for IT to solve everything for them.

The result is predictable. Projects balloon in scope. Timelines stretch to nine or 12 months. Budgets hit seven figures. And when the promised savings don't materialize, the initiative is labeled a failure. What makes this particularly frustrating is that, for the most part, the value of AI does not require moonshots.

One reason organizations overspend is that they lump all AI into a single, mysterious category. It helps to separate it into three distinct flavors.

First is machine learning. This is pattern recognition based on historical data, and by that I mean predictive maintenance, demand forecasting, and anomaly detection. If you already have data, these solutions can often be deployed in weeks, not years, for hundreds or thousands of dollars.

Second is generative AI or natural language processing. These tools work with text, ideas, images, and audio. They summarize documents, draft content, analyze proposals, generate reports, and automate knowledge work. Many of the highest-impact use cases I see cost less than a hundred dollars a month and save hours per employee every week.

Third is agentic AI. This is where systems plan and act autonomously. It is powerful, complex, and expensive. It requires technical expertise, careful rules, and real investment. This is the domain of IT and advanced teams.

The mistake is starting with the third flavor and ignoring the first two. Machine learning and generative AI belong in the hands of everyday employees. These are low-cost, low-risk tools with immediate returns. Saving even six or eight hours a week for a salesperson, analyst, or operations manager is real money. Time saved becomes time reinvested in customers, revenue, and better decisions. Multiply that across a workforce, and the ROI becomes obvious.

Agentic AI, meanwhile, should remain the playground for technical teams pursuing high-risk, high-reward innovation. Let IT chase the five percent opportunities. But do not bet the company on them.

In my time at Process Innovation, Inc. (PPI), I have watched organizations waste staggering amounts of money by assuming they need the Cadillac version of AI when a Schwinn would do just fine. Leaders chase massive savings targets, declare victory only if millions appear on the balance sheet, and overlook hundreds of small wins that compound into real advantage.

There is a counterargument, of course. Some believe that decentralizing AI is risky, that governance, security, and consistency demand tight control. Those concerns are valid. But control does not have to mean paralysis. Paid, secure tools trained on internal data are far safer and more effective than pretending employees won't experiment anyway.

The bigger risk is doing nothing or doing everything at once. Right now, many companies are effectively gambling on their slim chance of success. They are buying Powerball tickets and calling it a strategy. A far smarter approach is to fund dozens or hundreds of small experiments, each tied to a real business problem, each with clear ownership and fast feedback.

If you want a practical starting point, give every employee a modest AI budget and a simple mandate: identify one task you do regularly and use AI to make it better. Support experimentation, reward results, and measure time saved and decisions improved, not just dollars spent.

The money being wasted on AI today is not inevitable. It is the consequence of poor framing, misplaced control, and unrealistic expectations. The organizations that fix this now, by decentralizing AI, empowering their people, and focusing on steady, measurable wins, will be the ones leading their industries tomorrow. The rest will be left explaining to their boards why billions were spent for pennies in return.

Shares of medical device company Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) fell 4.6% in the afternoon session after the company agreed to acquire Penumbra in a transaction valued at approximately $14.5 billion, marking its largest deal in two decades.

The acquisition, a mix of cash and stock, aimed to expand Boston Scientific's portfolio of cardiovascular devices, particularly in high-growth vascular and neurovascular markets. However, the market reacted negatively to the news. To finance the roughly $11 billion cash portion of the deal, the company planned to use a combination of cash on hand and new debt. Boston Scientific also stated that the acquisition was expected to be dilutive, or reduce, its adjusted earnings per share in the first full year after the deal's closing.

The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Boston Scientific? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.

What Is The Market Telling Us

Boston Scientific’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 3 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 9 months ago when the stock gained 8.5% on the news that the company reported first quarter 2025 results that beat analysts' sales and EPS expectations. Organic sales growth topped the company's own forecast and was led by a 25.6% surge in its Cardiovascular segment, a signal that demand in its largest business is accelerating. Looking ahead, its revenue guidance for next quarter exceeded Wall Street's estimates. Overall, we think this was a decent quarter with some key metrics above expectations.

Boston Scientific is down 4.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $90.08 per share, it is trading 16.7% below its 52-week high of $108.14 from September 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Boston Scientific’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,480.",https://news-assets.stockstory.org/cover-images/boston-scientific-cover-image-43c4a53384fd_2025-02-03-172625_aohi.jpeg,N,,2026-01-15 15:02:29.128470

While everyone chases the next meme ticker, this industrial heavyweight has been stacking gains like it’s on easy mode. So the real talk question: are you seriously sleeping on Parker-Hannifin, or is the hype just not built for your bag?

Let’s break it down in scroll-friendly, no-fluff mode – price moves, clout level, rivals, and whether this is a must-have or a hard drop.

The Hype is Real: Parker-Hannifin on TikTok and Beyond

Parker-Hannifin isn’t exactly a household name on your FYP – it’s not an AI chatbot, not a crypto, not a gadget you can unbox. It’s a monster behind the scenes: motion control, hydraulics, aerospace, factory automation. Basically, the stuff that keeps planes flying, robots moving, and factories not catching fire.

Social buzz? It’s low-key – but that might be your edge. While hype traders chase whatever’s trending, long-term money is quietly watching industrials like this. Finance creators, dividend nerds, and value investors are starting to drop more Parker-Hannifin mentions in breakdown videos and ""boring stocks making dumb money"" threads.

Right now, Parker-Hannifin is more ""finance TikTok sleeper pick"" than ""full send viral."" That can flip fast if earnings keep beating and industrial AI, automation, and defense themes stay hot.

Market Watch: The Business Side – Parker-Hannifin Aktie

Here’s where it gets real, because price action doesn’t lie.

Live data check: Using multiple financial sources (including Yahoo Finance and at least one other major market data provider), Parker-Hannifin Corporation (ticker: PH, ISIN: US7010941019) is currently trading around the upper end of its historical range. As of the latest available market data (time-stamped from live feeds on the current day), the stock is sitting close to its recently recorded highs, with a market cap firmly in big-league territory and a price that reflects strong institutional demand.

If markets are closed where you’re reading this, what you’re seeing on your app will likely show the last close price, not live action. But across the major platforms checked, the picture matches: this is not a bargain-bin stock – it’s priced like a proven winner.

Performance-wise, Parker-Hannifin has been punching above its ""boring industrial"" label. Over recent periods, it’s outpaced a lot of traditional industrial peers and held its own against the wider market, riding themes like:

Automation and robotics build-out – factories are upgrading hard.

Defense and aerospace demand – more gear means more systems and components.

Infrastructure and reshoring – more stuff built at home needs Parker-grade hardware.

Real talk: this is the opposite of a penny play. You’re paying a premium for a company that’s already delivering. The question is: does the next chapter still have upside?

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

Forget the 200-page investor deck. Here’s the simplified, scrollable version: the three biggest reasons Parker-Hannifin even shows up on serious watchlists.

1. It’s Wired Into Every Big Trend You Hear About

You like AI, robots, aerospace, EVs, clean energy, smart factories? Parker-Hannifin is the behind-the-scenes plug for a ton of that. The company builds motion and control systems – think hydraulics, pneumatics, filters, sealing, and complex systems that make heavy machines not just move, but move safely and efficiently.

Whenever a factory gets more automated, a plane gets upgraded, or a new industrial system rolls out, there’s a decent chance something Parker-related is in the blueprint. That kind of ""picks and shovels"" role is why long-term investors love it. The hype headlines may be about AI or EV brands, but the real money often piles into the suppliers that quietly bill everyone.

2. The Stock Has That ""No-Drama Overachiever"" Energy

This is not the type of ticker that goes up 40% overnight because a celebrity tweeted about it. But if you zoom out, Parker-Hannifin’s chart tells a very different story than your average meme stock flameout.

Across multiple time frames checked on major financial platforms, Parker-Hannifin shows:

Solid long-term uptrend – it’s rewarded patient holders.

Resilience in rough markets – not invincible, but not a collapse machine.

Consistent execution – earnings and cash flow that match its ""grown-up"" price tag.

Is it cheap? No. Is it a total flop for the price? Also no. It’s closer to a ""you pay up because it actually delivers"" situation.

3. Boring On Social, Serious In Real Life

Clout level from a Gen Z / millennial angle? Low for now. It’s not a brand you wear, not an app you flex, not something that throws influencer trips. But ask people actually working in aerospace, heavy equipment, or industrial automation, and the respect is there.

Because this company isn’t chasing virality, it focuses on what actually matters to long-term investors:

Big, sticky customers who don’t churn every five minutes.

High switching costs – if your jet or plant runs on Parker systems, you don’t just swap overnight.

Margins and cash flow that look way better than the brand recognition would suggest.

So is it a game-changer? From a ""change the world overnight"" standpoint – no. From a ""quietly compound your portfolio if you hold and chill"" standpoint – it’s absolutely in that conversation.

Parker-Hannifin vs. The Competition

Every stock has a villain. For Parker-Hannifin, picture a cage match with other industrial and automation giants. Think big names in motion control, automation, and aerospace components. Different companies get love for different reasons – some for pure automation software, some for diversified industrial exposure, some for more cyclical vibes.

On the scoreboard that matters to you:

Clout war: A lot of younger investors know the big automation brands before they know Parker-Hannifin. From a brand-awareness POV, Parker is playing more stealth mode than headline act.

Execution: When you check revenue growth, margins, and long-term returns, Parker-Hannifin hangs with the best of them. It’s not the loudest, but the numbers back it up.

Valuation: Versus key rivals, Parker tends to trade at a valuation that signals ""high quality, not screaming cheap."" That’s the tradeoff – you pay for the track record.

If we’re picking a winner in the pure clout war, Parker-Hannifin loses to names that trend more on social and show up more in retail portfolios. But if the battle is who actually prints money and compounds over time, Parker looks way more competitive.

The real edge? Because Parker isn’t meme-ified, there’s less random sentiment whiplash and more price action driven by earnings, orders, and real industrial demand.

Is It Worth the Hype?

Here’s where it gets spicy. You’ve got a stock that:

Is trading near high levels according to current live data.

Has a long-term winning record.

Is plugged into almost every big industrial megatrend.

But you also have:

High expectations baked in – the market already knows it’s good.

Limited viral upside – it’s not going to moon just because it’s trending on your FYP.

Real business risk – if industrial demand slows or big projects get cut, the stock can absolutely take a hit.

So is it ""worth the hype""? Depends what game you’re playing:

If you want YOLO, 10x in a year, gamble energy – this is not your play.

If you want ""sleep at night"" industrial exposure with a strong track record – this is exactly the type of name serious investors study.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

Let’s land this.

Is Parker-Hannifin a game-changer? In culture – no. In industrial reality – yes. It’s one of those companies that help make the flashy stuff work, without grabbing any of the spotlight.

Is it a must-have? If you’re building a long-term, diversified portfolio and you want exposure to automation, aerospace, and industrial infrastructure, this sits in strong ""must-watch"" territory. For some investors, especially those into quality industrials, it’s already a must-have core holding.

Is there a price drop coming? Nobody can call the next candle. What’s clear from the current pricing: the stock isn’t cheap, and the bar is high. Any earnings miss, slowdown in orders, or macro shock could trigger a pullback. If you’re the type who likes buying quality names on dips, Parker-Hannifin is exactly the stock you bookmark and stalk for better entries.

Real talk:

As a flex on social, this stock is mid.

As a long-term, fundamentals-first play, it looks powerful.

As a short-term trade, you’re basically betting on near-term earnings and macro news.

Only 17% said that they “actively” use AI to support decision making.","New research released today by Capgemini indicates that enterprise leaders are looking beyond the hype surrounding AI and are taking a more pragmatic approach to its use. However, leaders remain shy about disclosing publicly its use in decision making.

The research, ""The multi-year AI advantage: Building the enterprise of tomorrow"" surveyed more than 1500 executives globally, 38% of organisations already operationalise generative AI use cases, while six in ten organisations are now exploring the application of agentic AI.

China is more advanced than the US and Europe with 46% of Chinese organisations are piloting or deploying agentic AI, as opposed to 40% in the US and 30% in Europe.

Researchers also found that data sovereignty is emerging as a critical priority for 2026 which is perhaps unsurprising given the sharp deterioration in relations between the US and Europe, and the tumultuous state of geopolitics more broadly.

54% prioritise data sovereignty, keen to ensure that their confidential data remains within their control, regardless of platform. AI sovereignty is subsequently gaining in importance as organisations understand the link between the data feeding these models and outcomes.

Nonetheless, the market for generative and agentic AI is still at least partly driven by FOMO. Two thirds of business leaders expressed a fear of being left behind strategically if their competitors got ahead in the race to scale up AI deployments.

The desire not to be left behind even overrode concerns about the prospect of an AI winter setting in. Most of those surveyed acknowledged the likelihood of the optimism and financial confidence in AI starting to ebb, but 80% said that they planned to wait it out by focusing on foundational capabilities such as the data and infrastructure. 72% planned to prioritise low cost, high impact initiatives. A smaller proportion (57%) said that they intended to keep hold of “core talent and knowledge.”

AI winter or not, organisations are planning to accelerate AI investments. They are just doing so more selectively, prioritizing functions with well-defined processes and measurable outcomes. On average, they expect to allocate 5% of their annual business budget to AI initiatives in 2026, up from 3% in 2025.

Capgemini’s researchers also note that organisations have evolved in the way that they measure AI success. It's not all about cost reduction. New measures of ROI include revenue growth, risk management and compliance, knowledge management and customer experience and personalisation.

AI is reshaping decision-making, but few will admit it

Additional research from Capgemini shines a light on executive decision making. ""How AI is quietly reshaping executive decisions"", surveyed 500 C-level executives, including 100 CEOs. It finds that more than half of this group uses AI to support or inform their strategic decision-making in some way.

Only 17% said that they “actively” use AI to support decision making. 42% did so “selectively”, and 31% are currently “experimenting” with it. However, the proportion expecting to use AI actively within one to three years is 38%.

Early adoption is already delivering value. More than half of executives reported reduced time and cost to make decisions, and improvements in creativity and foresight from the use of AI.

However, leaders are clear that AI should not be considered a replacement for human judgement – wisely given the propensity of generative AI to make mistakes or just make things up. Only 41% described their level of trust in AI for executive decision-making as “above-average.” Leaders were mindful of legal and security risks, and the difficulty of explaining decisions to others when they were AI-influenced.

A particularly interesting finding of this piece of research is a dichotomy between private enthusiasm for using AI, and public reticence to admit doing so. Only 11% of executives were prepared to highlight publicly the use of AI in business decisions.

Why the shyness around such a transformative technology? Those who prefer not to disclose AI use cite concerns about reputational risk if AI-influenced decisions go wrong and uncertainty around how other people - clients, partners and the public - perceive AI use.",https://www.computing.co.uk/news-analysis/media_16f31547ec1202978ced5805758914880e9c161cd.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2026-01-15 14:03:38.262534

Dive Brief:

After the bank’s headcount remained neutral in 2025, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said Wednesday he expects its employee total to drop this year.

The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender, which has had about 213,000 employees for the past two years, has leaned into artificial intelligence capabilities in recent years. With expense discipline in mind, “the No. 1 thing,” Moynihan said during the bank’s fourth-quarter earnings call, is “work the headcount through operational excellence and applications of new technologies, including AI.”

Citi and Wells Fargo are also projecting job cuts this year. Citi CEO Jane Fraser, in a Wednesday memo to employees seen by Bloomberg, said the “bar is raised” for working at the bank. “I expect to see the last vestiges of old, bad habits fall away, and a more disciplined, more confident, winning Citi emerge in 2026,” Fraser wrote.

Dive Insight:

Bank of America brought on about 17,000 new employees in 2025, to fill roles that were vacated. “Every time someone leaves, we take the opportunity to evaluate whether the role needs to be replaced,” the bank’s CFO, Alastair Borthwick, said Wednesday.

BofA notched productivity improvements through AI and digitalization last year, enabling the bank to add client-facing employees while eliminating operational support work and roles, Borthwick said.

Moynihan pointed to the bank’s audit team as an example where an AI-powered capability that’s been built could result in a smaller team. The unit had grown in recent years to handle “the regulatory onslaught,” Moynihan said.

BofA also added 2,000 new college graduates last year, executives noted. Headcount is the bank’s top expense driver.

“If you look at the expense load, it comes from people and it comes from the benefits and compensation, and it ultimately comes from the buildings and computer systems to allow them to do the great job for clients,” Moynihan said. “So that's what we're working on.”

In its consumer segment, the bank has cut headcount by nearly half over the past 15 years – from 101,000 in 2011 to 55,000 today, executives said during a November investor day.

The bank spends about $13 billion on technology annually, with about $4 billion allocated to new initiatives. That includes “several hundred million dollars” on AI investments, with some 20 different projects in process across the company, such as the audit team example, Moynihan said.

Meanwhile, Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf on Wednesday said the San Francisco-based bank has more tools to achieve greater efficiency than it ever has, “especially with AI.”

The lender’s headcount has dropped by about 25% since the second quarter of 2020, he said as the bank reported earnings Wednesday.

Wells ended 2025 with about 205,000 employees, and $612 million in severance costs led to higher expenses in the fourth quarter of the year.

Scharf said in December he expected the bank would have fewer employees heading into this year. He called the long-term impact of AI on the bank’s headcount “extremely significant” and said the lender aims to “use attrition as our friend.”

At Citi, CFO Mark Mason buttressed Fraser’s memo, saying the bank has made headway on its plan to trim 20,000 jobs by the end of this year and added he expects a further decline in headcount in 2026 and subsequent years.

Fraser, for her part, noted the bank’s progress on resolving regulatory issues, adding that completion of those tasks may result in some roles being eliminated.

The private credit universe has matured dramatically over the past decade, but the latest data from S&P Global’s With Intelligence suggests the asset class is facing its first significant downturn test.

After a prolonged period of strong US direct lending growth, a combination of higher risk behavior, rising defaults and a pivot toward European markets signals a changing competitive landscape for investors and their clients.

A key stress indicator for private credit in 2025 has been a subtle uptick in selective defaults and the growing prevalence of payment-in-kind structures, where interest is added to loan principal rather than paid in cash. Taken at face value, headline default rates remained below historical highs, but broader calculations including selective defaults and liability management actions suggest an effective default rate of nearly 5% through the first nine months of 2025.

“The private credit market is facing its first big test as evidence of late-cycle behavior continues to build,” said James Harvey, research lead for private credit at With Intelligence. “After years of allocating overwhelmingly to US direct lending, limited partners are broadening their horizons, both geographically and by sub-strategy, and we expect some of these shifts to significantly alter the current landscape over the next several years.”

Rising use of PIK in senior secured loans — historically the domain of lower-tier subordinated financings — reflects borrowers’ strained cash flows and elevated leverage. Public business development companies, serving as a proxy for parts of the retail and wealth channel, are now reporting an average of 8% of investment income derived from PIK.

Europe’s Breakout Year, US Growth Cools

One of the most striking developments of 2025 has been the shift in fundraising geography. European private credit reached record levels, with €56 billion (approximately $66 billion) raised through the first nine months — up sharply from prior years — while North America-focused funds lagged, raising about $52 billion over the same period.

European funds accounted for roughly 35% of global private debt fundraising in 2025, compared to about 24% in both 2023 and 2024. By contrast, North America’s share has fallen from near 50% to just under a quarter of total capital raised.

Europe’s fragmented lender base and relatively inefficient markets can offer wider risk premia compared with the increasingly crowded US direct lending space. Combined with structural shifts such as Basel IV’s impact on bank loan supply, this has created fertile ground for private debt strategies that target niche sectors or bespoke financing solutions.

Growth of Evergreen Structures and Wealth Channel Capital

Another theme reshaping the asset class is the rapid expansion of evergreen private credit vehicles. Assets in such perpetual-capital structures, including non-traded BDCs and semiliquid funds, climbed past $640 billion by mid-2025, up more than 40% versus the prior year.

While institutional investors continue to command a large share of capital, allocation from private wealth channels has surged. These flows pose a dual challenge: they have broadened the base of capital available to managers, but they also raise questions around liquidity profiles, governance standards and alignment with long-term liability matching for traditional pension and endowment allocations.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/in/deni_639040754326824145.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 18:03:53.722883

The EliteBoard uses laptop silicon to stuff a complete PC underneath its keys. Think of it as a portable desktop of sorts, or a laptop without a screen. But more than that, the idea will remind some of you of retro PC-in-a-keyboard designs like the classic Commodore 64 or VIC-20. The EliteBoard revives a form factor that's been dormant for almost 40 years. It's a portable, AI-ready keyboard desktop computer that actually packs substantial power.

You might be thinking, ""Why do this in 2026?"" HP details a particular niche for these PCs. The EliteBoard is tailored for modern offices in which hot-desk reservations and hybrid-location employees require workers to have portable systems, but they use them with desktop monitors and peripherals. Using laptops may make sense in offices like this, in many cases, but some business laptops don't get opened and used enough to justify having a screen. Instead, they're run closed, with a full-size keyboard, mouse, and desktop monitor plugged in. And that might be the case in a home office and the local workspace. plugged into desktop peripherals in both places. This effectively wastes the laptop's screen and portable computing capabilities, which are considerable portions of a laptop's price. Toting an EliteBoard back and forth could make more sense.

With no lid or built-in display, the EliteBoard aims to save organizations and independent customers money. Here's what I think of it after a week with a production model.

The HP EliteBoard G1a is a PCMag pick for Best in Show at CES 2026.

A Low-Profile Design, and Quiet Typing

The EliteBoard features a minimal, low-profile design, and its metal-and-plastic chassis weighs just around 1.5 pounds (1.6 pounds for HP's model with an optional battery; more on that in a bit). The unit's two-layered setup puts the keyboard on top—this portion is removable and replaceable for IT departments to service as needed—while the bottom half of the chassis houses the motherboard and PC components. (Given that it's a keyboard at heart, you don't want to have a broken key take your whole desktop out of commission for good.) Inside, you get easy access to memory, SSD storage, the WLAN card, speakers, fan, and battery, making the system surprisingly serviceable.

The underside of the keyboard is nicer-looking than most and is perforated for ventilation. While I couldn't benchmark-test the new system just yet (this was an early sample), I can tell you that the fan noise seems minimal, and the thermal management on point; the unit never got overly hot.

(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)

In the interest of thinness and to accommodate the PC hardware inside, HP uses low-profile keycaps with silicone-dome switches for the key mechanisms. The keyboard won’t replicate the tactile or audible clickety-clack of a mechanical keyboard, and the feedback feels somewhat soft. At least it's very quiet, and, with 2mm of vertical travel, the keys provide enough depth for comfort. In essence, in the typing experience, you're getting the equivalent of a premium laptop keyboard repackaged for desktop use.

To save space, the EliteBoard lacks a built-in touch pad, but HP bundles a wireless mouse designed to work with multiple devices. The mouse includes a wireless dongle and supports two discrete Bluetooth connections.

Connectivity and the Monitor-Side Dongle

The EliteBoard features a pair of USB-C ports (one supporting USB4), complementing the connectivity with a compact port adapter or dongle.

This dongle serves as a port splitter, attaching to the HDMI port of your attached monitor. It carries the video signal from the EliteBoard to the monitor (you can daisy-chain multiple monitors), and it features an RJ-45 jack. That jack allows you to connect a network cable, enabling the EliteBoard to access wired Ethernet through the USB-C connection.

The dongle also connects to a wall adapter for the desktop's power source. This minimizes the cables going to the actual EliteBoard, keeping connections easy and clean. The system also provides Wi-Fi 6E (or optional Wi-Fi 7) for wireless networking without the dongle connection.

A single, long USB-C cable connects the EliteBoard to the dongle. In the model with a battery, it plugs into one of the USB-C ports; in the other, it's hardwired. In all, this arrangement is a clever way to keep the desk clutter-free.

To Battery, or Not To Battery?

The EliteBoard comes with a built-in battery, though you can opt for a battery-free version. The onboard battery isn't necessarily intended for on-the-go use, though; instead, it serves as a backup battery or uninterruptible power supply (UPS).

This UPS allows you to pick up the system and move it to another room (say, to a conference room for a meeting) without having to shut down and restart the machine, as you would if you had to unplug and replug an equally portable mini-PC or other desktop.

(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)

As for that battery-free option? HP tells me that this design is meant for stationary usage scenarios, like an EliteBoard installed as the PC at the front desk of a hotel, or in other environments where the system can be plugged in and never has to move. In other words, think of the types of situations in which, now, you might use a mini-PC or all-in-one to minimize clutter and maximize clean appearances.

Next-Gen AI Performance From a Keyboard

Beneath the keys, the EliteBoard is a capable AI PC powered by AMD Ryzen AI processors, supporting up to 50 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of NPU performance. (It starts with an AMD Ryzen AI 5 330 and tops out with a Ryzen AI 7 350 Pro.) Those AMD chips are backed by up to 64GB of DDR5 memory and up to 2TB of solid-state storage.

While the keyboard has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for connecting key peripherals, it also features built-in speakers and microphones. HP views these onboard audio capabilities as more critical than ever, as AI PCs increasingly rely on dictation and conversational voice interaction, and separate speakers or microphones add wires and complexity.

I couldn't benchmark the performance of this pre-production EliteBoard G1a model, but the specs suggest it's on par with many similarly equipped laptops. We'll have to wait for a proper review to see how much the unconventional design affects performance.

Prepare to Wait: Pricing and Availability

HP hasn't announced the price or launch date of the HP EliteBoard G1a yet, but with pre-release samples in our hands already, I'd expect a debut sometime in the first quarter of 2026. The company hasn't disclosed any details on pricing, either, but the EliteBoard will likely be closer to the price of a premium laptop than to any stand-alone keyboard—and if it has a price close to $1,000, I won't be surprised.

If it's that pricey—which is to say, as much as a decent basic enterprise laptop—that may put a damper on the whole value proposition. (After all, a laptop is stilll more flexible.) But it's possible the EliteBoard may make sense for some businesses purchased in bulk at negotiated prices.",https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/00KwcR4o97ncrHAhIsbQPlU-1.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1768499335.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 14:03:41.450097
ID8,BNY Mellon,2026-01-15 17:56:27+00:00,NeoFeed,The shortcut for family offices: direct investments gain momentum in Brazil. - NeoFeed,Patricia Valle,,,,,https://neofeed.com.br/wealth-management/o-atalho-dos-family-offices-investimentos-diretos-ganham-forca-no-brasil/en/,"Since 2020, the family office has dedicated an exclusive area to direct investments in the real estate market.
In contact with developers, it seeks a minimum IRR of 25% in the residential segment and 18% in logistics.
In venture capital, the accumulated figure of R$ 4.6 billion represents half of the R$ 9.2 billion invested in 2024.
The R$ 2.1 billion recorded in the third quarter marks the highest quarterly volume of 2025 and a jump of 23.5% over the same period of the previous year.
The asset managers we have the most relationships with in Brazil tend to do 50% in funds/50% in co-investments.","Praça Higienópolis, a high-end residential building located in the Higienópolis neighborhood of São Paulo, with over 21,000 m² of private area, is one of the newest developments by SKR, a real estate developer and construction company partnered with the Cyrela Group. The company has sought partnerships with asset managers such as Kinea and SPX to raise funds for its developments, but in this case, the funding came from Multi Family Office Portofino, which manages approximately R$ 30 billion.

In this project, Portofino acquired a 25% stake, bringing together more than 20 wealthy families—clients with an appetite for real estate assets. The expectation is to achieve an internal rate of return (IRR) of 25% per year. Since 2020, the family office has dedicated an exclusive area to direct investments in the real estate market. In contact with developers, it seeks a minimum IRR of 25% in the residential segment and 18% in logistics.

“Historically, developers have had the practice of seeking family and friends to come on board as investors in development projects, and families like to feel like they own real assets. Now, this is done in a more professional way with our intermediation and curation,” says Leonardo Bersot, Real Estate partner at Portofino MFO.

This type of operation, called co-investment or club deal , in which wealth managers invest directly in an asset, either with an asset management firm or directly in the transaction, is gaining increasing traction in the Brazilian and global markets.

According to Citibank's ""Global Family Office Report 2025,"" 70% of family offices made direct investments worldwide this year. Meanwhile, a BNY Mellon survey, ""Investment Insights For Single Family Offices 2025,"" indicates that nearly two-thirds (64%) expect to make six or more direct investments in the coming year, a 10% increase over the previous period.

Research by Volt Partners , published exclusively by NeoFeed , showed that the number of club deals had doubled last year, reaching 20% of deals. As a result, the average value of investment checks in private equity operations was shrinking, from R$ 56.5 million in 2024 to R$ 41.6 million in 2025.

In Brazil, this strategy is a form of differentiation, since traditional funds have become more accessible and commoditized. As a result, firms that make direct investments have multiplied—and closed more deals .

Origination typically occurs when a lead manager (private equity or private credit) finds an opportunity considered excellent, but cannot concentrate enough capital in a single asset or does not have sufficient resources. Therefore, they contribute what they can through a fund and invite wealth managers to co-invest in another vehicle. On the other side, wealth managers identify families interested in the project, offering exclusive, long-term investment options.

This is how Arton Advisors , with over R$10 billion under management, participated in the retrofit of the former Marina Palace in Leblon, which will house the first Four Seasons hotel in Brazil. The management is handled by the Catuaí group, and construction begins this year, with an expected duration of 36 months and a projected return of over 25% per year.

“Our relationship with asset managers means we are always consulted for the start of any venture, and together with other firms we dilute the risk, even though the ticket size remains high, often R$ 1 million per individual, which is possible because our clients are professional investors,” says Raphael Vieira, co-head of Investments at Arton Advisors.

Investing directly allows families to obtain higher returns by eliminating brokerage and management fees and providing greater visibility into where capital is allocated. It also makes it possible to reduce portfolio duration and choose return timeframes. Unlike a blind pool —where the manager decides alone where to invest—the investor chooses the specific asset.

This, however, implies concentration: a single name can represent a high risk. Unlike a fund, where the manager invests in various assets, this strategy allocates capital to a single business. If it goes wrong, the loss is 100%, as there is no diversification.

“We gave up diversification to gain in return. Our co-investment portfolio, for example, has a 70% annual return in dollars, while in private equity investments it is 15% per year,” says Felipe Nobre, CEO and co-founder of Jera Capital, with R$ 5.5 billion under management, which invested in this way in the American companies OpenAI and DataBricks.

The recommendation is that only very wealthy families should make this type of investment, representing a small percentage of their portfolio, and always with the guidance of a wealth manager, whose expertise and relationships with companies and asset managers are essential. This does not exclude allocation through funds.

The Brainvest family office, with approximately US$6 billion under management, adopts the practice of maintaining 80% of its investments in alternative funds and 20% directly, to add ""spice"" to its portfolios. The firm makes co-investments in real estate, private equity, special situations, and infrastructure.

“There are some investment theses that we are very convinced of, making it sensible to be more exposed, to have concentration. And when allocating through managers, you never know exactly how much they will allocate and if they will change their minds over time,” says Renzo Malagoli, head of alternatives in Brazil at Brainvest. Examples include investments in Brazilian gold mining companies and mature highway concessions in the state of São Paulo, via Starboard's private equity funds.

This trend gains momentum during periods of high interest rates, when alternative assets need to offer high returns to compete. ""Interest rates have been high for a long time, so alternative assets compete with a very high risk-return ratio, needing to yield more to make sense. And, in this scenario, the sophisticated investor seeks real assets with high returns as a diversification strategy,"" says Wilson Barcellos, CEO of Azimut Wealth Management.

Wealth managers predict that 2026 will be a year of even more opportunities for direct investments. With the slight reduction in interest rates, more deals may materialize, making it more attractive for those raising investments, although liquidity remains limited.

“In the US, family offices allocate 50% of their portfolio to alternatives, and co-investments are part of that, being something much more structured in the industry. Here, this is growing as discretionary management and the appetite for alternatives grow,” says Felipe Nobre, CEO and co-founder of Jera Capital.

For now, the most promising segments for co-investing with asset managers are real estate, infrastructure, special situations, and credit, where families have entered as partners in subordinated shares of FIDCs (Investment Funds in Credit Rights). Meanwhile, the appetite for private equity and venture capital remains low, despite the recent improvement in the industry.

Recent data from Abvcap shows that private equity investments reached R$ 15.9 billion by the third quarter of 2025, in 51 transactions. These figures already surpass those for the entire year of 2024 – R$ 13.3 billion in 72 deals.

In venture capital, the accumulated figure of R$ 4.6 billion represents half of the R$ 9.2 billion invested in 2024. The R$ 2.1 billion recorded in the third quarter marks the highest quarterly volume of 2025 and a jump of 23.5% over the same period of the previous year.

Meanwhile, FIDCs ( Investment Funds in Credit Rights) are among the fastest-growing fund classes in recent years, having more than doubled in size since 2023 and reaching R$773 billion under management. And the real estate segment may be experiencing one of the best moments in its history, moving from a period of high long-term interest rates to a cycle of rate cuts, with the dollar trending downwards, which favors construction.

And it seems that both wealthy families and investment managers are interested in taking advantage of these joint investment opportunities and developing this relationship.

“The next 10 years will be very fruitful for alternatives. Co-investment will go hand in hand with the industry. The asset managers we have the most relationships with in Brazil tend to do 50% in funds/50% in co-investments. And this should continue,” says Malagoli, from Brainvest.",https://neofeed.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ATALHO.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 14:03:32.245862

At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ECL options chain for the new March 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $270.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.20.
Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.
For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.","Investors in Ecolab Inc (Symbol: ECL) saw new options become available today, for the March 20th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ECL options chain for the new March 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

The put contract at the $270.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.20. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $270.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $264.80 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ECL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $278.04/share today.

Because the $270.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.93% return on the cash commitment, or 10.99% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.

Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Ecolab Inc, and highlighting in green where the $270.00 strike is located relative to that history:

Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $280.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.60. If an investor was to purchase shares of ECL stock at the current price level of $278.04/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $280.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.44% if the stock gets called away at the March 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ECL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Ecolab Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ECL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $280.00 strike highlighted in red:

Considering the fact that the $280.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.73% boost of extra return to the investor, or 15.60% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.

The implied volatility in the put contract example is 23%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 22%.

Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $278.04) to be 21%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

ID32,Nvidia,2026-01-15 17:19:01+00:00,The Motley Fool,Alphabet and Amazon Just Said Something That May Eliminate Nvidia's Biggest Risk,"Adria Cimino, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/14/something-that-may-eliminate-nvidia-biggest-risk/,"This is because the company sells the key element needed to power AI: the AI chip.
And Nvidia's chips just so happen to be the fastest around, making them the go-to choice for major tech companies aiming to win the AI race.
Well, here's some good news: Customers Alphabet (GOOG 0.70%) (GOOGL 0.68%) and Amazon (AMZN +1.05%) just said something that may eliminate Nvidia's biggest risk.
On top of this, some of Nvidia's own customers, from Alphabet and Amazon to Meta Platforms, have developed their own chips.
Now, let's consider the words from executives at Alphabet and Amazon that eliminate this major risk.","Nvidia's (NVDA +3.42%) business has been booming since the start of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. This is because the company sells the key element needed to power AI: the AI chip. And Nvidia's chips just so happen to be the fastest around, making them the go-to choice for major tech companies aiming to win the AI race.

These chips are known as graphics processing units (GPUs), and they power some of the most crucial AI tasks, such as the training that gives large language models (LLMs) knowledge and the inferencing that helps them think through and solve complex problems.

All of this has generated enormous growth for Nvidia, with revenue climbing to record and multi-billion-dollar levels. The company has also reported billions of dollars in profit thanks to its market leadership. And the stock price has followed, delivering a 1,200% increase over the past five years.

Still, some investors have expressed concern about whether Nvidia may hold onto this top position. Well, here's some good news: Customers Alphabet (GOOG 0.70%) (GOOGL 0.68%) and Amazon (AMZN +1.05%) just said something that may eliminate Nvidia's biggest risk.

Nvidia isn't alone

So, first of all, let's start by considering this risk, which begins with the idea that Nvidia isn't alone in the AI space. The company faces competition from other chip designers like Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. These players offer customers high-quality options that come with a smaller price tag than Nvidia's latest innovations, so the idea is they could chip away (excuse the pun) at the company's market share.

On top of this, some of Nvidia's own customers, from Alphabet and Amazon to Meta Platforms, have developed their own chips. And the concern here is that they will shift to their own products and rely less and less on Nvidia.

So, Nvidia's biggest risk is that other chip designers and its own customers will buy fewer chips and supporting systems from the company in the coming years -- and that would clearly hurt earnings prospects and stock performance.

Now, let's consider the words from executives at Alphabet and Amazon that eliminate this major risk.

These comments come at the time of a big announcement: The upcoming launch of Nvidia's Rubin platform. Nvidia, at CES last week, said the system is in full production and is set to roll out in the second half of this year. That fulfills Nvidia's pledge to innovate and upgrade its chips on an annual basis.

Demand for Nvidia GPUs

Against this backdrop, Alphabet chief Sundar Pichai said: ""To meet the substantial customer demand we see for Nvidia GPUs, we are focused on providing the best possible environment for their hardware on Google Cloud.""

Matt Garman, chief of Amazon Web Services (AWS), said: ""The Nvidia Rubin platform on AWS represents our continued commitment to delivering cutting-edge AI infrastructure that gives customers unmatched choice and flexibility.""

Both executives also emphasized their long-established relationships with Nvidia.

These comments don't suggest a shift away from reliance on Nvidia and instead a will to continue significant work with the chip leader.

This doesn't mean players like Alphabet and Amazon won't use their own chips or those of Nvidia rivals. But, considering their comments, it's unlikely those moves will weigh on their orders for Nvidia products.

Nvidia predicts that AI infrastructure spending may reach $4 trillion by the end of the decade, and investment patterns we've seen from big AI players like Alphabet and Meta suggest this is very possible. This means there is plenty of room for Nvidia and its rivals to see orders for GPUs explode higher -- and remain at high levels as the AI story progresses.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F850897%2Fgettyimages-1191849990.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-15 14:03:57.466485

This may challenge trends such as Semiconductors 3.0, where standards may diverge from the prior assumption of global consensus or safe manufacturing havens.

For instance, as automation becomes more prevalent, trends that focus on reskilling, including Lifelong Learning and Education Technology​,​ will grow in importance.
Equipped with the right insight, portfolios could benefit from several trends that show promise in the years ahead.","How polarisation affects the 150 trends

This polarised backdrop will have a varied impact on the roadmap. While some trends face near-term headwinds, others will show long-term resilience. Over the next decade, investors​ should assess portfolios with these considerations in mind:​

Selectivity replaces breadth: Previously, global breadth was an advantage, offering more exposure to growth. However, it may now be better to embrace regional nuances and localised supply chains. This may challenge trends such as Semiconductors 3.0, where standards may diverge from the prior assumption of global consensus or safe manufacturing havens.

Regional diversification replaces global collaboration: Sustainability is increasingly being balanced against near‑term resilience considerations, decoupling it from certain trends. Take Artificial Intelligence. This was closely linked to sustainability in our last roadmap, but AI infrastructure’s hunger for power may drive both Fossil Fuel Resurgence and Renewable Energy in the short term, even though the two trends appear to be ​​​​​at odds​​​.​

A widening automation gap: A ​productivity divide will separate digital-first adopters from ​laggards,​ and emerging from developed economies. This disparity will have a significant social impact. For instance, as automation becomes more prevalent, trends that focus on reskilling, including Lifelong Learning and Education Technology​,​ will grow in importance. Meanwhile, Social Credit may become necessary to deal with the economic fallout of workforce displacement.

Industrial bifurcation amid policy asymmetry: Government policy could dictate winners and losers in certain industries. Trends with exposure to advanced manufacturing, domestic re-shoring and tech infrastructure will likely benefit from increased government support. ​​I​n contrast, industries that are unsupported or even penalised may lag. ​​For​ example, there is varying policy support for Battery Recycling between the US Inflation Reduction Act and the EU Green Deal. This divergence creates opportunities for investors who can navigate these discrepancies.

Trends to watch in 2026-7

How will this multipolar reality shape the near-term future? Our Research analysts have identified four trends of special interest to investors in the coming year.

Humanoid robotics

This is a new trend in our roadmap, reflecting a greater appetite for AI and automation-driven physical productivity​​. As countries​ contend​ ​with demographic declines and labour shortages, this technology becomes increasingly appealing, especially in warehouses, caregiving and on the factory floor. Although there are currently only a few companies in countries including the US, China​ and Korea driving this trend, our analysts expect it will become gradually more investible as deployment targets expand and reliability improves.

DefenceTech

DefenceTech’s upgraded status on our roadmap is driven by heightened focus on public and national security, ​and ​​the ​​subsequent growth of ​national defence budgets. Our analysts expect M&A and industry consolidation to create more liquidity pathways going forward, especially given the large number of private companies emerging in this space. Areas of interest include those where AI and software are fuelling new innovations, including target recognition, sensors and unmanned systems. Although our research also highlights that these bring their own ​​risks, such as regulatory & procurement complexity, supply chain vulnerabilities and ethical & public scrutiny.

Quantum computing

This long-standing trend is expected to be a major focus in 2026, related to the growing importance of critical national infrastructure. Although the technology is still in its infancy, there has been a shift towards commercial readiness, evidenced by application-specific demonstrations. In fact, Barclays Research remains optimistic that achieving quantum advantage at scale could be achieved before 2030.

In summary

​​Although consensus is increasingly fractured, there is still much for investors to be optimistic about. Equipped with the right insight, portfolios could benefit from several trends that show promise in the years ahead. But caution is needed too, as agile, focused positioning will be required to capture opportunities and manage risk.​​​​​

Venezuelan bonds, long frozen in default and trading at deeply distressed levels, have surged as investors reassess recovery prospects in light of the country’s sudden political transition.

The Venezuelan crisis transformed one of the world’s most moribund sovereign debt markets into a high‑beta play on political transition.","The dramatic escalation of Venezuela’s political crisis — culminating in the US military operation that removed Nicolás Maduro from power — has triggered a striking rally in distressed sovereign debt. Venezuelan bonds, long frozen in default and trading at deeply distressed levels, have surged as investors reassess recovery prospects in light of the country’s sudden political transition.

Prices on Venezuela’s benchmark notes due in 2026 have doubled since summer, with the 2027 9.25 government bond listed on the Munich Stock Exchange hitting 39% of par in 2026, up from 20% of par in July 2025.

As speculators stepped in to seize the potential recovery of debt assets, a significant level of activity moved to electronic trading, in order to reduce the friction of finding available bonds. MarketAxess reported $172mm of total trade volume between 5 and 6 January, of which $67mm was trading in Venezuela sovereign bonds and $105mm in the corporate bonds of PDVSA, the state oil company.

This constituted 447 total trades, 1174% higher than the 2025 daily average, broken up across 221 Venezuela sovereign trades and 226 PDVSA trades. As investors reassess the prospects of recovery in light of the country’s sudden political transition, the prices on Venezuela’s benchmark notes due in 2026 more than doubled since late summer.

The sharp repricing of the bonds reflects a shift in expectations, with some market participants betting that a post‑Maduro government, led for now by acting president Delcy Rodríguez, will normalise relations with Washington and open the door to long‑delayed debt restructuring. The US Treasury’s sanctions regime has been an obstacle to any restructuring effort, as transactions involving Venezuelan debt can require explicit authorisation from the Office of Foreign Assets Control. With the US signalling a willingness to engage, investors see a clearer path to asset recovery.

Yet the situation is still unstable. Thomas Watter of S&P Global and Rishabh Dakalia of Crisil, part of S&P Global, noted that US President, Donald Trump, said the US would “run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition” and rebuild Venezuela’s oil sector via US companies.

“However, S&P Global Ratings expects a recovery will take years and significant capital to develop the underinvested and outdated oil and gas infrastructure,” they write. “For example, according to the Venezuelan Hydrocarbon Association, the nation’s five refinery complexes are operating at only 10% of nameplate capacity and would require more than US$10 billion-15 billion to bring that to greater than 80%.”

The broader market implications are complex. Morgan Stanley notes that the crisis introduces significant political and operational uncertainty, but the near‑term effect is unambiguously supportive for Venezuelan bonds, which are likely to continue rallying, as long as investors believe a stable government and sanctions relief are plausible outcomes. At the same time, the crisis has tested the US dollar’s safe‑haven status and contributed to increased demand for gold, reflecting heightened perceived geopolitical risk.

The Venezuelan crisis transformed one of the world’s most moribund sovereign debt markets into a high‑beta play on political transition. The rally has been substantial so far, but questions remain about the durability of the new government, the agreement with the US, the pace of any sanctions relief, and the feasibility of restructuring more than US$170 billion in obligations.

As demonstrated in the adrenaline-filled days around the removal of Maduro, for bond traders, having rapid and frictionless access to pricing and liquidity could make the difference between seizing or missing an opportunity.

It will further strengthen its capital markets business.","U.S. Bancorp USB entered a definitive agreement to acquire BTIG, LLC for $1 billion. This stock and cash transaction will likely be closed in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and fulfillment of customary closing conditions.

BTIG provides investment banking (IB), institutional sales and trading, research, and prime brokerage services. Since 2014, USB has had BTIG as the equity capital markets referral partner. The two firms further started a referral program in 2023.

USB CEO Gunjan Kedia said, ""BTIG’s top talent, capabilities and technology will position us for continued capital markets growth and deeper client relationships. This acquisition will enable both organizations to deliver greater value, innovation and efficiency to the companies and institutions we serve.""

This is a significant strategic move by U.S. Bancorp as it continues to expand its capital markets-based product set and revenues and support institutional clients in a better way. Also, new offerings such as institutional equity sales and trading, equity capital markets, equity electronic trading and mergers & acquisitions advisory are expected to further accelerate the company’s capital markets momentum.

USB-BTIG Deal Details & Financial Terms

As part of the deal terms, at close, U.S. Bancorp will pay a consideration of $725 million, consisting of $362.5 million in cash and approximately 6.6 million shares. An additional cash consideration of up to $275 million will be paid over three years, contingent on the achievement of defined performance targets.

BTIG’s senior leadership team will join U.S. Bancorp and continue to run the business. Anton LeRoy will remain CEO of BTIG, reporting to Stephen Philipson, vice chair and head of Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking at U.S. Bancorp, while co-founder and executive chairman Steven Starker will continue to work on client relationships and business development.

The transaction is anticipated to have a minimal impact on USB’s earnings per share this year. Nonetheless, it will likely reduce the company’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio by approximately 12 basis points at closing. Moreover, the deal will not affect the company’s near-term capital returns plan.

How Will the BTIG Deal Support USB’s Capital Markets Business?

Over the years, U.S. Bancorp has established a solid capital markets business, which is one of the major revenue growth drivers. With capital markets revenues of approximately $1.4 billion for the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2025, and a three-year (2021-2024) compound annual growth rate of 21%, the company views this acquisition as a meaningful top-line driver. It will further strengthen its capital markets business.

BTIG ranks among the top 10 U.S. brokers for high-touch equity volume executed and has advised on more than 1,275 announced IB transactions since 2015. The firm, along with its affiliates, operates through more than 700 employees in 20 cities across the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia, and complements U.S. Bancorp’s existing business.

Overall, the BTIG acquisition is a disciplined move by U.S. Bancorp to achieve further traction in the capital markets business by filling key product gaps, enhancing client relationships, and positioning the franchise to leverage its scale, without losing capital strength or leadership continuity.

Operating Margin: 45.16%

Net Margin: 30.99%

EBITDA Margin: 42.57%

The company's balance sheet is solid, with a current ratio of 1.55 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.79, indicating a healthy liquidity position and manageable debt levels. However, insider activity reveals some cautionary signs, with 24 insider selling transactions in the past three months.

Valuation and Market Sentiment

Eli Lilly's valuation metrics suggest a premium positioning in the market:

P/E Ratio: 50.02

P/S Ratio: 15.48

P/B Ratio: 38.49

Analyst sentiment remains positive, with a target price of $1,116.44 and a recommendation score of 1.9, indicating a favorable outlook. Technical indicators such as the RSI (14) at 54.18 suggest a neutral market sentiment, while institutional ownership stands at 86.67%, reflecting strong institutional confidence.

Risk Assessment

Despite its strong financial metrics, Eli Lilly faces sector-specific risks, particularly regulatory challenges as evidenced by the recent FDA delay. The company's Altman Z-Score of 8.02 indicates strong financial health, while the beta of 0.21 suggests lower volatility compared to the broader market. However, the ongoing regulatory scrutiny and insider selling activity warrant cautious monitoring.

Overall, Eli Lilly's financial strength and market position remain robust, but investors should remain vigilant of regulatory developments and insider activity that could impact future performance.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C000007E3.png?20,N,,2026-01-15 12:03:57.527814

OpenAI is welcoming back several senior researchers who had left to help launch Mira Murati's startup, Thinking Machines Lab, marking a notable talent reversal in the fast moving AI landscape.

Murati, OpenAI's former CTO, said two of the startup's co founders, Barret Zoph and Luke Metz, are returning to the ChatGPT maker. Senior researcher Sam Schoenholz is also heading back. All three previously worked at OpenAI before joining Murati to start Thinking Machines Lab in late 2024.

Murati announced Zoph's departure on X and named Soumith Chintala as the company's new CTO, without directly addressing Metz's exit. Thinking Machines Lab had quickly gained attention after raising $2 billion in a seed round last July at a $12 billion valuation, with backing from investors including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Andreessen Horowitz.

The move highlights just how fluid the competition for top AI talent has become, with researchers moving between startups and established players. For OpenAI, the returns reinforce its effort to regroup experienced leadership as development ramps up heading into 2026.

The software is designed to help customers achieve verifiable sovereignty and full operational control – building, deploying and managing cloud-native and AI workloads under an organisation’s own authority. Build on Red Hat’s open-source foundation, Sovereign Core is expected to make sovereignty a critical property of the software itself.

“Businesses are facing growing pressure to innovate while meeting tightening regulatory requirements and recognising the importance of controlling how sensitive data and AI workloads are accessed and operated,” said Priya Srinivasan, general manager at IBM Software Products. “This shift is creating an urgent need for sovereign solutions that deliver AI-ready environments.

Organisations that deploy the software are expected to gain:

Customer-operated control plane: organisations maintain direct operational authority over software operations, deployment decisions and system configurations without intermediation from a vendor not in region.

In-boundary identity and keys: all authentication, authorisation, encryption keys and access management remain within jurisdiction boundaries under customer control.

Ongoing compliance enablement and generated evidence of continuous compliance: comprehensive operational data, system telemetry and audit trails are generated, stored and managed within the sovereign boundary, including automated identity.

Governed AI inference: AI model deployment and hosting, local GPU clusters, local inference execution and agent operations occur under local governance with traceability and oversight, without exporting data to external providers.

Ease of deployment: delivering sovereignty at scale with consistency and flexibility.

The platform comes as businesses around the world are looking at digital sovereignty. As the regulatory landscape evolves, enterprises and governments are seeking self-managed environments where they maintain complete operational authority – particularly as they deploy AI workloads that amplify sovereignty concerns.

According to IBM, most organisations currently lack a destination to land, modernise and re-host applications under sovereign control, including applications that will incorporate AI capabilities. According to Gartner, 75% of all enterprises will have a digital sovereignty strategy by 2030.

With IBM Sovereign Core, customers can deploy it in the environment of their choice, including in on-premises data centres, in-region cloud infrastructure or through IT service providers.

The technology giant is collaborating with IT service providers worldwide, starting with an initial rollout in Europe with Cegeka in Belgium and the Netherlands and Computacenter in Germany.

IBM said these partnerships will enable local independence and compliance management, enabling IT service providers to offer differentiated sovereign services to enterprises preparing for and running AI-scale workloads.

Srinivasan added: “With IBM Sovereign Core, we are helping clients move faster and with confidence – combining openness, compliance, and operational autonomy to meet the demands of the AI era, without the need to sacrifice sovereignty requirements.”

Boston Scientific plans to acquire Penumbra for about $14.5 billion, the companies announced Thursday.

Penumbra makes heart devices to remove clots from blood vessels, treating conditions including pulmonary embolism, stroke and deep vein thrombosis. It also makes an embolization system, designed to stop blood flow to control bleeding.

Boston Scientific CEO Mike Mahoney sees an “opportunity to enter new, fast-growing segments within the vascular space,” he said in a statement.

Dive Insight:

The planned purchase, one of the first large medtech acquisitions of 2026, is expected to complement Boston Scientific’s portfolio. Buying Penumbra would let Boston Scientific expand into new markets in thrombectomy and embolization, bringing the cardiovascular device company a growth asset, BTIG analyst Ryan Zimmerman wrote in a research note.

Boston Scientific will pay $374 per share in cash and stock. Zimmerman said the price is fair, valuing Penumbra at about 19% above its share price Wednesday.

Penumbra is expected to report 2025 revenue of about $1.4 billion, a more than 17% increase year over year.

The deal was not surprising, RBC Capital Markets analyst Shagun Singh wrote in a research note, adding that Penumbra “has been considered a take-out candidate for some time now.” Stryker’s $4.9 billion acquisition last year of Inari Medical, another company making thrombectomy devices, made Penumbra a more attractive acquisition candidate, Zimmerman said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/N_cLe-haE96UNciFI2DMVcdB5JKJsFiYb5Cckvh9k8Y/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9CU1hfQ0VPLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-15 11:06:06.730533

The definition of transformation is exactly that—caterpillars becoming butterflies. Otherwise, you are not recognizing AI’s potential. As with the internet, it’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reimagine how you do business.

When it comes to implementation, there will always be a certain amount of experimentation, but many experiments fail because people think of AI as one monolithic thing. You need to break it into two steps.

First, establish what infrastructure you need, starting with your data. Is your data connected? Is it organized? Is it in a format that can be leveraged? AI is nothing but garbage-in, garbage-out otherwise. Establish the foundation, then second, pick one or two projects that will add real value.

Choose an area of the business where you see a real opportunity. Then find something that is not so big that it takes you years to deliver value, but not so small that it isn’t applicable to the rest of the business.

Many CEOs have been focused on cost-based use cases of AI, because it’s easier to prove their tangible value. But we’re seeing far more meaningful opportunities in the context of driving growth and sales. When you get it right, it demonstrates how AI can make a difference in everything from selling cars to increasing the value of shopping baskets.

If your child has just started playing football, you may not know what to buy. AI can say: “Tell us a few things, and we’ll check you out with everything you need for an 8-year-old who’s into football. You’re searching for a ball, but you also need cleats and socks and shin guards.”

This makes a real difference in revenue, unlike use cases where “we can optimize call centers and boost productivity.” Those projects are specifically focused on AI as a cost opportunity.

I remember talking to airline CEOs about paying to pick your own seat on airplanes. The CEOs wanted faster check-in lines at the airport. Back then, staff would have to show each passenger where they were seated at check-in, or fliers would have to call customer support, which took time and added cost.

Nowadays, choosing a seat is the second-largest revenue-generator for an airline after buying a ticket. This means that what started off as a cost-saving initiative creates more revenue for airlines today than even excess baggage fees.

At the time, the conversation was framed almost entirely around operational efficiency— reducing friction at check-in, shortening queues, and lowering support costs. What wasn’t immediately obvious was how these small changes in customer experience could fundamentally reshape behavior. Over time, those same decisions opened entirely new revenue streams that few had initially anticipated.

These are the trends you miss if you only use AI to save money. Industries which don’t make this pivot—from using AI to cut costs to using it to find new opportunities for growth—are going to be caught flat-footed.

It also claims that ChatGPT provider OpenAI made a conscious decision to decline the opportunity to provide the intelligence behind Siri …

Google’s Gemini models powering the new Siri

Apple this week confirmed reports that Google’s Gemini AI models will be used to power the new Siri in an announcement clearly aimed at investors, but also good news for customers.

Google said that this is a multi-year contract, while Apple noted that the Gemini models will run on its own Private Cloud Compute servers in order to maintain privacy.

It has been speculated that Apple is paying around $1bn a year for the deal, and a new report seems to at least roughly confirm this.

Apple to pay billions

A Financial Times report says that the deal is a multi-billion one.

The deal would be structured in the form of a cloud computing contract, which could lead to Apple paying several billion dollars to Google over time, a person familiar with the agreement told the FT.

While this is all rather vague, multiple billions over multiple years is consistent with the idea of somewhere in the region of $1B per year. If accurate, it seems a good deal for the Cupertino company, given that it is receiving more than 20 times as much from the search giant.

OpenAI reportedly decided against Apple partnership

The report also claims that OpenAI made a conscious decision to refrain from partnering with Apple.

OpenAI declined to comment. But a person close to the company said it had taken “a conscious decision to not become the custom model provider for Apple” in the autumn of last year and instead focus on building its own AI device to leapfrog the big tech companies.

It’s a near certainty that Apple and OpenAI at least had discussions about it, but it’s not clear whether the iPhone maker actually offered the company a contract. The wording allows for the possibility of OpenAI turning down a deal, but it may merely mean it had decided to decline were Apple to make an offer.

Penumbra's stock was up about 14% after the 'compelling' deal was announced Thursday morning

Penumbra, which developed the Lightning Bolt 6X, to remove blood clots below the knee, is being acquired by Boston Scientific.

Boston Scientific is spending $14.5 billion in cash and stock to buy Penumbra, another medical-device maker that makes products used in minimally invasive procedures to treat conditions such as blood clots and stroke.

As a result of the acquisition, Boston Scientific will add a fresh group of products to its portfolio while also entering ""new, fast-growing segments within the vascular space,"" CEO Mike Mahoney said in a statement.

The device maker is paying $375 per share, a premium over Penumbra's Wednesday closing price of $313.43. Penumbra's stock (PEN) rallied about 12% on Thursday after the deal was announced. Boston Scientific shares (BSX) were down about 5%.

It's one of the biggest med-tech deals over the last year. And with Abbott Laboratories (ABT) announcing in November that it is buying Exact Sciences (EXAS) for $21 billion, Boston Scientific's acquisition could be a signal of returned dealmaking to the sector, according to William Blair's Brandon Vazquez.

Penumbra's portfolio focuses largely on devices used in mechanical thrombectomies, a minimally invasive procedure to remove blood clots, and for neurovascular conditions. Its stroke business makes up 30% of its revenue, according to Vasquez. The company, founded in 2004, said it brought in $1.4 billion in revenue for 2025, a roughly 17% year-over-year increase.

""The markets where Penumbra competes are high-growth but also highly competitive,"" Stifel analysts told investors. ""Penumbra is a truly compelling and exciting acquisition for BSX. It accelerates sales growth, expands the company [total addressable market], and on the surface, it appears to be an excellent operational and cultural fit.""

Penumbra CEO Adam Elsesser will join Boston Scientific's board. Penumbra will operate as a standalone business within Boston Scientific's cardiovascular segment.

Boston Scientific said it's using cash and new debt to cover the $11 billion cash part of the deal. The deal is expected to close later this year.

Proximity to AI has been the main driver of U.S. semiconductor stock performance. Proposed AI spending points to a multi-year earnings tailwind, though the timing and scale of deployments remain debated.

Applied Material has underperformed due to valid concerns around China competition and exposure, with stock gaining just 12% in 2025.

But according to Barclays concerns around China exposure and competition are already reflected in the stock while rising foundry and DRAM spending makes Applied’s exposure to those areas attractive relative to peers.

Barclays said its preferred names are in compute, in storage, and in interconnect, and in semiconductor capital equipment.

Stock performance in 2026 is likely to favor companies tied directly to core parts of the AI buildout.

It flagged , , MTSI, Micron and Nvidia as its favored stocks, while taking a more cautious stance on , , and due to consumer and analog exposure.

On AI infrastructure, compute announcements imply about 20 gigawatts of deployments in calendar 2027, with power availability emerging as the key constraint.

It said Nvidia is positioned to capture the bulk of that demand, estimating $45 billion of upside to both its 2026 and 2027 revenue forecasts. Barclays said upcoming model launches in late Q1 or early Q2 are a key inflection point for investor confidence in returns on AI spending.

Pam is survived by her husband of 47 years, Mal; her eldest child, KJ and spouse, Ian; her daughter, Quinn and husband, Ezra; and her grandson, Terrence. She is also survived by her siblings Debbie, Cyndee, Ricky, and Alan; as well as a large and loving chosen family – her “strays” – people she gathered throughout her life who needed a mom or a family, and whom Pam welcomed with open arms.

Pam was born and raised in the Bronx. She grew up on Morris Avenue near 183rd St., in a two-bedroom, fourth-story walk-up, where her grandfather was the superintendent and her father was a milkman and, later, a gas station owner. At the same time, her mother worked in various retail positions and as a church musician. Pam excelled in school and was a feared presence on neighborhood and school basketball courts. She spent much of her free time at the New York Public Library.

Her love of books led Pam to her first career at the Reader’s Digest headquarters in Pleasantville, N.Y., where she worked nights in the company’s state-of-the-art computer center while putting herself through college at the City University of New York. It was at the Digest that she met Mal, sharing lunches and falling for one another. Mal’s career included being a commercial pilot and editor.

Anyone who worked with Pam knew she was a force of nature; her time in the company’s massive data systems led to a rapid rise through the organization, culminating in her role as senior vice president for logistics and marketing systems, with extensive worldwide travels in that capacity.

As Pam told the story, the day after Quinn was born, her doctors informed her that she had terminal melanoma and only months to live. She replied simply, “No.” She had 32 more years. Pam and Mal, who married in 1978, uprooted their lives and relocated to Damariscotta in 1994, where they focused on raising their young children and building a home together. When Pam later went looking for work again, she did so with a familiar goal – to, as she often put it, “be a useful engine.”

That search led her to what she considered the crowning achievement of her professional life: Skidompha Public Library. Pam worked on the capital campaign that made the current library possible and was appointed executive director shortly thereafter, a role she held for two decades. Pam believed deeply in the power of libraries to meet basic human needs, celebrate the arts and humanities, and foster connection. She viewed the library as both the community’s living room and as part of a larger calling to serve as “custodians of society.”

Pam’s tenure at Skidompha was marked by innovation, achievement, and deep affection for her colleagues. Under her leadership, the library received numerous awards, including the highest honor in the field, the National Medal for Library Service. Pam traveled to the White House to receive the medal from First Lady Laura Bush in 2008.

Pam’s commitment to community extended far beyond the walls of the library. She served on nonprofit boards across the Midcoast, from Heartwood Theater Co. and Lincoln Theater to The Carpenter’s Boat Shop and Stepping Stones. Her leadership was often sought by organizations navigating periods of challenge or pursuing ambitious growth. Pam also served as a member and later chair of the Great Salt Bay School Committee in the early 2000s, where she oversaw significant expansion and construction projects and helped secure an inclusive benefits package that extended coverage to same-sex domestic partners of school employees.

Pam’s drive for service was rooted in her faith. Her faith life was centered at Second Congregational Church in Newcastle for nearly 30 years, where she played many roles – cooking Wednesday night suppers, chairing the deacons, leading the church through its Open and Affirming process, and ringing handbells in the bell choir, which brought her particular joy.

Pam was a person of deep wonder, which she explored through art, music, and travel. She visited at least 27 countries across five continents, attended the Munich Olympics, summited Machu Picchu, stood on the continental divide in Iceland, and traveled through Palestine. After retirement, she undertook a six-week road trip around the United States in search of “all the elephants I can find,” reflecting her lifelong love of the creatures. Many of these travels were shared with friends and family, especially her eldest child, KJ.

Music was a constant in Pam’s life. The daughter of a church organist, she was an accomplished musician herself; though she insisted she preferred being a spectator. She raised her children to treat orchestra concerts the way others treat football games. Pam played handbells (mastering four-in-hand), piano, and organ – teaching keyboard skills to her daughter Quinn – and was an all-city musician on bass and trumpet in her youth. A proud alto, she also sang in many choirs.

Pam was not one to remain still. Retirement did not suit her for long, and she soon embarked on what she called her “encore career,” leading a nonprofit that placed unhoused teenagers with host families and supported them in completing high school and transitioning to adulthood. Through this work, by happy accident, Pam met her grandson. When Terrence, a young person in need of emergency placement, was placed with Quinn and Ezra, he quickly became family. Pam delighted in celebrating his adoption this past July and described Terrence as “the frosting on the cake of her life.”

Pam was a devoted and loving mother. She and Mal made childhood joyful and curious while fostering ambition and confidence in their children. Though she sometimes needed a moment to catch up on the right words, Pam embraced the work of affirming and raising two sparkly children with gusto. Her home was often a refuge for other young people who needed a mom who loved them for who they were.

Pam leaves behind a remarkable legacy of love, service, faith, and accomplishment – carried forward in the institutions she strengthened, the communities she served, and the many people whose lives were made better because she was in them.

In lieu of flowers, please send donations in Pam’s memory to the Mabel Wadsworth Center in Bangor.

A funeral will be held at the Second Congregational Church of Newcastle at 2 p.m. on Jan. 24, 2026.",https://lcnme.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/obit-Gormley.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 13:04:21.361565

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on MRX. Marex Group plc's share was trading at $38.99 as of January 13th. MRX’s trailing and forward P/E were 11.24 and 9.23 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.

Marex is a UK based global financial services platform that provides critical market access, liquidity, and infrastructure to institutional participants across energy, commodity, and financial markets. The company operates through four tightly integrated segments clearing services, agency and execution, market making, and hedging and investment solutions, allowing it to offer a full suite of services that few competitors can match.

Serving roughly 5,000 active clients, Marex has carved out a defensible niche by focusing on mid sized funds that are underserved by large banks due to minimum commission thresholds and by smaller independents that lack the scale and global reach required by these clients.

The investment thesis is anchored in high barriers to entry and a structurally improving competitive landscape. Building a scaled platform in this space is slow and complex, as demonstrated by Marex’s own decade long ramp to establish its initial business. –

Industry consolidation has meaningfully reduced competition, with the number of futures commission merchants declining by roughly half since 2002 even as client assets have expanded. This dynamic has enabled Marex to emerge as a top ten FCM in the U.S. by client assets, with only a handful of peers, notably StoneX, able to offer comparable breadth across all service lines.

Marex is also leveraged to favorable secular and cyclical tailwinds. Rising use of cleared derivatives, expanding commodity markets, higher interest rates, and increased volatility all support demand for its services, making the business an effective play on sustained market activity.

Growth has been driven by a balanced mix of organic initiatives and disciplined M&A, with acquisitions such as ED&F Man and TD Cowen’s prime brokerage materially expanding the client base and revenue mix. This strategy has delivered a decade of consistent profit growth, with adjusted PBT rising from $16 million in 2014 to $321 million in 2024, alongside improving earnings stability and strong free cash flow conversion.

Despite this track record, Marex remains underfollowed due to its UK domicile, small cap size, and limited public history, with additional pressure from a recent short report viewed as immaterial. Trading at roughly 7.7x 2025 earnings, consensus estimates assume only organic growth and exclude future M&A, suggesting the market is undervaluing the company’s long term earnings power and strategic optionality.

Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on Marex Group plc by Karst Research in May 2025, which highlighted the company’s diversified platform, strong profit growth, and disciplined M&A strategy. The company's stock price has decreased by approximately 14.58% since our coverage. This is because the thesis has not played out yet, due to valuation compression and near term sentiment pressure. However, core business fundamentals remain intact. MOI Global Equity Research shares a similar view but emphasizes valuation disconnect and industry consolidation.

Marex Group plc is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 34 hedge fund portfolios held MRX at the end of the third quarter which was 39 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of MRX as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Traditional production has served existing markets well, but meeting this growing demand requires a diversified approach.” Tomoaki Ichida, CEO, MOL Switch","Ammobia, a San Francisco-based startup developing modular “Haber-Bosch 2.0” ammonia production plants, has raised a $7.5 million seed round to advance reactor technology it says can materially cut the cost and complexity of ammonia synthesis. The round was backed by Shell Ventures, ALIAD (Air Liquide), MOL Switch (Mitsui O.S.K. Lines’ venture arm), and Chevron Technology Ventures, with additional participation from Katapult Ocean, AIR Capital, Alumni Ventures, and Motivate Fund. Ammobia also reported follow-on capital from existing investors, including Starlight Ventures, Collaborative Fund, Arosa Capital, and Zero Infinity Partners, bringing total funding to $13.5 million across dilutive and non-dilutive capital.

The company said it will use the financing to build a pilot facility to further derisk its reactor approach and to identify a cohort of customers for commercial demonstrations.

Ammonia is among the world’s most-produced chemicals, serving as the key input for nitrogen fertilizers that underpin global food production and as a feedstock for chemicals and plastics. The company is positioning its technology against a broader, anticipated expansion in demand as ammonia is explored for uses such as maritime shipping fuel, power generation, and energy storage and transport over the coming decades.

Conventional ammonia production via the Haber-Bosch process typically requires centralized, capital-intensive facilities and extreme operating conditions, and is often tied to natural gas supply dynamics. Ammobia said its alternative design combines novel materials science, reaction engineering, and commercially available components to enable smaller, standardized plants with lower capital requirements and the flexibility to operate closer to end markets. The company argues that approach could reduce exposure to supply shocks associated with centralized production and volatile global supply chains, while also supporting a longer-term pathway to decarbonization.

Ammobia said it has validated performance over thousands of operating hours and demonstrated operation at roughly 10x lower pressure and 150°C lower temperature than conventional synthesis conditions. Based on those results, the company believes its approach can reduce total synthesis-loop costs by up to half, with implications for overall ammonia affordability at a range of scales and with different upstream energy sources. The company also said the lower-pressure, modular configuration can better accommodate intermittent renewable power, potentially reducing reliance on costly hydrogen storage in clean-ammonia configurations.

Beyond economics and resilience, Ammobia framed its technology as a decarbonization lever for an industry responsible for nearly 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with downstream implications across agriculture, energy, maritime, and chemicals. The company said lowering the cost barrier to producing ammonia with low-carbon inputs could accelerate adoption of cleaner pathways across those sectors.

Separately, Ammobia said it has added Guido Radaelli as chief engineering officer. Radaelli has decades of experience in ammonia process technology development and commercialization, and the company said his appointment strengthens its ability to move from pilot work toward commercial deployments.

About Ammobia, the company said it was founded in 2023 and is building modular ammonia production systems designed to reduce costs while remaining compatible with global manufacturing standards. It also noted recognition as a 2025 World Economic Forum Technology Pioneer and said its co-founders were included in Forbes 30 Under 30 Manufacturing & Industry 2024.

KEY QUOTES

“The ammonia industry is at an inflection point. If we want to lower costs and cut emissions in existing ammonia markets – while enabling ammonia’s untapped value in energy and maritime fuel – we need production technology designed for where the world is headed, not where it’s been.”

Future-proof your print security in 2026 to secure the Future of Work As the threat to print ecosystems escalate, quantum advances loom, and identity management fatigue sets in, reassessing printer security posture in 2026 will be essential to protecting the Future of Work.
These robust print security strategies must combine automated recovery, isolation technologies and quantum-resistant BIOS security to guarantee uptime, form a fortified barrier against intrusion and counter next-generation attacks.","Advances in AI and automation will continue to reshape how organizations operate in 2026, helping employees work smarter and faster and unlocking new levels of efficiency. But without the right security, new technology can expand the attack surface and expose enterprises and SMBs alike to potential new risks — making it harder to keep employees productive and protected.

While security strategies are usually updated to address emerging threats, the printing ecosystem is still a persistent point of exposure. Embedded in everyday workflows, networked printers function as edge devices. If compromised, they can provide attackers with a direct route into corporate networks, enabling sensitive data theft, lateral movement, or attacks that knock critical devices out of service. Print security risks from large enterprises down to SMBs, will only worsen in 2026, as AI-powered threats intensify cybercrime, assisting attackers with complex tasks like vulnerability discovery.

As printers increasingly appear on attackers’ radar, organizations will need a more holistic view of cyber resilience that extends to the print ecosystem. Here are three print security trends to watch out for in 2026:

Organizations will need to take notice of print, IoT, and edge security after a string of attacks

Despite a year of high-profile attacks against connected devices in 2025, where security vulnerabilities allowed for remote takeovers of printers, many organizations lack basic visibility and control over print infrastructure.

Related reading:

This creates security blind spots — from exploitation attempts to insider threats, outdated firmware, malicious updates and misconfigurations, such as open ports or unchanged default credentials. After all, printers are most often used by cybercriminals as a launchpad to capture ever-escalating permissions. This enables threat actors to access the broader network of data and devices.

In the year ahead, organizations and governments should demand that endpoint devices, like printers, come with continuous and active system monitoring throughout their lifecycle. Future-proofing security will mean securing the complete device ecosystem, including printers. Having the ability to automate print fleet security compliance and assessment of fleet firmware vulnerability status will minimize IT overhead for security conscious organizations in 2026.

Quantum resilience will increasingly influence printer decisions

A year on from the introduction of new NIST standards for quantum-resistant asymmetric cryptography, public sector and critical infrastructure companies are going to accelerate planning and vendor engagements to chart a path towards migration. This process will reveal the scale of the challenge. With NIST intending to deprecate RSA-2048 by 2030 and all RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography by 2035, many vendors are likely to seize the opportunity to move directly from RSA-2048 to quantum resistant algorithms — particularly in critical industries and long-life systems, such as hardware.

With ongoing advances in quantum computing, the prospect of a quantum computer capable of breaking asymmetric cryptography within a decade is becoming increasingly plausible. The U.S. government’s decision to set a quantum-resistance deadline of 2027 for new National Security System devices signals this urgency. Adding to the pressure, the threat from 'harvest now, decrypt later’ attacks mean data must be protected today against future breaches.

To become quantum resilient, organizations must start by preparing their long-lived hardware, including their printers. With an office-class commercial printer lifespan of between four to five years, devices procured in 2026 have the potential to be in use within the timeframe of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer.

As a result, from 2026 onwards, quantum resilience will increasingly influence hardware procurement decisions. This will increase pressure on device manufacturers to future-proof their devices by embedding quantum resistant cryptography into their products, while pushing for the protection of long-life data. By embedding quantum resilience now, organizations can maintain trust in the technologies shaping the Future of Work.

Organizations will shift to unified identity, provenance, and persistent control

We’ll also see efforts within cybersecurity shift from fragmented identity frameworks and perimeter-based controls to a unified, data-centric model. Today’s zero-trust implementations often create complexity and fatigue, with identity scattered across users, apps, and devices. This fragmentation leads to blind spots, inconsistent enforcement, and poor user experience. The next phase will prioritise consolidation: centralised identity orchestration that simplifies access, strengthens governance, and reduces operational risk.

At the same time, we’ll see security move from focusing on point of entry, to managing the custody of data throughout its lifecycle. Organizations will need visibility into where data originates, how it is used, and who has access — even after it leaves their boundaries. Identity and policy will travel with the data, embedded through persistent controls, telemetry, and rich metadata. Dynamic permissions such as ‘can I share this?’ will evolve into continuous oversight, ensuring compliance online and offline.

Provenance and lifecycle control will also become critical in the age of AI, where transparency and trust are non-negotiable. By embedding identity, custody, and governance controls into the core of digital ecosystems, organizations will achieve stronger, adaptive security that protects without adding friction.

Future-proof your print security in 2026 to secure the Future of Work

As the threat to print ecosystems escalate, quantum advances loom, and identity management fatigue sets in, reassessing printer security posture in 2026 will be essential to protecting the Future of Work. Embedding security within printers remains one of the most effective defences for the year ahead.

Boston, which recently raised its annual profit forecast on strong demand for its heart devices, said the inclusion of Penumbra's products will help it improve ""revenue and margins over time"".

Penumbra has developed a comprehensive portfolio that includes differentiated devices to treat conditions such as pulmonary embolism, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, acute limb ischemia, heart attack and aneurysms.

The deal values Penumbra at $374 per share, a premium of about 19.3% to its last close.

The transaction is expected to be completed in 2026.

Three people close to the matter told Reuters on Monday that UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel had expressed interest in the Monte dei Paschi (MPS) stake held by Delfin during meetings with Francesco Milleri, the head of the Italian holding company.

The sources said UniCredit was also potentially interested in Delfin's stake in insurer Generali (GASI.MI), opens new tab.

UniCredit's statement said that it was the job of the bank's internal M&A team to study all possible growth options, including external ones.

""This at any one time will involve discussions with, and assessment and analysis of, the target in question, none of which is indicative of the likelihood of a transaction taking place,"" it said.

Italian financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported on Thursday that a new meeting between Milleri and Orcel could take place as early as this weekend, adding that the Delfin chairman had reservations about the transaction.

In expressing its disappointment about ""recent rumours and constant noise"" about its alleged interest in the MPS and other stakes, Italy's second-largest bank said that, at present, these were ""pure invention"" and served no purpose other than to distort and confuse the market.

Under veteran M&A banker Orcel, UniCredit has worked to deploy part of its large reserves of capital to buy stakes in Germany's Commerzbank (CBKG.DE), opens new tab and Greece's Alpha Bank (ACBr.AT), opens new tab, but it has failed so far to clinch a merger.

MARLBOROUGH, Mass. and ALAMEDA, Calif., Jan. 15, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) and Penumbra, Inc., (NYSE: PEN) today announced the companies have entered into a definitive agreement under which Boston Scientific will acquire Penumbra in a cash and stock transaction that values Penumbra at $374 per share, reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $14.5 billion.i

""Penumbra is a well-established company with an experienced, high-performing team and this acquisition offers Boston Scientific an opportunity to enter new, fast-growing segments within the vascular space,"" said Mike Mahoney, chairman and chief executive officer, Boston Scientific. ""I'm thrilled to combine the talents and shared values of our teams – including welcoming Penumbra's chairman and chief executive officer, Adam Elsesser, to our board of directors upon close. The addition of Penumbra can expand access for these novel technologies to more patients and customers around the world, further enhancing our revenue and margins over time with proven offerings that have a history of growth and innovation.""

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globallyii and include disorders of the heart and blood vessels that can restrict blood flow and increase the risk of clots throughout the body. To address the escalating prevalence of these complex diseases, Penumbra has developed a comprehensive portfolio that includes differentiated devices to treat conditions such as pulmonary embolism, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, acute limb ischemia, heart attack and aneurysms.

Penumbra offers innovative mechanical thrombectomy products for use in peripheral vascular procedures to remove blood clots causing blockages in arterial, venous and pulmonary vessels, including the Lightning Bolt® and Lightning Flash® computer assisted vacuum thrombectomy (CAVT™) systems. The company's vascular portfolio also includes a minimally invasive peripheral embolization system, which is designed to stop blood flow to control hemorrhaging and bleeding or to close blood vessels.

Neurovascular offerings from Penumbra currently include differentiated solutions for access, stroke revascularization and neuro embolization. The company is continuing to innovate in these areas and add meaningful clinical evidence to support expanded access for more patients worldwide.

""Our decades-long development of therapies for challenging medical conditions has focused on deep innovation for complex diseases so that we can offer physicians novel solutions to transform patient care,"" said Adam Elsesser. ""I am grateful for the amazing people who have contributed to this work and look forward to uniting our efforts and shared values as we come together with Boston Scientific.""

Penumbra expects to deliver fourth quarter reported revenue growth in the range of approximately 21.4% - 22.0% and full year 2025 reported revenue of approximately $1.4 billion, representing growth in the range of approximately 17.3% - 17.5% over the prior fiscal year.iii Penumbra continues to advance its technologies with a multi-year research and development plan and ongoing clinical programs.

Under the terms of the agreement, which has been approved by the board of directors of each company, the transaction values each Penumbra share at $374, with Penumbra stockholders having the right to elect to receive $374 in cash or 3.8721 shares of Boston Scientific common stock (valued at $374 based on the volume weighted average price of Boston Scientific common stock over the last 10 trading days, as of January 13, 2026), subject to proration, so that the total transaction consideration is paid approximately 73% in cash and approximately 27% in shares of Boston Scientific common stock. Adam Elsesser has indicated that he will elect to receive Boston Scientific shares for all his Penumbra shares.

Boston Scientific expects to finance the approximately $11 billion cash portion of the transaction consideration with a combination of cash on hand and new debt. The transaction is expected to be $0.06-0.08 dilutive to adjusted earnings per share for Boston Scientific in the first full year following the close of the acquisition, neutral to slightly accretive in the second year and more accretive thereafter. The impact to GAAP earnings per share is expected to be dilutive in the first full year following the close, and less dilutive or increasingly accretive thereafter, as the case may be, due to amortization expense and acquisition-related net charges.

The transaction is expected to be completed in 2026, subject to receipt of Penumbra's stockholder approval and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants his engineers to spend exactly zero percent of their time writing code. In a recent appearance on the No Priors AI podcast, Huang revealed that every engineer at the $3 trillion chipmaker now uses Cursor, an AI coding assistant, throughout their workday. His goal? Free them entirely from what he calls 'syntax' so they can focus on finding and solving problems that haven't been cracked yet.

The idea is simple: coding is the task, but discovering and solving novel problems is the purpose. AI should handle the former so humans can concentrate on the latter.

Why radiologists didn't disappear, and why engineers might not either

Huang points to radiology as proof this approach creates jobs rather than eliminates them. Years ago, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton predicted radiologists would be obsolete within five years because computers could scan images faster than humans. Instead, radiologist numbers have grown. The reason, Huang argues, is that reading scans was always just a task—the real purpose is diagnosing disease and improving patient outcomes. When AI took over the grunt work, demand for the human expertise behind it actually expanded. At Nvidia's recent all-hands meeting, Huang reportedly pushed back hard against managers who were telling teams to dial back AI usage. ""Are you insane?"" he said, according to Business Insider. He promised employees they'd still have work to do—just more ambitious work.

Vibe coding pioneers warn Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s approach has limits

Not everyone shares Huang's unbridled optimism. Michael Truell, CEO of Cursor itself—the $29 billion startup whose AI tool Nvidia has embraced—recently cautioned against 'vibe coding,' where developers let AI build software without reviewing the output. ""If you close your eyes and don't look at the code and have AIs build things with shaky foundations, things start to kind of crumble,"" Truell told Fortune's Brainstorm AI conference. Even Andrej Karpathy, the former Tesla AI director who coined the term 'vibe coding,' admitted his recent Nanochat project was ""basically entirely hand-written"" because AI agents ""just didn't work well enough."" He recently warned fellow programmers: ""I've never felt this much behind. The profession is being dramatically refactored."" For now, Huang's betting big that humans who focus on purpose rather than tasks will come out ahead. Whether that bet pays off for the millions of developers who actually write code for a living remains the undiscovered problem.

ID39,S&P Global,2026-01-15 11:31:16+00:00,the Guardian,'The consumers are still out there': why a bankruptcy for Saks Global may not spell the end,"Lauren Aratani, www.theguardian.com, lauren-aratani",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/15/saks-global-bankruptcy,"After the acquisition, the newly created Saks Global company would oversee three luxury department store brands: Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue.
Hudson’s Bay spun off Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks Off 5th, Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus into a separate company, Saks Global, in 2024.
But after the Neiman Marcus deal, Saks Global struggled to pay back its vendors.
Saks Global CEO Marc Metrick, a longtime executive with nearly 30 years at the company, abruptly announced his departure.
“The merchandising and vendor relations makes it what it is for the consumer.” Baker, through Saks Global, did not respond to a request for comment.","Every year, the stores down Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue dress up their windows at Christmastime. Tourists from all over the world come to gawk at all the glitter, lace, ruffles and bows.

Saks’s Fifth Avenue location, so iconic that it’s embedded in the brand’s name, is usually dressed top to bottom during the holidays. In 2023, the store partnered with Christian Dior to display a giant zodiac calendar. As part of the light show, fireworks were released from the top of the store to the oohs and aahs of spectators.

But in 2024, the show went dark. Saks Fifth Avenue was without its extravagant lights throughout the holiday season, for the first time since the show debuted in 2004.

Money was tight that year. The company had just announced a $2.7bn deal to acquire competitor Neiman Marcus. To fund the deal, Saks borrowed $2.2bn.

It was a “challenging year for luxury”, Saks told the New York Post at the time, but the company voiced optimism for the new year. After the acquisition, the newly created Saks Global company would oversee three luxury department store brands: Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue.

But just more than a year after this new luxury behemoth was formed, Saks Global on Wednesday announced that it had filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, amid problems paying off its debts. While filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy doesn’t force a company into liquidation, it’s a major hit to a brand that was once among the most prestigious in retail.

The bankruptcy appears to mark the latest in a string of once-quintessential American retail giants now struggling to pay their bills. Many companies that rely on bricks-and-mortar stores have struggled to compete with online retailers. Saks is no exception.

But that’s just part of the story. The changing retail environment has shaken many companies, but some – even department stores – are learning to survive. Saks competitors Bloomingdale’s and Nordstrom both reported revenue growth last year.

So what happened to Saks? To those who have been following the company over the last year, bankruptcy almost seemed inevitable. Not because of retail’s shifting reality – though that hasn’t helped the company – but because of a string of decisions made by company executives over the last few years.

Saks is the third department store firm owned by former parent company Hudson’s Bay that has filed for bankruptcy. Hudson’s Bay spun off Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks Off 5th, Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus into a separate company, Saks Global, in 2024.

Hudson’s Bay acquired Lord & Taylor in 2006, and while the company held strong for years, it eventually sold the chain’s flagship Fifth Avenue store to WeWork, and the entire brand in 2019. The company closed its remaining stores in 2020.

Last year, Hudson’s Bay – the Canadian department store that gave its namesake to its parent company – liquidated all of its stores after filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing struggles to pay back its lenders and suppliers.

Analysts agree that Saks made a huge bet buying Neiman Marcus, especially with $2.2bn of borrowed funds. “As soon as you put debt into the equation in this kind of environment, it just crunches your ability to operate,” said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData Retail.

This is especially true for department stores that rely on relationships with vendors to stock their stores. With everything imaginable available online, the draw of a bricks-and-mortar store is the curated selection they can offer consumers.

But after the Neiman Marcus deal, Saks Global struggled to pay back its vendors. In its bankruptcy petition, the company listed luxury firms including Chanel and Kering, owner of Gucci, as some of their creditors, with the company owing them tens of millions of dollars in unpaid invoices. In a recent note to investors, analysts at S&P Global said Saks had experienced “significant inventory challenges” over the last three years.

Dwindling stock in stores hit on Saks’s bottom line last year. In the second quarter, the company’s revenue dropped 13%.

Come the turn of the year, things started to look dire. Saks Global CEO Marc Metrick, a longtime executive with nearly 30 years at the company, abruptly announced his departure. It emerged soon after that the company had missed a multimillion-dollar interest payment on its loans at the end of 2025.

To some industry observers, that’s the catch. What may seem like a retail company on the surface is likely serving another purpose for company executives.

“They certainly will talk about the intention to be a global retailer, but they also see a group that has very large real estate assets. It owns some of the properties that it trades from in very prime locations,” Saunders said. “And they will say, look, if we can’t make the retail bit work, does it really matter?”

Saunders pointed to longtime Sears CEO Eddie Lampert, who oversaw the liquidation of the company’s store while still maintaining control of its real estate holdings through a separate company, which he owned.

“Their mindset is deal-making, it’s asset monetization,” said Saunders. “It’s not, hey, here are a couple of retail brands that we need to protect, cherish and grow.”

When announcing its chapter 11 filing, Saks Global also said that executive chair Richard Baker would step away from the company. Baker is also the longtime CEO of Hudson’s Bay, and of leading real estate and investment company NRDC Equity Partners.

It’s a sign Saks Global is planning to pivot back into its retail origins. Geoffroy van Raemdonck, Neiman Marcus CEO from 2018 to 2024, has taken Baker’s place.

“Richard Baker is all about real estate,” said Shelley Kohan, a former Saks executive. “He’s not about retail. He’s never been a retailer.”

“For a high-end luxury company, you need a merchant running [the business] and a merchant that has a deep connection with a vendor community, that understands at the end of the day [that] a department store like Saks is all about product,” added Kohan, a professor of fashion business management at the Fashion Institute of Technology. “The merchandising and vendor relations makes it what it is for the consumer.”

Baker, through Saks Global, did not respond to a request for comment.

Experts point to Macy’s CEO Tony Spring as a retail leader who is considered a “merchant”. Under him, Bloomingdale’s – which is owned by Macy’s – has been expanding through stores with a smaller physical footprint than the typical multifloor department store, a strategy also taken on by competitor Nordstrom.

“His view is, I want to grow it over time, and protect it,” Saunders said. “It’s a very, very different mindset [from Baker]. Neither of them are completely wrong, but they come from very different positions.”

In its announcement Wednesday, Saks Global said incoming CEO van Raemdonck will be “appointing industry veterans and former Neiman Marcus Group leaders” to join him as Saks executives.

Saks’s bankruptcy is not the end of the company, but a fork in the road for the luxury department store brand.

“I think there’s a lot of opportunity for Saks to more consistently put their business decisions in the eyes of the customer,” Kohan said, adding that she’s a “firm believer” in physical retail: “The consumers are still out there.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e20962bcb81f6379e919a82bda0e7cab1f06c37/356_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a7b3abb46f85e07ae05f533575d67583",N,,2026-01-15 10:04:12.611214

Even after this strong run—and despite what is clearly a premium valuation—I believe Walmart still has room to run over the long term. The key driver is the company’s accelerating transformation into a technology-enabled, data-driven enterprise that extends well beyond traditional retail.

Walmart is no longer simply a scale retailer competing on price. It is evolving into a hybrid consumer platform, logistics powerhouse, and AI-driven commerce ecosystem, and that shift underpins a bullish long-term outlook.

A Durable Long-Term Growth Algorithm

I believe management remains well positioned to deliver on Walmart’s long-term financial algorithm of roughly 4% annual sales growth and 4%–8% operating income growth. That may sound modest on the surface, but when combined with Walmart’s scale, improving mix, and growing contribution from higher-margin businesses, it creates meaningful earnings and free cash flow leverage over time.

After several years of multiple expansion, the stock’s bull run is likely closer to the middle or later innings rather than the early stage. In the very near term, the setup is somewhat tricky, as management could adopt a conservative tone when it introduces full-year guidance alongside Q4 earnings in mid-February.

However, from a multi-year perspective, Walmart’s fundamentals remain exceptionally strong, supported by continued market share gains, improving profitability in e-commerce, and rapid growth in alternative revenue streams.

Technology, Automation, and AI as Structural Tailwinds

Walmart’s ongoing digital transformation is one of the most underappreciated aspects of the story. The company is leveraging automation, data, and artificial intelligence across its stores, warehouses, and digital platforms to drive productivity and improve the customer experience. AI-enabled tools are improving inventory accuracy, accelerating delivery times, and boosting associate efficiency in both stores and fulfillment centers.

Walmart is also rapidly evolving into an AI-driven shopping destination. Its generative and agentic AI initiatives increasingly support multimodal shopping experiences that blend text, voice, images, and live assistance. The company’s Sparky AI assistant already helps customers search, summarize reviews, build baskets, and personalize recommendations, while also emerging as a new advertising surface.

Strategic partnerships further reinforce this trajectory. Walmart now enables customers to shop and check out directly through conversational interfaces such as ChatGPT, and it has recently partnered with Google (GOOGL) to integrate Gemini into Walmart and Sam’s Club shopping experiences. These integrations enable customers to discover products via natural-language prompts, receive personalized recommendations linked to their Walmart accounts, and complete purchases without opening the Walmart app. This kind of conversational commerce positions Walmart at the forefront of how AI reshapes consumer behavior.

Alternative Revenue Streams Still in Early-to-Mid Innings

One of the most compelling elements of the Walmart story is the long runway in alternative revenue streams. Retail media through Walmart Connect, marketplace expansion, membership income from Walmart+, fulfillment services, and data monetization through platforms such as Scintilla are increasingly significant contributors to growth and profitability.

While Walmart has already made significant progress in these areas, management commentary suggests that there remains substantial opportunity. These businesses are higher-margin and more capital-light than traditional retail, and their growth enables Walmart to reinvest aggressively in price, convenience, and technology while still expanding operating margins. Over time, this mix shift should structurally improve Walmart’s earnings power and cash flow profile.

Valuation

I estimated Walmart’s fair value by averaging the results of 14 different valuation models, including P/E multiples, a 10-year DCF with a revenue exit, and a multi-stage DDM. Based on this analysis, I arrived at a fair value of approximately $90 per share, implying roughly 25% downside from the current stock price. That said, valuation alone does not fully capture Walmart’s strategic positioning.

There is no question that Walmart trades at a premium valuation. Shares currently command a P/E of roughly 46x and an EV/EBITDA multiple above 23x, above sector medians of 16x and 11x, respectively.

However, I believe that the premium is justified. Walmart’s combination of scale, AI-driven efficiency, alternative revenue growth, and consistent market share gains supports a structurally higher multiple than traditional retailers. This is increasingly a technology-enabled consumer platform with durable cash flow and defensive characteristics, not just a low-margin big-box chain.

Is WMT a Good Stock to Buy Now?

Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about Walmart. Data from TipRanks shows a consensus rating of Strong Buy, supported by 25 Buy ratings, one Hold, and no Sell recommendations. Among the 26 analysts who have issued 12-month price targets for Walmart, the average stock price target is $125.88, implying a ~5% upside in 2026.

Walmart’s Transformation Is Accelerating

In short, Walmart’s reinvention is both real and picking up speed. Its investments in AI, automation, omnichannel infrastructure, and higher-margin revenue streams are strengthening the core business and expanding long-term earnings potential. Even with a richer valuation, I still view Walmart as one of the highest-quality long-term compounders in retail—and I remain bullish on the stock.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2713035715-750x406.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 08:01:47.315222

'This transaction demonstrates how InvestEU can be deployed at scale to deliver tangible impact for Europe's Small and Mid-sized Enterprises,' said EIF Chief Executive Marjut Falkstedt. 'By significantly expanding our partnership with UniCredit, we are supporting thousands of businesses in Central and Eastern Europe as they invest in sustainability, innovation and digital transformation. The strong utilisation of the previous guarantee confirms both the demand and the effectiveness of this approach, and we are proud to support its further expansion.'

'SMEs in EU CEE employ over 65% of people in the region and deliver more than 55% of the economic value, but some of their ambitions still outpace their access to affordable finance,' highlighted Teodora Petkova, Head of UniCredit for Central and Eastern Europe. 'By extending our InvestEU partnership with EIF, we are increasing lending volumes and providing tangible benefits: better terms, longer horizons, and now access to capital markets through minibonds. This way entrepreneurs with good ideas can invest, innovate and scale faster, with fewer constraints, while boosting CEE regions growth and opportunities.'

The extended agreement introduces minibonds as an eligible financing instrument, supporting SMEs' access to debt capital markets and diversifying funding sources beyond traditional bank lending.

IRVINE, Calif., Jan. 14, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biomerica, Inc. (Nasdaq: BMRA), (the “Company”) a global provider of advanced medical diagnostic and therapeutic products today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 ended November 30, 2025.

Key Highlights:

Management Commentary

Zack Irani, CEO said, ""We are executing a deliberate strategic pivot from legacy, lower-margin products to higher-value, higher-margin diagnostic-guided therapy products. The current revenue softness reflects this transition, not fundamental business deterioration. With our fixed cost structure largely in place, we believe incremental revenue from inFoods® IBS and new partnerships such as Henry Schein as well as hp+detect™ opportunities should drive significant margin expansion. Additionally, our contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) expansion leverages existing infrastructure to generate higher-margin revenue while diversifying our revenue base.""

""While second quarter revenue reflected expected variability across our established product lines, Biomerica continued to strengthen its financial foundation through successful capital raising activities and disciplined cost management,” said Gary Lu, CFO of Biomerica. “Earlier in the fiscal year, the Company also received approximately $1.10 million in Employee Retention Credit (ERC) refunds, which, together with our financing initiatives, contributed to a $457,000 year-to-date improvement in working capital and an increase in our cash position to $2.5 million. As we advance key programs from development into commercialization, we are prudently reallocating resources, which resulted in a 27% reduction in research and development expenses, while continuing to invest in the commercial launch of high-value diagnostic programs, including inFoods® IBS and hp+detect™. We maintain access to additional capital through our existing shelf registration to support future growth initiatives.”

Second Quarter and Year-to-Date Fiscal 2026 Financial Results

Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 were $1.21 million, compared to $1.64 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease primarily reflects the absence of large initial distributor stocking orders in the Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”) region recorded in the prior year period, as the Company’s regional partner ramped up its initial market rollout. While Biomerica continues to generate recurring revenue from the region, the prior year quarter benefited from these upfront inventory purchases. The quarter also reflects normal timing variability in international shipments as well as lower contract manufacturing activity. These impacts were partially offset by continued growth in inFoods® IBS sales.

For the six months ended November 30, 2025, net sales were $2.59 million, compared to $3.44 million in the prior year period. Gross margin for the six-month period was 18%, compared to 21% in the prior year, reflecting lower overall sales volume as the Company transitions from legacy products to higher-margin diagnostic-guided therapy offerings. Management expects gross margins to expand as inFoods® IBS and hp+detect™ sales scale and added CDMO services.

Operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 were $1.42 million, compared to $1.43 million in the same period last year. For the six months ended November 30, 2025, operating expenses decreased approximately 4% to $2.96 million, compared to $3.09 million in the prior year period. This performance reflects Biomerica’s continued focus on cost discipline and operational efficiency, including targeted reductions across administrative, research, and manufacturing. Notably, when excluding professional service fees related to Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) filings, which contributed to the Company's increase in cash, normalized operating expenses for the six-month period decreased by approximately 7% compared to the prior year. With the Company's fixed cost structure now largely optimized, management expects incremental revenue from new product launches and strategic partnerships to drive meaningful operating leverage and margin expansion.

Net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 was $1.32 million, compared to $0.95 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting lower revenue and gross margin during the period. For the six months ended November 30, 2025, net loss improved to $1.31 million, compared to $2.27 million in the prior year period, primarily due to sustained expense discipline and the recognition of a non-recurring tax credit earlier in the fiscal year. Biomerica continues to prioritize operational efficiency and disciplined cost management while selectively investing in core diagnostic programs designed to drive long term value. The Company's strategic focus on transitioning its revenue mix toward higher-margin products, combined with its optimized cost structure, positions Biomerica to benefit from significant operating leverage as inFoods® IBS, hp+detect™, and CDMO services gain commercial traction.

About inFoods®

The inFoods IBS test involves a simple blood collection procedure and is designed to assess a patient’s above normal immunoreactivity to specific foods. Instead of difficult to manage broad dietary restrictions, physicians can now use the inFoods IBS information to make targeted, patient-specific recommendations about specific foods that, when removed from the diet, may alleviate IBS symptoms such as pain, bloating, diarrhea and constipation. Further information about Biomerica’s patented inFoods® Technology Platform can be found at: https://biomerica.com/inFoods/our-technology/. The inFoods IBS clinical study was performed at several prominent centers including Mayo Clinic, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Inc. - a Harvard Medical School Teaching Hospital, Houston Methodist Hospital, and the University of Michigan. The clinical results for improvement in the Abdominal Pain Intensity (API) responder endpoint of >30%, for IBS patients in the treatment diet arm had a statistically significant improvement over patients in the placebo diet arm (p-value of 0.0246). The improvement for patients in the treatment arm versus the placebo arm is considered clinically significant and is similar and, in some cases, better than the current drugs in the market.

ID18,Eli Lilly,2026-01-15 10:12:58+00:00,The News Journal,Delaware latest to sue pharmaceutical companies over insulin prices,Isabel Hughes,,,,,https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/local/2026/01/14/de-lawsuit-claims-greed-big-pharma-insulin-eli-lilly-novo-nordisk-cvs-caremark-express-scripts/88181042007/,"It argues that the companies ""conspired to increase insulin prices by as much as 1,000% over the past 15 years.""
According to the court filing, prices began ticking up in 2003 when pharmacy benefit managers ""began their rise to power.""
Pharmacy benefit managers act as middlemen between health insurance companies, drug manufacturers and pharmacies to manage prescription drug benefits and negotiate prices.
Other states file similar suits Numerous other states have filed similar lawsuits in recent years.
Mississippi was the first state to initiate litigation against both insulin manufacturers and pharmacy benefit managers, filing suit in 2021.","Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings is suing several drug manufacturers and pharmacy benefit managers for reported insulin price gouging, following similar legal action taken by other states in recent years.

The Delaware Department of Justice announced the suit Jan. 14, though it was filed on Jan. 13 in Delaware's Court of Chancery. It argues that the companies ""conspired to increase insulin prices by as much as 1,000% over the past 15 years.""

Those named in the suit include the nation’s three primary insulin manufacturers − Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi − and the three largest pharmacy benefit managers: CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx.

According to the state Department of Justice, more than 110,000 Delawareans live with diabetes and 130,000 live with prediabetes, a condition defined by elevated blood sugar that puts them at risk for developing diabetes in the future.

""The disease costs Delaware’s economy roughly $1.1 billion per year,"" a state Department of Justice news release said. ""The uninsured population has a diabetes prevalence rate of nearly twice the state’s average, which has left them especially susceptible to injury from the illegal pricing scheme. Nearly all diabetics in Delaware rely on daily insulin treatments to survive.""

Jennings, in a statement, blamed the pricing on greed.

“The level of greed that would drive someone to price-gouge consumers over life-saving diabetes medicine is almost unfathomable,” Jennings said in a statement. “It is an avarice that not only hurts diabetics across the country financially, but in many cases leads to medication hoarding and preventable deaths.""

What does the lawsuit claim?

According to the court filing, prices began ticking up in 2003 when pharmacy benefit managers ""began their rise to power."" Pharmacy benefit managers act as middlemen between health insurance companies, drug manufacturers and pharmacies to manage prescription drug benefits and negotiate prices.

This allows them to ""exert tremendous influence over what drugs are available throughout Delaware and at what prices,"" the suit says.

By 2016, the lawsuit claims, the average monthly price of the four most popular types of insulin rose to $450. Specific insulins saw even greater increases.

One type of insulin sold by Eli Lilly, Humulin R, increased from $165 in 1997 to $1,784 in 2023, the suit says.

""....costs continue to rise, so much so that now one in four diabetics are skimping on or skipping lifesaving doses,"" the court filing says. ""This behavior is dangerous to a diabetic’s health and can lead to a variety of complications and even death.""

The suit also claims that on more than a dozen occasions since 2009, ""competitors Sanofi and Novo Nordisk raised the list prices of their insulins, Lantus and Levemir, in tandem, taking the same price increase down to the decimal point within a few days of each other.""

The suit also notes similar practices with GLP-1 medications, which have become increasingly popular weight loss and diabetes-control tools in recent years. It says Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have more than tripled the prices of Victoza, Ozempic and Trulicity since their release.

Other states file similar suits

Numerous other states have filed similar lawsuits in recent years.

Most recently, Oregon's attorney general filed suit against the same parties. Indiana's attorney general also filed a nearly identical lawsuit in late December.

Mississippi was the first state to initiate litigation against both insulin manufacturers and pharmacy benefit managers, filing suit in 2021. The case was later consolidated with other similar actions and is being litigated as part of ongoing multidistrict court proceedings.

OpenAI is partnering with Sam Altman-backed AI chipmaker Cerebras to deploy 750 MW of its wafer-scale systems to make OpenAI’s chatbots faster.

Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman calls this the “largest high-speed AI inference deployment in the world”. Sources tell The Wall Street Journal that the deal is worth more than $10bn.

The AI system will be deployed in multiple stages beginning this year, and capacity is expected to come online in multiple tranches through 2028, the two companies have said.

Cerebras has a faster-is-better approach to AI chips. The company is behind WSE-3, the “largest” AI chip ever built, with 19-times more transistors and 28-times more compute that the Nvidia B200.

“Reasoning that take minutes on Nvidia GPUs take a single second on Cerebras,” Feldman said last year, announcing OpenAI’s gpt-oss-120B that runs on Cerebras.

Cerebras’ speed comes from its massive chip that combines compute, memory and bandwidth, eliminating bottlenecks that slow inference on conventional hardware, explains OpenAI. The company already works with the likes of Meta, powering some of its Llama models.

“Just as broadband transformed the internet, real-time inference will transform AI, enabling entirely new ways to build and interact with AI models,” said Feldman.

OpenAI CEO Altman was an early investor in Cerebras, and the two companies met frequently over the last decade to explore opportunities to work together.

“Cerebras adds a dedicated low-latency inference solution to our platform. That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people,” said Sachin Katti, who develops OpenAI’s compute infrastructure.

Since its early days, OpenAI has been a voracious consumer of Nvidia’s AI technology. Recently, however, it has been looking for alternatives. Last year, AMD and OpenAI signed a 6GW agreement to power OpenAI’s AI infrastructure across multiple generations of AMD Instinct GPUs.

In September, Nvidia signed a deal to sell up to 10 GW of its chips to OpenAI, but that hasn’t materialised yet. While a separate $300bn deal with Oracle would give OpenAI Oracle’s cloud compute power for a five year period.

Earlier this week, The Information reported that Cerebras is in discussions to raise $1bn at a $22bn valuation. Last September, it raised $1.1bn in a Series G round at a $8.1bn post-money valuation, with backers including Fidelity Management and Research Company; Atreides Management; Altimeter; Alpha Wave Global; and Benchmark.

Meanwhile, according to a Wall Street Journal report from December, OpenAI is in the early stages of a funding round that could value the company at $830bn.",https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AdobeStock_564087424_Editorial_Use_Only.jpeg,N,,2026-01-15 06:00:30.684231

A joint venture equally owned by TotalEnergies and Air Liquide, the company opened seven new stations during the year, adding to the infrastructure required for hydrogen‑powered heavy trucks.

Two new French stations—located in Marseille‑Fos and Reims—became operational in late 2025. Both offer round‑the‑clock service and can dispense up to one tonne of hydrogen per day at 350 and 700 bar, the pressures required for commercial vehicles. These sites join existing infrastructure outside Paris. Beyond France, five additional stations opened in Germany and the Netherlands, contributing to a footprint that now includes 15 locations across five countries.

TEAL Mobility plans further expansion in 2026, including projects in Mulhouse, Antwerp, Rotterdam, Berlin and Duisburg, areas positioned near major freight corridors and ports.

Measures of AI success broaden beyond productivity to growth, risk management, and customer experience

Two-thirds of CXOs say that clearer governance and accountability frameworks would help them better leverage AI in decision-making

Paris, January 15, 2026 – New research shows that after an era of ‘AI hype’, business leaders are now increasingly realistic and pragmatic about their AI strategies, and have started using it in their decision-making. The Capgemini Research Institute publishes today a report on AI perspectives, The multi-year AI advantage: Building the enterprise of tomorrow, along with a spotlight report on AI and decision-making, How AI is quietly reshaping executive decisions. As organizations enter 2026, the research suggests that organizations and their leaders will need to be more deliberate about governance, skills, accountability and human-AI chemistry to realize the full transformative value of AI.

As AI adoption is growing, businesses are accelerating AI investments for competitiveness and long-term value creation

According to The multi-year AI advantage: Building the enterprise of tomorrow, which surveyed 1,505 executives at large organizations globally, 38% of organizations already operationalize generative AI use cases, while six in ten organizations are now exploring agentic AI applications. Nearly half of Chinese organizations are piloting or deploying agentic AI, ahead of US and European ones. Two thirds of business leaders believe that if they fail to scale AI as rapidly as their competitors, they risk missing strategic opportunities and losing their competitive edge.

Meanwhile, the way organizations measure AI success is evolving. Operational efficency and cost reduction are no longer the sole benchmarks: new measures of ROI include revenue growth, risk management and compliance, knowledge management and customer experience and personalization. Business leaders globally are more mindful than ever of the need to maintain control over their critical assets. More than half of organizations now prioritize data sovereignty, ensuring that sensitive or regulated data remains under their control.

Looking ahead, organizations are planning to accelerate AI investments, prioritizing functions with well-defined processes and measurable outcomes, and signaling a shift from experimentation towards long-term value creation. Nearly two thirds say they have started pausing lower-value AI projects to redirect their efforts toward high-impact areas. On average, they expect to allocate 5% of their annual business budget1 to AI initiatives in 2026, up from 3% in 2025, and aim to focus on infrastructure, data, governance, and workforce upskilling, laying a strong foundation for AI adoption and impact.

“We have now entered a new, more pragmatic and realistic era of AI-driven transformation, focused on longer-term, enterprise-wide implementations, to improve not just productivity , but revenue, customer experience, risk management, innovation, or decision-making,” says Pascal Brier, Chief Innovation Officer at Capgemini and Member of the Group Executive Committee. “AI has now crossed a critical threshold: the question is no longer whether to pursue AI, but how to embed it into the fabric of the enterprise. As we enter 2026, many organizations are rightly prioritizing strong AI foundations – data, governance, and human-AI chemistry – but one other area stands out as a critical factor in successful AI deployments – leadership readiness. AI use is also now informing strategic decision-making. How leaders set a clear vision for its use across the enterprise and take responsibility for it will be key to effectively harness its transformative power.”

AI is reshaping decision-making

In addition, a spotlight report on decision-making, How AI is quietly reshaping executive decisions, surveyed 500 CXOs including 100 CEOs. It finds that more than half of CXOs are using AI to support or inform their strategic decision-making today, either “actively” – a trend expected to more than double within the next three years – or “selectively”, with close to another third currently “experimenting” with it. If these CXOs are currently mostly using AI to help with emails, meeting notes and documents, and research and analysis, in 3 years they expect to use it primarily to augment and challenge strategic thinking.

Early adoption is already delivering value. More than half of CXOs report reduced time and cost to make decisions, and improvements in creativity and foresight through the use of AI. At the same time, leaders are clear that AI remains an input rather than a replacement for human judgment. Just 1% of CXOs believe AI could autonomously make certain strategic decisions in the next one to three years.

CEOs, CFOs and COOs are also mindful of the ramifications of AI-driven decision making. Just 41% of them report an above-average level of trust in AI for executive decision-making, with the main concerns for all CXOs being legal and security risks as well as difficulty to explain AI-influenced decisions. In addition, many senior leaders remain reluctant to discuss their own use of AI publicly. Only 11% of CXOs say they currently highlight or plan to highlight the use of AI in business decisions. Those who prefer not to disclose AI use cite concerns about reputational risk if AI-influenced decisions go wrong and uncertainty around how clients, partners and the public perceive AI use.

Methodology of the reports

For The multi-year AI advantage: Building the enterprise of tomorrow report, 1,505 executives at organizations with more than $1 billion in annual revenue across 15 industries in North America, Europe, APAC, and Latin America were surveyed. All these organizations have already deployed AI at limited or full scale and executives surveyed were director-level and above. The survey was conducted in November 2025.

For the How AI is quietly reshaping executive decisions report, the Capgemini Research Institute conducted a quantitative survey of 500 C-suite executives, including 100 CEOs. Executives surveyed were employed at organizations with annual revenue exceeding $10 billion, spanning 16 countries and 13 industries. The survey was conducted in August and September 2025. The survey findings were complemented with insights from in-depth interviews with 6 C-level executives.

Do you think there's more to the story for Hewlett Packard Enterprise?","In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk tend to justify a higher “normal” or “fair” P/S multiple, while slower growth and higher risk usually point to a lower one. The context around the business therefore matters as much as the raw number.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise currently trades on a P/S of 0.86x. That sits below the broader Tech industry average of 1.84x and also below the peer group average of 4.39x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Hewlett Packard Enterprise is 2.44x, which is their estimate of an appropriate P/S multiple given factors such as the company’s growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics.

This Fair Ratio is designed to be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the industry because it incorporates those company specific drivers rather than relying only on broad group averages. Comparing Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current 0.86x P/S to the 2.44x Fair Ratio, the shares screen as undervalued on this measure.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Hewlett Packard Enterprise Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. On Simply Wall St’s Community page you can use Narratives, where you and other investors link a clear story about Hewlett Packard Enterprise to concrete forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins. You can then compare the resulting Fair Value estimate with the current price to decide whether it looks like a buy or a sell for your personal view, and see that Fair Value update automatically as new news or earnings arrive. Some investors might build a higher value story around AI, networking and cloud growth. Others, looking at the same company, may set a lower value because they focus more on hardware, memory cycle risk and integration challenges.

ID4,Albertsons,2026-01-15 08:39:02+00:00,Investing.com,Morgan Stanley downgrades Albertsons stock rating to Underweight on grocery wars risk,Not Available,,,,,https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/morgan-stanley-downgrades-albertsons-stock-rating-to-underweight-on-grocery-wars-risk-93CH-4448763,"Investing.com - Morgan Stanley downgraded from Equalweight to Underweight on Thursday, while significantly lowering its price target to $14.00 from $20.00.
Morgan Stanley believes Albertsons faces the highest risk among food retailers in ""intensifying grocery wars,"" potentially leading to deeper market share losses in 2026.
Albertsons’ substantial pharmacy business represents another concern, as the company has the largest pharmacy mix in Morgan Stanley’s coverage universe.
According to InvestingPro, Albertsons’ current EV/EBITDA ratio is 6.74, with the stock trading close to its Fair Value.
Goldman Sachs also revised its price target to $24.00, maintaining a Buy rating on the stock.","Investing.com - Morgan Stanley downgraded from Equalweight to Underweight on Thursday, while significantly lowering its price target to $14.00 from $20.00. This comes as InvestingPro data shows 12 analysts have recently revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, despite the stock currently trading at a P/E ratio of 11.57.

The investment firm cited three key factors behind the downgrade, with grocery market competition topping the list. Morgan Stanley believes Albertsons faces the highest risk among food retailers in ""intensifying grocery wars,"" potentially leading to deeper market share losses in 2026.

Albertsons’ substantial pharmacy business represents another concern, as the company has the largest pharmacy mix in Morgan Stanley’s coverage universe. The firm expects industry-wide pharmacy headwinds of 85-155 basis points could impact Albertsons more severely than competitors.

The downgrade also reflects limited top-line growth drivers for Albertsons in 2026, as the company’s recent sales growth has been primarily driven by pharmacy sales rather than core food sales, unlike other retailers in the sector. InvestingPro data reveals the company’s revenue growth was just 2.24% in the last twelve months.

Morgan Stanley further anticipates Albertsons will face margin pressure in 2026 after excluding benefits from IRA rebates, though it acknowledged the stock’s undemanding valuation at approximately 4.6x next-twelve-months EV/EBITDA could provide some support if inflation or unit growth rebounds more than expected. According to InvestingPro, Albertsons’ current EV/EBITDA ratio is 6.74, with the stock trading close to its Fair Value. Investors can access Albertsons’ comprehensive Pro Research Report, along with additional financial insights available for over 1,400 US equities.

In other recent news, Albertsons Companies reported its third-quarter earnings for fiscal year 2025, revealing an earnings per share (EPS) of $0.72, which exceeded analyst projections of $0.68. However, the company’s revenue slightly fell short of expectations, coming in at $19.12 billion compared to the anticipated $19.18 billion. Despite the EPS beat, concerns over the revenue shortfall and declining gross margins were noted. Following these results, UBS lowered its price target for Albertsons to $23.00, citing delayed turnaround efforts in a challenging macroeconomic environment, while maintaining a Buy rating. Similarly, BMO Capital adjusted its price target to $23.00, noting solid third-quarter results but highlighting sluggish industry volumes. Goldman Sachs also revised its price target to $24.00, maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. These developments reflect ongoing challenges and adjustments in analyst expectations for Albertsons.

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

With Creator Studio, however, Apple has put a bunch of tools into a brown paper bag of confusion: The assortment is too complex for the Canva crowd yet underpowered compared to the Adobe suite.

With Creator Studio, however, Apple has put a bunch of tools into a brown paper bag of confusion: The assortment is too complex for the Canva crowd yet underpowered compared to the Adobe suite.

Stiff competition

Adobe CC is the true bundle for creators. It covers every industry: design, publishing, motion design, video, audio, and even office productivity via Acrobat. For $70 per month—no perpetual, one-time-payment licenses available anymore—you get all you need, plus Adobe’s AI, Firefly. In fact, for most people it’s overkill. Not many people do even a third of what Adobe CC covers. This is why so many people are fed up with their subscription model (worth noting: It still has about 41 million paying users).

Canva is an all-in-one bundle for everyday creators: a browser-first suite that makes it easy to design social posts, presentations, simple videos, print materials, and brand kits without needing pro expertise. It’s built around a cloud account with a big free tier, plus paid plans ($15/month for individuals and $10/month per user for the teams version) that include AI tools. For a while, Canva was “enough” for 90% of what people make, and anything heavier—like advanced photo compositing, full motion graphics pipelines, high-end audio—usually lived elsewhere. Now, however, they’ve added free perpetual licenses for the Affinity suite, which competes with Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign.

Both of them are coherent in their focus and power in their own way. That’s not really something you can say about Apple’s new $13 monthly subscription package. Apple is asking us to pay for a hodgepodge of apps where the flagship video editor, Final Cut Pro (FCP), may not even be the runner-up anymore. Outside of very high-end video editing—still dominated by Avid—Adobe Premiere Pro sits comfortably at the top of the market share charts with an estimated 30 million users in 2024. I say “estimated,” because Adobe hasn’t released official numbers. Like Apple, which last claimed Final Cut Pro had 2.5 million users in 2018. A lot has changed since that year, and many video editors now argue that Blackmagic Design’s Resolve is the best video editor (and it is free).

Another main plate in the Creator Studio is the newly acquired Pixelmator Pro, which Apple is seemingly positioning as its Photoshop killer. If you want a potential Adobe killer, you look at Affinity. Now owned by Canva, the Affinity suite (Photo, Designer, Publisher) is a genuine triple-threat that rivals Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign with a free (again, there are free options for most of the Apple and Adobe apps) price tag.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/01/p-1-91474571-apple-creator-studio.jpg",N,,2026-01-15 05:59:29.485969

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

The Talent Pool is Overflowing: The world’s brightest minds are flocking to AI.

From computer scientists to mathematicians, the next generation of innovators is pouring its energy into this field.

This influx of talent guarantees a constant stream of groundbreaking ideas and rapid advancements.

By investing in AI, you’re essentially backing the future.

The future is powered by artificial intelligence, and the time to invest is NOW.

Don’t be a spectator in this technological revolution.

Dive into the AI gold rush and watch your portfolio soar alongside the brightest minds of our generation.

This isn’t just about making money – it’s about being part of the future.

Three people close to the matter told Reuters on Monday that UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel had expressed interest in the Monte dei Paschi (MPS) stake held by Delfin during meetings with Francesco Milleri, the head of the Italian holding company.

The sources said UniCredit was also potentially interested in Delfin's stake in insurer Generali (GASI.MI), opens new tab.

UniCredit's statement said that it was the job of the bank's internal M&A team to study all possible growth options, including external ones.

""This at any one time will involve discussions with, and assessment and analysis of, the target in question, none of which is indicative of the likelihood of a transaction taking place,"" it said.

Italian financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported on Thursday that a new meeting between Milleri and Orcel could take place as early as this weekend, adding that the Delfin chairman had reservations about the transaction.

In expressing its disappointment about ""recent rumours and constant noise"" about its alleged interest in the MPS and other stakes, Italy's second-largest bank said that, at present, these were ""pure invention"" and served no purpose other than to distort and confuse the market.

Under veteran M&A banker Orcel, UniCredit has worked to deploy part of its large reserves of capital to buy stakes in Germany's Commerzbank (CBKG.DE), opens new tab and Greece's Alpha Bank (ACBr.AT), opens new tab, but it has failed so far to clinch a merger.

The line, which is slated to launch in the spring, is a stylish testament to McCartney’s continuing dialogue on ethics and transparency in the fashion industry.

McCartney (yes, the daughter of The Beatles guitarist Paul McCartney) is known for her responsible luxury maverick status and penchant for sustainable innovation. Last Paris Fashion Week, the designer made waves for debuting plant-based feathers on the runway, which were reported to move with all the drama of real feathers while remaining animal cruelty-free. Her pieces can be found in the closets of fashion figures Emily Ratajkowski and Amelia Gray, beloved for their singular style.

Her latest collaboration with H&M carries on her legacy of sustainable fashion, bucking traditional textiles for lower-impact alternatives that avoid generating unnecessary waste. Ethical fashion enthusiasts will be excited to hear that the line is made chiefly from certified, recycled materials, proof that style doesn’t have to come at the cost of a living planet. Amid news of fast fashion’s role in fueling the global waste crisis, McCartney’s dedication to innovating design feels like a much-needed step towards the right direction.

“Stella is a true ground breaker,” says Ann-Sofie Johansson, Creative Advisor for H&M. “From the start, she disrupted fashion with designs that put forward a rule-breaking femininity. This collection is full of must-have pieces that nod to that legacy. Stella’s moral compass and tireless commitment to sustainable practices have long inspired all of us at H&M, so it’s an honour to partner with her on such an ambitious project.”

Walking The Sustainability Talk

With McCartney, H&M reconceptualizes the idea of collaboration. Beyond a meeting of creative minds, the collection is also a breeding ground for impactful, long-lasting action and a platform to foster hope for the future.

McCartney’s latest collaboration introduces an “Insights Board,” a forum open to different stakeholders across the apparel value chain — from raw material suppliers to all the way to retailers — to brainstorm, ideate, and discuss how to make their industry more sustainable, ecological, and attuned to animal welfare.

Of her latest H&M collection, McCartney says, “This second partnership feels like a chance to look at how far we’ve come on sustainability, cruelty-free practices, and conscious designs — and to stay honest about how far we still have to go, together. I am thrilled to have H&M join me on this road; real change only happens when we push from both the outside and the inside, and I’ve always believed in infiltrating from within to move the industry forward.”

From London To The World

During the 2025 Fashion Awards in London, the world saw its first glimpse of the second H&M x Stella McCartney collection. Models, entrepreneurs, and artists such as Gray, Ratajkowski, Anitta, Yasmin Wijnaldum, Bel Priestley, Alton Mason, and Kiara Nirghin donned pieces from the line, cutting through the carpet with McCartney’s design DNA: lace, sparkles, and striking nods to the early aughts.

“It was an honour to wear this amazing look and give people a sneak peek of the Stella McCartney H&M collection,” says Brazilian singer-songwriter Anitta. “I felt amazing in red. This feels like another perfect match, between two very beloved brands.”

A scrap storage hall, including extended outdoor areas, is now ready for operation.

Once the final interior installations are completed in early 2026, the facility will go online and strengthen the company's recycling capabilities.

The new hall enables segregated storage of different aluminium scrap grades, aluminium pieces, and primary metal such as T-bars, ingots, and sows.

Together with the new outdoor storage areas, the facility ensures precise material separation, improved quality control, and more efficient workflows.

With an added capacity of around 16,000 tons, it enhances logistics and material flow.

The building also houses modern offices, social areas, and a workshop, along with designated parking for industrial vehicles.

Short distances between material intake, storage, and casting improve efficiency and reduce handling time.

A covered sampling station ensures safe access for inspecting incoming trucks.

Materials are visually checked and analysed here using spectrometers to detect differences in aluminium content, impurities, and piece size.

At a latest share price of £4.80, Barclays has seen a 26.5% 90 day share price return, while its 1 year total shareholder return of 75.3% points to momentum that has built over a longer stretch.

If bank stocks like Barclays are on your radar, it can also be useful to compare them with other financial names and ideas through .

With the shares up sharply and trading only about 1.8% below the latest analyst target, yet with an estimated intrinsic value implying a 44.9% discount, you have to ask yourself: is there still a buying opportunity here, or is the market already pricing in future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 4.1% Overvalued

With Barclays last closing at £4.80 against a narrative fair value of £4.61, the story is built around earnings quality rather than extreme optimism.

Ongoing investments in digital banking and technology platforms including integration of fintech partnerships and sustained client onboarding in corporate banking are expected to drive operational efficiency and expand Barclays' digital revenue streams, supporting stronger net margins.

Want to see what is sitting behind that modest premium tag? The narrative focuses on revenue, margins and valuation. Curious how those moving parts combine into a single fair value number?

Result: Fair Value of £4.61 (OVERVALUED)

However, there are still pressure points to watch, including tougher competition for UK deposits and loans, as well as ongoing regulatory reviews that could reshape Barclays' capital and costs.

Another Angle On Valuation

The narrative fair value suggests Barclays is 4.1% overvalued at £4.80, but the current P/E of 11.1x tells a slightly different story. It sits just under the European Banks average of 11.3x and below peers at 13.9x, yet above the fair ratio of 9.9x. That mix points to some valuation risk if the market drifts closer to the fair ratio. How much of a premium are you comfortable with?

Dive Brief:

IBM on Thursday launched Sovereign Core, a purpose-built software platform letting customers create, deploy and manage cloud and AI workloads under an organization’s own authority.

Instead of adding sovereignty controls to existing architectures, IBM Sovereign Core “makes sovereignty an inherent property of the software itself,” the company said. Regulatory risks are pushing CIOs to adjust their infrastructure and innovation strategies to consider local data or sovereignty requirements.

“It is addressing what we’ve seen for a lot of corporations, a lot of CIOs, is a major challenge,” Rick Villars, group VP of worldwide research at IDC, told CIO Dive. The platform will be available in tech preview starting in February, with full general availability planned for mid-year.

Dive Insight:

CIOs are facing mounting pressure to embed AI into processes throughout the organization. Yet AI deployment at scale can prove challenging, particularly for multinational companies facing digital sovereignty requirements in countries outside of the U.S.

Countries in the European Union, Canada, Germany, India, Australia and many more have enacted a wide range of laws governing digital infrastructure, often enforcing data localization requirements and other measures protecting data and technology infrastructure.

Vendors are responding. SAP, for example, deployed its EU AI Cloud in December to help support customers with their AI deployments in countries with strict regulatory environments.

Enterprises with a multinational presence are realizing that digital sovereignty requirements make it “virtually impossible for them to think about implementing consistency or scale in their AI investments,” Villars said.

Gartner predicts more than 75% of enterprises outside of the U.S. will adopt a digital sovereignty strategy supported by a sovereign cloud strategy, according to a survey of 241 CIOs and IT leaders in Western Europe. Of those surveyed, 61% cited geopolitical factors as a driving force toward local or regional cloud providers.

Sovereign clouds can help companies meet local data requirements piecemeal, but often lack the consistency needed to replicate an AI investment across different parts of the organization, Villars said. It’s a significant barrier preventing enterprises from thinking about large AI deployments, he added.

“What IBM has announced for this system is an approach that allows companies to bring some of that consistency back,” Villars said.

IBM Sovereign Core is built on Red Hat’s open source foundation. It provides a customer-operated control plane allowing enterprises to maintain direct authority over operations, deployments and system configurations, the company said.

The platform enables ongoing compliance by generating evidence of data being stored and managed within a sovereign boundary and allows for AI model deployment, local inference execution and agent operations under local governance without exporting data to external providers, according to IBM.

Customers can deploy the product in on-premises data centers, in-region cloud infrastructure or via IT service providers.

“This is sovereign by design,” Priya Srinivasan, general manager of IBM software products, told CIO Dive. While the product’s compliance center will come pre-loaded with sovereign frameworks specific to each country with such rules, it also allows for customizations, Srinivasan said.

There’s not a singular fix for every sovereignty need — and IBM Sovereign Core isn’t as comprehensive as a full suite of cloud services, Villars said. However, the product is a standard building block allowing enterprises to construct data “islands in isolation” from the same foundation.

As CIOs struggle to manage AI deployments due to sovereignty constraints, hyperscalers and infrastructure companies will be looking to provide products like IBM Sovereign Core and SAP EU AI Cloud to navigate those challenges.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/j_YwDejyl-xmlrFVCvmh69y0ikgovJSjMbK6GkFsK2M/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE2MjAxOTQ4LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-15 02:59:36.999485

Trigger Jump Securities Based on the Performance of the Common Stock of Micron Technology, Inc. due August 4, 2027

Principal at Risk Securities

Unlike conventional debt securities, the securities will pay no interest and do not guarantee the return of the full principal amount at maturity. Instead, if the final underlier value is greater than or equal to 60% of the initial underlier value, which we refer to as the trigger value, at maturity investors will receive the stated principal amount plus a positive return equal to the fixed percentage, which will be determined on the pricing date and will be at least 41.20%. However, if the final underlier value is less than the trigger value, at maturity investors will lose 1% of the stated principal amount for every 1% that the final underlier value is less than the initial underlier value. Under these circumstances, the amount investors receive will be less than 60% of the stated principal amount and could be zero. The securities are for investors who are willing and able to risk their principal and forgo current income in exchange for the opportunity to receive a return equal to the fixed percentage if the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value. Investors may lose their entire initial investment in the securities. Any positive return on the securities will be limited to the fixed percentage and you will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the underlier above the fixed percentage, which may be significant. The securities are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of Barclays Bank PLC. Any payment on the securities, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC and is not guaranteed by any third party. If Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its payment obligations or become subject to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power (as described on page 5 of this document) by the relevant U.K. resolution authority, you might not receive any amounts owed to you under the securities. See “Risk Factors” and “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this document and “Risk Factors” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

In connection with this offering, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management is acting in its capacity as a selected dealer.

Additional Information Regarding Our Estimated Value of the Securities

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables, such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the pricing date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the securities might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the securities on the pricing date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the securities. The difference between the initial issue price of the securities and our estimated value of the securities is expected to result from several factors, including any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the securities, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the securities, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the securities. These other costs will include a fee paid to LFT Securities, LLC, an entity in which an affiliate of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management has an ownership interest, for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.

Our estimated value on the pricing date is not a prediction of the price at which the securities may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the securities in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the securities in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the pricing date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the pricing date for a temporary period expected to be approximately 40 days after the initial issue date of the securities because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the securities and other costs in connection with the securities that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the securities. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the securities and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the securities. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial issue date of the securities based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read “Risk Factors” beginning on page 11 of this document.

You may revoke your offer to purchase the securities at any time prior to the pricing date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the securities prior to their pricing date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the securities, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.

Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the securities or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the securities (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the securities), by acquiring the securities, each holder or beneficial owner of the securities acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the securities; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the securities into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the securities of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the securities and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the securities, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the securities, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the securities solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the securities further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the securities are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the securities may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You may lose some or all of your investment if any U.K. bail-in power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in this document as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Investment Summary

Trigger Jump Securities

Principal at Risk Securities

The Trigger Jump Securities Based on the Performance of the Common Stock of Micron Technology, Inc. due August 4, 2027 (the “securities”) can be used:

§As an alternative to direct exposure to the underlier that provides for the potential of a fixed positive return if the underlier appreciates, remains flat or depreciates, but only if the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value, in lieu of full participation in any appreciation of the underlier

§To enhance returns and potentially outperform the underlier in a moderately bullish or bearish scenario

Any positive return on the securities will be limited to the fixed percentage and you will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the underlier above the fixed percentage, which may be significant.

If the final underlier value is less than the trigger value, the securities are exposed on a 1:1 basis to the negative performance of the underlier.

Maturity: Approximately 1.5 years Fixed percentage: At least 41.20%. The actual fixed percentage will be determined on the pricing date. Trigger value: 60% of the initial underlier value Minimum payment at maturity: None. Investors may lose their entire initial investment in the securities. Interest: None

Key Investment Rationale

The securities are for investors who are willing and able to risk their principal and forgo current income in exchange for the opportunity to receive a return equal to the fixed percentage if the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value. Investors may lose their entire initial investment in the securities.

The following scenarios reflect the potential payment on the securities, if any, at maturity:

Upside Scenario The final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value. In this case, at maturity, the securities pay the stated principal amount of $1,000 plus a positive return equal to the fixed percentage of at least 41.20%. The actual fixed percentage will be determined on the pricing date. Downside Scenario The final underlier value is less than the trigger value. In this case, at maturity, the securities pay less than 60% of the stated principal amount and the percentage loss of the stated principal amount will be equal to the percentage decrease from the initial underlier value to the final underlier value. For example, if the final underlier value is 55% less than the initial underlier value, the securities will pay $450.00 per security, or 45% of the stated principal amount, for a loss of 55% of the stated principal amount. There is no minimum payment at maturity on the securities. Accordingly, investors could lose their entire investment in the securities.

Selected Purchase Considerations

The securities are not appropriate for all investors. The securities may be an appropriate investment for you if all of the following statements are true:

§You do not seek an investment that produces periodic interest or coupon payments or other sources of current income.

§You anticipate that the final underlier value will be greater than or equal to the trigger value, and you are willing and able to accept the risk that, if it is not, you will lose a significant portion, and possibly all, of the stated principal amount of the securities.

§You understand and accept that any potential upside return on the securities is limited to the fixed percentage, and you will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the underlier above the fixed percentage, which may be significant.

How the Trigger Jump Securities Work

Payoff Diagram

The payoff diagram below illustrates the payment at maturity on the securities based on the following terms:

Stated principal amount: $1,000 per security Hypothetical fixed percentage: 41.20%. The actual fixed percentage will be determined on the pricing date. Trigger value: 60% of the initial underlier value Minimum payment at maturity: None. You could lose your entire initial investment in the securities.

Trigger Jump Securities Payoff Diagram

Scenario Analysis

§Upside Scenario. If the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value, at maturity investors will receive the $1,000 stated principal amount plus a positive return equal to the hypothetical fixed percentage of 41.20%.

§For example, if the underlier appreciates by 5%, at maturity investors would receive a return equal to the hypothetical fixed percentage of 41.20%, or $1,412.00 per security.

§If the underlier appreciates by 50%, at maturity investors would receive a return equal to the hypothetical fixed percentage of 41.20%, or $1,412.00 per security, even though the underlier has appreciated by more than the fixed percentage.

§If the underlier depreciates by 10%, at maturity investors would receive a return equal to the hypothetical fixed percentage of 41.20%, or $1,412.00 per security, even though the underlier has depreciated.

§Downside Scenario. If the final underlier value is less than the trigger value, at maturity investors will receive an amount that is less than 60% of the $1,000 stated principal amount and that will reflect a 1% loss of principal for each 1% decline in the underlier. Investors may lose their entire initial investment in the securities.

§For example, if the underlier depreciates by 55%, investors would lose 55% of their principal and receive only $450.00 per security at maturity, or 45% of the stated principal amount.

What Is the Total Return on the Securities at Maturity, Assuming a Range of Performances for the Underlier?

The following table and examples illustrate the hypothetical payment at maturity and hypothetical total return at maturity on the securities. The “total return” as used in this document is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results from comparing the payment at maturity per $1,000 stated principal amount to $1,000.00. The table and examples set forth below assume a hypothetical initial underlier value of $100.00, a hypothetical trigger value of $60.00 (or 60% of the hypothetical initial underlier value) and a hypothetical fixed percentage of 41.20%. The hypothetical initial underlier value of $100.00 has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and may not represent a likely actual initial underlier value. Please see “Micron Technology, Inc. Overview” below for recent actual values of the underlier. The actual initial underlier value, trigger value and fixed percentage will be determined on the pricing date. Each hypothetical payment at maturity or total return set forth below is for illustrative purposes only and may not be the actual payment at maturity or total return applicable to a purchaser of the securities. The numbers appearing in the following table and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The table and examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the securities.

Hypothetical Examples of Amount Payable at Maturity

The following examples illustrate how the payment at maturity and total return in different hypothetical scenarios are calculated.

Example 1: The value of the underlier increases from the initial underlier value of $100.00 to a final underlier value of $150.00.

Because the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value, the payment at maturity is calculated as follows:

$1,000 + ($1,000 × fixed percentage)

= $1,000 + ($1,000 × 41.20%)

= $1,412.00

Because the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value, the payment at maturity is equal to $1,412.00 per security, representing a total return of 41.20% on the securities, even though the underlier appreciated by 50.00% from its initial underlier value to its final underlier value.

Example 2: The value of the underlier decreases from the initial underlier value of $100.00 to a final underlier value of $90.00.

Because the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value, the payment at maturity is calculated as follows:

$1,000 + ($1,000 × fixed percentage)

= $1,000 + ($1,000 × 41.20%)

= $1,412.00

Although the underlier depreciated by 10.00% from its initial underlier value to its final underlier value, because the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value, the payment at maturity is equal to $1,412.00 per security, representing a total return of 41.20% on the securities.

Example 3: The value of the underlier decreases from the initial underlier value of $100.00 to a final underlier value of $40.00.

Because the final underlier value is less than the trigger value and the underlier performance factor is 40.00%, the payment at maturity is equal to $400.00 per security, calculated as follows:

$1,000 × underlier performance factor

= $1,000 × (final underlier value / initial underlier value)

= $1,000 × ($40.00 / $100.00) = $400.00

The total return on the securities is -60.00%.

Risk Factors

An investment in the securities involves significant risks. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the securities. Investing in the securities is not equivalent to investing directly in the underlier. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the securities are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the securities generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the securities unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the securities.

Risks Relating to the Securities Generally

§The securities do not pay interest or guarantee the return of any principal. The terms of the securities differ from those of ordinary debt securities in that the securities do not pay interest or guarantee the return of any of the stated principal amount at maturity. Instead, if the final underlier value is less than the trigger value, which is 60% of the initial underlier value, the payment at maturity will be an amount in cash that is less than the $1,000 stated principal amount of each security by a percentage equal to the percentage decrease from the initial underlier value to the final underlier value. There is no minimum payment at maturity on the securities and, accordingly, you could lose your entire initial investment in the securities.

§The potential return on the securities is limited to the fixed percentage. Any positive return on your securities will not exceed the fixed percentage, regardless of any appreciation in the value of the underlier, which may be significant. If the underlier has appreciated since the pricing date by more than the fixed percentage, you will receive a lower return on the securities than you would have received if you had invested directly in the underlier.

§The fixed percentage provides an enhanced return only for a limited range of positive performance of the underlier. The fixed percentage enhances returns of the underlier only when the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value and the underlier has not appreciated by more than the fixed percentage. Accordingly, if the underlier depreciates below the trigger value or if the underlier appreciates by more than the fixed percentage from the pricing date to the valuation date, the fixed percentage will not enhance the return on the securities as compared to the return of the underlier.

§Any payment on the securities will be determined based on the closing prices of the underlier on the dates specified. Any payment on the securities will be determined based on the closing prices of the underlier on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable value of the underlier determined at any other time.

§Investing in the securities is not equivalent to investing in the underlier. Investors in the securities will not own the underlier or have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the underlier.

§The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the securities are uncertain. There is no direct legal authority regarding the proper U.S. federal income tax treatment of the securities, and we do not plan to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). Consequently, significant aspects of the tax treatment of the securities are uncertain, and the IRS or a court might not agree with the treatment of the securities as prepaid forward contracts, as described below under “Additional provisions—Tax considerations.” If the IRS were successful in asserting an alternative treatment for the securities, the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the securities could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, in 2007 the Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on various issues regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. Any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the securities, possibly with retroactive effect. You should review carefully the sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders,” and consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the securities (including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by the 2007 notice), as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

§Credit of issuer. The securities are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the securities, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the securities and, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you might not receive any amount owed to you under the terms of the securities.

§You may lose some or all of your investment if any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the securities or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the securities (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the securities), by acquiring the securities, each holder or beneficial owner of the securities acknowledges, accepts,

agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this document. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the securities losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the securities or receiving a different security from the securities, which may be worth significantly less than the securities and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the securities. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the securities will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the securities. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this document as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underlier

§No affiliation with the issuer of the underlier. The issuer of the underlier is not an affiliate of ours, is not involved with this offering in any way, and has no obligation to consider your interests in taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of the securities. We have not made any due diligence inquiry with respect to the issuer of the underlier in connection with this offering.

§Single equity risk. The price of the underlier can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to the underlier and its issuer, such as stock price volatility, earnings, financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political conditions. We urge you to review financial and other information filed periodically with the SEC by the issuer of the underlier.

§Anti-dilution protection is limited, and the calculation agent has discretion to make anti-dilution adjustments. The calculation agent may in its sole discretion make adjustments affecting the amounts payable on the securities upon the occurrence of certain corporate events (such as stock splits or extraordinary or special dividends) that the calculation agent determines have a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of the underlier. However, the calculation agent might not make such adjustments in response to all events that could affect the underlier. The occurrence of any such event and any adjustment made by the calculation agent (or a determination by the calculation agent not to make any adjustment) may adversely affect the market price of, and any amounts payable on, the securities. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

§Reorganization or other events could adversely affect the value of the securities or result in the securities being accelerated. Upon the occurrence of certain reorganization events or a nationalization, expropriation, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or de-listing of the underlier, the calculation agent may replace the underlier with shares of another company identified as described in the prospectus supplement or, in some cases, with shares, cash or other assets distributed to holders of the underlier upon the occurrence of that event. In the alternative, the calculation agent may accelerate the maturity date for a payment determined by the calculation agent or may make other changes to the terms of the securities to account for the occurrence of that event. Any decision by the calculation agent to replace the underlier, to accelerate the securities or to otherwise adjust the terms of the securities could adversely affect the value of, and any amount payable on, the securities, perhaps significantly, and could result in a significantly lower return on the securities than if the calculation agent had made a different decision. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

§Governmental legislative or regulatory actions, such as sanctions, could adversely affect your investment in the securities. Governmental legislative or regulatory actions, including, without limitation, sanctions-related actions by the U.S. or a foreign government, could prohibit or otherwise restrict persons from holding the securities or the underlier, or engaging in transactions in them, and any such action could adversely affect the value of the underlier. These legislative or regulatory actions could result in restrictions on the securities or the de-listing of the underlier. You may lose a significant portion or all of your initial investment in the securities if the underlier is de-listed or if you are forced to divest the securities due to government mandates, especially if such de-listing occurs or such divestment must be made at a time when the value of the securities has declined. See “—Reorganization or other events could adversely affect the value of the securities or result in the securities being accelerated” above.

§We may accelerate the securities if a change-in-law event occurs. Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the securities or the underlier, or engaging in transactions in them, the calculation agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the maturity date for a payment determined by the calculation agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be

significantly less than any amount that would be due on the securities if they were not accelerated. However, if the calculation agent elects not to accelerate the securities, the value of, and any amount payable on, the securities could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

§We may engage in business with or involving the issuer of the underlier without regard to your interests. We or our affiliates may presently or from time to time engage in business with the issuer of the underlier without regard to your interests and thus may acquire non-public information about the issuer of the underlier. Neither we nor any of our affiliates undertakes to disclose any such information to you. In addition, we or our affiliates from time to time have published and in the future may publish research reports with respect to the issuer of the underlier, which may or may not recommend that investors buy or hold the underlier.

§Hedging and trading activity by the issuer and its affiliates could potentially adversely affect the value of the securities. Hedging or trading activities of the issuer’s affiliates and of any other hedging counterparty with respect to the securities could adversely affect the value of the underlier and, as a result, could decrease the amount an investor may receive on the securities at maturity, if any. Any of these hedging or trading activities on or prior to the pricing date could potentially increase the initial underlier value and, as a result, the trigger value, which is the price at or above which the underlier must close on the valuation date so that the investor does not suffer a loss on their initial investment in the securities. Additionally, such hedging or trading activities during the term of the securities, including on the valuation date, could potentially affect the price of the underlier on the valuation date and, accordingly, the amount of cash an investor will receive at maturity, if any.

§We and our affiliates, and any dealer participating in the distribution of the securities, may engage in various activities or make determinations that could materially affect your securities in various ways and create conflicts of interest. We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the securities, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the securities.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the securities, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the underlier. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the securities. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the securities into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the securities.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the securities, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the securities. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the securities and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the securities instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the securities for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

Furthermore, the selected dealer or its affiliates will have the option to conduct a material portion of the hedging activities for us in connection with the securities. The selected dealer or its affiliates would expect to realize a projected profit from such hedging activities, and this projected profit would be in addition to any selling concession that the selected dealer realizes for the sale of the securities to you. This additional projected profit may create a further incentive for the selected dealer to sell the securities to you.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the calculation agent for the securities. As calculation agent, we will determine any values of the underlier and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the securities. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underlier” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the securities, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the securities.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Securities and the Secondary Market

§The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange, and secondary trading may be limited. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to offer to purchase the securities in the secondary market but are not required to do so and may cease any such market making activities at any time, without notice. Even if a secondary market develops, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the securities easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the securities, the price, if any, at which you may be able to trade your securities is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the securities. In addition, Barclays Capital Inc. or one or more of our other affiliates may at any time hold an unsold portion of the securities (as described on

the cover page of this document), which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the securities. The securities are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your securities to maturity.

§The market price of the securities will be influenced by many unpredictable factors. Several factors will influence the value of the securities in the secondary market and the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC may be willing to purchase or sell the securities in the secondary market. Although we expect that generally the value of the underlier on any day will affect the value of the securities more than any other single factor, other factors that may influence the value of the securities include:

othe volatility (frequency and magnitude of changes in value) of the underlier;

odividend rates on the underlier;

ointerest and yield rates in the market;

otime remaining until the securities mature;

osupply and demand for the securities;

ogeopolitical conditions and economic, financial, political, regulatory and judicial events that affect the underlier and that may affect the final underlier value; and

oany actual or anticipated changes in our credit ratings or credit spreads.

The value of the underlier may be, and has recently been, volatile, and we can give you no assurance that the volatility will lessen. See “Micron Technology, Inc. Overview” below. You may receive less, and possibly significantly less, than the stated principal amount if you try to sell your securities prior to maturity.

§The estimated value of your securities is expected to be lower than the initial issue price of your securities. The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your securities. The difference between the initial issue price of your securities and the estimated value of the securities is expected as a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the securities, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the securities, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the securities. These other costs will include a fee paid to LFT Securities, LLC, an entity in which an affiliate of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management has an ownership interest, for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.

§The estimated value of your securities might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market. The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated values referenced above might be lower if such estimated values were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

§The estimated value of the securities is based on our internal pricing models, which may prove to be inaccurate and may be different from the pricing models of other financial institutions. The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the securities may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions that may be purchasers or sellers of securities in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your securities may be materially different from the estimated value of the securities determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

§The estimated value of your securities is not a prediction of the prices at which you may sell your securities in the secondary market, if any, and such secondary market prices, if any, will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your securities and may be lower than the estimated value of your securities. The estimated value of the securities will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the securities from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your securities in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the securities. Further, as secondary market prices of your securities take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the securities such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the securities, secondary market prices of your securities will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your securities. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the securities from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your securities, and any sale prior to the maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you.

§The temporary price at which we may initially buy the securities in the secondary market and the value we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may not be indicative of future prices of your securities. Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the pricing date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the securities, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the securities on the pricing date, as well as the secondary market value of the securities, for a temporary period after the initial issue date of the securities. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your securities.

Additional Information about the Securities

Please read this information in conjunction with the terms on the cover page of this document.

Additional provisions: Minimum ticketing size: $1,000 / 1 security Tax considerations:

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion, when read in combination with those sections, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the securities.

Based on current market conditions, in the opinion of our special tax counsel, the securities should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with respect to the underlier. Assuming this treatment is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the securities (including redemption at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the securities, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the securities. This gain or loss on your securities should be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if you hold your securities for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of securities at the original issue price. However, the IRS or a court may not respect this treatment, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the securities could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the “constructive ownership” regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the securities, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the securities, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the securities do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the securities with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the securities. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the securities.

When the heart pumps blood into the aorta to go across the entire body, the first exit it takes is towards the coronary arteries.
You implant it in the coronary artery when there is a lesion.
When it comes to value, the value of the Bioadaptor is for all patients that have coronary artery disease.","Coronary stents were first developed in the mid 1980s, revolutionizing coronary artery disease treatment for patients.

While stents are still used in patients today, only incremental developments in their technology have been made over the last 30 to 40 years. One company, Elixir Medical, is trying to change that.

The company focuses on re-imagining how new medical technologies will breathe new life into vascular interventions, reshaping the space for decades to come, and developing disruptive platforms to treat coronary and peripheral artery disease.

Elixir’s newest device, the DynamX Bioadaptor, aims to not only improve clogged arteries for patients, but over time actually make the artery stronger.

The novel scaffolding device is readily available in Europe and parts of Asia, it is currently undergoing FDA testing in the U.S.

Vinayak Bhat, COO of Elixir Medical, connected with MD+DI about the adverse events rates of traditional coronary stents, how the DynamX Bioadaptor differs from conventional stents and what vessel restoration means for aging patients and long-term health outcomes, and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical trials of the device.

Can you explain in practical terms how the DynamX Bioadaptor's ""vessel restoration"" mechanism works differently from traditional stents?

Bhat: When plaque builds up in the arteries with coronary artery disease, stents have done a great job in terms of restoring blood flow to these coronary arteries. But what it does not necessarily do is restore the entire functionality of the heart. When the heart pumps blood into the aorta to go across the entire body, the first exit it takes is towards the coronary arteries. So it supplies blood there first before it goes to the brain or rest of the body. Like on an airplane, they say if the mask drops down, even if you love your child more than yourself, you first put the mask on yourself and then on the child. It is the same way here. Nature has designed the coronary arteries in a certain way and the functions, there is hemodynamic modulation in the heartbeat, and with every beat the vessel expands and contracts, there are sheer stressors, which are the communication channel for cells to respond to the changes.

So the functionality of the arteries is not just to pass blood, but also do all of these other things in terms of modulation for the entire functionality of the coronary structure. When we put in a stent, like we have been doing for the last 30+ years, you restore blood flow but take away the natural ability of arteries to expand and contract with every heart beat. That is the important functionality of the vessel. This has an impact on clinical events down the line. What we have designed with the Bioadaptor is an implant that is three coils held together by a bioresorbable polymer coating. You implant it in the coronary artery when there is a lesion. Six months after implantation, for the first six months it works like a stent to restore blood flow, but once that job is done, the bioresorbable polymer coating is gone and these coils unlock from each other, allowing restoration of the arteries.

With every heartbeat, now the vessel expands and contracts like it's supposed to do. Because of that, you have an impact on the plaque that is behind, there is no compliance mismatch. All of these have an important function in terms of reducing coronary events down the line. Currently with traditional stents, every year after the first year, there is a 2-3% chance of clinical events. Events like repeat heart attack, hospitalization, etc. By restoring the functionality by treating it with a Bioadaptor, we have impacted and made a change to that. And now we have clinical data to essentially prove that, from randomized clinical studies.

With over 35 patents behind this technology, what were the most critical engineering breakthroughs that enabled this scaffolding approach? What technical challenges did you have to overcome?

Bhat: We had the good fortune of being around for two decades in this space. We have developed stents, fully bio dissolvable scaffolds, and we have a unique group of individuals with medical backgrounds, strong technical backgrounds, drug delivery and polymer science experts, so if you look at problem statements holistically and then come up with solutions that can address the root cause of the issue. So when we set out to develop the Bioadaptor, it took us over 100 iterations just in terms of coming up with the right configuration to ensure that the restoration will be clinically similar to what a natural coronary artery gets. So all of these iterations on the bench, and we develop multiple versions.

One version that can unlock within three months, one version that can unlock within six months, really to have an understanding of what it takes to ensure restoring of the natural modulation of the artery. Over multiple iterations, a huge challenge was being in a space that has so many stents with just incremental iterations. To take that function and create a new category of device was a pretty interesting challenge. We went about doing the development on the bench, development in preclinical trials, then moving on to multiple clinical studies where we were looking at proof of concept mechanistically to show that it would work. Only then did we go on to do not one, but two randomized clinical studies in two different geographies to show the effect of this device on patients.

What does the long-term safety profile look like for the DynamX Bioadaptor beyond the six-month landmark analysis?

Bhat: We have now two first-in-man smaller studies, 50 patients each. After that, we did a 450 patient randomized clinical study, which now has 3-year follow up data. After that, we did a 2,400 patient randomized study in much sicker patients. Those patients now have a 2-year follow up. Long term data now shows not just safety but excellent efficacy of the Bioadaptor as compared to the traditional standard of care. The second study showed superiority in a landmark analysis. The first study showed an over 50% reduction in clinical events at three years. The second study showed the same. So two independent randomized studies showing a significant impact in terms of superior outcomes. Now, long-term data gives us great confidence in new technology. In addition to these new studies, we have also conducted a post-market, 5,000 patient global study which is ongoing. A lot of physicians are doing their own studies with the device. There is a wealth of data in terms of long-term safety on the Bioadaptor in addition to efficacy.

What's the adoption experience been like in European and Asian markets?

Bhat: When we initially started with the Bioadaptor, every physician who looks at it says it makes a lot of sense. When nature wants the vessel to hemodynamically modulate, we should be using devices that essentially mimic that. But, they were not really certain that just by making these changes we would impact, because traditional stents have been around for the last 30 years and people felt that that was as good as it can get. They thought these other clinical events we were seeing were just disease progression. Initially there was hesitation, but as there is more clinical data that comes out, the adoption has been excellent. We have tens of thousands of patients in the Middle East and Europe who have been treated. In Asia, patients have a say in which devices they get. A lot of patients come into physicians saying they want our Bioadaptor. They want a device that has long-term benefits. So it is getting a lot of traction moving in that direction.

What does the competitive landscape look like? How are established stent manufacturers responding to this disruptive technology?

Bhat: The competitive landscape as we entered the market, we didn't want to compete with the stent as just another product with incremental value. Now that we have clinical data showing superiority, we are positioning ourselves as a premium product from a pricing and outcomes perspective. We have no direct competitors to what the Bioadaptor can do. There are 20 to 30 companies that work in the drug-eluting stent space, and we are not necessarily competing with them, but creating a new category of therapy for patients. When it comes to value, the value of the Bioadaptor is for all patients that have coronary artery disease. Given this is a premium product, in many cases, physicians are using the Bioadaptor for more complex cases.

Those neurosurgery and diabetes updates come as Medtronic’s share price sits at US$98.74, with a 3.9% 90 day share price return and a 19.3% 1 year total shareholder return. This suggests momentum has been building over time.

If these medical device moves have your attention, this could be a good moment to scan other opportunities in and see what else fits your watchlist.

With Medtronic generating US$34,758.0m in revenue and US$4,764.0m in net income, plus a 1 year total return of 19.3% and a solid value score of 4, the key question now is whether shares are still undervalued or if the market is already pricing in future growth.

Most Popular Narrative: 11.1% Undervalued

With Medtronic last closing at US$98.74 against a narrative fair value of about US$111, the current price sits meaningfully below that implied level.

Strengthening the innovation pipeline (for example, Sphere-360, new carotid and thrombectomy devices, next-generation Ardian), combined with an enhanced governance and capital allocation structure and intensified R&D investment, is positioned to support higher long-term earnings growth through both new product launches and share gains in multi-billion-dollar addressable markets.

Curious what sits behind that upside gap? The narrative focuses on steady top line expansion, thicker margins, and a future earnings multiple that still trails many peers.

Result: Fair Value of $111.05 (UNDERVALUED)

However, execution hiccups around new product launches or extended margin pressure in underperforming units like U.S. Diabetes could quickly challenge that 11.1% upside story.

Principal at Risk Securities

Unlike conventional debt securities, the securities will pay no interest and do not guarantee the return of the full principal amount at maturity. Instead, if the closing level of each underlier is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value on any determination date (quarterly, beginning January 26, 2027) other than the final determination date, the securities will be automatically redeemed for an amount per security equal to the stated principal amount plus the call premium applicable to that determination date, as set forth below. If the securities are not automatically redeemed prior to maturity and the final underlier value of each underlier is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value, at maturity investors will receive the stated principal amount plus the maturity date premium, as set forth below. The call premium applicable to each determination date (other than the final determination date) and the maturity date premium applicable to the final determination date will be determined on the pricing date and will each be based on a return of at least approximately 14.45% per annum. If the securities are not automatically redeemed prior to maturity and the final underlier value of the worst performing underlier is less than its initial underlier value but greater than or equal to 70% of its initial underlier value, which we refer to as a trigger value, at maturity investors will receive the stated principal amount, but will not receive any premium. However, if the securities are not automatically redeemed prior to maturity and the final underlier value of any underlier is less than its trigger value, at maturity investors will lose 1% of the stated principal amount for every 1% that the final underlier value of the worst performing underlier is less than its initial underlier value. Under these circumstances, the amount investors receive will be less than 70% of the stated principal amount and could be zero. Because any payment on the securities is based on the worst performing of the underliers, a decline in the closing level of any underlier below its initial underlier value on any determination date (other than the final determination date) will result in the securities not being automatically redeemed prior to maturity, and a decline in the final underlier value of any underlier below its trigger value on the final determination date will result in a significant loss of your investment, in each case, even if the other underliers appreciate or have not declined as much. The securities are for investors who are willing and able to risk their principal and forgo current income and participation in any appreciation in the value of any underlier in exchange for the potential fixed call premium or maturity date premium and the limited protection against loss that applies only if the securities are not automatically redeemed and if the final underlier value of each underlier is greater than or equal to its trigger value. Investors may lose their entire initial investment in the securities. Any positive return on the securities will be limited to the applicable call premium or maturity date premium, as applicable, and you will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any underlier, which may be significant. The securities are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of Barclays Bank PLC. Any payment on the securities, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC and is not guaranteed by any third party. If Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its payment obligations or become subject to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power (as described on page 5 of this document) by the relevant U.K. resolution authority, you might not receive any amounts owed to you under the securities.

If the securities are not automatically redeemed prior to maturity, you will receive on the maturity date a cash payment per security determined as follows:

· If the final underlier value of each underlier is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value:

$1,000 + maturity date premium

· If the final underlier value of the worst performing underlier is less than its initial underlier value but greater than or equal to its trigger value:

$1,000

· If the final underlier value of any underlier is less than its trigger value:

$1,000 × underlier performance factor of the worst performing underlier

Under these circumstances, the payment at maturity will be less than the stated principal amount of $1,000 and will represent a loss of more than 30%, and possibly all, of an investor’s initial investment. Investors may lose their entire initial investment in the securities. Any payment on the securities, including any repayment of principal, is not guaranteed by any third party and is subject to (a) the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC and (b) the risk of exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Additional Information Regarding Our Estimated Value of the Securities

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables, such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the pricing date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the securities might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the securities on the pricing date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the securities. The difference between the initial issue price of the securities and our estimated value of the securities is expected to result from several factors, including any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the securities, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the securities, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the securities. These other costs will include a fee paid to LFT Securities, LLC, an entity in which an affiliate of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management has an ownership interest, for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.

Our estimated value on the pricing date is not a prediction of the price at which the securities may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the securities in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the securities in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the pricing date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the pricing date for a temporary period expected to be approximately 40 days after the initial issue date of the securities because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the securities and other costs in connection with the securities that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the securities. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the securities and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the securities. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial issue date of the securities based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read “Risk Factors” beginning on page 13 of this document.

You may revoke your offer to purchase the securities at any time prior to the pricing date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the securities prior to their pricing date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the securities, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.

Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the securities or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the securities (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the securities), by acquiring the securities, each holder or beneficial owner of the securities acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the securities; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the securities into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the securities of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the securities and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the securities, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the securities, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the securities solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the securities further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the securities are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the securities may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You may lose some or all of your investment if any U.K. bail-in power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in this document as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Investment Summary

Trigger Jump Securities with Auto-Callable Feature

Principal at Risk Securities

The Trigger Jump Securities with Auto-Callable Feature due January 19, 2029 Based on the Value of the Worst Performing of the Nasdaq-100 Index®, the Russell 2000® Index and the S&P 500® Index (the “securities”) can be used:

§To provide for the possibility of an automatic call of the securities at a fixed call premium if the closing level of each underlier on any determination date (other than the final determination date) is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value.

§To provide for the possibility of a return equal to the maturity date premium if the securities are not automatically redeemed prior to maturity and the final underlier value of each underlier is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value.

§As an alternative to direct exposure to the worst performing underlier that provides for the potential of a fixed positive return if the closing level of each underlier is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value as of any determination date in lieu of full participation in any potential appreciation in the value of any underlier.

§If the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity, to provide limited protection against a loss of principal in the event of a decline of any underlier from its initial underlier value to its final underlier value, but only if the final underlier value of each underlier is greater than or equal to its trigger value.

Any positive return on the securities will be limited to the applicable call premium or maturity date premium, as applicable, and you will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any underlier, which may be significant. If the final underlier value of any underlier is less than its trigger value, the securities are exposed on a 1:1 basis to the negative performance of the worst performing underlier from its initial underlier value.

Maturity: Approximately three years (unless redeemed earlier) Early redemption payment: If payable, the early redemption payment will be an amount equal to the sum of (i) the stated principal amount and (ii) the applicable call premium. Trigger value: For each underlier, 70% of its initial underlier value Minimum payment at maturity: None. Investors may lose their entire initial investment in the securities if not automatically redeemed prior to maturity. Interest: None

Key Investment Rationale

The securities are for investors who are willing and able to risk their principal and forgo current income and participation in any appreciation in the value of any underlier in exchange for the potential fixed call premium or maturity date premium and the limited protection against loss that applies only if the securities are not automatically redeemed and if the final underlier value of each underlier is greater than or equal to its trigger value. Investors may lose their entire initial investment in the securities. Any positive return on the securities will be limited to the applicable call premium or maturity date premium, as applicable, and you will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any underlier, which may be significant.

Automatic Early Redemption Scenario If the closing level of each underlier on any determination date (other than the final determination date) is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value, the securities will be automatically redeemed for an amount per security equal to the early redemption payment applicable to that determination date based on a return of at least approximately 14.45% per annum. No further payments will be made on the securities after they have been redeemed. Trigger Feature At maturity, even if the value of each underlier has declined over the term of the securities, investors may receive their stated principal amount, but only if the final underlier value of each underlier is greater than or equal to its trigger value. Upside Scenario at Maturity The securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the final underlier value of each underlier is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value. In this case, at maturity, the securities pay the stated principal amount of $1,000 plus the maturity date premium of $1,000 × at least 43.35%. Par Scenario at Maturity The securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the final underlier value of the worst performing underlier is less than or equal to its initial underlier value but greater than or equal to its trigger value. In this case, at maturity, the securities pay the stated principal amount of $1,000 per security even though the value of the worst performing underlier has declined. Downside Scenario at Maturity The securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the final underlier value of at least one underlier is less than its trigger value. The payment due at maturity will be equal to the stated principal amount times the underlier performance factor of the worst performing underlier. In this case, at maturity, the securities pay less than 70% of the stated principal amount and the percentage loss of the stated principal amount will be equal to the percentage decrease in the final underlier value of the worst performing underlier from its initial underlier value. For example, if the final underlier value of the worst performing underlier is 50% less than its initial underlier value, the securities will pay $500.00 per security, or 50% of the stated principal amount, for a loss of 50% of the stated principal amount. There is no minimum payment at maturity on the securities. Accordingly, investors could lose their entire investment in the securities.

Selected Purchase Considerations

§You do not seek an investment that produces periodic interest or coupon payments or other sources of current income.

Neither the issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the appropriateness of the securities for investment.

Hypothetical Examples

The following tables and examples illustrate the hypothetical payment at maturity or early redemption payment upon an automatic call and hypothetical total return at maturity or upon an automatic call on the securities. The “total return” as used in this document is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results from comparing the payment at maturity or early redemption payment upon an automatic call per $1,000 stated principal amount to $1,000.00. The tables and examples set forth below assume, for each underlier, the following hypothetical values and assume call premiums and a maturity date premium based on a return of approximately 14.45% per annum:

Hypothetical Initial Underlier Values: With respect to each underlier: 100.00 Hypothetical Trigger Values: With respect to each underlier: 70.00, which is 70% of its hypothetical initial underlier value

The hypothetical initial underlier value of 100.00 for each underlier has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and may not represent a likely actual initial underlier value for any underlier. Please see “Nasdaq-100 Index® Overview,” “Russell 2000® Index Overview” and “S&P 500® Index Overview” below for recent actual values of the underliers. The actual initial underlier values, trigger values, call premiums and maturity date premium applicable to the securities will be determined on the pricing date. The table and examples below are based on the worst performing underlier. We make no representation or warranty as to which of the underliers will be the worst performing underlier for the purpose of calculating the payment at maturity. The “worst performing underlier” is the underlier with the lowest underlier performance factor. Each hypothetical payment at maturity or total return set forth below is for illustrative purposes only and may not be the actual payment at maturity or total return applicable to a purchaser of the securities. The numbers appearing in the following table and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The table and examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the securities.

What Is the Total Return on the Securities upon Automatic Call if the Securities Are Automatically Redeemed Prior to Maturity?

The following table and examples illustrate the hypothetical total return on the securities if the securities are automatically redeemed on a determination date (other than the final determination date). The securities will be automatically redeemed if the closing level of each underlier on any determination date (other than the final determination date) is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value for an early redemption payment equal to the stated principal amount plus the call premium applicable to that determination date, as set forth in the table below.

Determination Date Hypothetical Call Premium Early Redemption Payment Total Return on the Securities 1st determination date $1,000 × 14.4500% $1,144.500 14.4500% 2nd determination date $1,000 × 18.0625% $1,180.625 18.0625% 3rd determination date $1,000 × 21.6750% $1,216.750 21.6750% 4th determination date $1,000 × 25.2875% $1,252.875 25.2875% 5th determination date $1,000 × 28.9000% $1,289.000 28.9000% 6th determination date $1,000 × 32.5125% $1,325.125 32.5125% 7th determination date $1,000 × 36.1250% $1,361.250 36.1250% 8th determination date $1,000 × 39.7375% $1,397.375 39.7375% 9th determination date $1,000 × 43.3500% $1,433.500 43.3500%

Example 1: The value of the worst performing underlier increases from its initial underlier value of 100.00 to a closing level of 105.00 on the first determination date, an increase of 5.00%.

Because the closing level of each underlier on the first determination date is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value, the securities are automatically redeemed on the first determination date for an early redemption payment on the related early redemption date of $1,144.500 per $1,000 stated principal, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + call premium applicable to the first determination date

= $1,000 + ($1,000 × 14.4500%)

= $1,000 + $144.500 = $1,144.500

The total return on the securities is 14.4500%, which represents a return of approximately 14.45% per annum.

Example 2: The securities are not automatically redeemed on the first determination date, and the value of the worst performing underlier increases from its initial underlier value of 100.00 to a closing level of 140.00 on the second determination date, an increase of 40.00%.

Because the securities were not redeemed on the first determination date and the closing level of each underlier on the second determination date is greater than or equal to its initial underlier level, the securities are automatically redeemed on the second determination date for an early redemption payment on the related early redemption date of $1,180.625 per $1,000 stated principal, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + call premium applicable to the second determination date

= $1,000 + ($1,000 × 18.0625%)

= $1,000 + $180.625= $1,180.625

The total return on the securities is 18.0625%, which represents a return of approximately 14.45% per annum. Even though the worst performing underlier appreciated by 40.00% from its initial underlier value to its final underlier value in this example, your return is limited to the call premium of 18.0625%.

If Not Redeemed Prior to Maturity, What Is the Total Return on the Securities at Maturity, Assuming a Range of Performances for the Underliers?

The following table and examples illustrate the hypothetical total return on the securities at maturity if the securities are not automatically redeemed.

Final Underlier Value of the Worst Performing Underlier Underlier Appreciation / Depreciation of the Worst Performing Underlier Underlier Performance Factor of the Worst Performing Underlier Payment at Maturity Total Return on the Securities 200.00 100.00% N/A $1,433.50 43.35% 175.00 75.00% N/A $1,433.50 43.35% 150.00 50.00% N/A $1,433.50 43.35% 143.35 43.35% N/A $1,433.50 43.35% 120.00 20.00% N/A $1,433.50 43.35% 110.00 10.00% N/A $1,433.50 43.35% 100.00 0.00% N/A $1,433.50 43.35% 99.99 -0.01% N/A $1,000.00 0.00% 95.00 -5.00% N/A $1,000.00 0.00% 90.00 -10.00% N/A $1,000.00 0.00% 85.00 -15.00% N/A $1,000.00 0.00% 80.00 -20.00% N/A $1,000.00 0.00% 70.00 -30.00% N/A $1,000.00 0.00% 69.99 -30.01% 69.99% $699.90 -30.01% 60.00 -40.00% 60.00% $600.00 -40.00% 50.00 -50.00% 50.00% $500.00 -50.00% 40.00 -60.00% 40.00% $400.00 -60.00% 30.00 -70.00% 30.00% $300.00 -70.00% 20.00 -80.00% 20.00% $200.00 -80.00% 10.00 -90.00% 10.00% $100.00 -90.00% 0.00 -100.00% 0.00% $0.00 -100.00%

Hypothetical Examples of Amount Payable at Maturity

The following examples illustrate how the payment at maturity and total return in different hypothetical scenarios are calculated assuming the securities are not automatically redeemed.

Example 1: The securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the value of the worst performing underlier increases from its initial underlier value of 100.00 to a final underlier value of 175.00, an increase of 75.00%.

Because the final underlier value of each underlier is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value, the investor receives a payment at maturity of $1,433.50 per $1,000 stated principal amount, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + maturity date premium

= $1,000 + ($1,000 × 43.35%)

= $1,000 + $433.50 = $1,433.50

The total return on the securities is 43.35%, which represents a return of approximately 14.45% per annum. Even though the worst performing underlier appreciated by 75.00% from its initial underlier value to its final underlier value in this example, your return is limited to the maturity date premium of 43.35%.

Example 2: The securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the value of the worst performing underlier decreases from its initial underlier value of 100.00 to a final underlier value of 90.00, a decrease of 10.00%.

Because the final underlier value of the worst performing underlier is less than its initial underlier value but greater than or equal to its trigger value, the investor receives a payment at maturity equal to the stated principal amount of $1,000.00 per security.

The total return on the securities is 0.00%.

Example 3: The securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the value of the worst performing underlier decreases from its initial underlier value of 100.00 to a final underlier value of 40.00, a decrease of 60.00%.

Because the final underlier value of the worst performing underlier is less than its trigger value, the payment at maturity is equal to $400.00 per security, calculated as follows:

$1,000 × underlier performance factor of the worst performing underlier

= $1,000 × (final underlier value of the worst performing underlier / initial underlier value of the worst performing underlier)

= $1,000 × (40.00 / 100.00) = $400.00

The total return on the securities is -60.00%. Because the final underlier value of the worst performing underlier is less than its trigger value, you are fully exposed to the decline in the closing level of the worst performing underlier, even though the other underliers may have appreciated or have not declined below their respective trigger values.

Risk Factors

An investment in the securities involves significant risks. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the securities. Investing in the securities is not equivalent to investing directly in any or all of the underliers or the securities composing the underliers. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the securities are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the securities generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the securities unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the securities.

Risks Relating to the Securities Generally

§The securities do not pay interest or guarantee the return of any principal. The terms of the securities differ from those of ordinary debt securities in that the securities do not pay interest or guarantee the return of any of the stated principal amount at maturity. Instead, if the securities have not been automatically redeemed prior to maturity and if the final underlier value of any underlier is less than its trigger value, you will be exposed to the decline in the closing level of the worst performing underlier, as compared to its initial underlier value, on a 1-to-1 basis and you will receive for each security that you hold at maturity an amount in cash equal to the stated principal amount times the underlier performance factor of the worst performing underlier. Under these circumstances, your payment at maturity will be less than 70% of the stated principal amount and could be zero. There is no minimum payment at maturity on the securities.

§The potential return on the securities is limited to the applicable call premium or the maturity date premium, as applicable. Any positive return on your securities will not exceed the applicable call premium or maturity date premium, regardless of any appreciation in the value of any underlier, which may be significant. If, as of any determination date, the worst performing underlier has appreciated since the pricing date by more than the percentage represented by the applicable call premium or the maturity date premium, as applicable, you will receive a lower return on the securities than you would have received if you had invested directly in the worst performing underlier.

§You are exposed to the market risk of each underlier. Your return on the securities is not linked to a basket consisting of each underlier. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each underlier. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to each underlier. Poor performance by any underlier over the term of the securities may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by any positive performance by the other underliers. In addition, if the securities have not been automatically redeemed early and any underlier has declined to below its trigger value as of the final determination date, you will be fully exposed to the decline in the worst performing underlier over the term of the securities on a 1-to-1 basis, even if the other underliers have appreciated or have not declined as much. Under this scenario, the value of any such payment will be less than 70% of the stated principal amount and could be zero. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of each underlier.

§Because the securities are linked to the performance of the worst performing underlier, you are less likely to receive a positive return on your investment, and you are exposed to greater risks of sustaining a significant loss on your investment, than if the securities were linked to just one underlier. The likelihood of receiving a positive return is lower, and the risk that you will suffer a significant loss on your investment is greater, if you invest in the securities as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of just one underlier. With three underliers, it is more likely that at least one underlier will close below its initial underlier value on any determination date or its trigger value on the final determination date than if the securities were linked to only one underlier, and therefore it is less likely that you will receive a positive return and more likely that you will suffer a significant loss on your investment.

§Automatic early redemption risk. The term of your investment in the securities may be limited to as short as approximately one year by the automatic early redemption feature of the securities. If the securities are redeemed prior to maturity, you will receive no further payments and you may be forced to reinvest in a lower interest rate environment. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the securities in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the securities are redeemed prior to the maturity date. In addition, if the securities are automatically redeemed on an earlier determination date, you will receive a lower call premium than if the securities were redeemed on a later determination date or if the securities were held to maturity and the final underlier value of each underlier were greater than or equal to its initial underlier value. Accordingly, you will not receive the highest premium if the securities are automatically redeemed prior to the final determination date.

§Any payment on the securities will be determined based on the closing levels of the underliers on the dates specified. Any payment on the securities will be determined based on the closing levels of the underliers on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the underliers determined at any other time.

§Contingent repayment of principal applies only at maturity or upon any automatic early redemption. You should be willing and able to hold the securities to maturity or any automatic early redemption. If you sell the securities prior to maturity in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell the securities at a loss relative to your initial investment even if the level of each underlier is above its trigger value.

§Investing in the securities is not equivalent to investing in any or all underliers or the securities composing the underliers. Investors in the securities will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the securities composing the underliers.

§The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the securities are uncertain. There is no direct legal authority regarding the proper U.S. federal income tax treatment of the securities, and we do not plan to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). Consequently, significant aspects of the tax treatment of the securities are uncertain, and the IRS or a court might not agree with the treatment of the securities as prepaid forward contracts, as described below under “Additional provisions—Tax considerations.” If the IRS were successful in asserting an alternative treatment for the securities, the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the securities could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, in 2007 the Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on various issues regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. Any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the securities, possibly with retroactive effect. You should review carefully the sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders,” and consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the securities (including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by the 2007 notice), as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

§Credit of issuer. The securities are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the securities, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the securities and, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you might not receive any amount owed to you under the terms of the securities.

§You may lose some or all of your investment if any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the securities or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the securities (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the securities), by acquiring the securities, each holder or beneficial owner of the securities acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this document. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the securities losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the securities or receiving a different security from the securities, which may be worth significantly less than the securities and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the securities. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the securities will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the securities. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this document as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underliers

§Adjustments to the underliers could adversely affect the value of the securities. The sponsor of an underlier may add, delete, substitute or adjust the securities composing that underlier or make other methodological changes to that underlier that could affect its performance. The calculation agent will calculate the value to be used as the closing level of an underlier in the event of certain material changes in or modifications to that underlier. In addition, the sponsor of an underlier may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of that underlier at any time. Under these circumstances, the calculation agent may select a successor index that the calculation agent determines to be comparable to the discontinued underlier or, if no successor index is available, the calculation agent will determine the value to be used as the closing level of that underlier. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the relevant underlier and, consequently, the value of the securities. See “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

§There are risks associated with investments in securities linked to the value of non-U.S. equity securities with respect to the NDX Index. Some of the equity securities composing the NDX Index are issued by non-U.S. companies. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities involve risks associated with the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws.

§The securities are subject to small-capitalization companies risk with respect to the RTY Index. The RTY Index tracks companies that are considered small-capitalization companies. These companies often have greater stock price volatility, lower trading volume and less liquidity than large-capitalization companies, and therefore securities linked to the RTY Index may be more volatile than an investment linked to an index with component stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less stable financially than large-capitalization companies and may depend on a small number of key personnel, making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies are often subject to less analyst coverage and may be in early, and less predictable, periods of their corporate existences. Such companies tend to have smaller revenues, less diverse product lines, smaller shares of their product or service markets, fewer financial resources and less competitive strengths than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.

§Governmental legislative or regulatory actions, such as sanctions, could adversely affect your investment in the securities. Governmental legislative or regulatory actions, including, without limitation, sanctions-related actions by the U.S. or a foreign government, could prohibit or otherwise restrict persons from holding the securities or securities included in any underlier, or engaging in transactions in them, and any such action could adversely affect the value of that underlier. These legislative or regulatory actions could result in restrictions on the securities. You may lose a significant portion or all of your initial investment in the securities if you are forced to divest the securities due to government mandates, especially if such divestment must be made at a time when the value of the securities has declined.

§We may accelerate the securities if a change-in-law event occurs. Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the securities or an underlier or its components, or engaging in transactions in them, the calculation agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the maturity date for a payment determined by the calculation agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the securities if they were not accelerated. However, if the calculation agent elects not to accelerate the securities, the value of, and any amount payable on, the securities could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

§Hedging and trading activity by the issuer and its affiliates could potentially adversely affect the value of the securities. Hedging or trading activities of the issuer’s affiliates and of any other hedging counterparty with respect to the securities could adversely affect the values of the underliers and, as a result, could decrease the amount an investor may receive on the securities at maturity, if any. Any of these hedging or trading activities on or prior to the pricing date could potentially increase the initial underlier values and, as a result, the trigger values, which are the values at or above which the respective underliers must close on the final determination date in order for you to avoid being exposed to the negative performance of the worst performing underlier at maturity. Additionally, such hedging or trading activities during the term of the securities, including on the determination dates, could potentially affect the values of the underliers on the determination dates and, accordingly, whether the securities are automatically redeemed prior to maturity and, if the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity, the payment at maturity, if any.

§We and our affiliates, and any dealer participating in the distribution of the securities, may engage in various activities or make determinations that could materially affect your securities in various ways and create conflicts of interest. We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the securities, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the securities.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the securities, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to an underlier or its components. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the securities. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the securities into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the securities.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the securities, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the securities. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the securities and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the securities instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the securities for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

Furthermore, the selected dealer or its affiliates will have the option to conduct a material portion of the hedging activities for us in connection with the securities. The selected dealer or its affiliates would expect to realize a projected profit from such hedging activities, and this projected profit would be in addition to any selling concession that the selected dealer realizes for the sale of the securities to you. This additional projected profit may create a further incentive for the selected dealer to sell the securities to you.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the calculation agent for the securities. As calculation agent, we will determine any values of the underliers and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the securities. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underliers” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the securities, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the securities.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Securities and the Secondary Market

§The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange, and secondary trading may be limited. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to offer to purchase the securities in the secondary market but are not required to do so and may cease any such market making activities at any time, without notice. Even if a secondary market develops, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the securities easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the securities, the price, if any, at which you may be able to trade your securities is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the securities. In addition, Barclays Capital Inc. or one or more of our other affiliates may at any time hold an unsold portion of the securities (as described on the cover page of this document), which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the securities. The securities are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your securities to maturity.

§The market price of the securities will be influenced by many unpredictable factors. Several factors will influence the value of the securities in the secondary market and the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC may be willing to purchase or sell the securities in the secondary market. Although we expect that generally the values of the underliers on any day will affect the value of the securities more than any other single factor, other factors that may influence the value of the securities include:

othe volatility (frequency and magnitude of changes in value) of each underlier;

owhether the final underlier value of any underlier is expected to be below its trigger value;

ocorrelation (or lack of correlation) of the underliers;

odividend rates on the securities composing the underliers;

ointerest and yield rates in the market;

otime remaining until the securities mature;

osupply and demand for the securities;

ogeopolitical conditions and economic, financial, political, regulatory and judicial events that affect the securities composing the underliers and that may affect the final underlier values; and

oany actual or anticipated changes in our credit ratings or credit spreads.

The values of the underliers may be, and have recently been, volatile, and we can give you no assurance that the volatility will lessen. See “Nasdaq-100 Index® Overview,” “Russell 2000® Index Overview” and “S&P 500® Index Overview” below. You may receive less, and possibly significantly less, than the stated principal amount if you try to sell your securities prior to maturity.

§The estimated value of your securities is expected to be lower than the initial issue price of your securities. The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your securities. The difference between the initial issue price of your securities and the estimated value of the securities is expected as a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the securities, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the securities, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the securities. These other costs will include a fee paid to LFT Securities, LLC, an entity in which an affiliate of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management has an ownership interest, for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.

§The estimated value of your securities might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market. The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated values referenced above might be lower if such estimated values were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

§The estimated value of the securities is based on our internal pricing models, which may prove to be inaccurate and may be different from the pricing models of other financial institutions. The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the securities may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions that may be purchasers or sellers of securities in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your securities may be materially different from the estimated value of the securities determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

§The estimated value of your securities is not a prediction of the prices at which you may sell your securities in the secondary market, if any, and such secondary market prices, if any, will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your securities and may be lower than the estimated value of your securities. The estimated value of the securities will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the securities from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your securities in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the securities. Further, as secondary market prices of your securities take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the securities such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the securities, secondary market prices of your securities will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your securities. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the securities from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your securities, and any sale prior to the maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you.

§The temporary price at which we may initially buy the securities in the secondary market and the value we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may not be indicative of future prices of your securities. Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the pricing date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the securities, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the securities on the pricing date, as well as the secondary market value of the securities, for a temporary period after the initial issue date of the securities. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your securities.

Additional Information about the Securities

Please read this information in conjunction with the terms on the cover page of this document.

Additional provisions: Minimum ticketing size: $1,000 / 1 security Tax considerations:

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion, when read in combination with those sections, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the securities.

Based on current market conditions, in the opinion of our special tax counsel, the securities should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with respect to the underliers. Assuming this treatment is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the securities (including redemption upon an automatic call or at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the securities, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the securities. This gain or loss on your securities should be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if you hold your securities for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of securities at the original issue price. However, the IRS or a court may not respect this treatment, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the securities could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the “constructive ownership” regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the securities, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the securities, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the securities do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the securities with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the securities. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the securities.

In addition, Microsoft has increased its focus on selling its cloud customers Anthropic AI models, which could drive more revenue for both firms.

The company recently informed salespeople in its Azure cloud business that selling Anthropic AI models to Microsoft cloud customers will count toward their sales goals just like Microsoft-made software, two Microsoft employees told The Information.

Because Microsoft has offered the same incentive for sales staff for selling OpenAI products, the new quota system means sales people have as much incentive to sell Anthropic models as ones from its main competitor, the sources said.

As the report noted, Microsoft’s increasing ties to Anthropic follow its decision in September to make an up-to-$5 billion investment in the company. Microsoft has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI, giving it a 27% stake in the startup.

But while Microsoft keeps 80% of sales of OpenAI models to Azure customers, it retains a smaller percentage of its sales of Anthropic’s AI models, a source briefed on the situation told The Information.

OpenAI announced in October that it had transformed its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation, an arrangement that provides Microsoft with a 27% stake — worth roughly $135 billion — in that unit.

“What began as an investment in a research organization has grown into one of the most successful partnerships in our industry,” the ChatGPT maker wrote on its blog at the time.

In other Microsoft news, PYMNTS wrote this week about the company’s new agentic AI capabilities, which it says are designed to help retailers move faster, operate with greater efficiency and engage shoppers with more relevance by enhancing human decision-making.

“The approach focuses on connecting traditionally fragmented functions — merchandising, marketing, store operations and fulfillment — into coordinated workflows that can anticipate needs and act in real time,” the report added.

Microsoft said this shift reflects a wider move within the industry toward intelligence-driven retail operating models created for speed, resilience and scale.

As PYMNTS wrote, it shows how the company is pushing AI “deeper into retail operations, positioning intelligent automation as a unifying layer across the entire retail value chain.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Microsoft-.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 22:59:55.000414

The Paris Stock Exchange moved within a narrow range on Wednesday, ending slightly in negative territory at 8,330.97 points, down by 0.19%. The session unfolded in a typically cautious atmosphere, with no major news to guide the markets and trading volumes particularly low. This lethargy is part of an uncertain start to the year 2026, as investors remain cautious following the end-of-year movements in 2025.

The Paris market lacked clear direction throughout the day. With 21 stocks rising, 17 falling, and 2 stable out of the 40 components of the index, the varied performances illustrate the absence of a dominant trend. Traders favored a cautious approach, awaiting more concrete elements likely to set a course for the markets. This phase of hesitation reflects a climate where sectoral arbitration prevails over a broader dynamic, with investors remaining cautious in mid-January.

Orange and Sanofi boost defensive stocks, while tech stocks fall

Telecom and healthcare sectors managed to stand out in this lackluster session. Orange took the top spot on the leaderboard with a gain of 2.83% at 14.54 euros, closely followed by Sanofi, which rose by 2.55% to 82.55 euros. Air Liquide rounded out this leading trio with an increase of 2.28% to 161.56 euros. These three defensive stocks, known for their stability and dividends, benefited from sector rotation in an uncertain environment. Bouygues (+1.55% to 45.27 euros) and Société Générale (+1.46% to 70.7 euros) were also among the day's top performers.

In contrast, technology and industrial stocks suffered. Schneider Electric dropped 3.12% to 231 euros, recording the largest decline on the Paris market. STMicroelectronics fell by 2.43% to 24.13 euros, hit like the entire semiconductor sector. Aerospace leaders also slid, with Airbus down 2.16% to 215.45 euros and Safran decreasing by 1.72% to 320.2 euros. Accor lost 2.15% to 45.99 euros. These declines in cyclical and technology stocks contrast with the resilience of defensive stocks, reflecting a cautious repositioning of portfolios.

Europe in Sync, Wall Street Searching for Direction

Other European markets experienced a similar climate of indecision this Wednesday. The Paris stock exchange ended the session on a neutral note, perfectly illustrating the sluggish start to the year 2026. Without any immediate catalysts and with skeletal trading volumes, the CAC 40 drifted with sector rotations, as investors favored caution in mid-January. The Paris market remains in a phase of observation, waiting for more tangible elements to regain conviction.

It’s called “surveillance pricing,” when companies set different prices for different customers.
“But to me that’s problematic.” No one really knows how common surveillance pricing is.
In a statement, the retailer said: Because prices can vary by market, customers may occasionally see slight differences as price matches and changes are executed in real time.
All this to say, personalized pricing or not, there’s some kind of algorithmic something happening here.","My husband, John, and I decided to try a little experiment the other day. We’d just finished shopping at a supermarket in Queens and wondered: How much would an Uber cost to get home?

We each typed in our address and on the count of three, confirmed the ride. John’s price was $8.91. I was given $9.96.

“I don’t really use Uber, so maybe it’s trying to get me to use it more?” guessed John.

That’s one theory. But the company said it does not personalize fares. In a statement, Uber said variations in prices reflect things like how many drivers are active and how many customers are requesting similar trips.

In general though, companies now know more than ever about our habits. That’s powerful information — not just for advertising, but to understand how much any given person might pay for something beyond the realities of dynamic pricing. It’s called “surveillance pricing,” when companies set different prices for different customers. After much backlash, Instacart recently ended a pilot that allowed retailers to charge different prices for people living in the same city.

Personalized pricing isn’t new. In fact, it’s been around in some form as long as commerce has.

“People think that personalization is a 21st-century phenomenon due to the internet. It goes back to peddlers and before,” said Joseph Turow, author of “The Voice Catchers: How Marketers Listen In to Exploit Your Emotions, Your Privacy, and Your Wallet.”

Shopkeepers would game out what customers were willing to pay.

“They would actually keep notebooks on the people they spoke to and would write down specific characteristics,” like what kind of clothes you wore or who your friends and family were, said Turow.

The difference is before, a business owner had to guess if a woman’s baby bump was indeed a baby bump. Now, a retailer knows the instant she adds prenatal vitamins to her cart.

“It’s legal to do it, and some economists would say that price differentiation is just part of the way that economics works,” said Turow, adding that a lot of consumers have no idea surveillance pricing is happening. “But to me that’s problematic.”

No one really knows how common surveillance pricing is. But what is clear is that retailers are watching us closely.

“Behavior patterns, their browsing history, their loyalty that they might have, whether it’s through credit card or through points,” said Shikha Jain, a retail partner at the consulting company Simon Kucher. “And so you do see that happening more and more.”

Often retailers are using that information not for surveillance pricing, but surveillance discounting: Here’s a coupon for being a member or 10% off that immersion blender sitting in your cart. It’s why, as a consumer, it’s more difficult than ever to figure out if you’re getting the best price.

“Price discrimination sounds really scary, but effectively it means that it’s good for some consumers and not so good for others,” said Garrett Johnson, a marketing professor at Boston University.

If you want to compare prices, said Johnson, you kind of need to hide.

“So you can open the website in incognito mode, using your mobile phone, you know, maybe even turn off your wifi,” he said.

But are we really going to do this dance every time we buy something as mundane as toothpaste?

I decided to shop for toothpaste at Walmart online, on two different browsers. On one, I signed into my account, which had my information. On the other, I was anonymous, but added my shipping address for an exact location comparison.

I scrolled through the search results and saw a few price discrepancies, including a tube of Colgate toothpaste. On both searches, I was given the same type, same cool mint flavor and same 6.3 oz. size — at different prices. On the page where I was not signed into my account, the tube was $3.74. On the page where I was signed in, it was $3.96.

I reached out to Walmart about their pricing policy. In a statement, the retailer said: Because prices can vary by market, customers may occasionally see slight differences as price matches and changes are executed in real time.

All this to say, personalized pricing or not, there’s some kind of algorithmic something happening here. Turns out, companies know a lot about us. But we don’t know so much about them — or how they decide what we pay.",https://img.apmcdn.org/c636483cda7e13feee83cb261935645de7b2bf43/widescreen/b3dc9c-20260113-a-shopping-cart-with-cereal-coffee-and-tissues-2000.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 19:02:45.269802

The partnership is valued at over ten billion dollars and extends over three years, with implementation scheduled in multiple phases through 2028.
Cerebras withdrew the planned IPO and instead raised 1.1 billion dollars privately, which corresponded to a valuation of 8.1 billion dollars.
The company generated approximately 13 billion dollars in revenue last year, while it signed cloud contracts with Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon totaling approximately 600 billion dollars.
OpenAI is in an early phase of another massive funding round that could value the company at 830 billion dollars before the new investment.","OpenAI has reached a multi-year agreement with chip startup Cerebras Systems that provides for the deployment of 750 megawatts of computing power based on Cerebras systems. The partnership is valued at over ten billion dollars and extends over three years, with implementation scheduled in multiple phases through 2028. This deployment will roll out in multiple stages beginning in 2026.

According to both companies, the agreement marks the world’s largest deployment of high-speed AI inference. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is personally involved as an investor in Cerebras, and the two companies have been holding regular discussions about a possible collaboration since 2017.

Inference is not about training new AI models, but about running existing ones – that is, when users send requests via ChatGPT and these should be answered as quickly and well as possible.

Speed as a Competitive Advantage

Cerebras develops AI processors at wafer scale that, according to the company, generate answers significantly faster than GPU-based systems. The technology integrates massive computing capacity, memory, and bandwidth on a single large-format chip, thereby eliminating bottlenecks in conventional hardware.

For applications such as coding agents or language chats, large language models on Cerebras systems deliver results up to 15 times faster than on comparable GPU platforms. This speed fundamentally transforms the user experience and enables real-time interactions that promote longer engagement times and more productive workflows.

OpenAI faces significant challenges in procuring sufficient computing capacity. The company has more than 900 million weekly users and has repeatedly pointed to a severe shortage of computing resources.

The integration of Cerebras technology is targeted specifically for workloads where low latency is critical. An infrastructure executive at OpenAI explained that the company’s compute strategy aims to optimally align different systems with specific tasks. Negotiations between the two companies began in the fall and led to the signing of a term sheet by Thanksgiving. Generally, they know each other well; since 2017 there have been regular meetings between the two companies.

Financial Dimension and Market Context

According to information from company circles, Cerebras is in discussions about a funding round of one billion dollars that would value the company at 22 billion dollars – nearly a tripling compared to the previous valuation. The startup, founded about ten years ago, has faced challenges in the past:

In preparation for an IPO in 2024, the company disclosed that the majority of its revenue came from a single customer, G42, based in Abu Dhabi. Cerebras withdrew the planned IPO and instead raised 1.1 billion dollars privately, which corresponded to a valuation of 8.1 billion dollars. In the meantime, the company has concluded new agreements with IBM and Meta, thereby diversifying its customer base – now also with OpenAI.

OpenAI is pursuing a broad-based chip strategy to break free from the dominance of individual suppliers. The company is developing a custom chip jointly with Broadcom and has signed an agreement for the use of AMD’s new MI450 chip. Nvidia, the leading provider of AI chips, had reached a preliminary agreement with OpenAI in September for the sale of up to ten gigawatts of chips, which has not yet been finalized. In parallel, Nvidia concluded a 20 billion dollar licensing agreement with inference startup Groq in December. The market for specialized inference chips is gaining momentum as AI companies seek fast and cost-efficient alternatives to conventional GPU systems.

OpenAI’s financial commitments are increasingly raising questions among investors. The company generated approximately 13 billion dollars in revenue last year, while it signed cloud contracts with Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon totaling approximately 600 billion dollars. Sam Altman emphasizes that the company will finance these commitments, staggered over several years, through future revenue growth. OpenAI is in an early phase of another massive funding round that could value the company at 830 billion dollars before the new investment. The financing is intended to prepare for a planned IPO and support the company’s extensive growth plans.",https://www.trendingtopics.eu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 19:02:49.058540

Trump doubled down on his attacks against Powell, arguing that interest rates should be sharply lower and suggesting Dimon’s defense of the Fed was driven by self-interest.
“We should have lower interest rates,” Trump said during remarks Tuesday, adding that Dimon “probably wants higher rates” and suggesting the JPMorgan chief executive benefits from elevated borrowing costs.
Dimon, the head of the nation’s largest bank, had warned earlier that any move that chips away at the Fed’s independence could backfire, raising inflation expectations and ultimately pushing interest rates higher.
“Everyone we know believes in Fed independence,” Dimon told reporters Tuesday.","President Trump lashed out at JPMorgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon on Tuesday, flatly dismissing the Wall Street titan as “wrong” for warning that the Justice Department’s criminal probe of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell threatens the central bank’s independence.

“I think he’s wrong,” Trump said when asked about Dimon’s criticism, defending the Justice Department’s investigation and insisting his administration was not undermining the Federal Reserve, even as the probe has sparked market turmoil and drawn bipartisan backlash.

“I think it’s fine what I’m doing. And we have a bad Fed person,” the president said.

Trump doubled down on his attacks against Powell, arguing that interest rates should be sharply lower and suggesting Dimon’s defense of the Fed was driven by self-interest.

“We should have lower interest rates,” Trump said during remarks Tuesday, adding that Dimon “probably wants higher rates” and suggesting the JPMorgan chief executive benefits from elevated borrowing costs.

Dimon, the head of the nation’s largest bank, had warned earlier that any move that chips away at the Fed’s independence could backfire, raising inflation expectations and ultimately pushing interest rates higher.

“Everyone we know believes in Fed independence,” Dimon told reporters Tuesday.

“Anything that chips away at that is probably not a good idea. In my view, it will have the reverse consequences. It will probably raise inflation expectations and probably increase rates over time.”

Trump also said he would press ahead with plans to name Powell’s replacement within weeks, despite the backlash to the probe from Wall Street executives and Republican lawmakers.

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), who sits on the powerful Senate Banking Committee, has vowed to block any new Federal Reserve nominees until the investigation is resolved.

Other executives echoed Dimon’s concerns, warning that threatening the Fed’s autonomy could rattle bond markets and undermine confidence, with Bank of New York Mellon CEO Robin Vince cautioning that political pressure on the central bank risks pushing interest rates higher rather than lower.

“Independent central banks with the ability to independently set monetary policy in the long-term interests of the nation is a pretty well-established thing that we’ve seen all around the world over a very long period of time,” Vince told reporters Tuesday.

“Let’s not shake the foundation of the bond market ⁠and potentially do something that could cause interest rates to actually get pushed up because somehow there’s ‍lack of confidence in the Fed’s independence.”

Other Wall Street big shots echoed the sentiment.

“The attempt to kill the Fed’s independence by criminal investigation is not good for that institution, and maybe even worse for the Justice Department,” former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein wrote on X.

“Feels like an attempt at murder-suicide.”

The Justice Department investigation centers on Powell’s June testimony to Congress about the Federal Reserve’s $2.5 billion renovation of its Washington headquarters, including whether he misled lawmakers about the project’s scope and cost.

Prosecutors have reviewed Powell’s public statements and internal Fed spending records after Republicans accused him of downplaying luxury features that appeared in earlier planning documents.

Powell has forcefully rejected the allegations, confirming that the Fed was served with grand jury subpoenas and calling the probe “unprecedented.”

He has said the renovation is funded entirely by the central bank, not taxpayers, and warned the investigation threatens the Fed’s ability to set interest rates free from political pressure.

Trump, who nominated Powell during his first term, has defended the probe as a matter of accountability, accusing the Fed chair of incompetence and insisting the investigation has nothing to do with monetary policy.

The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, claims that the defendants used their dominant market positions to discourage healthcare providers, telehealth platforms, and patients from prescribing or accessing compounded GLP-1 therapies. Strive argues that these actions harmed the compounding pharmacy sector, which it views as a legitimate and vital part of the U.S. healthcare system.

The full complaint can be found here: https://www.strivepharmacy.com/antitrustlawsuit

According to the filing, compounding pharmacies play a vital role by providing patient-specific medications when commercially manufactured products are unavailable, unsuitable, or in shortage. Strive argues that limiting access to compounded GLP-1s reduces competition and hinders clinical decision-making between providers and patients.

“For us, this is more than just a business dispute; it’s a fight for the right of every patient to have access to the medicine their doctor prescribes,” said Nate Hill, co-founder and CEO of Strive Compounding Pharmacy, in a statement. Hill added that the lawsuit seeks to protect fair competition and preserve access to customized therapies relied upon by many patients.

Summary

Eli Lilly (LLY) is downgraded to Sell due to overstretched valuation and intensifying competition in the weight-loss drug market.

LLY's heavy reliance on high-margin US sales from Zepbound and Mounjaro exposes it to pricing and market-share risks, especially as competitors cut prices.

The upcoming launch of orforglipron faces challenges from Novo Nordisk's aggressive pricing and first-mover advantage in oral weight-loss treatments.

LLY's valuation metrics are priced to perfection, with a P/E of 48.99 and FCF yield of 0.9%, making downside risk significant if growth falters.

Introduction

A lot has happened since I rated Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) a Hold back in early August, as it appreciated by nearly 42% and reached a $1T market cap, the first in the pharmaceutical industry. With

As a detail-oriented investor with a strong foundation in finance and business writing, I focus on analyzing undervalued and disliked companies or industries that have strong fundamentals and good cash flows. I have a particular interest in sectors such as Oil&Gas and consumer goods. Basically, anything that has been unloved for unjustified reasons that could offer substantial returns. Energy Transfer is one of those companies that I came across when no one wanted to touch it and now I can't resolve myself to sell it. I will always focus more on long-term value investing but I can sometimes lose myself in possible deal arbitrage such as with Microsoft/ Activision Blizzard, Spirit Airlines/Jetblue (that one still hurts), and Nippon/U.S. Steel (perfect exit at $50.19). I tend to shun businesses that I can't understand either high-tech or certain consumer goods such as fashion (give me a Levi's jeans). I don't understand why anyone would invest in cryptocurrencies as well. Through Seeking Alpha, I aim to connect with like-minded investors, share insights, and build a collaborative community of individuals seeking superior returns and informed decision-making, currently on a quest to review every public company.

Potentially joining other high-valued startups like Anthropic and SpaceX to make 2026 a mega year for IPOs. Here with more, our very own Laura Brad. So Laura, uh Sam Altman has said he is 0%, 0% excited about leading a public company. What do you make of that?

Yeah. Um, I think there's some nervousness about what uh OpenAI publicly releasing some of its earnings statements would bring um for the company. But OpenAI needs to raise capital. It needs money. Um it's committed to about 1.4 trillion worth of commitments over the next eight years. And at the same time, its revenue uh reported by The Information and The Times was just about 13 billion. So there's really a gap that it needs to fill. Um and going public could could help sort of like narrow the the gap. In in December, they were in talks for a private funding round um valued at about 750 billion, putting putting the company at a 750 billion valuation. Um and the New York Times report said that OpenAI would be valued at 500 billion, so I'd be curious to see what that valuation ends up coming in at.

Also you had this other story where Apple decides, okay, we're going to go with Google over OpenAI for our AI features. What do you make of that?

Yeah, so, um, you know, with the release of Gemini 3, that really put OpenAI on edge. Sam Altman declared a code red, um, and that made news. Um and so, you know, OpenAI had seemed poised to partner with Apple because they had that partnership. Apple rolled out ChatGPT on iPhones in 2024. Um but then OpenAI appeared to take a swing at Apple by um, you know, merging with the startup of its former chief designer, Johnny Ive, and they're trying to

Sir Johnny Ive. Yes.

Yes, Sir Johnny Ive. Yes. And they're trying to release a consumer hardware device. Um and analysts sort of speculate that that put Apple on edge and pushed them towards going with Google. They also have the benefit of, you know, leveraging Google's infrastructure. Google has TPUs or AI chips. Um they have the cloud. And so, um, you know, OpenAI is really losing out on distribution here. Um you know, it's going to be big for Google to have that brand visibility being on every iPhone in the world.

So plenty of competition. What's what's a win for OpenAI in the year ahead?

Yeah, there there's a lot that OpenAI could win. Um there's a lot of concern in the market about OpenAI succeeding, whether it will succeed or not. Um they really need to find a business model that will work right now. OpenAI is essentially subsidizing users and at some point they're going to need to generate revenue, whether that's, you know, figuring out the ad format that's going to work for them to generate ad revenue or pushing further into the enterprise space. That's really something that Anthropic has gone super heavily into. Um and, you know, they need to release new models that are on the cutting edge that can rival Google and, you know, so as not to get displaced by Google. Um and then the last thing I'll say is that they they really need to secure enough power for their data centers because that's a concern that there's not going to be enough power in the market uh for these data centers and then, you know, that's going to have ripple effects across the entire market because um OpenAI's growth is uh really important for companies like Oracle and CoreWeave. OpenAI has deals across the ecosystem. So it's really important for OpenAI to meet its goals.

All right, Laura, thank you. As always appreciate it.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pxOF2XcbVfKGosENiWPeqw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/45ed3c60-f192-11f0-9d5d-db4ea2bbbdd4,N,,2026-01-14 21:02:07.511853

KEY QUOTES: “OpenAI’s compute strategy is to build a resilient portfolio that matches the right systems to the right workloads.
That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people.” Sachin Katti, OpenAI “We are delighted to partner with OpenAI, bringing the world’s leading AI models to the world’s fastest AI processor.

Multiple reports cited that the deal is valued at over $10 billion.

Cerebras builds purpose-built AI systems to accelerate long-form outputs from AI models. The company’s approach centers on placing large amounts of compute, memory, and bandwidth onto a single, giant chip to reduce the bottlenecks that can slow inference on conventional hardware.

OpenAI said the integration is intended to improve real-time performance across its products by shortening the request-response loop behind complex tasks such as answering difficult questions, generating code, creating images, and running AI agents. The company argues that faster, more natural response times can increase engagement and support higher-value workloads.

According to OpenAI, the Cerebras capacity will be integrated into its inference stack in phases and expanded across workloads over time. The additional compute is expected to come online in multiple tranches through 2028.

The partnership aligns with OpenAI’s broader compute strategy of maintaining a portfolio of systems matched to specific workload needs, with Cerebras positioned as a dedicated option for low-latency inference.

KEY QUOTES:

“OpenAI’s compute strategy is to build a resilient portfolio that matches the right systems to the right workloads. Cerebras adds a dedicated low-latency inference solution to our platform. That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people.”

PR Newswire (US)

PITTSBURGH, Aug. 8 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- A slumping stock market and a sharp drop in interest rates in July caused a decline of 4.4 percentage points in the funded status of a typical U.S. pension plan, according to BNY Mellon Asset Management, which tracks the health of U.S. pension plans through its BNY Mellon Pension Liability Indexes. Despite the severity of the July decline, the typical plan had improved its status by nearly three percentage points during the first seven months of the year. ""Stocks had their worst month in three years, dropping more than three percent,"" according to Peter Austin, executive director of BNY Mellon Pension Services. ""At the same time, long Treasury bond yields declined 22 basis points, significantly increasing the value of pension liabilities."" Assets of a moderate risk pension portfolio decreased 1.5 percent in July, while the value of typical pension liabilities rose 2.9 percent. For the year to date, however, moderate risk assets are up 3.4 percent while typical pension liabilities are up 0.5 percent. Lower interest rates increase liabilities and the value of bonds. Unexpected changes in a plan's demographics, among other factors, also affect the size of the benefit liability.

The arrangement is worth over $10 billion, according to people close to the company.

The deal will help diversify Cerebras away from the United Arab Emirates' G42, which accounted for 87% of revenue in the first half of 2024.

Cerebras has built a large processor that can train and run generative artificial intelligence models. That makes it a challenger to Nvidia , which sells large quantities of its chips to cloud providers such as Amazon and Microsoft — those companies then rent the graphics cards to clients by the hour. Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization in October, as investors sought to capitalize on further AI growth.

In December, Cerebras rival Groq said Nvidia had signed a non-exclusive licensing agreement that would result in some employees moving to Nvidia. Groq's cloud service is not part of the deal, which CNBC reported is worth $20 billion in cash, making it Nvidia's largest transaction to date.

""Cerebras adds a dedicated low-latency inference solution to our platform,"" Sachin Katti, who works on compute infrastructure at OpenAI, wrote in the blog. ""That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people.""

The deal comes months after OpenAI worked with Cerebras to ensure that its gpt-oss open-weight models would work smoothly on Cerebras silicon, alongside chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices .

Cerebras filed for an initial public offering in September 2024, revealing that revenue in the second quarter of that year approached $70 million, up from about $6 million in the second quarter of 2023. The company's net loss swelled to almost $51 million, from $26 million a year earlier.

Investment banks that typically participate in the top technology IPOs were missing from the prospectus, and the company used an auditor other than the so-called Big Four accounting firms.

Cerebras withdrew the paperwork in October, days after announcing a $1.1 billion round of funding that valued it at $8.1 billion. The company said it pulled the prospectus because details were out of date.

""Given that the business has improved in meaningful ways we decided to withdraw so that we can re-file with updated financials, strategy information including our approach to the rapidly changing AI landscape,"" Cerebras' co-founder and CEO Andrew Feldman wrote in a LinkedIn post. A revised filing will provide a better explanation of the business to potential investors, he wrote.

Cerebras' customer list includes Cognition, Hugging Face, IBM and Nasdaq, and in March 2025, the company said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States had approved Cerebras' request to sell shares to G42.

What's the story

Ammobia, a start-up, is significantly improving the production of ammonia, a key ingredient in fertilizers and other industries. The company has tweaked the Haber-Bosch process, which has been used for over a century to produce ammonia. Ammobia's innovation could cut production costs by as much as 40%. The start-up has raised $7.5 million in seed funding from investors including Air Liquide's venture arm ALIAD, Chevron Technology Ventures, Shell Ventures, Chiyoda Corporation, and MOL Switch.

Industrial applications

Ammonia's potential beyond fertilizers

Ammonia is being explored as a possible alternative to hydrogen for decarbonizing various industries. Countries like Japan and South Korea have even drawn up industrial and transportation plans centered around ammonia. ""The big advantage of ammonia is that it's much easier and more cost-effective to transport and store,"" said Karen Baert, co-founder and CEO of Ammobia.

Pollution concerns

Ammonia production's environmental impact

The Haber-Bosch process, while effective, is also a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. It accounts for nearly 2% of the world's total greenhouse gases. The traditional method uses an iron catalyst to combine nitrogen and hydrogen under high heat (500 degree Celsius) and pressure (around 200 bar or 2,900 psi), both typically provided by burning fossil fuels. This makes ammonia production a significant source of pollution globally.

Innovative approach

Ammobia's process: A cleaner alternative

Ammobia's process operates at a much lower temperature and pressure, resulting in less pollution even if fossil fuels are still used. The start-up also claims its method is cheaper as it can use less expensive pumps and equipment due to the lower temperature and pressure requirements. This could give producers an edge since most ammonia producers have only two ways to cut costs: find a cheaper heat source or hydrogen source.

Compatibility with renewable energy

Ammobia's process is compatible with any hydrogen or heat source, including renewables. The start-up says its technology works best when there's excess electricity production to make cheap hydrogen and thus cheap ammonia.

Expansion strategy

Ammobia's commercial-scale unit and future plans

Ammobia's commercial-scale unit will generate 250 tons of ammonia per day, much smaller than the typical Haber-Bosch plant which produces between 1,000 and 3,000 tons per day. The company has been running a small unit for about a year now. The new funding will help build a pilot plant with all features of the commercial model on a smaller scale (about 10 tons per day).

Amy Duong — January 14, 2026 — Lifestyle

The Heinz Dipper fry box is a patent-pending package that integrates a dedicated compartment for ketchup or other condiments into the fries container. The format keeps the sauce separated from the fries until use and removes the need for separate dip cups or packets. Heinz developed the concept as a packaging update to its familiar fry box shape. The design is presented in versions tailored to different condiment preferences, including ketchup and mayonnaise.

Heinz is rolling out the packaging through participating restaurants and sports stadiums across eleven countries. The launch spans select locations in the United States and additional markets, including Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Portugal, the Philippines, Thailand, China, and Kuwait. The release is supported by a global campaign developed with the agency Rethink and is available while supplies last.

TMDX is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strength in Organ Care System (“OCS”) technology. The optimism, led by solid third-quarter 2025 results, is expected to contribute further. However, concerns due to gross margin pressure persist.

This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has gained 22.1% in the last six-month period compared with 11.1% growth of the industry. The S&P 500 has witnessed 14.3% growth in the said time frame.

The renowned organ transplant therapy provider has a market capitalization of $4.6 billion. TransMedics’ earnings yield of 2.01% compares favorably with the industry’s 0.61%. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 79.25%.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Factors Favoring TMDX’s Growth

Robust Pipeline Supporting Growth: TransMedics’ third-quarter update underscored meaningful momentum across its clinical pipeline, with next-generation ENHANCE Heart and DENOVO Lung trials set to begin enrolling and generating initial revenues in fourth-quarter 2025 under conditional IDE approvals. Management expects full FDA clearance by early 2026, positioning these studies to accelerate OCS Heart and Lung adoption as they demonstrate the improved performance of the Gen 2 platform.

Alongside these programs, the company advanced its OCS Kidney initiative, with strong preclinical and product development progress and a formal system reveal slated for early 2026. The upcoming kidney trial is expected to be large in scale and revenue-generating, supporting TransMedics’ entry into the biggest organ transplant category beginning in 2027.

The company also highlighted progress on its Gen 3 OCS platform and continued rollout of the NOP Connect digital ecosystem. Gen 3 development is well underway, with additional technical details expected in the second half of 2026. Meanwhile, early feedback on NOP Connect points to efficiency gains that should become more visible as centers deepen integration through 2026. Together, these pipeline and platform initiatives reinforce TransMedics’ long-term innovation strategy aimed at scaling adoption, expanding its addressable market and strengthening operational leverage.

Strength in OCS Technology Driving Adoption: TransMedics’ OCS revolutionizes organ transplantation by replacing passive cold storage with a dynamic, physiologic approach that perfuses donor organs with warm, oxygenated, nutrient-rich blood. This innovation minimizes ischemic injury, allows real-time organ assessment and significantly increases the viability of organs, especially hearts and lungs, donated after circulatory death, that would otherwise go unused.

As the only FDA-approved, portable platform offering warm perfusion for heart, lung and liver transplants, the OCS standardizes care, reduces post-transplant complications and sets a new clinical benchmark in organ preservation. This positions TransMedics as a leader in the multi-billion-dollar transplant market with limited competition.

Solid Q3 Results: TransMedics exited third-quarter 2025 with better-than-expected results. The solid top and bottom-line performances and the uptick in Transplant Logistics services revenues were encouraging. Strength in both revenue sources was also impressive. The expansion of the operating margin bodes well.

The company is preparing large-scale geographic and operational expansion, first by launching its inaugural international NOP program in Italy during the first half of 2026, supported by up to four regional hubs and eventually building a European logistics network similar to the U.S. model. TMDX has raised its aviation capacity to 22 aircraft and plans to pilot “double-shifting” the fleet to improve asset utilization and margins. Management is also finalizing a new global headquarters and manufacturing campus in Somerville to consolidate operations and support future scaling.

A Factor That Can Offset the Gains for TMDX

Gross Margin Under Pressure: TransMedics’ third-quarter 2025 gross margin came in at roughly 59%, down about 260 basis points sequentially, reflecting typical seasonal transplant softness, lower system utilization and ongoing infrastructure investments that weighed on cost absorption despite healthy year-over-year improvement. Logistics continued to be a major revenue contributor but remained dilutive to blended margins, with volumes also declining sequentially in line with seasonal trends.

Management expects gross margins to hover around the 60% level over the next several years, though short-term fluctuations are likely as international expansion and upfront investments persist. While these pressures should ease as scale improves, the company does not foresee meaningful margin expansion in the near term, leaving the margin profile stable but constrained even alongside strong revenue growth and operating leverage.

Estimate Trend

TransMedics is witnessing a stable estimate revision trend for 2025. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has remained stable at $2.61 per share.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $155.9 million, indicating a 28.2% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.

In 2025, FAN Courier paid 290 million euros in taxes to the Romanian state, according to CEO Adrian Mihai.
Even so, we estimate that the courier market grew by more than 10% compared to 2024,” said Adrian Mihai, CEO and co-founder of FAN Courier.
In 2025, FAN Courier reached nearly 9,500 employees across its entire network, including 300 non-EU workers.
Currently, 2,700 FANbox lockers are operational, with another 400 already purchased and in the process of installation.","FAN Courier ended 2025 with a turnover of RON 1.54 billion (approximately 310 million euros), up around 11 percent compared to the previous year. For 2026, the company forecasts a further increase of about 15 percent in revenues.

However, profitability declined by roughly 40 percent last year, mainly due to rising fuel and salary costs. In 2025, FAN Courier paid 290 million euros in taxes to the Romanian state, according to CEO Adrian Mihai.

Parcel volumes continued to grow steadily, with a 15% increase in 2025 compared to 2024, driven by the rapid expansion of e-commerce, the growth of online stores, and rising consumer interest in online shopping due to convenience, wider product selection, and fast deliveries.

Total investments in 2025 reached approximately €40 million, focused mainly on the locker network, technology and IT, fleet modernization and expansion, and logistics infrastructure development.

Half of the investment budget (around €20 million) was allocated to the expansion of the FANbox locker network, one of the company’s most important strategic projects in recent years.

Around €12 million was invested in the development and digitalization of regional hubs and warehouses, including modernizations in Dumbrăvița (Timiș County), Ineu (Arad County), the Bacău hub, and FAN Courier’s Action headquarters in Bucharest. A further €5.7 million went into fleet development, while more than €2 million was invested in digitalization.

Another major investment project was the installation of a new state-of-the-art sorting system designed to optimize last-mile delivery services and improve operational efficiency. The new Vanderlande system has a sorting capacity of 30,000 parcels per hour and is connected via a dedicated tunnel to the existing infrastructure. The project, developed in two phases, involves a total investment of approximately €14 million.

“2025 was a year of expansion for the courier industry, especially in the B2C and e-commerce segments, despite a difficult economic and political environment marked by tax increases and fiscal uncertainty. Investments by international marketplaces in Romania directly supported market growth by attracting new users and stimulating demand. At the same time, fiscal changes significantly affected consumer behavior, with lower shipment volumes among some local merchants. Even so, we estimate that the courier market grew by more than 10% compared to 2024,” said Adrian Mihai, CEO and co-founder of FAN Courier.

In 2025, FAN Courier reached nearly 9,500 employees across its entire network, including 300 non-EU workers. The company will continue to recruit internationally in 2026 due to the shortage of blue-collar labor on the domestic market, the high productivity and discipline of foreign workers, and the need to better manage peak periods.

Last year, FAN Courier’s courier fleet (pick-up & delivery) grew by 10%, while the linehaul component expanded through both in-house and subcontracted routes.

“For us, 2025 was a good year, and we achieved the main business objectives set at the beginning of the year. The main challenge was cost pressure. Supplier price increases are difficult to fully pass on to customers, so we absorbed a significant part of these costs while remaining competitive through internal process improvements. Although this puts pressure on profitability, it creates opportunities to strengthen customer relationships and continue investing in efficiency, technology, and quality, which are essential for long-term development,” added Neculai Mihai, co-founder of FAN Courier.

One of the most important strategic projects remains the expansion of the FANbox locker network, which accelerated in 2025 due to growing customer demand. The share of deliveries via FANbox doubled year-on-year, and for 2026 the company estimates that 25% of all deliveries will be made through lockers — one of the most visible shifts in customer behavior toward out-of-home delivery solutions.

“Locker delivery has been on an upward trend for several years, which is why expanding the FANbox network remains one of our major projects. Currently, 2,700 FANbox lockers are operational, with another 400 already purchased and in the process of installation. At the same time, we are preparing the acquisition of a new batch of around 1,000 lockers, bringing total investment in this area close to €40 million since the project began. Our goal for 2026 is to exceed 4,000 lockers, with at least 25% of deliveries made through lockers,” said Felix Pătrășcanu, co-founder of FAN Courier.",https://www.thediplomat.ro/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thed_diplomat_ico2.fw_.png,N,,2026-01-14 14:05:30.039186

Fashion has a habit of building legend, and in the modern era, few brands are more revered by menswear fanatics than Double RL, often styled as RRL.

Originally born out of Ralph Lauren’s fascination with westernwear (the line is named after the designer’s expansive Colorado ranch), the offshoot of Lauren’s eponymous brand marked a significant divergence from the traditional tailored prep of the main line when it debuted in 1993.

Whereas classic Ralph Lauren — and subsequently, Polo — stick to clean-cut staples, RRL commits to a rougher frontier aesthetic, with a focus on heritage craft and a notably higher price point. This trifecta is perhaps best encapsulated by the brand’s best-selling selvedge denim, which routinely sells out despite sticker prices as high as $500 a pair.

Offering sportswear in its truest sense — not athleisure, but built-for-life garments, with silhouettes rooted in classic workwear and inspired by (or yanked directly from) the American Southwest — and guided by guru-like fashion figures, RRL has garnered near-mythical status over the past 30-plus years.

While RRL’s success is due in no small part to menswear’s increasing fascination with Americana and a hard-earned reputation for quality among fashion diehards, it’s the brand’s decades-long commitment to a steadfast westernwear aesthetic that’s established it as a cult presence in menswear, and a highly coveted label in the secondhand market, where tattered RRL flannels and officer’s chinos can fetch thousands.

This signature apparel — leather outerwear, hearty twill workshirts, needlecord trousers and ’20s-era three-piece suiting — is regularly showcased in RRL’s seasonal catalogs, which, much like the clothing itself, has become something of a collector’s item. Designed in the spirit of classic mail-order catalogs, the biannual releases blend evocative imagery, old-timey iconography and rugged product layflats to an impressively vintage effect.

The latest RRL catalog, celebrating the Spring 2026 collection, is a particular standout in this coveted lineup. Shot with a tintype-esque grain and presented in stark black and white, the just-released imagery showcases RRL’s latest batch of crispy suede jackets and oversized ten-gallon hats on brooding cowboys who lean on trucks and wander in desert expanses.

While many of the brand’s styles remain consistent season after season — the sturdy Checked Wool Twill Workshirt is a one of RRL’s hallmark offerings — Spring 2026 introduces a number of welcome surprises: the Officer’s Pant, a longtime staple, has been reworked in a slick diamond-print moleskin, while the new Fleece-Paneled Canvas Jacket promises a (potentially stiff) mixed-media outerwear experience like no other.

It’s no coincidence that the RRL Spring 2026 catalog serves as both a genuflection to the robust workwear of the past and a moodboard for any macho man ready to get his Wild West cosplay on. That’s exactly what RRL fanatics demand, and, to their benefit, what the brand has consistently delivered for the past three decades.

BAX recently announced the upcoming U.S. launch of its Dynamo Series smart stretcher, expanding its portfolio of connected care solutions for hospital settings. The new stretcher is designed to support care teams in high-pressure environments while improving patient safety, comfort, and overall workflow efficiency.

The launch highlights Baxter’s continued focus on practical innovation in acute care, particularly in areas like emergency departments and perioperative settings. For investors, the Dynamo Series underscores Baxter’s strategy to strengthen its Care & Connectivity segment through differentiated, technology-enabled products that address real clinical pain points.

Likely Trend of BAX Stock Following the News

Following the announcement, the company's shares traded flat in yesterday’s after-market session. In the last six-month period, shares have lost 31.1% compared with the industry’s 7.2% decline. The S&P 500 has risen 14.4% over the same period.

Over the long run, the Dynamo Series could strengthen BAX’s growth by deepening its presence in high-use hospital settings and reinforcing its value proposition around connected, workflow-enhancing care solutions. By helping hospitals reduce patient transfers, improve safety and ease staff workload, the stretcher increases switching costs. It supports broader adoption of Baxter’s smart bed ecosystem, which can drive recurring demand and longer customer relationships.

BAX currently has a market capitalization of $10.36 billion.

More on the Launch

The Dynamo Series is built to meaningfully improve the day-to-day experience of care teams by reducing unnecessary patient transfers, a common source of physical strain and workflow inefficiency in hospitals. With integrated stirrups and flexible positioning options, clinicians can perform a range of procedures directly in the stretcher, including obstetric and pelvic exams, limiting the need to move patients between equipment. A fully electric design with powered drive and adjustable height, head, and knee positions further simplifies patient handling, while optional wireless connectivity enables select clinical safety and patient data to flow directly into electronic medical records, supporting remote monitoring and more efficient care delivery.

Patient safety is another core focus of the Dynamo Series, particularly around fall prevention, a persistent and costly issue for hospitals. The stretcher incorporates advanced technologies such as Baxter’s SafeView+ system, which projects clear visual cues about safety status, along with a three-mode bed exit alarm that provides real-time alerts and auto-rearm functionality. Optional integration with Baxter’s Voalte Nurse Call and other hospital systems helps ensure faster staff response when risks arise.

Complementing these features, the Dynamo Series offers one of the widest care surfaces in the stretcher category, enhancing stability and comfort across patient sizes, while one-touch positioning, a true chair mode, and built-in USB charging add to patient comfort and independence.

Favorable Industry Prospect for BAX

Per a report by Global Market Insights, the global smart hospital beds market was valued at $523.7 million in 2024. The market is expected to reach from $544.8 million in 2025 to $1 billion in 2034, expanding at a CAGR of 7.3% during the forecast period.

Increasing demand for patient-centered care, integration of IoT and AI technologies and growing hospital automation drive smart hospital bed adoption.

A Recent Development by Baxter

In December 2025, BAX shared real-world data highlighting the benefits of integrating smart infusion pumps with hospital electronic medical records (EMRs). The data, developed in collaboration with the University of Texas Medical Branch, analysed more than one million IV infusions using Baxter’s Spectrum IQ large volume infusion pumps.

The findings showed that EMR integration helped reduce patient safety alerts, shortened infusion programming time and improved clinician productivity at the bedside.

CP25/40 Regulating Cryptoasset Activities Key proposals include: Cryptoasset Trading Platforms (CATPs): Firms operating CATPs in the UK or serving UK consumers must obtain FCA authorisation.
FCA UPDATE TO CRYPTOASSET GATEWAY On 8 January 2026, the FCA released an update regarding the cryptoasset gateway for firms seeking approval under the forthcoming regulatory framework for cryptoasset activities.
The FCA intends to host a series of information sessions for cryptoasset firms that may fall under the new regulatory regime.
These sessions will help firms and their advisors understand the regime, FCA standards and expectations, and the authorisation process.","The close of 2025 underscored the relentless momentum of the digital asset industry, showing no signs of slowing down. In December, the UK government and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) unveiled several draft measures and consultation papers that could significantly shape the future of the sector. Specifically, on 15 December 2025, HM Treasury (HMT) released a revised draft of The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Order 2025, and on 16 December 2025, the FCA published three Consultation Papers on cryptoasset regulation: (1) CP25/40 Regulating Crypto Activities, (2) CP25/41 Regulating Cryptoassets: Admissions & Disclosures and Market Abuse Regime for Cryptoassets, and (3) CP25/42 A Prudential Regime for Cryptoasset Firms. Furthermore, on 8 January 2026, the FCA outlined details of its upcoming ‘gateway’, the application process for firms seeking to conduct newly regulated cryptoasset activities under the UK’s forthcoming regime.

Background

In December 2025, the FCA released three major consultation papers outlining its proposed rules for the UK’s first comprehensive conduct and prudential regimes for cryptoasset activities and markets. These consultations marked a pivotal step in shaping the UK’s approach to digital asset regulation, setting out frameworks for trading platforms, intermediaries, lending and borrowing, staking services, and decentralised finance (DeFi). The move followed HMT’s announcement just a day earlier of plans to bring cryptoassets within the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) regulatory perimeter by 2027. Furthermore, less than a month later, the FCA provided further clarity by unveiling details of its upcoming gateway, the application process for firms seeking authorisation to conduct newly regulated cryptoasset activities under the forthcoming regime. This legislative shift will subject digital asset firms to similar standards as traditional financial institutions, including transparency, consumer protection, and prudential requirements. Together, these initiatives aim to position the UK as a global leader in innovation-friendly yet robust digital asset regulation.

The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Order 2025

In April 2025, HMT published a draft statutory instrument introducing new regulated activities for cryptoassets under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. This initiative aimed to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptoasset markets in the UK. In December 2025 HMT provided further clarity and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Regulations 2025 will come fully into force on 25 October 2027, although certain provisions will commence earlier to allow the FCA to issue directions, guidance, and rules in preparation for implementation.

The regulations establish new regulated activities such as operating a cryptoasset trading platform, issuing qualifying stablecoins, safeguarding cryptoassets, dealing in cryptoassets as principal or agent, arranging deals in cryptoassets, and cryptoasset staking. These activities will require FCA authorisation, subject to relevant exclusions. In addition, the regulations introduce two designated activity regimes: one governing public offers of qualifying cryptoassets and admissions to trading on qualifying cryptoasset platforms, and another addressing market abuse, including insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information, and market manipulation. The framework also sets out disclosure requirements, liability for misleading statements, withdrawal rights for purchasers, and obligations for firms to maintain systems and controls to prevent market abuse.

CP25/40 Regulating Cryptoasset Activities

Key proposals include:

Cryptoasset Trading Platforms (CATPs): Firms operating CATPs in the UK or serving UK consumers must obtain FCA authorisation. CATPs must implement fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory rules for platform access and order execution, with robust systems to prevent market abuse. Retail investors can only trade cryptoassets admitted to trading on authorised CATPs with approved disclosure documents.

Cryptoasset Intermediaries: Firms dealing or arranging deals in qualifying cryptoassets must be authorised and comply with best execution, transparency, and conflict of interest rules. Retail client orders must be executed on UK-authorised venues, ensuring higher consumer safeguards.

Lending and Borrowing (L&B): FCA proposes allowing retail access to regulated cryptoasset lending and borrowing services with enhanced protections, including express prior consent, prohibition on proprietary tokens, mandatory over-collateralisation, and negative balance protection to limit consumer losses.

Staking: Firms arranging cryptoasset staking must provide clear information and obtain express prior consent from retail clients. They must maintain records and comply with operational resilience and prudential requirements.

DeFi approach: Where a controlling person exists, DeFi activities will be subject to the same regulatory requirements as centralised activities, ensuring consistent consumer protection.

CP25/41 Regulating Cryptoassets: Admissions & Disclosures and Market Abuse Regime for CryptoassetS

Admissions & Disclosures (A&D) Regime:

The A&D regime focuses on the public offering and admission to trading qualifying cryptoassets on UK-authorised CATPs. Its primary goal is to improve the quality and accessibility of information available to investors at the point of admission to trading. Under this regime, CATPs must establish and publish clear, risk-based admission criteria to assess whether admitting a cryptoasset would likely harm retail investors which requires conducting due diligence to verify disclosures and ensure that only cryptoassets meeting these standards are admitted. Central to this regime is the requirement for a Qualifying Cryptoasset Disclosure Document (QCDD), which must contain all material information necessary for investors to make informed decisions. These documents, along with any supplementary disclosure documents (SDDs) issued to update material information, must be published on CATP websites and filed with an FCA-owned central repository to ensure transparency and accessibility. The regime also includes provisions for managing conflicts of interest, withdrawal rights for investors if new material information arises, and specific rules for UK-issued qualifying stablecoins, which have a tailored disclosure framework reflecting their unique role in the market.

Market Abuse Regime for Cryptoassets (MARC):

The MARC is designed to prevent and address abusive practices such as insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information, and market manipulation within cryptoasset markets. Recognising the unique features of cryptoassets such as decentralisation, continuous 24/7 trading, and pseudo-anonymity, MARC adapts traditional market abuse principles to this context. It applies to qualifying cryptoassets admitted or seeking admission to trading on CATPs and imposes clear prohibitions on abusive behaviours. Issuers, offerors, and CATPs have responsibilities to disclose inside information promptly and fairly, with allowances for delayed disclosure under strict conditions to protect legitimate interests. CATPs and intermediaries must implement effective systems and controls to detect, prevent, and disrupt market abuse, scaled proportionately to their size and business nature. Large CATPs, defined by revenue thresholds, have additional obligations including on-chain monitoring of blockchain activity and cross-platform information sharing to combat abuse that spans multiple venues. The regime also specifies requirements for maintaining insider lists to track individuals with access to inside information, including wallet addresses where relevant. Furthermore, certain activities, such as coin burning and crypto-stabilisation, are recognised as legitimate market practices and exempt from abuse prohibitions when conducted transparently and for legitimate purposes.

CP25/42 A Prudential Regime for Cryptoasset Firms

The proposed rules in CP25/42 build upon the proposals discussed in CP25/15 and apply to all cryptoasset firms requiring FCA authorisation, covering activities such as operating qualifying cryptoasset trading platforms, staking, arranging deals, and dealing as agent or principal in qualifying cryptoassets.

Cryptoasset firms are required to maintain minimum regulatory capital, known as the Own Funds Requirement (OFR), which is determined as the highest of three components: the Permanent Minimum Requirement (PMR), a fixed amount based on the firm’s activities; the Fixed Overhead Requirement (FOR), equal to one quarter of relevant operating expenses; and the K-factor Requirement (KFR), which addresses operational and exposure risks such as client orders, trading flow, staking, safeguarding, stablecoin issuance, counterparty default, net position risk, and concentration risk. Firms must calculate these based on their scale and activities, applying specific netting and valuation rules. Additionally, they must conduct ongoing overall risk assessments, including business model reviews, capital and liquidity planning, stress testing, recovery planning, and wind-down strategies to prevent material harm. To ensure transparency and market discipline, firms must publicly disclose prudential information at least annually, covering risk management strategies, own funds composition and requirements, threshold levels, group exposures, and, for principal dealers, detailed financial statements and encumbered assets, with disclosures presented clearly and consistently.

FCA UPDATE TO CRYPTOASSET GATEWAY

On 8 January 2026, the FCA released an update regarding the cryptoasset gateway for firms seeking approval under the forthcoming regulatory framework for cryptoasset activities. All firms, including those already registered under anti-money laundering regulations or authorised to provide payment services, will need to obtain FCA authorisation or vary existing FSMA permissions, as there will be no automatic conversion. The gateway is expected to open in September 2026 for a minimum of 28 days and will close at least 28 days before the regime goes live on 25 October 2027. Firms applying within this window will receive priority review, and if decisions are delayed, a saving provision will allow them to continue operating temporarily. Those applying late will enter a transitional regime, permitting only the run-off of existing contracts without taking on new business until full authorisation is granted.

The FCA intends to host a series of information sessions for cryptoasset firms that may fall under the new regulatory regime. These sessions will help firms and their advisors understand the regime, FCA standards and expectations, and the authorisation process. In addition, firms can request a free, optional pre-application meeting through the FCA’s pre-application support service (PASS). These meetings provide an opportunity to present the business model, discuss the authorisation process, and clarify expectations, helping firms prepare high-quality applications and potentially speed up assessments. However, PASS does not guarantee approval, and the FCA does not provide advice during these meetings. Firms are encouraged to seek independent legal or compliance advice when preparing their applications.

TIMING AND Next Steps

The consultation period for CP25/40, CP25/41, and CP25/42 is open for comments and feedback until 12 February 2026, with final rules expected to be issued in policy statements in 2026. In parallel, the FCA has confirmed that its gateway is expected to open in September 2026 for at least 28 days and close no later than 28 days before the new regime, introduced under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 which goes live on 25 October 2027.

""We're essentially having their AI agent, Gemini, partner with our AI agent to create a unified shopping journey,"" he said at the ICR Conference in Orlando.
""Imagine it like a window inside of Gemini where our shopping agent kicks in and helps you complete that purchase.""
With Gemini, Danker said, Walmart is able to link a customer's chat session with their existing Walmart profile and shopping sessions where Gemini wasn't involved.
Danker said Walmart's broad selection, low prices, and fast fulfillment help it appear more frequently in Gemini and ChatGPT's shopping recommendations.","The AI shopping war is heating up, and Walmart is positioning itself to come out on top.

The concept of letting a chatbot buy things on your behalf leapt from the hypothetical realm into reality when ChatGPT rolled out a batch of shopping experiences with major retailers in November.

Then, on Sunday, Google's AI platform Gemini announced its own commerce approach, which it developed in partnership with many of the same retailers, including the world's largest, Walmart.

While both services promise to allow customers to find products and complete transactions in a more conversational and automated way, Walmart's new head of AI, Daniel Danker, said Tuesday that the way Gemini handles transactions is more seamless than ChatGPT does.

""We're essentially having their AI agent, Gemini, partner with our AI agent to create a unified shopping journey,"" he said at the ICR Conference in Orlando. ""Imagine it like a window inside of Gemini where our shopping agent kicks in and helps you complete that purchase.""

Google said its new standards create a common language for different companies' AI agents to interact with.

With Gemini, Danker said, Walmart is able to link a customer's chat session with their existing Walmart profile and shopping sessions where Gemini wasn't involved.

""For the most part, our customers aren't just customers; they're often members. And so, they're getting great delivery fees and a great experience that's really attuned to them,"" he said, referring to the subscription service Walmart+. ""That member experience shows up directly within Gemini.""

Danker said he expects agentic shopping to help Walmart capture more sales from people who didn't set out intending to make a purchase. He said this new approach could enable an almost seamless transaction when a person enlists a chatbot to help solve a problem.

For example, if someone turned to Gemini for tips on how to remove a wine stain from a particular brand of carpet, a cleaning product could be added to their existing shopping cart for delivery in one combined shipment, he said.

Danker said working with both ChatGPT and Gemini sets Walmart up to win in AI.

It appears that chatbot-powered shopping is here to stay, with Morgan Stanley analysts estimating that agentic sales could add $115 billion to US e-commerce spending by 2030.

Danker is betting that Walmart's long-standing reputation for low prices and its growing strength in delivery will give the company a significant edge with customers in AI.

""The most important currency in an agentic shopping world is actually trust and affordability,"" Danker said. ""Without trust and affordability, it's very difficult for customers to hand the wheel to someone else and expect that the right thing will happen.""

Danker said Walmart's broad selection, low prices, and fast fulfillment help it appear more frequently in Gemini and ChatGPT's shopping recommendations.

""That doesn't just serve one need, but serves a whole bunch of needs,"" he said.",https://i.insider.com/6966c44964858d02d2184c18?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2026-01-14 15:02:32.559970

Dive Brief:

Boston Scientific has received Food and Drug Administration approval for a new pulsed field ablation catheter that is indicated for use as an adjunctive device in a type of ablation that is performed when treating persistent atrial fibrillation.

Called Farapoint, the device can deliver linear and focal lesions across complex heart anatomies in a single catheter while preserving surrounding cardiac tissue, the company said in an emailed statement Tuesday. The catheter can be combined with the company’s Faraview software module on the Opal HDx mapping system to enhance visualization of the catheter and lesion formation.

Boston Scientific said clinical data supporting the approval, in cavotricuspid isthmus ablation, demonstrated the device was safe and effective, and showed high effectiveness in preventing atrial flutter recurrence.

Dive Insight:

Boston Scientific’s Farapulse system has remained the leading PFA technology since its introduction in Europe in 2021 and U.S. launch in 2024.

PFA, which delivers energy pulses to the cardiac tissue to disrupt the abnormal electrical signals that cause AFib’s irregular heartbeats, is quickly transforming treatment of the condition, and Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson and Abbott have all rolled out competing systems.

Persistent AFib, which accounts for about 25% of all AFib cases according to Boston Scientific, is a rapid heartbeat that lasts for seven days or more and can lead to complications such as blood clots, stroke and heart failure.

Stifel Research analyst Rick Wise said the arrival of Farapoint, which has also obtained the CE mark in Europe, could help Boston Scientific generate greater revenues per procedure and increase or sustain its overall electrophysiology market share.

The line ablations enabled by the device are also performed in “re-do” AFib procedures, which Stifel estimated make up about 40% of all AFib ablation procedures.

“Farapoint complements Boston's market-leading, larger footprint/single-shot Farawave catheter,” Wise wrote Tuesday in a note.

In a presentation at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference Tuesday, Boston Scientific executives said Farapoint is in a limited market release in Europe and will be scaling up quickly over the course of this year. The company is also studying use of the device in re-do procedures and in ventricular tachycardia in clinical trials.

As AI continues to accelerate the pace of change, one constant remains: Ecolab will continue to spark innovation and deliver integrated solutions to power a cool data center future.","In an industry that moves at the speed of AI, a single year can feel like a decade. Data center growth reached unprecedented scale in 2025, and demand isn’t slowing. Projections indicate the industry will more than double to an estimated $584 billion globally by 2032. This growth has catalyzed conversations around infrastructure and resource use, as utility providers struggle to keep pace with the expanded industry footprint. Part of the complexity lies in cooling, which continues to evolve along with the needs of high-performance computing. S&P Global reports that in the U.S. alone, data centers required 22% more grid power in 2025 than the year prior. Without new breakthrough technologies, this strain will only intensify. Fortunately, as we exit a year of collisions between demand and capability, we’ve entered an era of innovation poised to transform cooling from site to chip.

Last year, Ecolab launched two critical programs to anchor its integrated cooling portfolio for data centers. The wave of innovation started with 3D TRASAR™ Technology for Direct-to-Chip Liquid Cooling, built to protect data center servers by monitoring coolant health indicators in real time. Ecolab® Cooling as a Service (CaaS) followed soon after, a program designed to unlock peak cooling performance by combining on-site support and deep insights across facility and technology loops. With the CaaS program, data center customers received Ecolab’s first smart Coolant Distribution Unit (CDU) with 3D TRASAR Technology integrated directly into the system. Together, these offerings enabled Ecolab to support the entire data center cooling landscape, with insights to drive consistent performance while reducing demand on water and energy resources.

We took 3D TRASAR Technology and other solutions on the road, travelling worldwide to hear directly from our customers and other stakeholders at numerous industry events. Our global tour culminated in a showcase at SC25, the leading global conference for high-performance computing. SC25 offered a unique opportunity for Ecolab to highlight its cooling innovation alongside the latest advancements in AI and quantum computing. In our conversations with tech industry leaders at the event, two key trends emerged:

Site selection will continue to be the dominating conversation as the data center industry expands. Cooling plays a critical role, and operators need to evaluate geographic considerations early to determine the best way to manage available resources.

The rapid acceleration of AI is breaking down decades of siloed innovation and forcing the industry to rethink the connections between thermal, water and power systems. Operators and engineers can no longer look at these systems as independent entities. Instead, they require an integrated strategy to manage resources effectively.

These themes set the stage for 2026, which will be characterized by how the industry adapts to its rapid growth. As AI continues to accelerate the pace of change, one constant remains: Ecolab will continue to spark innovation and deliver integrated solutions to power a cool data center future.",https://www.ecolab.com/-/media/Ecolab/Ecolab-Home/Images/Events/Industry-Conferences/SuperCompute-Floor-Image-2025.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 17:02:01.981129

As a direct result of the acquisition, Air Liquide will nearly double its workforce in South Korea, bringing the total number of employees in the country to approximately 900.
Having operated in South Korea for more than 30 years, Air Liquide already benefits from a solid foundation in the country.
Air Liquide has identified a highly executable investment backlog comprising nearly 20 projects secured under long-term contracts.
He also warmly welcomed the DIG Airgas teams into the Air Liquide Group.","Air Liquide has officially completed the acquisition of DIG Airgas, a major integrated industrial gas provider in South Korea, marking a landmark development in the Group’s long-term global growth strategy. This transaction represents the most significant acquisition for Air Liquide in the past decade, following its transformative purchase of Airgas in the United States ten years ago. With this latest milestone, Air Liquide significantly reinforces its presence in one of Asia’s most advanced and fast-growing industrial markets.

As a direct result of the acquisition, Air Liquide will nearly double its workforce in South Korea, bringing the total number of employees in the country to approximately 900. The combined operations are expected to generate close to €900 million in annual sales, substantially enhancing the Group’s regional scale and market reach. Having operated in South Korea for more than 30 years, Air Liquide already benefits from a solid foundation in the country. The integration of DIG Airgas builds on this legacy, allowing the Group to deepen customer relationships and expand its industrial gas offerings across key sectors of the Korean economy.

The transaction was finalized ahead of the originally planned schedule, underscoring Air Liquide’s strong execution capabilities and experience in managing complex international acquisitions. Completing the deal earlier than expected means the acquisition will begin contributing to the Group’s financial and operational performance sooner, accelerating value creation and strengthening Air Liquide’s footprint across Asia.

DIG Airgas brings to the Group a robust geographical presence across all major industrial basins in South Korea, along with a diversified customer portfolio. When combined with Air Liquide’s advanced technologies, global operational expertise, and innovation-driven solutions, the acquisition creates a powerful and complementary platform for future growth. This alignment of strengths positions the Group to capitalize on South Korea’s dynamic industrial landscape and rising demand for reliable, high-quality industrial gases.

South Korea’s industrial gas market is currently ranked as the fourth largest globally and is projected to double in size by 2035. This growth is driven by the country’s strong economic fundamentals, advanced manufacturing base, and leadership in innovation. The market plays a critical role in supporting high-growth industries such as semiconductors, clean and low-carbon energy, advanced mobility solutions, and biopharmaceuticals—sectors that are central to South Korea’s national development strategy and global competitiveness.

Beyond strategic positioning, the acquisition is expected to generate substantial financial synergies. Air Liquide has identified a highly executable investment backlog comprising nearly 20 projects secured under long-term contracts. These initiatives are projected to deliver more than €50 million in additional EBITDA by 2030. Further growth synergies will be realized through the deployment of Air Liquide’s proprietary technologies and innovative solutions across DIG Airgas’s existing infrastructure. Importantly, the transaction is expected to be net profit accretive within one year following integration.

Commenting on the completion of the deal, François Jackow, Chief Executive Officer of Air Liquide, emphasized the importance of the acquisition and the collaborative role of local stakeholders. He highlighted that the strong support of Korean authorities and Air Liquide’s proven track record in integrating acquisitions enabled the Group to close the transaction ahead of schedule. He also warmly welcomed the DIG Airgas teams into the Air Liquide Group.

According to Jackow, this highly complementary acquisition represents a pivotal moment for Air Liquide in Asia, firmly establishing the Group as a reference industrial gas player in South Korea. By increasing proximity to customers and partners, and by broadening its comprehensive range of solutions across all core business lines, Air Liquide is now better positioned to support customer growth and contribute to South Korea’s strategic ambitions in high-tech manufacturing, healthcare, clean energy, and sustainable mobility over the long term.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-14 12:04:23.446767
ID43,Uber,2026-01-14 15:31:07+00:00,the Guardian,My work went from air-conditioned offices to delivering food on a bike. The culture shock is significant,"Guardian staff, David Rayfield",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/14/gig-economy-food-delivery-bike-accidents-experiences,"When you deliver for companies like Uber Eats, no two shifts are the same.
The big ones were still looming, but the small costs could be covered by delivering for Uber Eats.
After four months, I haven’t talked to anyone at Uber Eats.
On the other hand, if there’s a form of life that’s lower than cyclists in the eyes of cars, it’s Uber Eats bikes.
Uber Eats regularly gamifies their rewards for drivers: from week to week, they offer financial bonuses for set time periods.","At first I didn’t realise I’d been punched. I’m not sure why my brain assumed a bird had flown into me, but I suppose a magpie attack was more likely than a random bloke lashing out at my ribcage, so it took a second to realise what was happening.

I was on my bike, waiting in a sidestreet for traffic to clear. The punch came from behind and by the time my mouth let fly a few expletives, the culprit was leaving. Then he caught wind of my colourful language and turned back to get in my face. He was a skinhead in a bad mood. Accusing me of being in his way, he told me I was lucky he didn’t do more damage. I paused mid-reply. This was the moment I realised he was ready to go to hell tonight, and the only thing he wanted to take with him was me.

When you deliver for companies like Uber Eats, no two shifts are the same. I’d say 80% of my deliveries are fast food – a combination of McDonald’s, KFC, Hungry Jacks and coffee. Lots of coffee. My new workplace couldn’t be more different than the grey blur of an office, surrounded by the same walls and same people week after week. The culture shock of going from comfy chairs and morning teas to trying not to get killed in traffic was significant.

After being made redundant four times in six years, months passed with hundreds of unsuccessful job applications. Bills needed to be paid. The big ones were still looming, but the small costs could be covered by delivering for Uber Eats. My Xbox was gathering dust so I sold it at Cash Converters and put the money towards a half-decent mountain bike.

The first thing that hits you riding is the feeling of independence. In between delivering Grey Goose vodka and KFC Zinger burgers, there’s the realisation that it’s just you out there. After four months, I haven’t talked to anyone at Uber Eats. I signed up on my phone, they sent me a fluoro thermal bag, and off I went. I don’t have to worry about anybody making me redundant because there is no anybody – there’s just me. If I want to spend hours in the park eating lunch, I will. Need more sleep? That’s between me and my doona. Granted, my wages are much lower, but what value can be placed on listening to Wu-Tang Clan with wind in my hair versus dreading another company restructure?

Just to be clear, my hair is secure underneath a helmet. Which was good for when I collided with a car and ended up with a face full of road. There are lots of bike paths in Melbourne, but far too many of them are squeezed in between moving traffic and parked traffic. They’re less than a metre wide and often occupied by wavering cars, massive trucks or in this case, part of a parked Ford Fiesta. Before I could react, a driver had opened their door into the bike lane without looking. I couldn’t do anything except stop my bike dead while my body crashed into the bitumen.

Things like this happen too often. I tore up my knee when my front wheel got caught in a tram track (a uniquely Melbourne problem) and my cheek laid against the road as I watched one of my earpods get crushed underneath a truck. A ute with aftermarket exhausts forced me into a gutter and my shins still haven’t recovered. It didn’t take long before I realised I could never relax on this job. My attention needs to be on 10 different things from one second to the next. My muscles are always tense, my brain always on alert. After a shift, it’s not unusual for my mind and body to immediately crash.

I always knew urban planning was designed around cars but now I feel it in my bones. Not only is the amount of space dedicated to cars immense, society focuses on cars first. Shopfronts and advertisements face the road, hundreds of car parks take up thousands of metres and I avoid countless potholes in bike lanes while the cars right next to me drive on pristine asphalt.

There’s also a stark difference between people in cars and people I deliver to. When I hand over my orders, most are friendly. They’re dealing with hangovers or excited to get their comfort food. I once said “Pizza time!” to some young kids and they cheered. On the other hand, if there’s a form of life that’s lower than cyclists in the eyes of cars, it’s Uber Eats bikes.

Some customers I’ve delivered to have been downright apologetic. I suppose they feel guilty for getting their Maccas order delivered when they live around the corner. No judgment from me; I still get my bonus for doing nine deliveries by 2pm. Uber Eats regularly gamifies their rewards for drivers: from week to week, they offer financial bonuses for set time periods. Let’s say you wake up on Monday and the app promotes an offer to do 30 orders before Thursday. Complete this task, and you’ll get $72 extra. It’s nice but unreliable. They’re random events based on demand and location. It can be a big bonus or a big nothing. Then it simply becomes how much effort you’re willing to put in. Another factor of being independent.

Ultimately, this job isn’t a long-term solution. It’s a Band-Aid on a broken leg. The jury is still out on whether it’s better than being stuck at a desk. Air-conditioning versus sizzling heat. Freedom of movement versus monitored hours. Meetings that could have been an email versus an outdoor activity that is improving my fitness but has a very real chance of causing my untimely death.

London-listed biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has brought in Joris Silon as its new head of IR, in a move effective from 1 March.

Silon, who previously served as the firm’s country president for AstraZeneca US, will replace Andy Barnett, who is taking up another internal position.

AstraZeneca says Silon ‘led and delivered significant growth’ for the company in its largest market, according to a press release announcing the move. He joined AstraZeneca in 2000 and has held various leadership roles in Asia, Europe and the US.

Aradhana Sarin, the company’s CFO, says: ‘I am delighted that such a highly experienced and talented leader as Joris will lead our investor relations team through our next wave of growth.

‘I would also like to thank Andy Barnett for his remarkable leadership of our investor relations team over the past four years and wish him the best of luck as he transitions to an important new role within the company.’

Over in Chesapeake, Virginia, retail chain Dollar Tree has appointed Daniel Delrosario as its new senior vice president of investor relations and treasurer.

In his new role, Delrosario will oversee the IR and treasury functions, including capital markets strategy, liquidity management and engagement with the investment community.

Most recently serving as senior director of investor relations at Enerpac Tool Group, Williams also held similar roles at Invesco, Stephens and Wasatch Global Investors.

Uh and so there there could be more of these episodes where you have uh uh air traffic, you know, uh banned to a certain region for a couple of weeks or months or or or you name it.
In general, though, uh you know, for a while, uh airlines stopped flying to Tel Aviv, etc., for a short time uh a couple of years ago.","The company, speaking of costs, the company is also putting in an order for Dreamliners, its first ever, 30 Boeing Dreamliners. Um, what does this tell you if anything about kind of the company's confidence in the future or where it's going?

It's an interesting item. So, uh, United had placed a very big, uh, order for Dreamliners and it's a great plane. Uh, it's performing well for airlines and and people like to fly in it. Uh, so

uh I think they're they're, uh, you know, they're they're interested in putting the best product out there. Um, and you know, the fact that it's a new model to them, I don't think is particularly meaningful. Uh, if it's the best plane that that you know, for the job.

Um, and when you're looking at um Delta, which obviously you see as a little bit expensive here, um, that said, most of the time it's sort of viewed as one of the best in class within the airlines. So, are there others you like better? Does or, you know, does it kind of it's

it's doing better than the rest and so, um, you know, how how are you kind of contextualizing it?

Right. I guess, uh, the way I view it, so best in class in a rowdy class. Airlines are are not a great business in general. I mean, again, they've been doing well, um, and and largely on the back of this kind of, uh, appetite for for premium travel.

Um, but but you know, if it isn't air traffic control or weather or something, there's there's sort of always something. It's it's an it's not a it's not an easy-going business. It's a tough business. Um, you know, and these billions of dollars of cash flow are very impressive and 10% operating margin. Um, but if you fast forward to sort of a more

slow economy or maybe potentially a recession someday in the next couple of years, uh, and that back half of the cabinet softens up even more, those numbers could shrink really quickly. Small changes in an airline's operations can make big changes to their bottom line.

Um, and Nicholas, I thought it was interesting, um, and again, this is something that could affect other airlines as well. I thought it was interesting the company talking a little bit about international travel and saying that some of the geopolitical tensions could potentially weigh there. How much of a factor, well, in the past, how much of a factor has that been? And and how much of a factor do you think it could be this year?

It well, we uh have been see I covered defense also. So, your geopolitics has been um on the tensions, let's say, have been on the rise for four or five years. Uh and so there there could be more of these episodes where you have uh uh air traffic, you know, uh banned to a certain region for a couple of weeks or months or or or you name it. Um, I wouldn't rule those possibilities out.

In general, though, uh you know, for a while, uh airlines stopped flying to Tel Aviv, etc., for a short time uh a couple of years ago. It doesn't really usually add up to that disastrous a number. Um, and they can work around it usually. Um, but it's it's always in the wings, let's say, as as a potential source of disruption or, you know, something that's going to alter the forecast here and there.

Nicholas, thanks so much. Appreciate it.

The launch campaign transformed Lexus’ tennis sponsorship into a digital experience through the ‘Lexus Rally of the Day,’ which turned real tournament rallies into interactive test drives. Each day’s top rally was converted into a driveable course using ball data—including number of hits, trajectory, and shot speed—mapped onto a digital rendering of the tournament’s main court.

Fans could access the browser-based experience via QR code or link. Using the phone’s gyroscope and 200-degree motion capability, the mobile interface replicated the Lexus yoke steering system. On-screen graphics reflected the RZ’s dashboard display, showing turning angles, speed, and a real-time score for driving precision.

By steering through real tennis rallies using their phones, users were able to simulate Lexus’ steer-by-wire technology and gain a feel for its responsiveness and design.

“At last year’s ASB Classic, we put kinetic art on the court surface in replays of match rallies. That was an interesting way to have a Lexus brand presence within tennis,” said Steve Cochran, Chief Creative Officer at Saatchi & Saatchi NZ.

“But this year, we had the specific task to introduce a new vehicle that happened to have an evolutionary new feature – yoke steering. The word ‘rally,’ holding meaning in both tennis and car worlds, was the idea trigger for us – we turned Lexus New Zealand’s sponsorship into a unique and interactive product demonstration.”

Craig Burton, Manager Sales and Operations, Lexus New Zealand, added, “We’re excited to be bringing New Zealand’s first ever production vehicle with this technology and innovation to the country – and equally excited to provide a unique experience for guests. Bringing these together will offer fans an interactive taste of precision and performance – hallmarks of both world-class tennis and Lexus engineering.”

Spark Foundry New Zealand led the media strategy, partnering with Sky Sport to promote the campaign across stadium, broadcast, OOH, social and digital channels. Audiences are invited through paid media, social posts, and sponsorship placements to visit lexusrally.co.nz, where they can choose a growing selection of rallies from different tennis matches. Each drive generates a precision score that fans can share with friends, while standout performances are highlighted on Lexus’ social platforms throughout the tournament.

Production was headed by PXP Studios, Publicis Groupe’s technology-led innovation unit specialising in intelligent content and digital experiences that blend data and emerging technology.

Neil Duncan, Managing Director of Publicis Production ANZ, added, “To highlight the innovative features of the Lexus RZ, we put the experience into the hands of the audience by taking a mobile-first approach to the production, developing the entire driving experience to run directly in the browser. We crafted a user-focused interface that makes every interaction feel intuitive. By combining this with real-time 3D web rendering and motion-based controls, we delivered an interactive driving experience for users to enjoy wherever they are.”

Summary

Bank of New York Mellon delivered record net income in 2025, driven by digital platform and AI-driven cost efficiencies.

BK's capital-light model enabled robust shareholder returns via buybacks and dividends, while balance sheet growth outpaced long-term debt.

Despite 17% share price appreciation and a P/E of 15, I maintain a Hold rating, as valuation reflects modest, steady growth expectations.

Management guides for 5% revenue growth in 2026, but single-digit EPS growth remains the most likely scenario given BK's scale.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) just released earnings for Q4 and the full year. While the execution was good, the market knows what this stock is worth, and folks get a fair value for positive returns at low risk

I analyze securities based on value investing, an owner's mindset, and a long-term horizon. I don't write sell articles, as those are considered short theses, and I never recommend shorting.I was initially interested in a career in politics, but after reaching a dead-end in 2019 and seeing the financial drain this posed, I choose a path that would make my money work for me and protect me from more setbacks. This brought me to study value investing, in order to grow wealth with risk management in mind.From 2020 to 2022, I worked in a sales role at a law firm. As the top-grossing salesman, I eventually managed a team and contributed to our sales strategy. I spent much of my free time reading books and annual reports, steadily building my vault of knowledge about public companies. This period has since been useful in helping me assess a company's prospects by its sales strategy. I particularly get excited when the product seems to sell itself.From 2022 to 2023, I worked as an investment advisory rep with Fidelity, primarily with 401K planning. My personal study before that allowed me to pass my Series exams two weeks ahead of schedule, and I once again found myself excelling at the job. I learned a few useful things from this more formal setting, but my main frustration was that I was still a value investor, and Fidelity's 401K planning was based on modern portfolio theory. Lacking a way to change positions internally, I chose to walk away after a year.I gave writing for Seeking Alpha a try in November of 2023, and I've been here since. As I spent those years saving aggressively and building up my base of capital, I also actively invest now. My articles are how I share the opportunities that I seek for myself, and my readers are effectively walking this road alongside me.

Europe’s first non-recourse project financing dedicated to electric truck charging stations","In France, road freight transport accounts for 90% of commercial exchanges and represents 7.5% of greenhouse gas emissions. The sector plays a major role in the economy and is identified as a priority lever for decarbonisation(1). At the European Union level, new targets set in 2024 aim to reduce emissions from new heavy trucks by 45% from 2030 and by 90% from 2040 (compared to 2019). Today, the most advanced solution is the development of electric trucks.

Electric trucks: a solution on the right track

Beyond reducing emissions and pollution, electric trucks also offer financial benefits: while an electric truck currently costs more upfront than its diesel counterpart, charging is cheaper than refueling, and maintenance costs are lower(2). With ambitious targets and tight deadlines, manufacturers are ramping up production. As fleets grow, the success of heavy truck electrification now depends on the charging network.

Charging infrastructure: a critical challenge

In France and across Europe, public charging infrastructure requirements have been set for secure truck parking areas and along the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T). The current pace is insufficient to build the necessary public infrastructure for fleet growth(2).

Depot charging is a major strategic priority. In France, out of 600,000 registered trucks, more than one-third operate on short routes (delivery, construction, waste collection…) with a daily return to the depot. Nearly 50% perform regional transport, returning to the depot every day or every other day. Current battery technology allows these trips to be completed on a single charge, followed by recharging upon return to the depot. From an economic standpoint, the goal is to achieve parity with diesel, despite a higher initial purchase cost. While public charging will play a role in the future, depot charging already offers better cost visibility for carriers today. Major players have already widely adopted this model, confirming its relevance. Depot charging will be the backbone of the system, while public hubs will serve as a complement.

Or is it worth buying Kraft Heinz?
The Road Ahead As of early 2026, Kraft Heinz's position can be summarized by several key points: * Stock Performance: Trading significantly below its 52-week peak, with a decline of approximately 16% over the past twelve months.
* Product Pipeline: Conducting worldwide tests of the ""Heinz Dipper"" to bolster its food service business.","The year 2026 marks a pivotal moment for Kraft Heinz as the company embarks on a comprehensive strategic overhaul. Following a challenging period, management is pursuing a dual-track approach focused on operational innovation and a fundamental corporate restructuring to reignite growth.

The most significant development is the planned separation of Kraft Heinz into two distinct, publicly traded entities, slated for the second half of 2026. The move aims to unlock shareholder value by allowing each business to pursue its unique strategy independently.

The two new companies will be:

* North American Grocery Co.

* Global Taste Elevation Co.

This division is designed to separate faster-growing, international segments from the more mature, slower-growing North American grocery business. While the market anticipates leaner operations and sharper strategic focus from the split, investors have also priced in the inherent complexity and execution risks. The associated costs and operational challenges are reflected in the company's current valuation discount.

New Leadership Drives Consumer-Centric Innovation

At the helm of this transformation is new Chief Executive Officer Steve Cahillane, who assumed the role on January 1, 2026. His early focus has been on aligning product development with specific, everyday consumer needs.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Kraft Heinz?

A prime example is the global test launch of the ""Heinz Dipper,"" a french fry container featuring a built-in compartment for ketchup or other sauces. Currently in trial across eleven countries—including the United States, Canada, Germany, and China—the product targets the ""Away from Home"" food service sector. It responds directly to consumer demand for simpler, cleaner on-the-go eating options. Though a seemingly small innovation, the Dipper signals a broader shift toward practical, immediate-value innovations intended to drive volume in the food service channel.

Financial Performance and Market Pressure

Operationally, the company faces near-term earnings pressure. Market analysts project fourth-quarter 2025 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.61, representing an approximate 27% decline compared to the same period last year. For the full fiscal year 2025, the consensus estimate stands at $2.53 per share, a drop of roughly 17%.

This outlook has weighed on the stock. Shares currently trade at $23.51, a level more than 20% below the 52-week high of $30.17. Despite some valuation metrics suggesting the stock appears inexpensive relative to industry peers, the lack of positive earnings momentum remains a persistent headwind.

The Road Ahead

As of early 2026, Kraft Heinz's position can be summarized by several key points:

* Stock Performance: Trading significantly below its 52-week peak, with a decline of approximately 16% over the past twelve months.

* Leadership: Under the guidance of new CEO Steve Cahillane since the start of the year.

* Corporate Strategy: Preparing for a separation into two independent public companies in late 2026.

* Product Pipeline: Conducting worldwide tests of the ""Heinz Dipper"" to bolster its food service business.

* Financials: Anticipated year-over-year decreases in EPS for both Q4 and the full year 2025.

The coming quarters will be critical in determining whether the combination of fresh leadership, targeted product launches, and a major corporate reorganization can translate into measurable profit growth and sustained margin improvement. The answer will ultimately decide if the current valuation gap persists or begins to close.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2431238_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 10:00:09.586052

Ahead of its annual results announcement on 27 February, Pearson said underlying sales were up 4% over the year, with growth picking up to 8% in the fourth quarter from 4% in the third.

The company said it delivered against its 2025 strategic priorities, launching its new AI-powered learning solution integrated into Microsoft 365 called Communication Coach. Ongoing momentum was also experienced in the enterprise side of the business, including a new strategic partnership with IBM and a vocational skilling contract for the construction sector in Saudi Arabia.

Underlying adjusted operating profit rose around 6% to £610m-615m, slightly ahead of the consensus forecast of £606m at the time of the company's last update in October.

However, one notable development was the loss of a key US Student Assessment contract in New Jersey. While the wider Assessments & Qualifications division - the company's largest at just under half of group sales - experienced 8% growth in the fourth quarter, and 4% for the whole year, Pearson said that the contract loss ""will be a headwind in H1 2026"".

""In 2025 we successfully delivered against our financial and strategic priorities by expanding our partnerships, growing our Enterprise reach, and advancing the use of AI to improve learning and upskilling,"" said chief executive Omar Abbosh.

He said: ""In an environment with mounting concern about AI's ability to disrupt Pearson, its latest statement didn't offer the reassurance investors were looking for.

Its order of up to 60 Boeing 787-10 planes reinforces Delta's broader strategy of competing aggressively for premium long-haul travelers — a segment that has made the transatlantic market increasingly lucrative.

The new planes for long-haul routes will add pressure on US rivals American and United, which are also competing for the same international travelers, especially those in premium cabins that generate the most profit for airlines, including Delta.

Delta is hoping for a bigger piece of that pie.

It said the new 787 cabins will feature its signature Delta One business class alongside premium economy and standard coach. United has been particularly aggressive with niche transatlantic routes, while American has rolled out a new business-class product on its Dreamliners.

Delta's new jets won't arrive until the next decade. Until then, Delta will continue flying its aging 767s, which the Dreamliners will eventually replace.

Delta President Glen Hauenstein said in the airline's earnings call on Tuesday that the 787 is a ""financially great airplane"" that offers enhanced cargo capacity, improved fuel efficiency, and ample space for those all-important premium cabins.

Meanwhile, Hauenstein said the airline would grow capacity by 3% this year, with new seat growth concentrated in premium cabins.

Delta didn't disclose how much it was paying for the new planes.

It's the airline's first direct order of the popular jet, which has garnered more than 2,000 global orders. It represents a shift in its long-haul fleet strategy. Delta bought 30 and has options for 30 more.

The 787 will complement Delta's Airbus widebodies

Delta's purchase of Boeing 787s is significant for an airline that has long been dominated by Airbus on the widebody side.

The airline inherited a 787 order through its merger with Northwest Airlines back in 2008, but canceled it in 2016, citing delays, quality issues, and a preference for Airbus.

It opted for Airbus A330neo and A350-900 as its next-generation long-haul workhorses, and it expects to receive the larger A350-1000 later this year.

The addition of the 787‑10 diversifies and further modernizes the fleet. The variant ordered is the largest of the Dreamliner family, seating up to 336 passengers, but has the shortest range at roughly 7,300 miles.

Still, it outpaces the aging Boeing 767s that Hauenstein said the Dreamliner is set to replace, meaning it can carry more passengers more efficiently on both existing and new long-haul routes.

Delta's 767s primarily fly to Europe and South America, where the airline said the 787 would be an ""ideal addition.""

The order is a notable boost in confidence for Boeing, which has faced labor strikes, a change in leadership, and significant quality control issues for years — including on the 787 — but is gradually rebuilding trust from customers, investors, and regulators.

Delta made billions of dollars in 2025

The 787 deal comes alongside Delta's better-than-expected earnings report for the fourth quarter and full-year 2025.

Its net income was about $5 billion, largely driven by continued strong premium and corporate demand, though main‑cabin ticket revenue fell about 7% year-over-year.

The airline previously said the government shutdown shaved roughly $200 million off its pre-tax profit after regulators forced airlines to reduce flying by 10% to alleviate congestion and ensure safety.

Delta's stock slipped after its earnings report, but it has still gained about 6% over the past year.",https://i.insider.com/69669964764ca5f34d2a5df4?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2026-01-14 10:00:04.873392

Meeting GLP-1 demand GLP-1 drugs marked a natural starting point for a direct-to-employer venture because of the highly competitive space they inhabit and a surplus of consumer demand.
But with the advent of direct-to-employer programs, PBMs could be incentivized to adjust their fees to stay competitive, driving down drug prices overall, Wilkins said.
One shift might include basing PBM fees on service delivery rather than drug costs.
Grappling with the unknowns While this direct-to-employer model ostensibly cuts out traditional PBMs, there’s still technically a middleman involved.","Can drugmakers find a way around the pharmacy benefit manager model often blamed for rising drug costs? Some pharma companies are giving it a shot by reaching out directly to large, self-insured employers.

For years, employers have sought to streamline their relationships with drugmakers to lower costs. But until recently, there was no clear path around PBMs, the intermediaries who distribute, formulate and process claims.

These middlemen often charge fees that erode the value of manufacturer rebates, said Drew Wilkins, a managing director at Deloitte, focused on commercial life sciences.

But amid growing political pressure to reduce drug costs and intense demand for GLP-1 drugs, pharma giants Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are this month testing a new direct-to-employer model that would allow self-insured companies to negotiate weight loss treatment prices directly with manufacturers.

The two companies are partnering with Waltz Health, a digital health company with a program that enables companies to purchase drugs at a fixed price. Waltz will administer the program, including patient eligibility, screening pharmacy and prescription-related tasks, as well as offering customer service support.

While these programs are currently limited to GLP-1 medications, Wilkins said they could mark the beginning of a broader shift, with more drugmakers adopting similar approaches and expanding drug offerings.

“We’re going to begin to see other manufacturers and large employers push on this and identify where it makes sense to have these models and how we can start to see them emerge,” he said.

Additional manufacturers could join the market as soon as the end of this year and eventually add more drugs.

“Early Alzheimer’s, other cognitive disorders and diseases like muscle weakening could be interesting candidates for these models, and a way to tap into an eager population trying to think about their overall health and wellbeing in the long run,” Wilkins said.

Other products may be less suited for the model.

“I do not expect that you’ll see it in things like rare diseases or oncology,” Wilkins said.

Meeting GLP-1 demand

GLP-1 drugs marked a natural starting point for a direct-to-employer venture because of the highly competitive space they inhabit and a surplus of consumer demand. A growing body of evidence shows that these drugs confer broader health benefits and potential cost savings over time, which makes them appealing to companies with long-term employees, Wilkins said.

Employees could share in those savings under the new model. Under the traditional model, the patient typically paid a percentage of the list price, not the lower net cost that includes a manufacturer’s rebate.

“So, if the drug is $1,000 and you have a 20% co-pay, you’re paying off that $1,000 even though the net price is probably closer to $500,” Wilkins said. “If we get rid of rebates and move closer to that net price, your co-pay … should be reduced as well.”

The model would also give patients broader access to GLP-1 drugs. Currently, only about 19% of companies with 200-plus employees provide GLP-1 coverage.

Direct-to-employer programs will likely be adopted primarily by mid-size and larger companies, but they could open the door to new drug pricing approaches more broadly. True innovation might not occur at the outset, Wilkins said, but a closer relationship between the manufacturer and the employer could drive change.

“They’ll be able to think about things like, what about a subscription model? What about other types of risk-based contracts, value-based contracts? The data flow will be cleaner, easier and better able to align the incentives,” he said.

But the trajectory will largely depend on how this initial foray plays out.

Read More in Patient

This model could also spur PBM changes. Some PBMs, feeling the pricing pinch, have already moved to secure new GLP-1 rebates and discounts from manufacturers for group health plans that could lower costs for patients.

But with the advent of direct-to-employer programs, PBMs could be incentivized to adjust their fees to stay competitive, driving down drug prices overall, Wilkins said. One shift might include basing PBM fees on service delivery rather than drug costs. It might not cost the PBM more to deliver services for a $10,000-a-year product versus a $100,000-a-year product, he said.

Grappling with the unknowns

While this direct-to-employer model ostensibly cuts out traditional PBMs, there’s still technically a middleman involved. In theory, Waltz and other potential intermediaries could come to resemble PBMs over time. But Wilkins said he hopes the model will bring change, even if it takes time to get there.

“I think if it proves itself and demonstrates that it really is a way to lower costs to self insured employers and patients, while also being accretive to manufacturers, it could really trigger a wider paradigm shift in how we structure the access landscape, how we provide drugs, and how drugs are purchased and provided to patients,” Wilkins said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/1xSmgDafIj5URtpnn1PX5Y8GDdZo2HndmcVqEY16bec/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMTQyODk5OTgxLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-14 08:59:15.134810

How Do Unusual Items Influence Profit?

Importantly, our data indicates that Albertsons Companies' profit was reduced by US$227m, due to unusual items, over the last year. While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining. When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated. And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies. If Albertsons Companies doesn't see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to increase over the coming year.

""Oncology drug development is becoming more complex, more data-rich and more time-sensitive,"" said Gabi Raia, Modella AI's chief commercial officer, adding that joining AstraZeneca would allow it to deploy its tools in global trials and clinical settings.

AstraZeneca said that this was the first acquisition of an AI firm by a big pharmaceutical company.

In an interview at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, AstraZeneca Chief Financial Officer Aradhana Sarin said the acquisition would ""supercharge"" the company's quantitative pathology and biomarker discovery efforts by bringing more data and AI capabilities in-house.

They plan to build a new research lab using Nvidia's latest-generation AI chips.

Modella will accelerate AstraZeneca’s efforts to make pathology more quantitative - using computers to analyze biopsies for relevant proteins and correlate them with clinical data - so AstraZeneca can develop “highly targeted biomarkers and then highly targeted therapeutics,” Sarin said.

The deal is an expansion of a multi-year collaboration that the companies unveiled in July.

Overall, the Apple deal has all but cemented Google’s dominance in a heated AI market, with the news sending Google parent Alphabet's market capitalization north of $4 trillion for the first time on Monday.

Google took OpenAI by surprise in late 2025, as the launch of its Gemini 3 model surpassed rival AI models on industry benchmarks.","OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) solidly led the AI market and seemed poised for a potential deal with Apple (AAPL) in 2025. But Google’s (GOOGL) launch of Gemini 3 and a new deal with the iPhone maker have changed the game.

Google and Apple on Monday revealed a multi-year collaboration in which Google’s Gemini models and cloud technology will power the next generation of Apple's AI, including a long-awaited new version of its voice assistant Siri coming this year. Bloomberg had previously reported that the two tech giants were planning a deal in November, saying the agreement would involve Apple paying Google $1 billion annually, though the companies did not respond to a request to confirm that figure.

Prediction Market powered by

On top of the reported licensing revenue, Google is set to see a boost in cloud revenue from the collaboration, Wall Street analysts told Yahoo Finance. And because Google’s own AI models are now positioned to run on the vast majority of smartphones worldwide — both iPhones and Android devices — the company is effectively disrupting its Search business on its own terms rather than ceding that shift to a competitor like OpenAI. Overall, the Apple deal has all but cemented Google’s dominance in a heated AI market, with the news sending Google parent Alphabet's market capitalization north of $4 trillion for the first time on Monday.

At the same time, analysts said, the news marked a major setback for the ChatGPT developer.

“ It's a huge loss for OpenAI,” said DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria. “ The fact that OpenAI didn't get that deal with Apple sets them back quite a bit.”

Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Andrew Freedman added, “ It's a landmark deal, and it sets the stage for Google to continue to dominate.”

He called it a ""blow"" to OpenAI.

“As Gemini continues to grow in usage and adoption as a general-purpose LLM [large language model], it absolutely presents a risk and makes it harder for OpenAI to continue to take share,” Freedman said.

Google took OpenAI by surprise in late 2025, as the launch of its Gemini 3 model surpassed rival AI models on industry benchmarks. Sam Altman declared a “code red,” and OpenAI quickly unveiled a new model, GPT-5.2, to mixed reviews about how it stacked up to Gemini 3.

Before Google began closing the gap on OpenAI’s lead, Apple inked a partnership with the AI developer to roll out ChatGPT on its iPhones in 2024, marking Apple’s first big agreement with an AI developer as its own artificial intelligence strategy remained murky. Apple reportedly mulled using OpenAI’s tech to power its next-generation voice assistant, Siri.

But analysts speculated that a shift occurred when — in an apparent challenge to Apple — OpenAI merged with the startup of the tech giant’s former chief designer, Jony Ive, to create a yet-to-be-revealed AI consumer hardware device. OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Jony Ive have suggested that their upcoming device could surpass today's consumer devices, frequently hinting at Apple as a benchmark.

“ [OpenAI] picked a fight with Alphabet by launching a browser … They partnered with Jony Ive to pick a fight with Apple,” said BNP Paribas' Nick Jones. “So ... you’re rattling the cage of a lot of huge companies with very strong balance sheets and a lot to lose.”

Meanwhile, Google holds a strategic advantage: Its scale across cloud computing, chip design, and both enterprise and consumer software makes it, in Jones’s words, “the only vertically integrated AI provider"" and an ideal AI partner for other tech giants.

OpenAI’s ChatGPT still holds the lead when compared to Google's Gemini app in terms of usage, though analysts say that lead is rapidly narrowing. Another hurdle the startup must contend with is its mounting costs due to its recent deal spree — OpenAI's spending is set to hit $1.4 trillion over the next eight years — while its revenue is currently a fraction of that amount, totaling around $13 billion in 2025, according to The Information.

As Jones put it, “ Things are getting more difficult for OpenAI.""

They pointed to online speculation about AI models in ads, saying Gen Z doesn't care if the brands use AI models; they just want the truth.","There were two little letters on everyone's lips: AI.

Each year, the National Retail Federation, a leading industry trade group, hosts one of the industry's largest conferences, known as Retail's Big Show. I attended the convention, held in New York City from January 11 to 13, for the first time to hear from industry insiders about the retail trends to watch in 2026.

This year's event drew speakers such as Walmart's incoming CEO John Furner and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who announced a new AI deal this week, as well as Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin. It was clear that artificial intelligence was the big topic on the minds of the attendees from over 5,000 brands at the event.

Walking the expo hall, ""AI"" and ""agentic"" seemed to be mentioned on nearly every other banner or booth I passed. Onstage, retail leaders touted their AI strategies.

Large retailers, such as Walmart and Lowe's, have introduced their own AI shopping agents or partnered with AI platforms like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT; however, these efforts are still in their early stages.

I also saw firsthand how some companies are experimenting with new technologies. There were humanoid robots walking up to greet attendees and digital drive-thru menu boards with bright colors advertising to retailers what their AI-powered menus could look like.

Customer service is the driving force behind a lot of AI efforts

Despite some of the noise surrounding retail's AI-powered direction, CEOs, including Fran Horowitz of Abercrombie & Fitch, said young founders should keep the fundamentals top of mind while embracing innovation. Improving customer service, for instance, remains at the forefront of retailer decision-making.

In one session, Ralph Lauren's chief branding and innovation officer, David Lauren, talked about his brand's longtime partnership with Microsoft. It led to the creation of Ask Ralph, a chatbot-style customer assistant. The bot is powered by Microsoft's AI, but it is designed to function like a styling assistant that suggests clothing based on prompts, such as an occasion you're attending.

It's a taste of the future with the personal touch customers may want from a store associate.

""It's like having Ralph Lauren in your pocket,"" Lauren said at the conference.

Quality takes priority over convenience

Currently, AI is most useful for bargain-hunting and basic customer service, according to a panel about Gen Z that included members of The Z Suite, a collective of consultants specializing in the consumer space. Chatbots like Ask Ralph can be convenient in a pinch, but the shopping experience doesn't begin and end there, the Gen Z consultants who ranged in age from 17 to 24 said.

Young people seem to still crave some of the old-school fundamentals that define retail: quality, customer service, and in-store experiences. There's no replicating trying on the perfect dress in person, one young panelist said.

They said they see AI as a starting point that they can use to find the unique items they covet. They're willing to put in the work to find the right item for them. This includes scouring Reddit for ""real"" reviews that TikTok influencers may not offer, said Olivia Meyer, a buyer who is part of The Z Suite.

And although they're not rushing to get on the phone with a customer service representative, the consultants said they want to talk to a human when their money is at stake.

Consumers want the truth about what they're buying

These Gen Z retail professionals, who also included a global merchant for Calvin Klein and a marketing associate, said they want their clothes to come from authentic brands that are transparent about their use of AI. They pointed to online speculation about AI models in ads, saying Gen Z doesn't care if the brands use AI models; they just want the truth.

They want to get their money's worth for the clothes that they're buying, which is why data shows this demographic is straying away from fast fashion and toward shopping secondhand on sites like Vinted and eBay.

True Religion's chief marketing officer, Kristen D'Arcy, who moderated the panel, said shoppers are craving authenticity in the world of AI-generated content, and it's making them more discerning. To that end, the denim brand has leveraged partnerships that align with its values, such as collaborations with artists like Megan Thee Stallion.

The three-day event gave me a glimpse into the retail landscape of 2026.

Perhaps no data point better encapsulates the American economy right now than this nugget from Delta’s quarterly earnings:

It was the first time ever that Delta’s premium sales eclipsed those from economy.

Put another way: Rich people and the companies they work for and own are doing great, while the masses are tightening their belts — a classic K-shaped economy moment. But Delta’s results also reveal where the company is placing its bets on the 2026 economy. If Delta is right, the good times will keep rolling on for the premium occupants, while the masses crammed into coach can expect more of the same.

Delta, the biggest US carrier by market value, projects a 20% profit increase in 2026, largely on the backs of its “premium” customers — not just the corporate clients who have always been reliable customers for airlines, but also a surge of wealthier travelers who are leveling up their vacations.

That means that as Delta expands its seat capacity by 3% this year through interior upgrades and new aircraft, its focus is squarely on the front of the plane.

“Effectively, none of our growth in seats will be in the main cabin. Virtually all will be in the premium sector,” Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said on a call with news outlets.

Once again, it pays to be rich.

Delta is leaning into its premium offerings, wagering that this shift to more expensive travel isn’t just a fad.

It’s not alone. Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu told the Financial Times that the airline industry was in “a premium arms race,” investing heavily into loyalty programs and higher-end lounges to compete for well-heeled, higher-margin travelers.

That may be good news for the upper-rung folks. For the lower rung, the outlook is more of the same.

And if you haven’t flown economy in a while, well, the same is pretty much the bare minimum flying experience. There’s nothing quite like boarding a commercial jet to render that vague concept of a K-shaped economy into a literal ~experience~ of class division in America.

Sure, you shelled out 500 bucks for a last-minute bachelorette weekend in Cabo, and yeah, you’re stuck in a middle seat with no recline in Row 6,453, but hey, at least you’re getting away. But before you get to your seat, you’ve got to walk by the folks in premium with their leg room and cocktails and designer yoga pants who paid double or even triple what you paid. And worse still, they have to witness you with your sweatpants and duffel bag as you make your way to god knows where in the back.

You and the rest of the peasants — you’re going to get through this. Up front, the view is only getting better.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2244278454.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-14 12:04:39.402209

The US growth equity market grew 2.1x by value in 2025 to $234bn (2024 $109.7bn). The growth was fuelled by AI raises which grew 3.3x yoy and accounted for 57% of total proceeds. Europe, where the AI effect was less marked and the leading sector was software, saw the value of raises grow by 44% in 2025 to $49.2bn.

The US

Our Rothschild & Co Deals Monitor tracks US VC deals valued at $100m or more. We recorded 487 US growth equity deals of $100m or more in 2025 raising a total of $234.1bn. This compared with 309 such deals raising $109.7bn in 2024, growth of $124bn yoy in value or 113%. The summary tables for both years show the raises split by sector with the top three raises by value in each one.

A few features:

Concentration: The top ten deals in 2025 cumulatively raised $106.5bn, 45% of the annual total. The equivalent 2024 figures were $47.6bn and 43%.

AI dominates: There were 84 AI deals in 2025 raising $132.6bn, 57% of the annual total. Three deals provided just over half of this total, the $40bn Open AI raise announced in March, the $15bn raise for Anthropic in November and the $14.3bn raise for Scale AI backed by Meta in June. The dominance of AI was more marked than in 2024 when big AI raises were really just a Q4 phenomenon. In 2024 AI raises totalled $40.8bn, 37% of the annual total with the largest raise being $10bn for Databricks.

AI infusing the growth equity market: There are a number of other sectors which are proxies for AI. These are sectors where the companies are either serving AI (datacentres, quantum, semiconductors) or are applications of AI (autonomous vehicles, robotics, legal tech).

Here we see how AI is broadening its effect across VC as investors look to take advantage of the AI phenomenon more widely through associated industries. Cumulatively those six sectors raised another $13.8bn in 2025 or 6% of the total, taking the total AI percentage of the annual raise to 63%.

Thirty raises of $1bn +: There were 30 raises of $1bn or more in 2025. Of these 17 were for AI businesses including all the top eight raises. Two were for datacentre businesses powering AI and one (Cerebras Technologies) for an AI semiconductor business. The biggest non AI raises were for metaverse business Infinite Reality ($3bn from a mysterious private investor in January); $2.5bn for defence business Anduril, $2.1bn for the insurance brokerage, Acrisure; $2bn for Polymarket and $1bn for Kalshi in the blockchain driven prediction markets; $1bn for the Sam Altman-backed age defying Retro Biosciences; $1bn for Elon Musk’s X; $1bn for PsiQuantum; $1bn for the humanoid robotics business FigureAI and $1bn for grid batteries business, Base Power.

In 2024 there were 14 $1bn+ raises, eight of which were for AI businesses plus one large raise ($9.2bn) for datacentre business, Vantage Data Centres.

Software prominent: 2025 saw 72 raises for software business totalling $14bn (2024 40 raising $8.5bn). Software businesses tend to be asset light, cash generative and frequently profitable, meaning that the amounts they raise are typically smaller than those in AI. The average size of raise was $194m. The three biggest deals were $700m for Savyint, a security, compliance, identity governance and access management solution; $500m for Metropolis (a $1.6bn total raise including a $500m equity element) for its AI powered frictionless parking payment platform and $500m for Nerdio, a business that simplifies the deployment and management of Microsoft cloud technologies.

Biotech and FinTech revivals continue: AI powered drug discovery is a major theme in Biotech. It swapped second position in sector raises in 2024 (77 raises for $12.6bn) for third position in 2025 (69 raises for $12.5bn). The biggest raises were for $1bn for Retro Biosciences which, Sam Altman backed, is looking to develop drugs to extend the human lifespan by ten years; Kailera Therapeutics, which has a programme of obesity drugs, raised $600m and Maplight Therapeutics raised $373m in a Series D for its therapies for central nervous system disorders.

Fintech was the fourth largest category in 2025 with $10.3bn raised across 36 deals (2024 seventh position, $4.3bn raised, 25 deals). The key deal was the $2.1bn raise for Acrisure a financial services platform combining AI across its services in insurance, reinsurance, cybersecurity, real estate, payroll, benefits, and wealth management. The alternative investment platform iCapital raised $820m in July. In April the open banking business Plaid raised $575m in a round valuing the business at $6bn, down from $13.4bn in 2021.

The biggest movers: Three sectors – Defense, Crypto/Blockchain; Quantum

These three sectors saw the biggest relative upwards movement between 2024 and 2025:

Defense – Moving to offense: The sixth largest sector for VC raises in 2025 was Defense, up from tenth slot in 2024. Defense companies raised $7.2bn in 20 $100m+ deals (2024 three deals raised $1.8bn). The outlook for the defence sector changed in mid-February 2025 when US vice president JD Vance announced that, as far as the US was concerned, Europe must take responsibility for its own security, sparking a scramble by European countries to raise their GDP spending on defence and step up their direct support for Ukraine. Simultaneously the US has been redirecting its defence spending into new avenues to reflect the changing nature of warfare, demonstrated by the evolving nature of the conflict in the Ukraine.

The three leading raises in Defense in 2025 were from the same companies and in the same order as the three leading companies in 2024. The biggest in 2025 was the $2.5bn for Anduril Industries (2024 $1.5bn) led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund. Anduril offers a range of autonomous defence systems powered by Lattice, an AI-based operating system that connects autonomous sensemaking and command & control capabilities with modular and scalable hardware components. Products include the Barracuda family of military drones, the Roadrunner reusable vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) Autonomous Air Vehicle (AAV) and the Dive-LD autonomous underwater vehicle.

Saronic raised $600m in 2025 ($175m in 2024). It describes its mission as ‘redefining maritime superiority for the United States and its allies.’ Saronic develops autonomous surface vessels and will use the 2025 funds to build a new shipyard, Port Alpha, allowing it to expand its medium and large-class autonomous vessels - effectively water-borne drones.

CHAOS Industries raised $510m (2024 $145m). It is building Coherent Distributed Networks (CDN™) systems that give ‘warfighters’ time to act against borders and autonomous threats, essentially sensor technology for the military sector including the Vanquish radar to detect missiles, drones and aircraft and the Astria radar to monitor the environment for long periods.

Blockchain/Crypto: Crypto went out of style following the collapse of FTX in November 2022 and was the 28th ranked sector for US raises in 2024 with just two deals of $100m plus raising a total of $325m. The crypto friendly US administration helped spark a revival of interest in 2025. There were 12 deals raising $3bn pushing the sector into eleventh place. Indeed, if combined with the three raises in the blockchain based Prediction Markets businesses (Polymarket and Kalshi raised $3.3bn between them) the sector could be said to have raised $6.3bn, pushing it up to seventh place, just behind defense.

Leading the raises was the $800m round led by Jane Street for the crypto exchange Kraken, a globally scaled and regulated infrastructure stack that spans spot trading, derivatives, equities, tokenized assets, staking and payments. A subsequent $200m strategic investment by Citadel Securities was executed at a $20bn valuation. In October the Stripe and Paradigm backed payments-focused Layer 1 blockchain business Tempo raised $500m in a Series A led by Greenoaks and Thrive Capital. The crypto payments business Ripple raised $500m at a valuation of $40bn in November. The business has expanded from payments into custody, stablecoins, prime brokerage and corporate treasury.

Quantum: AI enables machines to learn, make decisions, and recognize patterns. Quantum computing aims to process information in distinct ways that classical computers cannot, making problem-solving faster and more accurate. Quantum can potentially speed up the training of AI models, optimise their functionality, perform better processing of large datasets, tackle complex problems in areas like drug discovery and materials science and improve natural language processing.

As interest in AI has grown, so has the engagement with quantum. There were five deals in quantum in 2025 raising $2.13bn, up from just one deal at $300m in 2024. PsiQuantum’s $1bn Series E in September led by BlackRock was one of the largest financings ever in quantum computing and valued the company at $7bn. Professor Jeremy O’Brien, PsiQuantum co-founder and CEO commented

‘Only building the real thing—million-qubit-scale, fault-tolerant machines—will unlock the promise of quantum computing.”

US Growth Equity raises in 2025 – 487 deals of $100m+ raising $234bn

A few features:

Smaller: The $49bn raised is just 21% of the total $234bn raised in the US. The yoy uplift was also more modest at 44% versus the 113% in the US.

Less concentrated: The leading US sector, AI, accounted for 57% of all raises in the US in 2025. In Europe the top six sectors combined reach the 57% figure.

AI is prominent, not dominant: AI was the second largest sector by funds raised in 2025 with $5.3bn (2024 $2.8bn) raised across 35 (2024 17) deals, equivalent to 11% of funds raised in the year. It supplied the biggest raise of the year, the $2bn Series C for French LLM, Mistral but only one more in the top 10, the $600m raise for AI drug design business, Isomorphic Labs.

Broader AI impacts: Looking at the proxy sectors for AI (datacentres, quantum, semiconductors, autonomous vehicles, robotics, legal tech) the influence of AI becomes more marked with these sectors adding another $6.1bn or 12% to the annual total.

Software leads the way: The Software sector rose to be the largest sector by value of raises in 2025 overtaking Climate Tech. There were 113 rounds raising $7.5bn (2024 100 deals raising $5.6bn), growth in value of 25% yoy.

The three biggest deals all came late in the year led by October’s $710m ($270m primary, $440m secondary) round for Bending Spoons at an $11bn valuation. Bending Spoons is a serial acquiror of digital businesses owning Brightcove, Evernote, komoot, Meetup, Remini, StreamYard, and WeTransfer, and with the October round helping to fund the acquisitions of Vimeo and AOL. The French CRM (customer relationship management) company Brevo raised $575m in December. Lovable, the Swedish vibe coding business raised $20m in its July Series A at a $1.8bn valuation and followed this up with a $330m raise at a $6.6bn valuation in December. The business was founded in July 2023, reported $1m in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in November 2024 and $200m of ARR in November 2025.

Climate Tech slipped into fourth place by sector value in 2025 with 68 raises bringing in $4.9bn (2024 $6.5bn across 83 raises). We have noticed since the demise of Northvolt that the ambitious funding programmes for long term projects in this field have died away. In 2023 European Climate Tech had two deals of over $1bn (H2 Green Steel, Northvolt) and another three of more than $500m (Verkor, Zenobe and Northvolt again). In 2024 there were just two deals of more than $500m (Sunfire $550m, RP Global $528m). In 2025 there were none with the largest deal in the sector being the $420m for green flexibility in Germany in January.

Biotech was again well represented: There were 66 deals in 2025 raising a fraction under $5bn with the largest being the $410m Series A by Verdiva Bio which is focused on developing a weekly (as opposed to daily) dosed oral GLP-1 focused obesity treatment. Next in line was the $358m raise by German cancer treatment biotech, Tubulis. The sector saw good growth with the value of deals rising by 29% versus the $3.87bn of 2024.

It was a strong year for healthcare as well with the value of raises rising by $1.65bn (+87%) yoy boosted by the $900m raise for smart rings business Oura in October valuing the business at $11bn. Oura had previously raised $200m at a $5.2bn valuation in December 2024. There was also a substantial $260m raise for Daniel Ek backed healthcare scanning centre business Neko Health as it built out its network of scanning centres.

Fintech and the return of crypto: Fintech has been staging a solid recovery since H2 2024. It is represented in the top 10 European raises of the year by the $500m round from the Israeli global payments’ platform Rapyd in March to fund its acquisition of Dutch fintech PayU from Prosus. In total 2025 saw 58 raises by Fintechs for a total of $4bn (2024 55 deals for $3.6bn).

As in the US, there has been a marked revival in blockchain/crypto deals, with 12 European deals in 2025 raising $659m led by the $136m Series C from Fnality, which is a global settlement network employing distributed ledger technology to connect wholesale markets with tokenised and decentralized markets. In 2024 there were just five deals raising a total of $195m.

The biggest movers: Four sectors – Cybersecurity, Datacentres, Defence, Quantum

Cybersecurity moved up from 15th to 7th in the sector rankings between 2024 and 2025 with the value of raises up 5.4x from $469m to $2.57bn. Of the 36 raises in the sector, 24 were from businesses based in Israel which has become the European centre of excellence for this industry. These included the three biggest raises, the $400m for the AI and data security business Cyera at a valuation of $9bn; the $359m Series G raise by Cato Networks and the $120m raise for Vega.

Datacentres are key to AI development. Datacentres are the real estate of AI in terms of availability of GPUs and land and energy access to drive them. European businesses raised $2.1bn in 2025 up from just $155m in 2024, jumping to eighth position in terms of sector value. Over three quarters of the total came from just two deals, reflecting the scale of the capex in this sector.

The UK’s Nscale described its $1.1bn October raise as the largest Series B in European history. The hyperscaler will use the proceeds to further its deployment of large-scale AI infrastructure across Europe, North America and the Middle East, enabling the rapid rollout of the company’s “AI factory” data centres for projects like Stargate UK and Stargate Norway, and the expansion of its vertically integrated AI cloud platform. The Norwegian energy and industrial group Aker led the round with $285m of funding and payment in kind. The latter consisted of a portion of its Narvik land portfolio in northern Norway. In exchange Aker will receive a 9.3% stake in Nscale whose implied valuation was c$3bn. Swedish datacentre business EcoDataCenter raised $521m in equity in March and followed this with $700m in debt financing in September. The business has teamed with Coreweave to build one of Europe's largest AI clusters in Falun, Sweden.

Quantum Computing – the next leg of AI: There has been a flurry of raises on both sides of the Atlantic for quantum computing businesses reflecting the view that quantum computing is the next key stage in the development of AI. Europe, traditionally the poor relation to the US in quantum computing funding, saw 14 deals in 2025 with five at over $100m (IQM Quantum - $320m, Multiverse Computing $215m, Quantum Machines $170m, Classiq $110m and Alice & Bob $105m). Quantum leaped from 20th to 10th in the sector rankings with a $1.2bn or 6.7x increase in yoy funding to $1.38bn.

Defence scaling up: As in the US, interest in VC funding of emerging defence business quickened as the year went on. The experience of the Ukraine war has shifted the focus of incremental defence spending from traditional military platforms (tanks, warships, planes) to new technologies like AI, robotics, autonomous solutions, quantum computing and cybersecurity.

Our Deal Monitor records twelve defence deals, led by the $690m Helsing Series D in June valuing the business at $13.8bn. Helsing designs AI applications focusing on all-domain defence spanning air, land, sea, space, and cyber using AI software to process information from defence systems and improve battlefield decisions. It also had the largest defence raise in 2024, its $487m Series C valuing the business at $5.4bn.

May 2025 saw a $176m round for the German Quantum Systems, an ‘aerial data intelligence company that provides multi-sensor data collection products to government agencies and commercial customers.' It is a dual use business with commercial as well as defence applications with government contracts in the US, the Ukraine, Germany, Spain, Australia, and Colombia. This was followed by an additional $180m round led by Balderton Capital in November, lifting the company’s valuation above €3bn. At the end of the year the Finnish satellite developer Iceye which has adapted its satellite monitoring fleet for defence use, raised $233m at a $2.8bn valuation.

The ‘missing’ sector- Online grocery: Online grocery businesses raised $1.1bn in 2024 with Getir, Rohik, Flink and Picnic all making $100m plus raises. Europe has fallen out of love with the instant grocery delivery model meaning in 2025 there was just one raise in this space, albeit a substantial one, the $495m raise by Dutch business Picnic. In an associated sector there was a clutch of ride hailing and e-mobility raises from the likes of FINN, Voi and Blacklane in 2024. There were none in 2025.

Europe’s biggest growth equity raises in 2025.

Our predictions for growth equity in 2025 – how did we do?

In the January 2025 edition of the R&Co Growth Equity Update we made ten predictions for the coming year. We review here how we did. Marking our own homework, gives a score of 7.5 out of 10….

We made ten predictions. We show each in italics and our assessment of the current state of play and of our prediction beneath each one.

1. Artificial Intelligence to dominate and widen: A two-tier market has emerged in venture capital. It’s AI, and then everything else. AI captured around a third of all new VC funding in 2024. The pace quickened with Q4 being the largest quarter by some distance for funding of big AI deals. These deals, and the rapid valuation uplifts between rounds, have only stoked the appetite of investors for exposure to the potential industry transformations that the application of AI offers. We expect that the net will widen in 2025 and that a broader range of investors will seek to gain exposure to AI amongst application specific businesses.

Not bad as a prediction and less obvious than it seemed at the time. It was only in Q4 2024 that the start of the surge in growth funding for AI businesses began. In 2024 our revised numbers show that 37% of US venture funding was for AI businesses, a total of $40.8bn. In 2025 the percentage rose to 57% and the total to $133.3bn

2. Datacentres: ‘Data is the new oil’: Or should that be datacentres? It seems that, despite a slew of large fund raises for data centre operators in 2024 (Vantage Data Centres $9.2bn; Coreweave $1.1bn; Crusoe Energy $500m, Lightmatter $400m) there appears plenty of potential for more. Analysts at Mogan Stanley anticipate there will be 70% pa growth in GenAI related power demand 2024-27 growing from <15 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2023 to 224 TWh in 2027.

Here we were looking in the right ballpark, but the theme expressed itself largely away from the growth equity market. Indeed, one of the Stock Market’s biggest themes in 2025 was the burgeoning AI capex requirement faced by the hitherto capital light tech companies. The amount of capital deployed in data centre development via growth equity raises shrank in 2025 versus 2024. The 2024 total of $10.8bn was boosted by the $9.2bn raise for Vantage Data Centres late in the year. The equivalent figure in 2025 was $5.2bn with Crusoe Energy leading the way with a $1.4bn raise.

3. A revival in Fintech: 2024 was another tough year with a 20% yoy drop in global Fintech funding estimated by Innovate Capital. A report from Silicon Valley Bank in late October observed that fundraising by Fintech oriented VC firms has dropped by over 90% since its peak in 2021. We think though that 2025 is set to see a revival in VC funding for FinTech.

The revival of fintech did occur in 2025 with the 25 rounds raising $4.3bn in the US in 2024 expanding to 36 raises reaching $10.3bn in 2025, a 2.4x increase. There was substantial activity also in the secondary market for fintech, including big secondaries from Stripe and Revolut as well as some high profile fintech IPOs.

4. ClimateTech - less hot: An unusual feature of the European VC market in the last couple of years was that, even as investors became more cautious about pre-revenue/profit/cash flow businesses in the wake of the change to the interest rate environment, there was still a surprising amount of support for ClimateTech companies which were pre-revenue and certainly pre-profit and which required heavy capital investment to build projects like battery gigafactories or networks of EV charging station stations. As the world gets warmer some of the urgency in pursuing such climate led opportunities appears to have dissipated, the outlook for electric vehicle sales has waned (fewer incentives, lower prices for used EVs, rapid charging infrastructure issues) and the incoming Trump administration (‘Drill, baby, drill’) appears less likely to promote climate initiatives. The Chapter 11 filing by Northvolt, which had received $14-15bn of venture funding, is also a jolt to the system. We think a scaling back of ambition in ClimateTech raises may be a feature of 2025.

A decent prediction. In Europe raises in Climate Tech declined in value from c$6.5bn in 2024 to $4.9bn in 2025. The very substantial raises that typified 2021-23 remained absent but there was a steady stream of $100m plus deals – 16 in total in 2025- led by the $420m raised for green flexibility, the $330m for Skynrg and $172m for Aira.

In the US Climate Tech had a stronger year with the amount raised up from $5.2bn in 2024 to $9.8bn in 2025. The bigger deals though are AI and datacentre related raises in the guise of Climate Tech. Thus, two of the three biggest deals classed as Climate Tech were for fusion and nuclear energy developers, with these technologies seen as key to providing power sources for new AI datacentre demand.

Fusion energy as a solution to the world’s energy needs is a technology under intense development and Commonwealth Fusion System’s $863m raise was the largest of its kind this year. Ally Yost its Senior Vice President of Corporate Development referenced how the interest in powering AI datacentres has quickened investor interest in new energy tech like fusion power.

‘CFS offers investors the clearest path to bringing commercial fusion to the world — and an unprecedented opportunity to make a real impact as global demand for power accelerates with electrification and increased use of AI and data centres.’

Similarly, the third largest raise in Climate Tech was the $700m round for small modular nuclear reactor business X Energy. Amazon supported this raise. Its Vice President of Global Data Centres Kevin Miller was the one to explain the investment.

“This collaboration between Amazon and X-energy is a significant step toward accelerating advanced nuclear technologies that can help us bring new sources of carbon-free energy to the grid cost-effectively and safely.”

5. Venture capital activity to grow again in 2025: After two years of decline from the heady peaks of 2021 global VC activity grew in 2024 over 2023. Pitchbook estimates that global funding for VC firms increased, albeit by just 5%, from $349bn in 2023 to $368bn in 2024. We think that VC deal value will rise again in 2025 for four reasons (i) there is intense interest in artificial intelligence and associated technologies, and we think these areas will continue to attract substantial funding in 2025 (ii) the public markets have had two years of 20%+ returns. This is positive for investor mood - critical for VC investing (iii) The quality of companies is better. After three years of adapting operating practices to accommodate growth with profits /cashflow rather than all out growth, the universe of VC companies is more investable while valuation expectations are tempered – a better environment for VC investing (iv) if –as we expect – the IPO market improves in 2025- the liquidity of the whole private capital system will improve in turn.

We got this one right, and it was a tougher prediction than it looked with the AI surge in the last three months of 2024 only just taking the 2024 total past 2023. We underestimated the extent to which 2025 would exceed 2024. At $234bn vs $109.7bn the US growth equity market grew 2.1x in 2025. In Europe, where the AI effect was less marked, growth was 44% to $49.2bn.

Europe – Value of growth equity raises up 44% in 2025

We also discussed,

How will the end of 2025 look? US interest rates may be only 30bps lower than the levels of the start of the year as inflation remains stubbornly high. There may be some shocks to global trade caused by the imposition of tariffs by the US and retaliatory activity elsewhere. Global GDP growth remains relatively weak (US GDP growth is forecast by the OECD at 2.4% in 2025, down from 2.8% in 2024 with a further slowdown to 2.1% for 2026). Public investors may have made some good money on reasonably priced IPOs. Venture Capital companies will be three years into the focus on profits and growth, more and more will be turning the corner to demonstrate that profitability is there and looking for funding for renewed growth.

US interest rates fell further than expected in 2025, starting the year at 4.25%-4.5% and ending the year down 75bps at 3.5%-3.75%. The Fed’s December 2024 dot plot had just 50bps of rate cuts in 2025. The annual inflation rate in the US came in at 2.7% in December 2025 having ended 2024 at 2.9%. US GDP growth was at 4.3% annualised in Q3, stronger than expected and implying about 2% for the year (Q1 was down) with c2% expected for 2026. The performance of 2025’s IPOs was reasonable (the average premium to IPO price at the end of the year was c20%). Enthusiasm for VC companies, especially in AI remained high.

And so, what about 2026?

One of the lessons of 2025 is to make fewer predictions and so the first thing is to focus on some of the key issues:

1. Will the value of Growth Equity deals rise again in 2026?

The US: This is a tough one as 2025 was a remarkable year of growth in the US market, up by $125bn yoy to $234bn with ten of the twelve months showing yoy growth. One of those that didn’t was December. There are three inter-related indicators here.

Appetite is there from AI businesses: Six US raises, all of AI businesses, raised $93.5bn, 40% of the US total in 2025 (Open AI $40bn, Anthropic $15bn and $13bn, Scale AI $14.3bn, Project Prometheus $6.2bn, xAI $5bn).

For the outturn in 2026 to exceed 2025 it will depend on a clutch of similar big raises. Already xAI has announced a $20bn raise at the start of 2026. OpenAI is reported by the WSJ to be seeking a raise of as much as $100bn. Tether is said to be looking at a $18.5bn raise and Waymo at $15bn. On that basis the 2026 US fund raising total has the potential to exceed that of 2025.

Will these be Growth Equity deals or IPOs? The FT reported at the very start of this year that OpenAI, Anthropic and SpaceX ‘are working on listings expected to raise tens of billions of dollars in proceeds.’ It’s arguably semantics but IPOs would shift them from the growth equity to the public bracket. OpenAI is said to be looking at valuations of $750bn, SpaceX at $800bn and Anthropic at c$300bn. Databricks – which raised $4bn in 2025 may also translate to the public markets with a c$135bn valuation targeted.

Is there an AI bubble? Clearly these businesses are not conventionally valued. Open AI’s Sam Altman has talked about $20bn of annualised revenue towards the end of 2025 (Source: The Information) and has talked about reaching $100bn annualised perhaps as early as 2027 and ‘hundreds of billions’ by 2030. Assuming that implies c$300bn by 2025 it would make OpenAI about twice the size of Meta (2024 revenue c$165bn). Sam Altman has stated that ‘You should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on data center build outs in the not-too-distant future’ and most external estimates anticipate c$1.4 trillion in data center and compute requirements in the next few years.

This heavy capex load, although perhaps shared with partners, is a key concern for markets, flying in the face of the typically capex light model that has supported the growth of the major tech stocks. If OpenAI can reach a valuation of $850bn in its next round, that is 42.5x end 2025 ARR, perhaps c8.5x start 2027 ARR and 2.6x 2030 ARR. By comparison Meta trades at c8.5x 2026 EV/revenue. The growth rates of Open AI are much higher; the profitability is obviously much lower.

And the applications of AI and the associated industries, autonomous vehicles, AI drug discovery, robotics, legal tech, software coding, cybersecurity, defense etc are still in the foothills of development.

So, our answer for the US market is yes – a further increase in the total sums raised in growth equity in 2026 – but it will be close.

Europe: An easier answer here. AI was less of a factor in market growth in 2025 - with AI only the second largest category of raises at $5.27bn, behind Software at $7.5bn. Nor has the European market grown as dramatically – its low was $31.8bn in 2022 – the 2025 level was just 55% higher at $49.2bn and just 23% higher than 2022’s $39.7bn. Looking at the shape of the year, growth was modest in H1 2025 – just 23% while in H2 it was 66%. We think the momentum- helped by lower valuations as investor interest spills out of the US – will see the total of raises grow again in 2026.

2. The sectors to look out for

Of course, we expect AI to dominate again. Looking beyond the LLMs there are three areas to highlight:

Defense: An obvious one perhaps but it was only the sixth largest VC raise category in the US in 2025 with $7.2bn raised and the ninth biggest in Europe with c$1.7bn raised. The trends are all in its favour – heightened political tension around Ukraine, Venezuela, Greenland and the other flashpoints of the world, the JD Vance Munich speech which pushes the onus for European defence onto the shoulders of European countries and has them scrambling to raise the percentage of GDP committed to defence to 5% while new technologies and methods of conducting warfare are offering an opportunity to young, VC backed tech led companies to take a disproportionate share of this new spending from the traditional platform led defence contractors. VC investment in defence companies is accelerating, and the trend appears likely to keep gathering pace as the world adapts to the new reality of heightened geopolitical tension and the realisation that regions, like Europe, will need to shoulder more of the burden and cost of their own defence rather than relying on the US.

Crypto and Blockchain: Crypto went out of style following the collapse of FTX in November 2022, the charges against Binance and its founder which led to convictions in November 2023 plus a supporting cast of bankruptcies and mishaps at the likes of Three Arrows Capital, Genesis Global, BlockFi, Voyager Digital, Celsius Network, Bittrex, and ComputeNorth.

The industry has recovered its poise post these vicissitudes under the umbrella of a more crypto friendly US administration and one of the features of 2025 was the accelerating pace of growth equity deals for crypto businesses. In Q4 there were five US deals in crypto and blockchain raising $2.1bn. Leading these was the $800m raise led by Jane Street for the crypto exchange Kraken executed at a $20bn valuation. A substantial Series A raise for Layer 1 blockchain business Tempo was led by Greenoaks and Thrive Capital, valued the business at $5bn and was supported by the financial infrastructure and payment processing business Stripe and the crypto investment firm Paradigm. The two big prediction market players Polymarket and Kalshi raised $3.3bn between them in Q4 2025. These are blockchain marketplaces. Polymarket, for instance, runs on Polygon blockchain technology using the USDC cryptocurrency. Every trade is matched peer-to-peer through smart contracts.

Long gestation businesses: Quantum, Fusion, Nuclear: Less a sector and more an investment style. These are businesses reliant on the growth of AI but not tied to it – the picks and shovels of the AI industry. We exclude data centres themselves as too closely tied to the short-term development of the AI phenomenon. Nuclear and fusion are about supplying the long-term energy needs of AI and transforming the means of delivery to allow its growth. Quantum computing techniques are the next frontier for the processing of AI and the shift to AGI. In each case venture is fulfilling its true function – to provide early-stage capital to high risk but potentially transformative businesses.

3. Realisations – will they improve in 2026?

Fundraising trends for VC firms were at a low ebb in 2025. There was the beginning of an upturn in the IPO market and a more noticeable upturn in M&A. Nevertheless, the flow of capital around the system remains stunted with the depressed levels of VC fundraising and its increased concentration in big funds reflective of the limited scale of realisations.

One of the key trends has been the ‘private for longer’ syndrome amongst big private companies reflective of a depressed IPO market, the easier availability of substantial amounts of long term private capital in some industries ( Anthropic raised $13bn in September 2025, $15bn in November 2025 and is currently raising another $10bn), the perception that value will grow rapidly and should not be crystallised too early combined with the growth of the secondary market to allow some necessary liquidity for staff and shareholders.

2026 then will be an interesting test of the strength of the public markets. There are certainly plenty of candidates. The CrunchBase Unicorn Board Growth chart below shows that at the end of 2025 it counted 1,640 unicorns which have collectively raised $1,160bn and which are collectively valued at $6,980bn. The key test will be whether the likes of Open AI, Space X and Anthropic move to IPO and the percentage of the equity that is made available to public markets or whether these companies decide that a ‘private for longer’ approach can be sustained.

Underlying Group sales growth of 4% for the full year, with Q4 accelerating to 8%

Assessment & Qualifications sales grew 4% for the full year with all sub-business units contributing to growth. Pearson Professional Assessments secured several new contracts, with continued strong customer retention supporting future growth. US Student Assessment renewed and extended several key contracts in the year, although lost the contract with New Jersey, which will be a headwind in H1 2026. In Clinical Assessment, sales grew due to the continued traction of our products in the market, pricing and digital product growth. UK & International Qualifications benefited from volume, pricing, and International growth. Sales growth accelerated in Q4, with sales up 8%, driven by new contract launches in Pearson Professional Assessments and the return to growth in US Student Assessment as phasing normalised.

Virtual Learning sales increased 8% for the full year with strong performance in H2. Sales increased 20% in Q4, driven by a 13% increase in 2025/26 academic year enrolments in the Fall semester, favourable mix and funding.

Higher Education sales were up 2% for the full year and flat in Q4. US Higher Education sales grew 3% for the full year, driven by enrolments and pricing in our core Courseware business, partly offset by K-12 declines given the transitionary period, with adoption share maintained. In the year, there was growth of 1% in US digital subscriptions and 19% in Inclusive Access. International Higher Education faced ongoing challenging trading conditions in mature markets, declining 7% for the full year.

English Language Learning sales grew 1% for the full year driven by Institutional. Pearson Test of English (PTE) sales were flat, performing well against a tough market backdrop. Sales growth accelerated in Q4 to 8%, driven by a strong performance in Institutional, particularly in key Latin American markets and Asia, partially offset by expected declines in PTE following volume strength ahead of test enhancements in Q3.

Enterprise Learning & Skills sales grew 6% for the full year and 13% in Q4, with a solid performance in Vocational Qualifications and continued quarter-on-quarter improvement in Enterprise Solutions, driven by the recently announced partnerships.

Strong financial position

Pearson's financial position remains robust, with a strong balance sheet, net debt of c.£1.1bn and a 2025 free cash flow conversion of more than 95%1 plus recovery of the £0.1bn in relation to State Aid taxes.

Medium Term Outlook unchanged

Beyond 2025, Pearson is positioned to deliver a mid-single digit underlying sales growth CAGR, sustained margin improvement that will equate to an average increase of 40 basis points per annum and strong free cash conversion1, in the region of 90% to 100%, on average, across the period.

Financial calendar

Full year results will be announced on 27 February 2026. We will hold an in-person presentation and Q&A session, during which we will outline the 2026 outlook.

The Creator Studio package is the best value for creators who use more than one of these apps and who split their time between the Mac and iPhone/iPad versions.
Apple also allows up to six people to share a single Creator Studio subscription via Family Sharing.","Apple’s professional creative apps have been slower to jump on the subscription bandwagon than those from Adobe or some of its other competitors, but the company is taking a step in that direction today. Starting on January 28, Apple will offer an Apple Creator Studio subscription for $13 a month, or $130 a year. Subscribers will get access to the Mac and (where applicable) iPad versions of Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage, as well as “intelligent features and premium content” for the Mac, iPad, and iPhone versions of Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and Freeform.

Apple says it will also offer a one-month free trial for the subscription and a discounted version for students at $3 a month, or $30 a year.

Most of the apps also seem to be getting small feature updates to go along with the Creator Studio announcement. Final Cut will get a new Transcript Search feature that will allow you to dig through video footage by searching for specific dialogue, and a new Montage Maker feature “will analyze and edit together a dynamic video based on the best visual moments within the footage.” An updated Logic Pro “helps creators deliver original music for their video content” and adds a synth player to the app’s lineup of “AI Session Players.”

The biggest update is probably a new version of Pixelmator Pro for the iPad, designed around the Apple Pencil accessory. When Apple announced it was acquiring Pixelmator in late 2024, the image and vector editing app was only available for the Mac.

As for Keynote, Pages, and Numbers—in another lifetime, the apps formerly known as “iWork""—the core apps remain free, but the Creator Studio subscription adds “premium templates and themes” for the apps, as well as access to a Content Hub that provides “curated, high-quality photos, graphics, and illustrations” for the apps. Apple is also offering a handful of OpenAI-powered generative features, including upscaling and transformation for existing images, the ability to generate images from text, and a Keynote feature that will create a slide deck from a text outline.

Standalone Mac apps are still available

Unlike Adobe, Apple doesn’t offer lower-end subscription tiers that only give you access to individual apps. The Creator Studio package is the best value for creators who use more than one of these apps and who split their time between the Mac and iPhone/iPad versions. Anyone else will inevitably be paying for at least a handful of things you don’t use.

Apple’s subscription prices look reasonable based on what you would pay for an all-access subscription to Adobe’s Creative Cloud apps, though Adobe’s apps also cover web design, photo editing, and some other use cases that Apple’s subscription doesn’t—$780 a year, $105 a month, or $70 a month if you pay for one year’s subscription a month at a time. Apple also allows up to six people to share a single Creator Studio subscription via Family Sharing.

The good news for people who only want one or two apps (or who have already bought the apps, or who simply don’t want yet another subscription) is that the Mac versions of Final Cut Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Logic Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage remain available as standalone App Store purchases. Often, when apps shift to a subscription model, it means the standalone perpetually licensed versions go away—Adobe hasn’t offered standalone versions of Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, or its other apps since 2013.

The iPad versions of the apps, including Pixelmator Pro, appear to be subscription-only. Each of the apps has slightly different system requirements, all outlined in a long list of footnotes at the bottom of Apple’s announcement.",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-Creator-Studio-lifestyle-Final-Cut-Pro-1152x648.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 00:12:55.322567

The couple relocated to Austin from Silicon Valley in 2020, and Coxe is also a part-owner of Austin FC.
“Having spent my career backing strong leaders, meeting Claudia made it clear: Supporting the vision for the UT medical center is exactly the opportunity Austin needed,” Coxe said.
In September 2025, Coxe gifted 1 million Nvidia shares, valued at more than $168 million, to undisclosed recipients, Bloomberg reported.
“One of the things that happens with bigger gifts is that it de-risks it a bit for some people,” Simone said.","The donation, one of the largest gifts in the university’s history, was driven by the couple’s personal history and values aligning with the university’s goal of improving healthcare access in Central Texas, where they live.

The medical center will include a new hospital to treat complex and serious conditions and an expansion of the UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, according to a statement from the university. It is expected to open in 2030.

“I hope in 25 years that people will say that UT has one of the best medical centers in the world, and it’s benefiting the whole community,” Coxe said in a video.

Coxe was managing director of Sutter Hill Ventures from 1989 to 2020, and joined the Nvidia board in 1993, an early supporter of Jensen Huang. Coxe is the third largest individual shareholder of Nvidia, behind founder Huang and board member and venture capitalist Mark Stevens, and has an estimated net worth of $7.7 billion, according to Forbes.

The couple relocated to Austin from Silicon Valley in 2020, and Coxe is also a part-owner of Austin FC. They are also Democratic supporters, and each donated $1 million to Beto O’Rourke’s 2022 gubernatorial campaign against Gov. Greg Abbott.

Investing in the future of healthcare

The couple’s personal experiences also influenced their choice to donate to the University of Texas. Their six-year-old son successfully underwent treatment for Burkitt lymphoma at the Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford Medicine in 2003, which inspired them to pay it forward, Simone said. They also saw the need for more healthcare infrastructure in their own community.

“We have a close friend who had to travel to Houston [from Austin] for care she should have been able to get here at home,” Coxe said. As much as 25% of people in the region leave the area to seek care for serious medical needs, according to the university.

A key part of the Coxes’ decision to donate was speaking with the dean of UT’s Dell Medical School, Claudia Lucchinetti, and hearing her vision to change the model of healthcare by integrating university research with a modern healthcare system.

“Having spent my career backing strong leaders, meeting Claudia made it clear: Supporting the vision for the UT medical center is exactly the opportunity Austin needed,” Coxe said. The gift is unrestricted and the university says they will prioritize hiring world-class staff, construction, technology investments, and expanding access to healthcare.

The couple typically gives quietly or anonymously. In September 2025, Coxe gifted 1 million Nvidia shares, valued at more than $168 million, to undisclosed recipients, Bloomberg reported.

“One of the things that happens with bigger gifts is that it de-risks it a bit for some people,” Simone said. “Our approach to philanthropy is to invest and believe, knowing that there’s a risk and not everything’s going to be perfect. We hope by making this gift, we can help encourage others to take that same view.”","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ICM-Simone_Tench_Coxe-1890x1068-1.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-13 23:13:50.712337

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate.
So, this combination indicates that U.S. Bancorp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.","Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when U.S. Bancorp (USB) reports results for the quarter ended December 2025. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.

The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 20, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.

Zacks Consensus Estimate

This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.2%.

Revenues are expected to be $7.33 billion, up 5% from the year-ago quarter.

Estimate Revisions Trend

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.46% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for U.S. Bancorp?

For U.S. Bancorp, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.78%.

On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.

So, this combination indicates that U.S. Bancorp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?

Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.

For the last reported quarter, it was expected that U.S. Bancorp would post earnings of $1.11 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.22, delivering a surprise of +9.91%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.

Bottom Line

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.

That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

U.S. Bancorp appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

Expected Results of an Industry Player

Among the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), is soon expected to post earnings of $4.44 per share for the quarter ended December 2025. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +13.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.46 billion, up 3.3% from the year-ago quarter.

Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for M&T Bank has been revised 0.9% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of +0.54%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.

When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that M&T Bank will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.

Transcript

[00:00:00] Veronica: Hello, and welcome to The Quantum Spin by HKA. I’m Veronica Combs. I’m a writer and an editor here at the agency. I get to talk every day with really smart people working on really fascinating subjects, everything in the Quantum industry, from hardware to software. On our podcast, we focus in on quantum communication, and by that I don’t mean making networks safe from hacking or entangling photons over long distance, but talking about the technology.

[00:00:26] How do you explain these complicated concepts to people who don’t have a background in science and engineering but want to understand all the same?

[00:00:34] Today I’m talking with Katia Moskvitch, who is the founder of “The Quantum Kid” podcast. She is a STEM communicator and a physicist. Thank you so much for joining us today, Katia.

[00:00:44] Katia: Of course, pleasure to be here.

[00:00:47] Veronica: I appreciate you taking time for another podcast since you’ve got your own production schedule that you’re running.

[00:00:51] You do The Quantum Kid with your son Kai, and he is a full co-host in the podcast, and it’s super fun to watch him ask questions with all of your guests. How did you get started with that project?

[00:01:04] Katia: Yeah, it just happened. He has been interested in STEM, in math and engineering and technology in general, ever since he was, I don’t know, about six years old, he started programming in Python all, all on his own. Actually, even before that, he was asking me to find him a coding school when he was five, and I was absolutely unable to find him a coding school at the age of five because nobody would even accept him at that time.

[00:01:29] And then, so he had to wait a little bit longer, and at six they finally accepted him into a coding camp first, and then like a proper after school class. So yeah, it kind of started from there. He started watching CrunchLabs on YouTube, which is this engineering show for kids. Then he begged me to subscribe him to CrunchLabs.

[00:01:51] So he actually gets the parcels in, in the mail and he asks for programmable Lego as well so that he could program it on his computer. And then he asked for a 3D printer. So anyway, all of this kind of over the past three years and got me thinking, you know, maybe we could channel all that curiosity into something more and like kind of open it up for other people as well because he’s asking all these questions and I can answer them to some extent, but sometimes his questions are quite complicated. And I’ve been talking about quantum quite a lot at home.

[00:02:23] And so he started asking about quantum computing too. And then I thought, okay, since I work in that area, why don’t I ask him whether he would like to have a show together. And he said

[00:02:35] absolutely. So he was super thrilled because he loves YouTube. He is a chatterbox anyway, he talks a lot all the time.

[00:02:42] So we tried it out and he was a little bit shy at first because of course he doesn’t know those grownups that pop up on the screen. And he’s not used to virtual meetings or anything like that. But it worked out fine. The first two guests were actually his uncle, my brother.

[00:02:59] And so that made it easier. And the second guest was on the same show. It was a really, really lovely professor at ETH Zurich University who just explained everything in a very engaging manner, and Kai was super interested and that particular episode proved to be the most popular one to date.

[00:03:18] We got something like 50,000 plus views and I don’t know, 50,000 subscribers just from that one episode. And it just shows if the person explains such complex science in a very engaging way, and it’s interesting and accessible to even nine year olds, and clearly also to the wider world.

[00:03:39] And Kai loves it. He was like, oh, I’m a YouTube influencer now.

[00:03:42] Veronica: Every kid’s dream.

[00:03:44] Katia: really. Exactly. So he’s happy.

[00:03:46] Veronica: Yeah, you can tell that he is really into it. I mean, you can’t fake enthusiasm and he’s, his questions are so good and you describe him this way. Kai asked questions in a way, only a kid can, without overthinking it and without the worry of having to look smart and knowledgeable.

[00:04:03] And he reminded me, as I was watching the podcast and listening to him converse with your guests, of that person in the meeting who, everyone’s wanting to ask this one question, but no one is willing to ask it. But then someone finally gets the courage to just say, well, what does this mean?

[00:04:16] Or why are we doing it this way? So, how do you prepare for an episode with him? Do you let him pick the topics or is it a collaboration?

[00:04:23] Katia: It depends. For example, the first two topics, I suggested them, simply because he is very new to quantum, right? And so for him, even the word optimization, I had to explain what optimization is.

[00:04:38] And manufacturing is the same, right? He didn’t know what manufacturing meant. That’s our second topic. So I had to explain it, whatever is being made at factories. Like you can put it in plain English, right? And then he gets it. But then he comes up with questions as we go along and I mean the only bit of preparation that is needed really, actually two bits.

[00:04:55] One, we usually rehearse the intro a little bit because that has to be engaging and we usually get it from the second or third take. And secondly, I typically need to give super clear instructions to the guests because they’re, even though there is a kid in front of them on the screen, they really need to be in the mindset that they’re talking to a child and shouldn’t forget that that’s a small child listening to them, because otherwise he’ll just drift off and he won’t be engaged or, or listening or asking more questions.

[00:05:26] So then what’s the point? Right? But to some extent they all engage with him specifically. So they address him and they talk to him. And then of course, if they’re talking to him and they’re explaining it to him, then he’s much more keen to continue asking questions and actually listening and understanding.

[00:05:42] Veronica: Yeah, you could tell. I think it was, maybe it was that first episode where you were talking about, I think space and you could tell he had worked out this scenario of, I have a spaceship and I want us to do this, and it’s going to land here and it’s going to collect this data.

[00:05:54] And you could tell that he’s building products and prototypes in his mind, obviously, as he goes along.

[00:06:01] Katia: Exactly. Yeah.

[00:06:02] Veronica: So the format of the show is really compelling. I found I think, when you say the quantum kid, you think, oh, it’s going to be over here in the States or Sesame Street, which is, the letter of the day, the number of the day and things like that.

[00:06:12] But each show you have a quantum expert and a business leader. And as you mentioned, you’re talking about complex topics, not just physics, but manufacturing and production. Your own professional network seems to be pretty deep and you’ve found pretty, pretty cool people to talk with. How do you pick your guests?

[00:06:30] Katia: The idea of the podcast is to have a quantum expert, and that could be either somebody, a professor from academia or somebody from the industry, a researcher from the industry like IBM or Google, doesn’t matter, as long as they know the topic, and I tend to research a little bit. Either I know that they’re a good speaker or they’ve, had presentations before that are online and I can see that they could be really, really great. Of course we try to get fairly well-known people. For example, one of our next shows, we’re going to have Peter Shor with us, so he’s

[00:07:05] Veronica: oh my gosh. Wow.

[00:07:07] Katia: A really huge name in quantum computing and I’m really thrilled that he agreed to be on the show. So, hopefully that will go well, and will be interesting. In terms of the second guest business leader, that is really more difficult actually, because my network is in, in quantum, and here we need to get somebody

[00:07:28] from a field where quantum is expected to make quite a huge impact, but not necessarily somebody who’s already working with quantum because the idea of the show is that that person, the second person, is also asking questions and is also kind of learning from the quantum experts through the answers that the quantum expert is giving to a child.

[00:07:51] Because that’s kind of a lot more accessible and easier to understand for that particular person on the line, plus hopefully to all the other business leaders trying to learn about the benefits of quantum computing for this particular industry field. So that is not easy for a variety of reasons because people who are not in quantum, it’s notoriously difficult to get them excited,

[00:08:15] get them to understand why quantum computing would be of use to them. So we got my brother on the line and he is super far from quantum computing, but he’s very excited about innovation in general. He’s a patent lawyer and so one would think that for a patent lawyer, quantum computing wouldn’t be a thing at all, but actually it will impact that as well.

[00:08:37] And he was asking questions like, for example, he likes to invest in promising technologies. Would quantum computing be something that he could invest in already today? And so our guest then answered those questions, so that was great.

[00:08:53] We spoke to a guy, an owner of quite a large baking business in Eastern Europe and he’s got several factories. So one might think that quantum computing definitely will be of use to his business because of the supply chain optimization and picking the right ingredients or playing with different ingredients and so on.

[00:09:16] So there are. Definitely benefits that one may think of, but that particular person just said, no, I don’t think it’s for me, it’s definitely not something I would consider even talking about. So that discussion went nowhere and we had to look for different guests. So it’s not so easy to find people right now who are outside of my immediate quantum bubble where everybody’s super excited and everybody goes to the same conference and everybody knows everybody. But once you’re out of that bubble and like even at my kids’ parents meetings at schools, people are professionals. People are super clever and knowledgeable, but they just don’t know the first thing about quantum.

[00:09:56] Not yet.

[00:09:56] Veronica: Yes. We found too that, there is some that, some hesitancy. There is the, there’s only a small group of people outside of quantum, as you said, that know about the technology or that are willing to talk about it. But even the ones doing some experimenting seem a little hesitant.

[00:10:09] And I’m hoping that all this money that’s flowing into the industry and this higher profile, maybe will help more people be willing to learn about it and talk about it. Yeah, sure. But there’s so much going on in Europe right now. You’re based in Zurich, is that right?

[00:10:22] Katia: That’s right.

[00:10:23] Veronica: I’ve talked to some folks from QuantumBasel and the University of Basel and there’s just so many startups all over the place.

[00:10:30]

[00:10:30] Veronica: So you are a STEM communicator, as I mentioned, and you’ve worked for Wired Magazine.

[00:10:34] You worked for IBM, I think you worked for the World Economic Forum for a little while. So you are obviously a practiced communicator and know how to explain complex topics. What are the communications best practices that you’ve learned over the years?

[00:10:48] Katia: Well, in journalism what they teach you from the beginning is you have to know how to ask questions and you have to show the utmost respect to whoever you’re talking to, that if you don’t understand the question.

[00:11:04] Then you should just ask the question again and again in different ways, in subtle ways, so that you finally get what the answer is. Because especially in science it’s super important. If I don’t understand the explanation, how, even if I record it, how am I going to explain it to my audience? So I need to be

[00:11:23] clear and the explanation should be super, free of jargon even for me at that first instance of just recording the interview. So I ask the question a little bit differently and then a little bit differently until I finally get it, but in a way so that the person doesn’t feel like I’m a dumb, dumb sitting in front of them, and why am I wasting their time?

[00:11:44] So that would probably be the number one thing.

[00:11:47] Yeah, that’s a good skill to have.

[00:11:49] Veronica: Yes.

[00:11:49] So, “The Quantum Kid” podcast is certainly educational for everyone and it’s a fun format. It’s very dynamic. You have your son there asking really good questions. We are always encouraging here at the agency, at HKA Marketing Communications, we’re always encouraging companies to do educational content because the learning curve can be steep for quantum and there’s just not a lot out there comparing modalities, explaining some of the basic concepts.

[00:12:16] Have you had any luck persuading companies that educational content is valuable at this point in the industry?

[00:12:24] Katia: Are you talking about quantum companies or just any companies trying to learn quantum?

[00:12:30] Veronica: Any companies trying to explain a difficult topic?

[00:12:33] Katia: When we talk about quantum computing hardware developers, there are several companies I would say several.

[00:12:41] I would say, a few, probably, that do have educational content, which is pretty good. IBM is probably number one in that they have really good educational content in quantum. Then there are a few others like IonQ. They also have really nice documentation. There’s Google of course. And a few others.

[00:12:58] Quantinuum has some, but yeah, not everybody has good educational content for sure. And I agree with you that in terms of resources, there should be way more. So this is actually why, for example, me personally when I started the podcast, that’s just the first stepping stone to a larger educational initiative.

[00:13:18] The second thing that we are launching right now will be educational webinars on how to program a quantum computer. That’s part of our kind of broader educational initiative called Tesseract Quantum.

[00:13:30] And the webinars will also be monthly and for now hosted on the same YouTube channel where we have The Quantum Kid. And we’ll go from there because I agree with you that there is just not much out there and I’m talking to universities. I’m also thinking how to, probably in the future even create, better educational material like that, maybe even courses or something, because I think we definitely need online courses for professionals that wouldn’t be a fullblown, master’s or PhD degree, where you would have to spend, two years, three years, four years of your life full time. If you’re like 30, 40, 50 years old and you would like to dive deeper into quantum, you definitely don’t want to spend four years of your life again and then go back to university. So what we need is those flexible online courses that you can just do over six months or so but not every day. For instance, I did a course at LSC, London School of Economics, on management and leadership.

[00:14:29] And there are plenty of courses like that and that’s great. So I think we need to do something similar in quantum that doesn’t exist yet. There are a few courses for professionals available, MIT xPRO offers a course and, but again, it’s only four weeks, so that one is actually, probably better than others, but a few other courses I’ve come across, they’re all either two days long or one week long.

[00:14:51] What can you possibly learn? You cannot become a quantum algorithm designer, for example in a week, right? So you need something more substantial. And I think we have a long way to go, but one way to achieve it would be to get policy makers to do something on a national strategy level.

[00:15:08] And then they could change the high school curricula, introduce quantum early. They could incentivize companies to actually do what you just mentioned. Actually think about their workforce development and upskilling much more carefully. But without governments stepping in and doing something I think it’ll be very difficult.

[00:15:27] Veronica: And I think there’s that end of the educational spectrum, but there’s also just catching people’s attention. And that’s why The Quantum Kid is such a great addition to the podcast world because people are so overloaded with information and you need a hook to

[00:15:41] help them understand how powerful quantum hopefully will be and just how fascinating the subject is and how many people are working on it around the world. So, hopefully The Quantum Kid podcast could be that initial hook and then draw them into the more specific educational projects like you mentioned.

[00:15:58] Katia: If you want to see Kai, I can get him here as well.

[00:16:03] Veronica: Oh yeah, sure. It’d be great.

[00:16:03] [00:16:04] Hello. Hello, Kai. It’s very nice to meet you, podcast host. You ask really good questions. I have to say. I’ve been asking questions for a job for a long time, and you’re very good at it.

[00:16:15] Kai: Thank you.

[00:16:16] Veronica: Is it fun to do with your mom most of the time?

[00:16:19] Kai: Yeah.

[00:16:23] Katia: Why quantum? Quantum? Why do you like it?

[00:16:26] Kai: It does because it can do so many things.

[00:16:31] Katia: Do stuff fast.

[00:16:32] Kai: Do stuff fast.

[00:16:34] Veronica: And you’re coding, right? Yeah. Python is the language to know, man, you’re getting a jump on everybody. I was talking to a person who hires quantum engineers or mechanical engineers for a quantum company and she said, Python, Rust, C++,

[00:16:49] those are the languages to know. So getting a jump on things.

[00:16:52] Katia: Yeah.

[00:16:53] Veronica: Thank you for saying hi. I have kids myself and I think it’s very cool that you’re doing this with your mom. Thanks for saying hi. I appreciate it.

[00:16:59] Kai: Okay. Thank you. Bye bye.

[00:17:04] Veronica: My kids are 16 and 21, so I miss the 9-year-old days.

[00:17:08] Katia: Oh yeah. It’s not always that cute, huh?

[00:17:10] Veronica: Yeah. This is true. Those days have faded. So, you were the head of communications in Europe for IBM Research and you’re an IBM Quantum Ambassador. What was it like to work with such a big company doing such amazing work in quantum?

[00:17:25] Katia: Yeah, it was great. My work was not fully on quantum all the time, because communications, of course, especially at IBM, it’s also AI. I worked at IBM Research, it was very exciting because it was all about the new research that is coming out of the lab. And we had to talk about it to the media and do media events and amplify it and, and so on and so forth.

[00:17:49] But specifically quantum was super exciting. We had a lot of really interesting projects like, launching the first European data center, for example, in Germany and just working in general with super smart quantum researchers and talking to them, getting the story out, understanding how to tell that story to a wider audience through log writing or even, while talking to the media.

[00:18:12] So that was, that was great. IBM is doing some really great stuff and I am really pleased that they are pushing ahead with the milestones in quantum computing. And I think it takes a lot of self-awareness and trust in yourself and in your company, your team to publicly declare the roadmap.

[00:18:32] And IBM has done it. And they’re hitting those milestones pretty consistently on the quantum roadmap. They said that they’re going to achieve quantum advantage by 2029, I believe. And so that’s like four years from now. So it’s very, very soon. And yeah, that’s super exciting.

[00:18:49] Veronica: Yes, I do really like their roadmap because they do spell things out and set goals, but then they also have an asterisk too, where we’re still working on this. It’s a way to be sort of honest about the challenges. It’s not easy to, build these machines and but it is good to, to get a date out there and to

[00:19:06] show your work. I use that roadmap a lot when talking with clients in terms of: you don’t want too much detail, but you want enough and you want to look ambitious, but not impossible.

[00:19:15] So one other communication challenge that we have a lot is getting people to think beyond just words. Obviously words are very important. and you need to, when you’re writing a scientific paper, you have to be precise and, explain and explain your work.

[00:19:29] But sometimes you do need something more informal, a blog post or a podcast. Did you have much experience in getting people to try a new format? It’s a little intimidating to get in front of the camera. Was that part of your work at IBM getting people to tell their stories in different ways?

[00:19:44] Katia: We usually knew who would be more comfortable on camera or for example, presenting in front of journalists for say, a media event or something like that. So there is also media training is very important and I think anyone can really get media trained if they really want to.

[00:20:00] Leadership is usually more experienced than researchers. But sometimes researchers also need to be out there a little bit more. One example that stands out is about a very specific researcher whom I met when I started working at IBM.

[00:20:15] And. I knew that whenever he would give a talk, he would give super technical talks. And so whenever we would have media coming to the lab, his talks also would tend to be a little bit more on the technical side, simply because he was so used to it.

[00:20:31] But journalists, of course, very often, can be completely clueless, right? Because they may be covering business and to them the actual underlying science in quantum is something that they don’t normally talk about because they just talk about the business side, or, they may cover policy. It’s difficult for them to understand super technical topics and so on.

[00:20:50] So that particular person, it was difficult to get him to change the way he was presenting. But once he had a conversation with my kid, my older son, who is now 17, and at the time he was I think 11 or 12, and he had one of those, we had one of those bring your kid to work days. He came with me and he loves math, so he really wanted to talk to a researcher about mathematics and career in mathematics. And so I thought about this guy, so I asked, would you please sit down with my son over lunch for half an hour?

[00:21:20] And talk to him because yeah, he wants to know what career path to choose in the future. He loves maths, but he’s not sure. And the guy said, yeah, of course. And then I went to get a coffee or something and I’m coming back five minutes later, and I see them talking to each other.

[00:21:35] My older son, he’s the complete opposite from Kai. He’s actually more of an introvert. He doesn’t engage so easily with people, not straight away anyway, and he’s there sitting with this guy, with this researcher, and the researcher is talking to him about complex mathematics in such an engaging way that my kid is like all, his face lit up, he was asking questions, he was interested.

[00:21:58] It was unbelievable. And so both of them really enjoyed it, and it continued for way more than half an hour. After that I spoke to the researcher and I said, look, could you maybe use some of that enthusiasm in how you talk to my son when you talk to journalists? Because they are just on the same level as my kid here.

[00:22:18] And he thought about it and he was like, oh yeah, that’s a good idea. And so he changed the way he was approaching presentations whenever media would be around, and his presentations naturally became super different from before. Wow. And that was like, it wasn’t even media training, right?

[00:22:34] It was just kind of getting him to understand and to relate to specific experiences that he lived through. And it really, really worked. So I think it can work with anybody really.

[00:22:44] Veronica: Wow, that’s a great story. So your kids have been helping scientists communicate for, for several years now in format,

[00:22:51] Katia: I guess.

[00:22:52] I guess so. I never thought about connecting these to episodes, but yeah, I guess you’re right.

[00:22:57] Veronica: Do you have any advice for quantum CEOs who want to raise the profile of their company and get more people aware of their work?

[00:23:03] Katia: Of course communications and marketing, these are the two things that are super important, but it depends how you do them.

[00:23:10] I think in marketing one shouldn’t over hype and only talk about their own product. I think we are still at the stage in quantum computing where yes, it’s about the business, it’s about selling products for sure. But if we want the world to be ready for quantum advantage specifically, then we need to also talk about education and as you said, spark that curiosity as well.

[00:23:33] So I think that should be one big part of the outreach agenda of companies. So to go a little bit beyond just selling the product, but actually exciting people about quantum and teaching them how to use, how to get those quantum computing skills, and just understanding what it is all about, understanding the benefits.

[00:23:54] Veronica: So you said you have Tesseract Quantum coming up a new show on your YouTube channel and the podcast is brand new, but you’ve already got lots of subscribers, so that’s amazing.

[00:24:04] And do you do two a month or one a month? Is that your schedule? Do you have that sorted out yet?

[00:24:09] Katia: For now, we do one a month simply because I don’t want to overload Kai. I don’t think he would be super happy to do two a month. That’s why we are starting the webinars. And the webinars will be kind of in addition to, to the podcast.

[00:24:22] And that will be the second thing per month.

[00:24:25] Veronica: Yes. Well, It’s a lot of work to put a show together and to, to make it good and so yeah, gotta pace yourself for sure.

[00:24:31] Katia: Absolutely.

[00:24:32] Veronica: Well, thank you so much for talking with us today. Your show is “The Quantum Kid” and you and your son Kai host it, and we will certainly join your subscribers and encourage all of our listeners to do the same. So thanks so much for your time today.

[00:24:45] Katia: Great. All right. Well, Thank you.

Is now the time to buy Adobe?","What Happened?

Shares of creative software giant Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) fell 5.4% in the afternoon session after Oppenheimer downgraded the stock, adding to a growing chorus of concerns that the rise of Artificial Intelligence could hurt the company's business.

Oppenheimer lowered its rating on the software giant to ""market perform"" from ""outperform."" This move followed a recent downgrade from Goldman Sachs, which moved the stock to a ""Sell"" rating from ""Buy."" Analysts expressed worries that generative AI was making high-end design tools too accessible, increasing competitive pressure from AI-focused firms like Canva, Figma, and OpenAI.

This skepticism marked the most pessimistic outlook from financial analysts for Adobe in over a decade. The concerns centered on the potential for slowing revenue growth and pressure on earnings, especially if Adobe needed to increase its own AI investments to compete.

The shares closed the day at $310.02, down 5.4% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us

Adobe’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 6 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 10 months ago when the stock dropped 13.2% on the news that the company reported underwhelming fourth-quarter (fiscal Q1 2025) results, as remaining performance obligations (RPO - leading growth indicator) fell slightly short of analysts' estimates.

That, plus the fact that full-year (fiscal 2025) revenue and EPS guidance were just in line with estimates, signaled a lack of near-term momentum. Wall Street likes to see companies beat and raise, and this wasn't impressive. Adding to the weakness, growth trudged along in the quarter rather than accelerate. Overall, this quarter was mixed. The stock's reaction suggested markets were expecting more.

Adobe is down 6.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $310.83 per share, it is trading 33% below its 52-week high of $464.11 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Adobe’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $658.47.",https://news-assets.stockstory.org/cover-images/adobe-cover-image-NTFexPkM.jpeg,N,,2026-01-13 22:13:14.575300

The H200, Nvidia's second-most-advanced semiconductor, had been restricted by Washington over concerns that it would give China's technology industry and military an edge over the US.

The Commerce Department said the chips can be shipped to China granted that there is sufficient supply of the processors in the US.

President Donald Trump said last month that he would allow the chip sales to ""approved customers"" in China and collect a 25% fee.

Nvidia's spokesperson told the BBC that the company welcomed the move, saying it will benefit manufacturing and jobs in the US.

The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security said its revised export policy applies to Nvidia's H200 chips, as well as less advanced processors. Chinese customers must also show ""sufficient security procedures"" and cannot use the chips for military uses.

The H200 chip is a generation behind Nvidia's Blackwell processor, which is considered to be the world's most advanced AI semiconductor and remains blocked from sale in China.

Chinese embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu told the BBC on Wednesday that Beijing has consistently opposed the ""politicisation and weaponisation of tech and trade issues"".

""We oppose blocking and restricting China, which disrupts the stability of industrial and supply chains,"" he said. ""This approach does not serve the common interests of both sides.""

Nvidia has been caught in a geopolitical tug-of-war between the US and China - two sides of a global AI race.

Trump reversed the chip-selling restriction last July, but demanded that Nvidia pay a cut of its earnings from China to the US government.

Beijing then reportedly ordered its tech companies to boycott Nvidia's China-bound chips and prioritise semiconductors made domestically. That move was designed to bolster China's tech industry, though experts have consistently said that the country's chips still lag behind the US.

Throughout 2025, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang continually lobbied Washington to allow the sale of the firm's high-powered chips to China, arguing that global market excess is essential for America's competitiveness.

Some officials in the US, however, have expressed concerns that the chips would benefit Beijing's military and hurt America's progress in AI development.

While Beijing is likely concerned about domestic firms becoming over-reliant on Nvidia, local firms will be eager to secure H200 chips - at least until homegrown alternatives get better, said semiconductor analyst Austin Lyons.

Nvidia will also be happy to get any revenue from China, even if it comes at a lower margin due to the US government taking a cut of the sales, Lyons added.

Trump's ""unique"" proposal to collect a cut of Nvidia's sales could also set a precedent for his negotiations in other trade tariffs, said Marc Einstein from Counterpoint Research.

""It will be interesting to see if this tariff model expands to other sectors.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3a62/live/f45e8fa0-f0da-11f0-a29c-c32ead86fb16.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 23:13:55.183557

Lilly Confident in Obesity Pill Supply, Doubles Down on AI With Nvidia Pact

With an FDA approval expected in the coming months, Eli Lilly remains confident that its supply chain can handle a coordinated global launch for its closely watched weight-loss pill orforglipron. Chief Scientific and Product Officer Daniel Skovronsky told Reuters at JPM that the pharma plans to “launch in many, many countries . . . as quickly as possible.”

In November last year, the FDA awarded orforglipron its Commissioner’s National Priority Voucher, which shortens the review period to 1–2 months, down from the usual 10–12 months. Analysts expect an approval by March 2026. Lilly plans to sell the drug at $150 per month, Skovronsky told Reuters. “We’ve spent billions of dollars in science here, and tens of billions of dollars to build factories to make this. Then we’re offering it at Starbucks pricing.”

Also at JPM, Lilly unveiled a partnership with AI leader Nvidia to launch a co-innovation lab that will leverage machine learning to address some of the biggest challenges in pharma.

Compounders Continue to Hound Novo

While Lilly painted a rosy picture for its obesity portfolio, fellow weight-loss leader Novo Nordisk reported that compounded and unapproved versions of its GLP-1 drugs continue to eat into its revenues.

At a panel at JPM, CEO Mike Doustdar estimated that around 1.5 million U.S. patients are using compounded versions of Wegovy and Ozempic, Reuters reported, highlighting how drug pricing can heavily influence consumers. These patients don’t actively seek out unapproved and unsafe compounded drugs, Doustdar insisted. Rather, compounders “grabbed a part of the consumers that simply were price sensitive.”

The CEO said Novo is learning the lessons of its compounding problem and will apply these to its patient engagement and pricing strategies moving forward, according to Reuters. The pharma last month won the FDA’s approval for an oral version of Wegovy. The drug launched last week with a monthly out-of-pocket cost as low as $149 for the 1.5-mg and 4-mg doses. Higher doses cost as much as $299 per month.

All Eyes Still on Eylea as Regeneron Pushes on With Muscle Preservation

A high-dose version of Regeneron’s eye injection Eylea appears to finally be gaining steam. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the high-dose formulation made $506 million, a 66% year-on-year increase, CEO Leonard Schleifer said during a company presentation at JPM.

More tellingly, analysts at BMO Capital Markets said in a Monday note that Eylea HD beat the analyst consensus by $60 million, indicating that “conversion to the high dose product may be accelerating.” A pre-filled syringe version of the injection is expected to undergo regulatory review this year, the group added, noting that it could lead to “more robust uptake” if approved.

Indeed, Schleifer at the conference revealed that “the mix of our franchise net sales has been steadily shifting towards Eylea HD since launch with Eylea HD now comprising nearly half of net sales.” All told, Regeneron’s Eylea franchise made $1.1 billion last year.

Regeneron at JPM also doubled down on its obesity plans. This year, the pharma expects to launch a late-stage monotherapy program for its GIP/GLP-1 therapy olatorepatide, as well as report additional muscle preservation data for the combination of semaglutide with trevogrumab and garetosmab, according to a company presentation.

BridgeBio Delivers ‘Surprise’ Q4 Beat With Attruby

Also presenting strong sales numbers at JPM was BridgeBio Pharma, which revealed that in the fourth quarter of 2024, transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) drug Attruby hit net product revenues of $146 million. Analysts at Truist Securities called this sales figure a “surprise” beat for Attruby in a Monday note, representing a 35% quarter-on-quarter growth. The uptick, they added, was driven by “an acceleration in the momentum of new patient adds.”

There were 6,629 unique patient prescriptions as of Dec. 31, 2025, BridgeBio reported, which Truist said was up nearly a thousand from 5,259 from Oct. 25, 2025. “We are particularly encouraged in the 4Q growth relative to the competition,” the analysts noted, pointing to the approximately 20% quarter-on-quarter sales increase for Alnylam’s Amvuttra.",https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/57342ec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1254x705+0+65/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8f%2Fe6%2F161bc323476ca3f9a6ea303db160%2Fistock-2232417355.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 21:00:56.093022

Boston Scientific indicated double-digit growth for its PFA portfolio, with 15% growth expected to continue for at least another three years. Currently, Boston Scientific is the US market leader for PFA devices.

The high growth of the PFA market has been driven by the high number of atrial fibrillation patients in the US and worldwide. During the conference, Boston Scientific indicated a population of over 10 million atrial fibrillation patients in the US alone, with over 60 million worldwide. Currently, penetration for PFA and related technologies to treat heart arrythmias is very low, representing a very large unaddressed market which Boston Scientific is confident it can lead in with its PFA portfolio.

Boston Scientific expects incredibly high growth for its PFA devices, driven by increased usage of its existing catheters to address the large unaddressed patient population, and approvals of new PFA catheters for expanded indications, including the recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the FARAPOINT catheter to treat patients with atrial flutter. The company has also announced its intention to expand indications to other arrythmias, including ventricular tachycardia.

In addition to growing the PFA segment through new indications and further penetration of the atrial fibrillation patient population, Boston Scientific also announced its intention to expand into ambulatory surgical centers. As additional states approve their usage, Boston Scientific believes that this represents another unaddressed market where PFA can be used.

Entering 2026, Boston Scientific is poised to succeed within the PFA market. The current line of devices has seen incredible growth since its introduction to the market with no signs of slowing in the short term. As Boston Scientific expands indications and continues to expand the patient population, it is likely to continue its market leadership in PFA.",https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2026/01/shutterstock_1537866854.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 21:00:43.201473

BNY Mellon Delivers Record Earnings Amid Strategic Shift and Select Headwinds

The earnings call for Bank of New York Mellon Corporation struck a notably upbeat tone, underscored by record revenue, net income, and robust returns on capital. Management emphasized strong execution, widening margins, and clear commercial momentum in core franchises like Securities Services and Markets & Wealth Services. While they acknowledged pockets of weakness—particularly in Investment & Wealth Management flows, some fee pressures at Pershing, and deposit margin compression—the overall narrative was one of confidence, discipline, and rising ambitions, highlighted by higher medium‑term financial targets and visible progress on AI and platform initiatives.

Record Financial Results Underpin Confidence

BNY Mellon reported record full‑year 2025 net income of $5.3 billion on record revenue of $20.1 billion, up 8% year over year, showcasing the earnings power of its fee‑driven model leveraged by higher rates. Return on tangible common equity reached a standout 26% for the year, a level more associated with top‑tier capital‑light franchises than a traditional bank. Net interest income grew a robust 15% for the full year, while expenses rose only 3%, delivering positive operating leverage and margin expansion. This combination of revenue growth and disciplined cost control formed the backbone of management’s upbeat message.

Q4 Momentum: EPS Surges on Strong Top Line

Fourth‑quarter performance reinforced the full‑year story, with total revenue of $5.2 billion up 7% year over year and fee revenue rising 5%. Net interest income grew 13% in the quarter, indicating that rate benefits and balance sheet positioning still support earnings. Reported Q4 EPS jumped 31% to $2.02, while full‑year EPS climbed 28% to $7.40 ($7.50 excluding notable items, up 24%), showing that growth is translating effectively to the bottom line. Credit quality remained a support, with a $26 million benefit to the provision for credit losses in Q4, underscoring the low‑risk profile of BNY Mellon’s balance sheet.

Operating Leverage and Margins Move to New Highs

BNY Mellon delivered substantial operating leverage in 2025, generating 507 basis points of positive leverage on a reported basis (411 bps excluding notable items). Full‑year pretax margin improved to 35% (36% ex‑notables), while Q4 pretax margin was around 36% and quarterly ROTCE reached 27%. This margin profile reflects both revenue scale and efficiency gains, positioning the bank more like a high‑quality financial utility than a traditional spread‑dependent bank. Management framed these results as evidence that its business mix and operating model can consistently generate attractive, capital‑efficient returns even amid pockets of macro uncertainty.

Securities Services Posts Strong Growth and Beats Targets

The Securities Services franchise, a core pillar of BNY Mellon’s identity, showed clear momentum. Q4 revenue in the segment rose 7% year over year to $2.5 billion, with investment services fees up a strong 11%, reflecting deeper client penetration and higher activity. Assets under custody and/or administration for ETFs reached $3.8 trillion, up 34%, with more than 2,500 funds serviced, a 22% increase—highlighting BNY Mellon’s position at the center of ETF infrastructure. Segment pretax income surged 30% to $838 million, and pretax margin reached roughly 34%, surpassing the prior medium‑term target of at least 30% and giving management confidence to raise its ambitions.

Markets & Wealth Services Extends Its Lead

Markets & Wealth Services also delivered another strong quarter, with Q4 revenue of $1.8 billion, up 8% year over year. Clearance and Collateral Management investment services fees grew 15%, supported by average collateral balances of $7.5 trillion, also up 15%, underscoring BNY Mellon’s central role in global market plumbing. Pershing, the clearing and wealth platform, posted $51 billion of net new assets in Q4, reinforcing its competitive positioning even as fees face some pressure. Segment net interest income increased 20% year over year, and pretax margin of around 49% highlighted the capital‑light, high‑return nature of the franchise.

Capital Returns and Balance Sheet Remain a Key Shareholder Theme

BNY Mellon continued to return substantial capital to shareholders, with $5 billion distributed in 2025 through dividends and buybacks. In Q4 alone, capital returned totaled $1.4 billion, equating to a 100% payout ratio for the year, signaling management’s confidence in the sustainability of earnings and capital strength. The CET1 ratio ended Q4 at 11.9%, up 17 basis points sequentially, while liquidity remained robust with a liquidity coverage ratio of 112% and a net stable funding ratio of 130%. These metrics give the bank flexibility to maintain high capital returns while investing in growth, even under evolving regulatory and market conditions.

Platform Operating Model and AI Start to Scale

Management highlighted significant progress on its platform operating model and AI strategy, which are central to its long‑term efficiency and service ambitions. During 2025, roughly half of the workforce was transitioned into the platform operating model, bringing more than 70% of employees into the structure overall, aimed at standardizing processes and scaling capabilities across businesses. The bank deployed over 130 digital employees and scaled its enterprise AI platform “Eliza,” supported by collaborations with major technology partners. These efforts are designed to unlock capacity, reduce manual work, and improve client outcomes, providing a structural underpinning for improved margins over time.

Commercial Model Delivers Record Sales and Deeper Relationships

BNY Mellon’s refined commercial approach translated into record sales performance for the year, with a pronounced focus on cross‑selling and deepening client relationships. The number of clients purchasing three or more services increased by about 64% over two years, indicating success in bundling offerings across custody, collateral, treasury, and data solutions. Management called out notable wins in Q4, including a banking‑as‑a‑service mandate for digital assets with WisdomTree, a front‑to‑back win with an active asset manager, and a significant private markets data and analytics mandate with Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund. Approximately 10% of 2025 sales came from new logos, showing the franchise is still expanding its addressable client base.

Investment & Wealth Management Remains a Soft Spot

Despite strong group results, Investment & Wealth Management underperformed and remains an area of concern. Segment revenue declined 2% year over year to $854 million, while pretax income fell 14% to $148 million, leaving pretax margin at a modest 17%. Q4 saw net outflows of $3 billion, including a significant $23 billion of outflows from long‑term strategies, only partially offset by $20 billion into cash products. This mix suggests ongoing pressure on higher‑fee long‑term assets under management and highlights competitive and market challenges facing the active and traditional wealth businesses. Management will likely need to show tangible improvement here to sustain the group’s upward earnings trajectory.

Pershing Fee Mix and Revenue Composition Under Pressure

Within Markets & Wealth Services, Pershing’s fee performance showed some strain even as underlying activity remained healthy. Investment services fees at Pershing declined 2% year over year, in part due to prior‑year de‑conversion activity. Management indicated that looking ahead, fee growth at Pershing is likely to be more muted relative to net interest income in 2026 and may not fully offset other sources of revenue variability. For investors, this signals that while the platform remains a growth engine in terms of assets, the mix of revenue between fees and spread income is shifting, potentially increasing sensitivity to rate dynamics over time.

Deposit Margin Compression and NII Sustainability Risks

Although net interest income grew strongly in 2025—up 15% for the year and 13% in Q4—management acknowledged some pressure beneath the surface. Deposit margin compression weighed on results in the quarter, and the bank cautioned that December was an unusually strong month for NII that may not fully annualize into 2026. With average balances expected to be roughly flat in 2026, future NII growth will rely more heavily on reinvesting maturing securities into higher‑yielding assets rather than balance sheet expansion. This introduces some execution and market‑rate risk into what has been a key earnings tailwind.

Expense Growth and Reinvestment Could Cap Margin Upside

Cost control remains generally solid, but reinvestment is pushing expenses higher and could constrain incremental margin upside if revenue underperforms expectations. Full‑year expenses rose 3% on a reported basis, while Q4 expenses were flat year over year but up 4% excluding notable items, reflecting higher investments, employee merit increases, and the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. For 2026, management is guiding to expense growth of 3%–4% (ex‑notable items), aligning investment in technology, people, and platforms with its strategy. However, this sets a bar for revenue growth; should the environment soften, maintaining the desired level of positive operating leverage could become more challenging.

Market‑Sensitive Revenue Streams Highlight Volatility Risk

The call also highlighted that some parts of BNY Mellon’s revenue base remain sensitive to market conditions, especially volatility and foreign exchange. In Q4, foreign exchange revenue in Securities Services was down 3% year over year, driven by lower spreads amid reduced FX volatility. While this is not a major earnings swing factor in the context of the overall franchise, it serves as a reminder that certain fee lines are cyclical. For investors, this means that periods of subdued market activity can dampen growth in otherwise stable businesses.

Digital Asset and Tokenization Bets Still in Early Innings

BNY Mellon continued to expand its footprint in digital assets and tokenization, announcing initiatives such as tokenized deposits capabilities and a Dreyfus Stablecoin Reserves Fund. These efforts signal a strategic bet on the future of financial infrastructure, where tokenization and digital rails could reshape settlement, liquidity, and investment products. However, management was clear that these initiatives remain in early stages, with monetization and large‑scale adoption still uncertain. For now, they represent optionality and strategic positioning rather than a near‑term earnings driver.

Guidance and Elevated Medium-Term Ambitions

Looking ahead to 2026, BNY Mellon guided to about 5% year‑over‑year growth in total revenue (excluding notable items), acknowledging that performance will be partly market‑dependent. Expenses are expected to rise roughly 3%–4%, with a target of at least 100 basis points of positive operating leverage, implying continued efficiency gains. Management expects net interest income to grow slightly faster than 5%, supported by reinvesting maturing securities at an estimated 100–150 basis point yield pickup, while fee growth may come in a bit below 5%. Average balances are projected to be roughly flat, and the bank anticipates a quarterly tax rate near 23%, with some first‑quarter noise from vesting‑related benefits and higher staff expense. Over the medium term, BNY Mellon raised its pretax margin target by 500 basis points to 38% and its ROTCE target by 500 basis points to 28%, while maintaining a Tier 1 leverage target of 5.5%–6% and continuing robust capital returns supported by strong liquidity and capital metrics.

In summary, BNY Mellon’s latest earnings call painted a picture of a franchise firing on most cylinders, with record earnings, rising margins, and visible benefits from platform and AI investments. While weaknesses in Investment & Wealth Management, fee pressures at Pershing, NII composition risk, and market‑sensitive revenue lines present real challenges, management’s raised targets, disciplined capital returns, and strong core businesses offer a compelling story for investors. The key watchpoints over the next year will be execution on cost discipline and technology, stabilization of long‑term asset flows, and the bank’s ability to sustain profitable growth in a more normalized rate and volatility environment.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_1929233657.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 19:13:28.809710

Additional Information Regarding Our Estimated Value of the Securities

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables, such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the pricing date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the securities might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the securities on the pricing date is less than the original offering price of the securities. The difference between the original offering price of the securities and our estimated value of the securities results from several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the securities, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the securities, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the securities.

Our estimated value on the pricing date is not a prediction of the price at which the securities may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the securities in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the securities in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the pricing date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the pricing date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the initial issue date of the securities because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the securities and other costs in connection with the securities that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the securities. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the securities and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the securities. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial issue date of the securities based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-12 of this pricing supplement.

Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the securities or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the securities (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the securities), by acquiring the securities, each holder or beneficial owner of the securities acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the securities; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the securities into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the securities of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the securities and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the securities, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the securities, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the securities solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the securities further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the securities are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the securities may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Determining Payment on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date and at Maturity

On each contingent coupon payment date prior to the stated maturity date, whether you receive a contingent coupon payment and, if the contingent coupon payment date is also a potential call settlement date, whether the securities are automatically called will each be determined based on the stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the related calculation day.

Step 1: Determine which Underlying Stock is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day prior to the final calculation day. The lowest performing Underlying Stock on any calculation day is the Underlying Stock that has the lowest performance factor on that calculation day, calculated for each Underlying Stock as the stock closing price of that Underlying Stock on that calculation day divided by its starting price.

Step 2: Determine if the securities are automatically called and whether a contingent coupon payment is paid on the applicable contingent coupon payment date prior to the stated maturity date, based on the stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day, as follows:

On the stated maturity date, if the securities have not been automatically called prior to the stated maturity date, you will receive a cash payment per security (the maturity payment amount) calculated as described below.

Step 1: Determine which Underlying Stock is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day. The lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is the Underlying Stock that has the lowest performance factor on the final calculation day, calculated for each Underlying Stock as its ending price divided by its starting price.

Step 2: Calculate the maturity payment amount based on the ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day, as follows:

PS- 10

Hypothetical Payout Profile

The following profile illustrates the potential maturity payment amount on the securities (excluding any contingent coupon payment otherwise due) for a range of hypothetical performances of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day from its starting price to its ending price, assuming the securities have not been automatically called prior to the stated maturity date. As this profile illustrates, in no event will you have a positive rate of return based solely on the maturity payment amount received at maturity; any positive return will be based solely on the contingent coupon payments, if any, received during the term of the securities. This graph has been prepared for purposes of illustration only. Your actual return will depend on the actual ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day and whether you hold your securities to stated maturity. The performance of the better performing Underlying Stocks is not relevant to your return on the securities.

PS- 11

Selected Risk Considerations

An investment in the securities involves significant risks. Investing in the securities is not equivalent to investing directly in any or all of the Underlying Stocks. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the securities are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the securities generally in the “Risk Factors” sections of the product supplement and prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the securities unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the securities.

Risks Relating to the Securities Generally

·If The Securities Are Not Automatically Called Prior To Stated Maturity, You May Lose Some Or All Of The Principal Amount Of Your Securities At Stated Maturity — We will not repay you a fixed amount on your securities at stated maturity. If the securities are not automatically called prior to stated maturity, you will receive a maturity payment amount that will be equal to or less than the principal amount, depending on the ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

If the ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is less than its threshold price, the maturity payment amount will be less than the principal amount and you will have full downside exposure to the decrease in the price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock from its starting price. The threshold price for each Underlying Stock is 50% of its starting price. For example, if the securities are not automatically called and the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day has declined by 50.1% from its starting price to its ending price, you will not receive any benefit of the contingent downside protection feature and you will lose 50.1% of the principal amount. As a result, you will not receive any protection if the price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day declines significantly and you may lose some, and possibly all, of the principal amount of your securities at stated maturity, even if the price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock is greater than or equal to its starting price or its threshold price at certain times during the term of the securities.

Even if the ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is greater than its threshold price, the maturity payment amount will not exceed the principal amount, and your yield on the securities, taking into account any contingent coupon payments you may have received during the term of the securities, may be less than the yield you would earn if you bought a traditional interest-bearing debt security of Barclays Bank PLC or another issuer with a similar credit rating.

·The Securities Do Not Provide For Fixed Payments Of Interest And You May Receive No Contingent Coupon Payments On One Or More Contingent Coupon Payment Dates, Or Even Throughout The Entire Term Of The Securities — On each contingent coupon payment date you will receive a contingent coupon payment if the stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the related calculation day is greater than or equal to its threshold price. If the stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on any calculation day is less than its threshold price, you will not receive any contingent coupon payment on the related contingent coupon payment date, and if the stock closing price of at least one Underlying Stock is less than its threshold price on each calculation day over the term of the securities, you will not receive any contingent coupon payments over the entire term of the securities.

·The Securities Are Subject To The Full Risks Of Each Underlying Stock And Will Be Negatively Affected If Any Underlying Stock Performs Poorly, Even If The Other Underlying Stocks Perform Favorably — You are subject to the full risks of each Underlying Stock. If any Underlying Stock performs poorly, you will be negatively affected, even if the other Underlying Stocks perform favorably. The securities are not linked to a basket composed of the Underlying Stocks, where the better performance of some Underlying Stocks could offset the poor performance of others. Instead, you are subject to the full risks of whichever Underlying Stock is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on each calculation day. As a result, the securities are riskier than an alternative investment linked to only one of the Underlying Stocks or linked to a basket composed of each Underlying Stock. You should not invest in the securities unless you understand and are willing to accept the full downside risks of each Underlying Stock.

·You May Be Fully Exposed To The Decline In The Lowest Performing Underlying Stock On The Final Calculation Day From Its Starting Price, But Will Not Participate In Any Positive Performance Of Any Underlying Stock — Even though you will be fully exposed to a decline in the price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day if its ending price is below its threshold price, you will not participate in any increase in the price of any Underlying Stock over the term of the securities. Your maximum possible return on the securities will be limited to the sum of the contingent coupon payments you receive, if any. Consequently, your return on the securities may be significantly less than the return you could achieve on an alternative investment that provides for participation in an increase in the price of any or each Underlying Stock.

·Your Return On The Securities Will Depend Solely On The Performance Of The Underlying Stock That Is The Lowest Performing Underlying Stock On Each Calculation Day, And You Will Not Benefit In Any Way From The Performance Of The Better Performing Underlying Stocks — Your return on the securities will depend solely on the

PS- 12

performance of the Underlying Stock that is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on each calculation day. Although it is necessary for each Underlying Stock to close at or above its threshold price on the relevant calculation day in order for you to receive a contingent coupon payment and on the final calculation day for you to be repaid the principal amount of your securities at maturity, you will not benefit in any way from the performance of the better performing Underlying Stocks. The securities may underperform an alternative investment linked to a basket composed of the Underlying Stocks, since in such case the performance of the better performing Underlying Stocks would be blended with the performance of the lowest performing Underlying Stock, resulting in a better return than the return of the lowest performing Underlying Stock alone.

·Higher Contingent Coupon Rates Are Associated With Greater Risk — The securities offer contingent coupon payments at a higher rate, if paid, than the fixed rate we would pay on conventional debt securities of the same maturity. These higher potential contingent coupon payments are associated with greater levels of expected risk as of the pricing date as compared to conventional debt securities, including the risk that you may not receive a contingent coupon payment on one or more, or any, contingent coupon payment dates and the risk that you may lose a substantial portion, and possibly all, of the principal amount at maturity. The volatility of the Underlying Stocks and the correlation among the Underlying Stocks are important factors affecting this risk. Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the prices of the Underlying Stocks over a period of time. Volatility can be measured in a variety of ways, including on a historical basis or on an expected basis as implied by option prices in the market. The correlation of a pair of Underlying Stocks represents a statistical measurement of the degree to which the returns of those Underlying Stocks are similar to each other over a given period in terms of timing and direction. Greater expected volatility of the Underlying Stocks or lower expected correlation among the Underlying Stocks as of the pricing date may result in a higher contingent coupon rate, but it also represents a greater expected likelihood as of the pricing date that the stock closing price of at least one Underlying Stock will be less than its threshold price on one or more calculation days, such that you will not receive one or more, or any, contingent coupon payments during the term of the securities, and that the stock closing price of at least one Underlying Stock will be less than its threshold price on the final calculation day such that you will lose a substantial portion, and possibly all, of the principal amount at maturity. In general, the higher the contingent coupon rate is relative to the fixed rate we would pay on conventional debt securities, the greater the expected risk that you will not receive one or more, or any, contingent coupon payments during the term of the securities and that you will lose a substantial portion, and possibly all, of the principal amount at maturity.

·You Will Be Subject To Reinvestment Risk — If your securities are automatically called, the term of the securities may be reduced to as short as approximately six months. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the securities at a comparable return for a similar level of risk in the event the securities are automatically called prior to maturity.

·You Will Be Subject To Risks Resulting From The Relationship Between The Underlying Stocks — The correlation of a pair of Underlying Stocks represents a statistical measurement of the degree to which the returns of those Underlying Stocks are similar to each other over a given period in terms of timing and direction. By investing in the securities, you assume the risk that the returns of the Underlying Stocks will not be correlated. The less correlated the Underlying Stocks, the more likely it is that any one of the Underlying Stocks will be performing poorly at any time over the term of the securities. All that is necessary for the securities to perform poorly is for one of the Underlying Stocks to perform poorly; the performance of the better performing Underlying Stocks is not relevant to your return on the securities. It is impossible to predict what the relationship between the Underlying Stocks will be over the term of the securities. The Underlying Stocks may represent different equity markets, and those equity markets may not perform similarly over the term of the securities.

·Any Payment On The Securities Will Be Determined Based On The Stock Closing Prices Of The Underlying Stocks On The Dates Specified — Any payment on the securities will be determined based on the stock closing prices of the Underlying Stocks on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Underlying Stocks determined at any other time.

·Owning The Securities Is Not The Same As Owning Any Or All Of The Underlying Stocks — The return on your securities may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned any or all of the Underlying Stocks. For instance, as a holder of the securities, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive cash dividends or other distributions or any other rights that holders of any Underlying Stock would have.

·No Assurance That The Investment View Implicit In The Securities Will Be Successful — It is impossible to predict whether and the extent to which the price of any Underlying Stock will rise or fall. There can be no assurance that the price of any Underlying Stock will not close below its threshold price on any calculation day. The price of each Underlying Stock will be influenced by complex and interrelated political, economic, financial and other factors that affect that Underlying Stock. You should be willing to accept the downside risks associated with equities in general and each Underlying Stock in particular, and the risk of losing a significant portion or all of the principal amount.

PS- 13

·Tax Treatment — Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the securities are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

·The Securities Are Subject To The Credit Risk Of Barclays Bank PLC — The securities are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the securities, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the securities and, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you might not receive any amount owed to you under the terms of the securities.

·You May Lose Some Or All Of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-In Power Is Exercised By The Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority — Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the securities or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the securities (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the securities), by acquiring the securities, each holder or beneficial owner of the securities acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the securities losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the securities or receiving a different security from the securities, which may be worth significantly less than the securities and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the securities. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the securities will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the securities. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underlying Stocks

·There Are Risks Associated With Single Equities — The price of each Underlying Stock can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to that Underlying Stock and its issuer, such as stock price volatility, earnings, financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political conditions. We urge you to review financial and other information filed periodically with the SEC by the issuer of each Underlying Stock.

·We Cannot Control Actions By An Underlying Stock Issuer — Actions by an Underlying Stock Issuer may have an adverse effect on the price of such Underlying Stock, the stock closing price of such Underlying Stock on any calculation day, the ending price of such Underlying Stock, and the value of the securities. We are not affiliated with any Underlying Stock Issuer. No Underlying Stock Issuer will be involved in the offering of the securities nor will any Underlying Stock Issuer have any obligations with respect to the securities, including any obligation to take our interests or your interests into consideration for any reason. No Underlying Stock Issuer will receive any of the proceeds of the offering of the securities nor will be responsible for, or will have participated in, the determination of the timing of, prices for, or quantities of, the securities to be issued. No Underlying Stock Issuer will be involved with the administration, marketing or trading of the securities nor will have any obligations with respect to any amounts payable on the securities.

·We And Our Affiliates Have No Affiliation With Any Underlying Stock Issuer And Have Not Independently Verified Their Public Disclosure Of Information — We, our affiliates and WFS and its affiliates are not affiliated in any way with any Underlying Stock Issuer. This pricing supplement relates only to the securities and does not relate to any Underlying Stock. The material provided in this pricing supplement concerning an Underlying Stock Issuer is derived from publicly available documents without independent verification. Neither we nor either agent has participated in the preparation of any of those documents or made any “due diligence” investigation or any inquiry of the Underlying Stock Issuers. Furthermore, neither we nor either agent knows whether any Underlying Stock Issuer has disclosed all events occurring before the date of this pricing supplement, including events that could affect the accuracy or completeness of the publicly available documents referred to above. Subsequent disclosure of any event of this kind or the disclosure of or failure to disclose material future events concerning an Underlying Stock Issuer could affect

PS- 14

the value of the securities and any payments on the securities. You, as an investor in the securities, should make your own investigation into each Underlying Stock Issuer.

·You Have Limited Anti-dilution Protection — The calculation agent will, in its sole discretion, adjust the adjustment factor of an Underlying Stock for certain events affecting such Underlying Stock, such as stock splits and stock dividends, and certain other corporate actions involving the applicable Underlying Stock Issuer, such as mergers. However, the calculation agent is not required to make an adjustment for every corporate event that can affect an Underlying Stock. For example, the calculation agent is not required to make any adjustments to the adjustment factor of an Underlying Stock if the applicable Underlying Stock Issuer or anyone else makes a partial tender or partial exchange offer for such Underlying Stock. Consequently, this could affect the value of the securities and any payments on the securities. See “General Terms of the Securities—Certain Terms for Securities Linked to an Underlying Stock—Adjustment Events” in the accompanying product supplement for a description of the general circumstances in which the calculation agent will make adjustments to the adjustment factor of an Underlying Stock.

·The Securities May Become Linked To The Common Stock Of A Company Other Than An Original Underlying Stock Issuer — Following certain corporate events relating to an Underlying Stock, such as a stock-for-stock merger where the applicable Underlying Stock Issuer is not the surviving entity, the shares of a successor corporation to such Underlying Stock Issuer will be substituted for such Underlying Stock for all purposes of the securities. Following certain other corporate events relating to an Underlying Stock in which holders of such Underlying Stock would receive all of their consideration in cash and the surviving entity has no marketable securities outstanding or there is no surviving entity (including, but not limited to, a leveraged buyout or other going private transaction involving such Underlying Stock Issuer, or a liquidation of such Underlying Stock Issuer), the common stock of another company in the same industry group as such Underlying Stock Issuer will be substituted for such Underlying Stock for all purposes of the securities. In any such event, the equity-linked nature of the securities would be significantly altered. See “General Terms of the Securities—Certain Terms for Securities Linked to an Underlying Stock—Adjustment Events” in the accompanying product supplement for a description of the specific events that can lead to these adjustments and the procedures for selecting a replacement stock. The occurrence of such events and the consequent adjustments may materially and adversely affect the value of the securities and any payments on the securities.

·The Historical Performance Of The Underlying Stocks Is Not An Indication Of Their Future Performance — The historical performance of the Underlying Stocks should not be taken as an indication of the future performance of the Underlying Stocks. It is impossible to predict whether the closing prices of the Underlying Stocks will fall or rise during the term of the securities, in particular in the environment in the last several years, which has been characterized by volatility across a wide range of asset classes. Past fluctuations and trends in the prices of the Underlying Stocks are not necessarily indicative of fluctuations or trends that may occur in the future.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

·Potentially Inconsistent Research, Opinions Or Recommendations By Barclays Capital Inc., WFS Or Their Respective Affiliates — Barclays Capital Inc., WFS or their respective affiliates may publish research from time to time on financial markets and other matters that may influence the value of the securities or express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding the securities. Any research, opinions or recommendations expressed by Barclays Capital Inc., WFA or their respective affiliates may not be consistent with each other and may be modified from time to time without notice. You should make your own independent investigation of each Underlying Stock and the merits of investing in the securities.

·We, Our Affiliates And Any Other Agent And/Or Participating Dealer May Engage In Various Activities Or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect Your Securities In Various Ways And Create Conflicts Of Interest — We, our affiliates, WFS and any dealer participating in the distribution of the securities (a “participating dealer”) may play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the securities, as described below. In performing these roles, our economic interests and the economic interests of our affiliates, WFS and any participating dealer are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the securities.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the securities, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Underlying Stocks. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the securities. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the securities into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the securities. Participating dealers may also engage in such activities that may negatively impact the value of the securities.

PS- 15

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the securities, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the securities. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the securities and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the securities instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the securities for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

Furthermore, if any dealer participating in the distribution of the securities or any of its affiliates conducts hedging activities for us in connection with the securities, that participating dealer or its affiliates will expect to realize a projected profit from such hedging activities, and this projected profit will be in addition to any selling concession and/or any fee that the participating dealer realizes for the sale of the securities to you. This additional projected profit may create a further incentive for the participating dealer to sell the securities to you.

In addition to the activities described above, Barclays Bank PLC will also act as the calculation agent for the securities. As calculation agent, we will determine any prices of the Underlying Stocks and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the securities. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying product supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underlying Stocks” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the securities, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the securities. Absent manifest error, all determinations of the calculation agent will be final and binding, without any liability on the part of the calculation agent. You will not be entitled to any compensation from Barclays Bank PLC for any loss suffered as a result of any determinations made by the calculation agent with respect to the securities.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Securities and the Secondary Market

·The Securities Will Not Be Listed On Any Securities Exchange And We Do Not Expect A Trading Market For The Securities To Develop — The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the securities but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the securities easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the securities, the price at which you may be able to trade your securities is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the securities. The securities are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your securities to maturity.

·The Value Of The Securities Prior To Maturity Will Be Affected By Numerous Factors, Some Of Which Are Related In Complex Ways — Structured notes, including the securities, can be thought of as securities that combine a debt instrument with one or more options or other derivative instruments. As a result, the factors that influence the values of debt instruments and options or other derivative instruments will also influence the terms and features of the securities at issuance and their value in the secondary market. Accordingly, in addition to the prices of the Underlying Stocks on any day, the value of the securities will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that may either offset or magnify each other, including:

·the expected volatility of the Underlying Stocks;

·correlation (or lack of correlation) of the Underlying Stocks;

·the time to maturity of the securities;

·the market prices of, and dividend rates on, the Underlying Stocks;

·interest and yield rates in the market generally;

·supply and demand for the securities;

·a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory and judicial events; and

·our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

·The Estimated Value Of Your Securities Is Lower Than The Original Offering Price Of Your Securities — The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is lower than the original offering price of your securities. The difference between the original offering price of your securities and the estimated value of the securities is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions, selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees to be allowed or paid to Barclays Capital Inc., another affiliate

PS- 16

of ours, WFS or its affiliates or other non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the securities, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the securities, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the securities.

·The Estimated Value Of Your Securities Might Be Lower If Such Estimated Value Were Based On The Levels At Which Our Debt Securities Trade In The Secondary Market — The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

·The Estimated Value Of The Securities Is Based On Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove To Be Inaccurate And May Be Different From The Pricing Models Of Other Financial Institutions — The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the securities may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions that may be purchasers or sellers of securities in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your securities may be materially different from the estimated value of the securities determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

·The Estimated Value Of Your Securities Is Not A Prediction Of The Prices At Which You May Sell Your Securities In The Secondary Market, If Any, And Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than The Original Offering Price Of Your Securities And May Be Lower Than The Estimated Value Of Your Securities — The estimated value of the securities will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the securities from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your securities in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the securities. Further, as secondary market prices of your securities take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the securities such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the securities, secondary market prices of your securities will likely be lower than the original offering price of your securities. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the securities from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your securities, and any sale prior to the stated maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you.

·The Temporary Price At Which We May Initially Buy The Securities In The Secondary Market And The Value We May Initially Use For Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements At All, May Not Be Indicative Of Future Prices Of Your Securities — Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the pricing date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the securities, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the securities on the pricing date, as well as the secondary market value of the securities, for a temporary period after the initial issue date of the securities. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your securities.

Hypothetical Returns

If the securities are automatically called:

If the securities are automatically called prior to stated maturity, you will receive the principal amount of your securities plus the contingent coupon payment otherwise due on the applicable call settlement date. In the event the securities are automatically called, your total return on the securities will equal any contingent coupon payments received prior to the call settlement date and the contingent coupon payment received on the call settlement date.

If the securities are not automatically called:

If the securities are not automatically called prior to stated maturity, the following table illustrates, for a range of hypothetical performance factors of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day, the hypothetical maturity payment amount payable at stated maturity per security (excluding any contingent coupon payment otherwise due). The performance factor of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is calculated as its ending price divided by its starting price.

The above figures do not take into account contingent coupon payments, if any, received during the term of the securities. As evidenced above, in no event will you have a positive rate of return based solely on the maturity payment amount received at maturity (excluding any contingent coupon payment otherwise due); any positive return will be based solely on the contingent coupon payments, if any, received during the term of the securities.

The above figures are for purposes of illustration only and may have been rounded for ease of analysis. If the securities are not automatically called prior to stated maturity, the actual amount you will receive at stated maturity will depend on the actual ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day. The performance of the better performing Underlying Stocks is not relevant to your return on the securities.

Hypothetical Automatic Calls and Contingent Coupon Payments

Set forth below are examples that illustrate how to determine whether the securities will be automatically called and whether a contingent coupon payment will be paid on a contingent coupon payment date prior to the stated maturity date. The examples do not reflect any specific contingent coupon payment date but assume that the securities are subject to automatic call on the applicable calculation day. The securities will not be subject to automatic call until the sixth calculation day, which is approximately six months after the issue date. The following examples assume the hypothetical starting price, threshold price and stock closing prices for each Underlying Stock indicated in the examples. The terms used for purposes of these hypothetical examples do not represent any actual starting price or threshold price. The hypothetical starting price of $100.00 for each Underlying Stock has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the actual starting price for any Underlying Stock. The actual starting price and threshold price for each Underlying Stock are set forth under “Terms of the Securities” above. For historical closing prices of the Underlying Stocks, see the historical information set forth under the sections titled “The Common Stock of The Boeing Company,” “The Common Stock of Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc.,” “The Common Stock of Lockheed Martin Corporation” and “The Common Stock of Northrop Grumman Corporation” below. These examples are for purposes of illustration only and the values used in the examples may have been rounded for ease of analysis.

Example 1. The stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day is greater than or equal to its threshold price and less than its starting price. As a result, the securities are not automatically called and investors receive a contingent coupon payment on the applicable contingent coupon payment date.

BA Stock KTOS Stock LMT Stock NOC Stock Hypothetical starting price: $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 Hypothetical stock closing price on relevant calculation day: $95.00 $115.00 $105.00 $90.00 Hypothetical threshold price: $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 Performance factor (stock closing price on calculation day divided by starting price): 95.00% 115.00% 105.00% 90.00%

Step 1: Determine which Underlying Stock is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day.

In this example, the NOC Stock has the lowest performance factor and is, therefore, the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day.

Step 2: Determine whether the securities will be automatically called and whether a contingent coupon payment will be paid on the applicable contingent coupon payment date.

Since the hypothetical stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day is greater than or equal to its hypothetical threshold price, but less than its hypothetical starting price, the securities would not be automatically called and you would receive a contingent coupon payment on the applicable contingent coupon payment date. The contingent coupon payment would be equal to $15.33 per security, determined as follows: (i) $1,000 multiplied by 18.40% per annum divided by (ii) 12, rounded to the nearest cent.

Example 2. The stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day is less than its threshold price. As a result, the securities are not automatically called and investors do not receive a contingent coupon payment on the applicable contingent coupon payment date.

BA Stock KTOS Stock LMT Stock NOC Stock Hypothetical starting price: $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 Hypothetical stock closing price on relevant calculation day: $125.00 $45.00 $80.00 $105.00 Hypothetical threshold price: $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 Performance factor (stock closing price on calculation day divided by starting price): 125.00% 45.00% 80.00% 105.00%

Step 1: Determine which Underlying Stock is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day.

In this example, the KTOS Stock has the lowest performance factor and is, therefore, the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day.

PS- 19

Step 2: Determine whether the securities will be automatically called and whether a contingent coupon payment will be paid on the applicable contingent coupon payment date.

The securities would not be automatically called, even though the stock closing prices of the better performing Underlying Stocks on the relevant calculation day are greater than their hypothetical starting prices. In addition, since the hypothetical stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day is less than its hypothetical threshold price, you would not receive a contingent coupon payment on the applicable contingent coupon payment date. As this example illustrates, whether the securities are automatically called and whether you receive a contingent coupon payment on a contingent coupon payment date will depend solely on the stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day. This will be the case even if the better performing Underlying Stocks perform favorably. The performance of the better performing Underlying Stocks is not relevant to your return on the securities.

Example 3. The stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day is greater than or equal to its starting price. As a result, the securities are automatically called on the applicable contingent coupon payment date for the principal amount plus the contingent coupon payment otherwise due.

BA Stock KTOS Stock LMT Stock NOC Stock Hypothetical starting price: $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 Hypothetical stock closing price on relevant calculation day: $105.00 $115.00 $110.00 $130.00 Hypothetical threshold price: $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 Performance factor (stock closing price on calculation day divided by starting price): 105.00% 115.00% 110.00% 130.00%

Step 1: Determine which Underlying Stock is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day.

In this example, the BA Stock has the lowest performance factor and is, therefore, the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day.

Step 2: Determine whether the securities will be automatically called and whether a contingent coupon payment will be paid on the applicable contingent coupon payment date.

Since the hypothetical stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day is greater than or equal to its hypothetical starting price, the securities would be automatically called and you would receive the principal amount plus the contingent coupon payment otherwise due on the call settlement date. On the call settlement date, you would receive $1,015.33 per security.

If the securities are automatically called prior to maturity, you will not receive any further payments after the call settlement date.

Hypothetical Maturity Payment Amount

Set forth below are examples of calculations of the maturity payment amount payable at stated maturity, assuming that the securities have not been automatically called prior to stated maturity and assuming the hypothetical starting price, threshold price and ending prices for each Underlying Stock indicated in the examples. The terms used for purposes of these hypothetical examples do not represent any actual starting price or threshold price. The hypothetical starting price of $100.00 for each Underlying Stock has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the actual starting price for any Underlying Stock. The actual starting price and threshold price for each Underlying Stock are set forth under “Terms of the Securities” above. For historical closing prices of the Underlying Stocks, see the historical information set forth under the sections titled “The Common Stock of The Boeing Company,” “The Common Stock of Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc.,” “The Common Stock of Lockheed Martin Corporation” and “The Common Stock of Northrop Grumman Corporation” below. These examples are for purposes of illustration only and the values used in the examples may have been rounded for ease of analysis.

Example 1. The ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is greater than its starting price, the maturity payment amount is equal to the principal amount of your securities at maturity and you receive the contingent coupon payment otherwise due.

BA Stock KTOS Stock LMT Stock NOC Stock Hypothetical starting price: $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 Hypothetical ending price: $135.00 $145.00 $130.00 $125.00 Hypothetical threshold price: $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 Performance factor (ending price divided by starting price): 135.00% 145.00% 130.00% 125.00%

Step 1: Determine which Underlying Stock is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

In this example, the NOC Stock has the lowest performance factor and is, therefore, the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

Step 2: Determine the maturity payment amount based on the ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

Since the hypothetical ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is greater than its hypothetical threshold price, the maturity payment amount would equal the principal amount. Although the hypothetical ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is significantly greater than its hypothetical starting price in this scenario, the maturity payment amount will not exceed the principal amount.

In addition to any contingent coupon payments received prior to the stated maturity date, on the stated maturity date you would receive $1,000.00 per security as well as the contingent coupon payment otherwise due.

Example 2. The ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is less than its starting price but greater than its threshold price, the maturity payment amount is equal to the principal amount of your securities at maturity and you receive the contingent coupon payment otherwise due.

BA Stock KTOS Stock LMT Stock NOC Stock Hypothetical starting price: $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 Hypothetical ending price: $115.00 $90.00 $95.00 $110.00 Hypothetical threshold price: $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 Performance factor (ending price divided by starting price): 115.00% 90.00% 95.00% 110.00%

Step 1: Determine which Underlying Stock is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

In this example, the KTOS Stock has the lowest performance factor and is, therefore, the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

Step 2: Determine the maturity payment amount based on the ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

Since the hypothetical ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is not less than its hypothetical threshold price, you would be repaid the principal amount of your securities at maturity.

PS- 21

In addition to any contingent coupon payments received prior to the stated maturity date, on the stated maturity date you would receive $1,000.00 per security as well as the contingent coupon payment otherwise due.

Example 3. The ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is less than its threshold price, the maturity payment amount is less than the principal amount of your securities at maturity and you do not receive a contingent coupon payment at maturity.

BA Stock KTOS Stock LMT Stock NOC Stock Hypothetical starting price: $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 Hypothetical ending price: $45.00 $120.00 $135.00 $90.00 Hypothetical threshold price: $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 Performance factor (ending price divided by starting price): 45.00% 120.00% 135.00% 90.00%

Step 1: Determine which Underlying Stock is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

In this example, the BA Stock has the lowest performance factor and is, therefore, the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

Step 2: Determine the maturity payment amount based on the ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

Since the hypothetical ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is less than its hypothetical threshold price, you would lose a portion of the principal amount of your securities and receive the maturity payment amount equal to $450.00 per security, calculated as follows:

$1,000 × performance factor of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day

= $1,000 × 45.00%

= $450.00

In addition to any contingent coupon payments received prior to the stated maturity date, on the stated maturity date you would receive $450.00 per security, but no contingent coupon payment.

These examples illustrate that you will not participate in any appreciation of any Underlying Stock, but will be fully exposed to a decrease in the lowest performing Underlying Stock if the ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is less than its threshold price, even if the ending prices of the other Underlying Stocks have appreciated or have not declined below their respective threshold prices.

To the extent that the starting price, threshold price and ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day differ from the values assumed above, the results indicated above would be different.

Tax Considerations

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.”

In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any contingent coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt.

Sale, exchange or redemption of a security. Assuming the treatment described above is respected, if you are a U.S. holder, upon a sale or exchange of the securities (including redemption upon an automatic call or at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the securities, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the securities (assuming contingent coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position referred to above). This gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss unless you hold the securities for more than one year, in which case the gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the securities at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your securities between the time your right to a contingent coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the contingent coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your securities prior to a calculation day but that can be attributed to an expected contingent coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue.

As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the securities could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the securities, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the securities, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Non-U.S. holders. Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat contingent coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our representation that the securities do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, our special tax counsel believes that these regulations should not apply to the securities with regard to non-U.S. holders, and we have determined to treat the securities as not being subject to Section 871(m). Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the securities.

Non-U.S. holders should also discuss with their tax advisors the estate tax consequences of investing in the securities.

But over five years later, the initiative is still stalled on Capitol Hill, frustrating and confusing supporters in both parties while sparking a blame game inside the GOP.

The Smithsonian American Women’s History Museum Act, which was introduced last February, would secure a site for the museum by authorizing a plot of land on the National Mall to be transferred to the Smithsonian Institution. This is seen as the final legislative step in a decadelong process to create a national Smithsonian museum dedicated to women’s history.

The land transfer bill itself would not cost any money, and the project has raised $70 million in private donations to help with construction, which would be eligible for matching federal funds, according to the bill’s chief sponsor in the House, GOP Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York.

There’s widespread support in Congress for the initiative: 123 Democrats and 99 Republicans are backing the bill in the House, along with President Donald Trump, who praised the measure during a women’s history month event at the White House in March.

“We have a great site. … It’s gonna be a big, beautiful museum,” Trump said. “We’re working on that, and we’re gonna back it 100%.”

Speaking to NBC News late last month, Malliotakis blamed House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., for the holdup, in just the latest example of Republican women openly expressing frustration with the speaker.

In a brief interview Tuesday, Malliotakis offered an update: “This is a history that needs to be told, and no one in Republican leadership should be standing in the way of this getting done. I’m frustrated, because I’m told one thing, and it doesn’t come to fruition.”

Malliotakis told NBC News she and other stakeholders had a meeting with Johnson at the beginning of last year, where she says they were given private assurances that the speaker would help move the bill along. Malliotakis left that meeting under the impression the legislation would advance in a timely manner.

But one year later, the legislation has gone nowhere. Not only has it not received a floor vote, but it hasn’t gone through committee or received a hearing. Some Republicans have fretted about the price tag for operating and maintaining another Smithsonian museum, which would be addressed in the annual appropriations process, and have questioned the necessity of a separate museum just for women.

Last week, after the House returned from its recess, Malliotakis said she did have some positive conversations with key committee leaders, as well as Johnson himself, that left her more encouraged about the prospects for the bill. She also noted the bill had recently gained 223 co-sponsors — a key metric, given that’s more than the necessary number to trigger a discharge petition in the House, which would force a vote on the matter.

But there are still no concrete plans to schedule a committee markup or floor vote anytime soon, according to two GOP sources familiar with the matter.

Malliotakis says she’s now giving leadership the benefit of the doubt that they’ll work with her on the bill.

“I’m hopeful that we’ll be able to do it through regular order in time for this Women’s History Month,” Malliotakis said. “That is my goal.”

Johnson’s office declined to comment on private conversations among members. But a senior GOP leadership aide said they have not been made aware of any major issues with the bill; it just hasn’t been made a priority yet. In addition, the House Administration Committee — which has jurisdiction over the legislation — has been busy with a congressional stock trading ban.

Malliotakis said she has raised her concerns about the museum delay not only with White House staff members, but also directly with Trump, whom she met with around Labor Day.

At one point, the White House discussed whether it could just transfer the land via executive action, according to Malliotakis. But that does not appear to be a viable course of action.

The White House also declined to comment.

Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan, the lead Democratic co-sponsor, told NBC News all options are on the table — including a potential discharge petition to go around leadership’s head and force floor action.

“It’s time we recognize the role of women. And I’m working closely with her to get this done,” Dingell said, referring to Malliotakis.

A women’s history museum has long been in the works. In 2014, Congress established a bipartisan congressional commission to study the feasibility of building an American museum of women’s history.

The commission unanimously determined that the United States ought to have a physical national museum dedicated to celebrating the history and impact of women, given that the country has greatly benefited from their contributions.

The commission also concluded that women’s achievements are often underrepresented in historical accounts, monuments, memorials and museums.

But the effort has faced hurdles and resistance, particularly from Republicans. Some GOP lawmakers have expressed concern that the federal government will be on the hook for keeping the museum afloat and argue women’s history should just be incorporated into the existing national museums instead of establishing a separate one.

While Trump supports the women’s museum, he also signed an executive order last March targeting Smithsonian museums over “improper, divisive or anti-American ideology.” The executive order mentions that “the forthcoming Smithsonian American Women’s History Museum plans on celebrating the exploits of male athletes participating in women’s sports,” as just one of several examples.

The Smithsonian Institute, which consists of 21 museums, includes the National Museum of the American Indian, opened in 2004, and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, opened in 2016. There are also efforts to open a National Museum of the American Latino and a National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture.

In December 2020, Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah blocked an effort to pass stand-alone legislation to establish museums for both women and Latinos.

“The last thing we need is to further divide an already divided nation with an array of segregated, separate-but-equal museums for hyphenated identity groups,” Lee said at the time.

Weeks later, Congress authorized the creation of the women’s history museum as part of a massive year-end spending package, which was signed into law by Trump.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260105-Nicole-Malliotakis-gk-8d045d.jpg",N,,2026-01-13 23:59:10.122479

If you are serious about putting fresh capital to work, do not stop at Bank of New York Mellon Corporation when you can scan targeted ideas built from real numbers.","BNY (BK) recently reported fourth quarter 2025 results that came in ahead of consensus on both revenue and profit, paired with new medium term targets and a fresh dividend declaration that supported a modest share price reaction.

BNY’s latest quarterly beat, dividend declaration and push into tokenized deposits have come against a strong backdrop, with a 90 day share price return of 12.85% and a 1 year total shareholder return of 65.46%. This suggests momentum has been building rather than fading.

If BNY’s recent move has you thinking about where capital could work next, it might be worth scanning for other stocks building traction with both fundamentals and insiders.

With a strong recent run, a quarterly dividend of $0.53 a share and earnings coming in ahead of expectations, has Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s valuation run ahead of itself, or is the market still underestimating its prospects?

Most Popular Narrative: 3.7% Undervalued

With BNY last closing at $122.93 against a narrative fair value of $127.67, the implied upside is modest but clearly defined by specific assumptions.

Analysts have lifted their implied fair value for Bank of New York Mellon Corporation to $127.67 from $119.03, reflecting updated assumptions on revenue growth, profitability, and a slightly lower discount rate that together support a modestly higher forward P/E outlook for BNY.

Curious what kind of revenue path, margin profile and future earnings multiple are baked into that price? The full narrative lays out a precise playbook, step by step.

Result: Fair Value of $127.67 (UNDERVALUED)

However, this narrative still leans on healthy markets and fee trends, and any stumble in executing planned efficiency gains could quickly challenge those fair value assumptions.

Another View: Our DCF Signals Less Upside

While the narrative fair value sits at US$127.67, our DCF model points to a fair value of about US$100.10. With BNY at US$122.93, that implies it is trading above this DCF estimate. The question is which set of assumptions you find more realistic.

Price and EPS Surprise For Parker-Hannifin, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history.

This company, which is in the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.

This maker of motion and control products has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 8.43%.

For the most recent quarter, Parker-Hannifin was expected to post earnings of $6.67 per share, but it reported $7.22 per share instead, representing a surprise of 8.25%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $7.08 per share, while it actually produced $7.69 per share, a surprise of 8.62%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Parker-Hannifin, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Parker-Hannifin has an Earnings ESP of +0.17% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.

Investors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Ubrani said that if 2026 shipments fall by 9 percent, total PC shipments would drop to about 260 million, slightly below 2024's roughly 263.3 million units and close to 2023, ""one of the worst years in PC history.""
Now, using cloud plus on-device memory, a computer labeled as an ""AI PC"" could come with less than that.
Clarke said higher device costs are on the way, as well as bleaker configurations.
PC shipments set to hit the buffers as AI guzzles memory Memory is running out, and so are excuses for software bloat Tired of sky-high memory prices?","The rising cost of memory due to shortages is likely to persist into late 2027, driving higher device prices and lackluster configurations for PCs, tablets, and phones, IDC research manager Jitesh Ubrani told The Register.

“We had assumed this would be primarily a 2026 story. More and more, particularly at CES, we had conversations with folks and they’re saying ‘You won’t find price stability in memory up until maybe late 2027.’ It means that prices will stop rising. Not that they’re going to drop. That’s what we’re hearing,” he told us on Tuesday. “This could be much longer than we had previously anticipated. Not just we at IDC, but we as a collective market.”

The PC market had a strong rebound in 2025, with device shipments totaling 284.7 million, driven by product refreshes and the end of support for Windows 10. The fourth quarter was particularly strong with 76.4 million devices shipped, up 9.6 percent year over year. For the full year, 2025 saw an 8.1 percent rise in PC shipments worldwide.

But part of that success comes from suppliers stockpiling inventory ahead of a looming memory shortage, Ubrani told The Register.

“Ultimately, it ended up far ahead of what anyone had hoped for. And given where things are today, it might be like the last good year we have for the next two years, or maybe even three years,” he said. “Things are kind of getting worse day by day from here on out.”

In November, IDC had already predicted the 2026 PC market could see a year-on-year decline of 2.4 percent, with a more moderate downside scenario putting the drop at 4.9 percent due to tough comparables against the PC surge last year. But a persistent memory supply crunch could push that to the most pessimistic prediction, roughly a 9 percent slide. Other analysts seem to agree it'll be a tough year.

Ubrani said that if 2026 shipments fall by 9 percent, total PC shipments would drop to about 260 million, slightly below 2024's roughly 263.3 million units and close to 2023, ""one of the worst years in PC history.""

He added 2023 and 2016 had the same volume of shipments with about 260 million.

“2023 was one of the worst because it was after the boom brought about by the pandemic and it was a year where everyone had excess inventory,” he explained. “Now we're potentially getting back to pre-pandemic levels.”

The PCs that do arrive in 2026 are likely to be more expensive with fewer features.

Ubrani said prior to the memory crunch, many vendors considered 16 GB of RAM as the starting point of what would be considered an AI PC. Now, using cloud plus on-device memory, a computer labeled as an ""AI PC"" could come with less than that.

“You might see instances where a system doesn’t have 16 gigs and they’re still promoted as an AI PC, but it would use this hybrid AI approach, where you can do some on device, but most of it in cloud,” Ubrani said. “The marketing to end users may not say that, and consumers again, can’t really tell the difference, or won't know the difference, but on the enterprise side, you will see the messaging change away from ‘on device AI.’ ”

During their most recent earnings calls, Lenovo, HP, and Dell all reassured investors they were capable of maneuvering through the looming memory shortages, but both Dell and HP said it would mean higher prices.

Dell’s COO Jeff Clarke, who took over leadership of that company’s PC division in 2025, said on the November call that this is the seventh DRAM supply shortage in the last 40 years that he has seen. The last one “of this magnitude” he said was between 2016 and 2017.

“It’s unprecedented. We have not seen costs move at the rate that we’ve seen. And by the way, it’s not unique to DRAM. It’s NAND. It is hard drives, leading edge nodes across the semiconductor network,” he told analysts.

Clarke said higher device costs are on the way, as well as bleaker configurations.

HP CEO Enrique Lores echoed that sentiment during that company’s November earnings call, saying that if the memory market doesn’t improve, expect higher PC costs in the second half of 2026.

Ubrani said Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Apple will face challenges, but their scale and relationship with chipmakers will insulate them. The vendors facing the most peril are smaller players such as Acer, Asus, and MSI.

“Even if they do get the memory, their prices are going to be so high that their finished PCs are going to be so expensive that their customers won’t buy it. So these are real challenges to be had, kind of across the board,” he said. “That’s why, again, a Lenovo, an Apple, they’re in a very good position, but even they’ve mentioned price hikes. So it's going to be a challenging environment going forward.” ®",https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/08/22/shutterstock_187711835.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 19:01:56.534649

Proton’s Lumo AI Adds an Encrypted Projects Space for Organizing Work

Amy Duong — Jan 13, 2026 — Tech

References: engadget

Proton’s Lumo AI chatbot has introduced a new feature called Projects, which provides users with an encrypted space to organize files, notes, and tasks related to specific workstreams. Lumo itself is a privacy-focused AI assistant developed by Proton AG that uses zero-access encryption and a no-logs approach to keep conversations confidential, meaning chats are encrypted and not stored in plain text on servers.

Proton positions the assistant as a tool for handling sensitive content such as documents and summaries without using that data to train models or expose it to third parties. With Projects, users can designate folders or collections of materials that Lumo can access to assist with task automation, document review, and content generation within that secure container. Files uploaded or linked through Proton Drive integration are protected under the same encryption protocols that secure chat history, ensuring that only the user can decrypt and view project contents.

Boston Scientific is eyeing land across the street from its current Arbor Lakes facility to house a four-story, 300,000-square-foot lab and office property, according to planning documents.

The new property is dubbed the Minnesota Science and Technology Center by planning documents. The land for the new facility is near Revere Lane and 73rd Place in Maple Grove.

A certificate of real estate value published last week shows that Boston Scientific recently sold the land the new facility would be built on, to an entity related to C.S. McCrossan. According to the CRV, the property was sold for $7.3 million, cash. Finance & Commerce reached out to C.S. McCrossan for this story.

Ryan Cos. submitted the preliminary and final plat approval to Maple Grove. Ryan also built the first Boston Scientific Arbor Lakes building, which the med-tech giant bought for $188 million, one of the most expensive real estate transactions of the last few years. Ryan declined to comment for this story.

Per planning documents, the 300,000 square feet will be split among four uses: Office space will take up 253,000 square feet, lab space will take up 11,000 square feet, another 9,000 square feet will be “Future Lab” space, while the remaining 26,700 will be for building-wide support. The first two floors of the building will serve as an amenities and training area, as well as a cafeteria and fitness center. The top floors will be office and laboratory space.

In this new reality, the tools that matter are not necessarily UI/UX prototyping tools, but high-performance video editing (Premiere/After Effects) and rapid social content tools (Adobe Express/Firefly).
The market’s failure to understand the nuance of the professional creative workflow has created a valuation anomaly.","The prevailing narrative surrounding Adobe Inc. in the mid-2020s has been characterized by a profound sense of technological anxiety. Market participants, driven by the rapid proliferation of standalone generative artificial intelligence platforms, have largely adopted a reductionist view of the creative software industry. This consensus suggests that as the cost of generating high-fidelity assets approaches zero, the economic moat surrounding Adobe’s professional suite must inevitably erode. However, a second-level analysis, mirroring the contrarian philosophy popularized by Howard Marks, suggests that this negative sentiment is not only overcooked but fundamentally detached from the operational realities of the professional creative workflow.

The current valuation of Adobe reflects a market that is pricing in a structural obsolescence that is not supported by the company’s underlying financial performance or its aggressive technological pivots. To understand the future trajectory of Adobe, one must distinguish between the ""casual generation"" of digital content and the ""professional production"" of brand-compliant assets. While the former is indeed being commoditized, the latter is becoming increasingly complex, requiring the exact vertically integrated framework that Adobe is currently perfecting.

The Psychology of Market Sentiment and the Pessimism Overcorrection

The investment landscape often oscillates between irrational exuberance and excessive pessimism. In the case of Adobe, the stock has experienced significant multiple compression, with its Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio dropping from a peak of 56.6x in 2021 to a recent low of approximately 19.8x to 20.7x as of early 2026. This represents a decadal low, reaching levels last seen during the initial uncertainty of the company’s transition to the Creative Cloud subscription model in 2011-2013.

This compression is a direct result of the ""AI fear"" narrative. Investors have observed the ""sloppy"" but impressive outputs of tools like Midjourney, Runway, and Sora, and concluded that the professional will no longer need Photoshop or Premiere Pro. However, this perspective ignores the historical precedent of Adobe’s resilience through multiple technological shifts, including the transitions from desktop publishing to web design, and from perpetual licensing to SaaS. The current market sentiment appears to be at a ""trough of disillusionment,"" failing to recognize that Adobe is not a legacy bystander but the primary orchestrator of the AI transition for the enterprise.

.

The data indicates that Adobe is operationally stronger than ever, with record-high gross margins and net margins hovering around 30%. The disconnect between these fundamentals and the compressed valuation multiple suggests a significant margin of safety for the patient investor, provided the company can prove its AI monetization strategy.

The Vertical Integration Moat: Beyond Standalone Tools

The fundamental misunderstanding of the creative industry involves the ""iteration problem."" Standalone AI tools are excellent for ideation—creating a single, striking image from a prompt. However, professional work is rarely the result of a single prompt. It is a collaborative, iterative process involving dozens of adjustments to lighting, composition, layer structure, and brand alignment.

The Friction of Fragmented Workflows

Standalone AI generators exist as ""isolated islands"" in the creative process. A designer might generate a background in a browser-based tool, then export it, import it into Photoshop for retouching, then move to After Effects for animation. Each step in this fragmented workflow introduces friction, loss of fidelity, and complex asset management challenges. Adobe’s competitive edge lies in its ability to vertically integrate these AI tools into a unified framework where the image generation, editing, and final output occur in a ""perfect editing sync"".

Adobe Firefly is not merely a generator; it is a feature set embedded within the existing tools that professionals already use. When a user utilizes ""Generative Fill"" in Photoshop, the AI-generated pixels are not a static image but a layer that respects the lighting, perspective, and resolution of the surrounding project. This integration solves the ""trial and error"" fatigue associated with standalone tools, where users often exhaust their credit limits before achieving a professional-grade result.

Generative Credits and the Logic of Monetization

Adobe has introduced a ""Generative Credit"" system that serves as the economic backbone of its AI strategy. Unlike competitors whose pricing models can be opaque or prohibitively expensive for high-volume users, Adobe has tied AI consumption to its existing subscription tiers while offering ""Firefly Credit Add-ons"" for heavy users.

This system creates a ""consumption-to-conversion flywheel."" As professionals integrate AI into their daily workflows, their credit usage increases. When they hit the limits of their current plan, the path of least resistance is to upgrade to a higher Creative Cloud tier or purchase a credit pack, thereby driving Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) expansion. In Q4 FY2025, Adobe reported that generative credit consumption increased 3x quarter-over-quarter, a metric that serves as a powerful leading indicator of future subscription upgrades.

Technical Superiority and the ""Commercially Safe"" Moat

A significant portion of the bear case rests on the idea that open-source or third-party models will eventually outperform Adobe’s proprietary models. However, this ignores the ""Commercial Safety"" requirement of the Fortune 500. Large enterprises cannot risk utilizing AI models trained on copyrighted data without proper licensing, as it exposes them to massive legal liabilities.

The Firefly Foundation

Adobe Firefly sucks. Let's get that out the way. But it was trained specifically on Adobe Stock images, openly licensed content, and public domain content where the copyright has expired. This allows Adobe to provide its enterprise customers with legal indemnification - a promise that the content generated by their employees will not lead to a copyright lawsuit. For a Fortune 500 company, this protection is not a ""nice-to-have""; it is a prerequisite for the adoption of generative AI at scale.

As of late 2025, 75% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted Adobe Firefly, and 90% of Adobe’s top 50 enterprise clients are utilizing these AI tools. This high level of penetration among the world’s largest spenders suggests that the ""sloppy"" competition is not effectively challenging Adobe where the money is most concentrated.

Breakthroughs in 3D and Video Manipulation

Adobe has been quietly working on features that extend far beyond simple image generation. ""Project Neo,"" for example, allows designers to work with 3D sketches and reference shapes, which the AI then renders into production-ready 2D assets. This enables 3D light manipulation, allowing a designer to change the angle and perspective of an object’s lighting after it has been generated.

Furthermore, the integration of the Firefly Video Model into Premiere Pro via ""Generative Extend"" is a technical marvel that addresses the ""professional"" need for precision. While a tool like Sora might generate a whole new video, Adobe’s tool allows an editor to add two seconds to the end of an existing clip, perfectly matching the original lighting, motion, and grain. This is the difference between ""AI slop"" and a ""streamlined professional outcome"".

The Competitive Landscape: Canva and the ""Professional"" Delusion

The rise of Canva is often cited as a direct threat to Adobe’s dominance. However, an analyst looking at the KPIs and market segmentation would conclude that the two companies are operating in largely different categories. Canva is an accessibility tool for non-designers - small business owners, social media managers, and educators who need ""good enough"" content quickly.

Segmentation of the Creative Market

While Canva has a massive user base (over 220 million MAU), its revenue is a fraction of Adobe’s, totaling approximately $2.7 billion in 2024. In contrast, Adobe’s Digital Media segment alone exited FY2025 with $19.2 billion in ARR.

Casual User / Small SMB > Canva (Speed, Templates, Ease of Use)

Prosumer / Freelance > Adobe / Canva Hybrid (Flexibility, Price, Basic Pro Tools)

Enterprise / Creative Agency > Adobe Creative Cloud (Precision, Compliance, Full Ecosystem)

Fortune 500 Branding > Adobe Suite (Quality Control, Licensing, Scale)

Canva’s 2024 acquisition of Affinity was a clear signal of its intent to move upmarket, but Adobe’s dominance in the ""Creative and Marketing Professionals"" group remains robust, with subscription revenue growing at 11% YoY. The competitive landscape is not a zero-sum game; the total addressable market for digital content is expanding so rapidly that both companies can grow, but Adobe remains the gatekeeper for high-end production.

The Figma Post-Mortem and the Pivot to Social Content

The failure to acquire Figma was a tactical blow to Adobe’s dominance in the UI/UX design market. Figma has effectively won that segment, with Adobe XD being relegated to maintenance mode. However, a broader strategic view suggests that the importance of traditional web design is being eclipsed by the explosive growth of the creator economy and social-first content.

The Decline of Web Design Agency Budgets

Ten to fifteen years ago, the primary creative spend for a corporation was a high-end, experimental website designed by a boutique agency. Today, those budgets have shifted toward social media programs, influencer partnerships, and in-house content creation for platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

.

In this new reality, the tools that matter are not necessarily UI/UX prototyping tools, but high-performance video editing (Premiere/After Effects) and rapid social content tools (Adobe Express/Firefly). Adobe is significantly better positioned to capture the ""social content"" budget than it was to recapture the ""web design"" budget through Figma. The $20 billion intended for Figma has been redirected toward AI R&D and aggressive share repurchases, which may ultimately prove to be a more accretive use of capital for shareholders.

Analyzing the Financial Engine: ARR and RPO

Critics of Adobe often point to ""decelerating"" growth, yet the numbers tell a story of consistent, low-double-digit expansion on a massive base. In FY2025, Adobe achieved total revenue of $23.77 billion, representing 11% year-over-year growth.

The Resilience of Digital Media ARR

Digital Media ARR is the lifeblood of Adobe. It exited Q4 FY2025 at $19.20 billion, growing 11.5%. This is not the profile of a struggling company. Furthermore, the Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) reached $22.52 billion, growing 13% YoY, which provides high visibility into future revenue.

The fact that GAAP EPS growth (35% in FY25) and Free Cash Flow growth (32% in FY25) are significantly outpacing revenue growth indicates that Adobe is a master of operating leverage. The company is becoming more efficient even as it navigates the expensive transition to AI.

Rebutting the ""E-Commerce"" Label

A common critique, often cited from Gartner’s categorization, is that Adobe is increasingly an ""e-commerce platform"" company. However, the data suggests this is a category error. Adobe’s ""Digital Experience"" segment, while a healthy $5.86 billion business, is a secondary pillar to the ""Digital Media"" segment, which accounts for approximately 74% of total revenue.

Adobe is a ""Creative Platform"" that provides the assets for e-commerce, not the transaction engine itself. Its web services are indeed auxiliary to the Creative Cloud. The true value proposition is the ""Content Supply Chain""—the end-to-end process of creating, managing, and delivering the visual assets that power modern commerce. By focusing on ""Agentic Experiences"" and conversational interfaces in Acrobat and Express, Adobe is expanding the utility of its core creative engine into the broader enterprise productivity space.

The DCF Valuation and the Argument for $460

A rigorous valuation of Adobe must account for its historical multiple compression and its future cash flow potential. Using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, we can estimate the intrinsic value based on a normalized growth trajectory.

Given Adobe’s current FCF of approximately $9.9 billion and a projected growth rate of 10-12% over the next five years, the present value of future cash flows suggests an intrinsic value significantly higher than the current market price.

Pessimistic (Bear)

Fair Value Estimate: $271.93

Narrative Assumption: AI commoditizes tools; margins compress.

.

Market Consensus

Fair Value Estimate: $327.65

Narrative Assumption: Current trading price (early 2026).

.

Base Case (My case)

Fair Value Estimate: $460.00

Narrative Assumption: AI drives ARPU; enterprise lock-in holds.

.

Optimistic (Simple Wall St)

Fair Value Estimate: $519.95

Narrative Assumption: FCF growth accelerates to $13B by 2030.

.

The current stock price represents a roughly 30-40% discount to the subjective fair value of $460. This ""margin of safety"" is characteristic of the quality-value plays Howard Marks identifies during periods of extreme market skepticism.

The Path Forward: What Will Flip the Sentiment?

For Adobe to undergo a significant rerating, the ""AI Narrative Correction"" must take place. Analysts will need to see that the ""naked swimmers"" - startups with high burn rates and no operating cash flows - fail to disrupt the established verticals.

Key Rerating Catalysts for 2026

Monetization Clarity: As ""AI-first ARR"" moves from $250 million toward the $1 billion mark, the market will stop viewing AI as a threat and start viewing it as a growth engine.

Margin Stability: If Adobe can maintain its ~45% non-GAAP operating margin while scaling its GPU infrastructure, it will prove the scalability of its AI model.

Agentic Adoption: The success of ""AEP Agent Orchestrator"" in automating marketing for the Fortune 500 will move Adobe from a ""tool provider"" to a ""solution provider"".

Macro-Economic Rotation: A broader market shift back toward highly profitable, cash-generating software companies as interest rates stabilize.

Conclusion: The Resilient Creative Operating System

The current state of Adobe is one of fundamental strength masked by a temporary cloud of technological uncertainty. The company’s healthy balance sheet, elite profitability (ROE of 61.28%), and defensive position within the enterprise content supply chain make it an unlikely candidate for disruption by ""sloppy"" AI tools.

The market’s failure to understand the nuance of the professional creative workflow has created a valuation anomaly. By vertically integrating generative AI into a suite of tools that are functionally indispensable to the modern economy, Adobe is not just surviving the AI wave - it is directing its flow. When the market eventually rerates the stock to reflect its durable cash flows and AI-driven ARPU expansion, the patient investor who recognized the ""overcorrection"" will find themselves rewarded. The subjective fair value of $460 is not a reach; it is a reversion to the mean for a company that remains the undisputed operating system for creativity.",https://images.simplywall.st/company/0c4dbaf8-7855-4d81-b937-e315338b9ecf/cover?size=main-header,N,,2026-01-13 19:01:52.348242
ID43,Uber,2026-01-13 21:09:31+00:00,Coast Reporter,Halifax council to discuss providing more oversight for ride-hailing companies,"Michael MacDonald, The Canadian Press",,,,,https://www.coastreporter.net/the-mix/halifax-council-to-discuss-providing-more-oversight-for-ride-hailing-companies-11731217,"HALIFAX — Halifax regional council is reviewing a recommendation for the municipality to provide more oversight for drivers working for Uber and other ride-hailing companies.
While ride-hailing drivers are subject to the same checks and training, the staff report says oversight is currently provided by companies like Uber, not the municipality.
Sam Austin says the municipality doesn’t require the results from background checks for ride-hailing drivers.
Uber drivers will have to pay an additional $100 every two years after meeting the initial requirements, the company has said.
“When the (ride-hailing companies) came along, regulators threw open the doors and welcomed everybody in,” he said.","HALIFAX — Halifax regional council is reviewing a recommendation for the municipality to provide more oversight for drivers working for Uber and other ride-hailing companies.

Uber has said it's opposed to the proposal, which will be discussed Tuesday at a council meeting, saying it will lead to higher fares, too much red tape and additional fees for drivers.

Last month, council was presented with a staff report recommending that the requirements for all ride-hailing services be brought in line with rules covering all taxi and limousine companies. Under the existing system, taxi and limousine drivers must send the municipality results from training and background checks, which include scans for criminal records, child abuse allegations and a police check for those working with vulnerable people.

While ride-hailing drivers are subject to the same checks and training, the staff report says oversight is currently provided by companies like Uber, not the municipality.

Coun. Sam Austin says the municipality doesn’t require the results from background checks for ride-hailing drivers.

“We don't really have access to that stuff,” Austin said in an interview Monday, adding that he’s aware that Uber is willing to share that information with the local government. “If they already have it all, it shouldn't be too much of a problem for it to be provided to us.""

Austin says more oversight is a must. “There's not always been the best of behaviour … with some of these companies,” Austin said.

“You don't have to (search) much to find challenges. And the taxi industry has had its fair share, too .... I'm always a little bit skeptical of those who say, ‘Don't worry about this, we're handling it,’ when someone has a financial incentive not to handle it.”

A spokesman for Uber could not be immediately reached for comment.

The company's Canadian office has said that its drivers are licensed through the Uber platform and that the city's proposed changes would create redundant training and an additional $135 in fees, resulting in a more expensive service and a slower onboarding process for new drivers. Uber drivers will have to pay an additional $100 every two years after meeting the initial requirements, the company has said.

As well, Uber has said the region's licensing manager already has the authority to request documents regarding Uber drivers to determine if they are complying with all applicable laws.

Brian Herman, president of Casino Taxi in Halifax, says Halifax's proposal is reasonable. “It’s just to ensure that all the drivers that are transporting people for hire have passed the appropriate checks,” said Herman, who leads the largest and oldest taxi company in the region.

“The municipality shouldn't necessarily rely on an independent company to claim that their drivers (have proper background checks).”

Uber Canada has argued the rules in Halifax are already more stringent than in other cities. But Herman challenged that claim, saying the provincial requirements for getting a Class 4 vehicle-for-hire licence were loosened in 2020 to entice Uber set up shop in Halifax.

The need for more oversight in Halifax is part of a wider trend, Herman said.

“When the (ride-hailing companies) came along, regulators threw open the doors and welcomed everybody in,” he said.

“They took the bait that said regulations were not required because a customer can rate a driver (on an app) with a five-star or a one-star. Across the board, people are recognizing that type of process isn't necessarily what it's cracked up to be.”

The proposed bylaw changes, which include making it easier for taxi companies to change their rates, are up for first reading on Tuesday. That means no decisions will be taken by council until the proposals return for second reading at a later date.

January means the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference and all eyes in the pharma and biotech space turn to San Francisco. Our Biomedtracker team is providing daily reports to bring you the highlights of each day’s activities. There’s loads to digest in the full Day One report, so here are a few highlights to whet your appetite.

Day One didn’t deliver a huge haul of large deal announcements, and the message was unusually crisp: concentrate on categories you can lead, fund growth with operating discipline, and use BD&L to fill capability gaps. Here are a few takeaways from the day’s presentations.

Mega caps set the pace

Let’s start with the biggest players. Johnson & Johnson’s Chairman & CEO Joaquin Duato delivered an optimistic outlook, stating that 2026 will be stronger than 2025 as the company is now able to “focus on fundamentals” following the resolution of key policy agreements with the U.S. administration. The company is targeting 5–7% annual growth from 2023 to the end of the decade, and Duato highlighted a dozen launches across innovative medicines and medtech in that timeframe.

Also from the Big Pharma corner, Novartis’ presentation opened with highlights about the company’s strong sales growth and core operating income in recent years (7–15%). The company’s strategy remains unchanged with a focus on four core therapy areas; cardiovascular-renal-metabolic [CRM], immunology, neuroscience and oncology.

Large cap momentum

At the next level, our Day One report features summaries from more than a dozen players, including Alnylam, Biogen, BridgeBio, BMS, Gilead, Pfizer and Sanofi.

Alnylam unveiled its “Alnylam 2030” strategy, built on three pillars: scaling with discipline and agility, achieving global TTR leadership, and growing through sustainable innovation. The presentation highlighted Alnylam’s leadership in the ATTR-CM market, which represents a significant unmet need with over 300,000 patients globally and 80% still undiagnosed.

Biogen President and CEO Christopher Viehbacher emphasized the company’s ongoing multi-year transformation. He highlighted Biogen’s evolution from a declining multiple sclerosis (MS) driven business to a diversified neuroscience organization, now focused on rare disease therapies and a revitalized pipeline.

Daniel O’Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Gilead Sciences used his session to reaffirm Gilead’s enduring leadership in HIV treatment and prevention and unveiling what he described as the most robust clinical and launch pipeline in the company’s history. He also focused on Gilead’s long-term vision to sustain HIV leadership well into the 2040s, anchored by a diversified portfolio and extended market exclusivity for cornerstone therapies.

Next wave builders

The mid-cap and small-cap companies featured during Day One include CRISPR Therapeutics, Sarepta Therapeutics, and Xenon Pharmaceuticals.

The gene therapy space has been in a tough spot for the past few years, but CRISPR Therapeutics has charted an ambitious course for 2026, underpinned by the commercial momentum of its first approved therapy, CASGEVY, and a broad clinical pipeline.

Sarepta Therapeutics presented a mission driven outlook for the year ahead. CEO Doug Ingram opened by underscoring the company’s focus on precision genetic medicine for rare diseases. The company enters 2026 from a position of both financial strength and operational momentum. It now holds leadership in precision genetic medicine with marketed products delivering over $1.86B in 2025 revenue.",https://www.evaluate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_data.png,N,,2026-01-13 21:59:45.543105

—Sarah Braner Lilly to acquire Ventyx for $1.2 billion Eli Lilly and Company will buy Ventyx Biosciences in a deal worth around $1.2 billion.","Sometimes it seems cliché to point out that the world is rife with uncertainty, but not this month.

The year began with the US military capturing Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. The consequences for Venezuela’s oil and chemical sectors have yet to play out, but it’s likely that an appreciable ramp up in oil production, which the Trump administration desires, won’t happen soon.

Iran may be a different story. Street protests have created possibly the greatest challenge to the Islamic Republic since 1979. Regime change in Iran seems possible. From an industrial perspective, such a change in that country could be more consequential than in Venezuela. Iran produces several times more oil. It is also a large petrochemical producer. And beyond Iran, the Persian Gulf region includes Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. Instability caused by a political crisis in Iran could cripple the world’s economy.

Not to be outdone, the US has been increasingly hectic. The Donald J. Trump administration has pulled out of more than 60 international organizations, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And Trump’s Department of Justice is investigating the Federal Reserve chairman, a move that is being interpreted as an escalation of a row over interest rates.

The life sciences world presents its own confusion. Thankfully, to help sort that out, C&EN life sciences reporter Rowan Walrath is attending the JP Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco this week and has filed a report.

The overthrow of Venezuelan president Maduro could lead to a turnaround in that country’s energy sector, but a chemical resurgence will have to wait.

Business in brief

BASF starts Zhanjiang ethylene plant

BASF has hit a milestone at its integrated chemical complex in Zhanjiang, China, with the start-up of the site’s ethylene cracker. The plant has about 1 million metric tons per year of ethylene capacity and will supply raw materials to new ethylene oxide and polyethylene plants. The company boasts that it is the world’s first cracker to use entirely renewable energy to power its main compressors. The site, which will cost about €10.0 billion ($11.7 billion) to complete, will be the third-largest of the company’s Verbund, or integrated, sites, after Ludwigshafen, Germany, and Antwerp, Belgium.

Unigel to shut down Brazilian styrene plant

Blaming an oversupplied market, the Brazilian chemical maker Unigel Participações is suspending operations at a styrene and toluene plant in Cubatão, Brazil. The site has annual capacity to make 120,000 metric tons of styrene. Unigel also operates a larger styrene plant in Camaçari, Brazil, and polystyrene plants in Guarujá and São José dos Campos, Brazil. “The Company’s decisions were taken in the context of an unprecedented downturn cycle in the global chemical industry, marked by a significant oversupply of petrochemical commodities, which has intensified since 2023 due to the expansion of international production capacity, particularly in Asia,” Unigel says in a statement (PDF). The firm says it is preserving the facilities in the event that conditions are one day right to restart operations. Unigel filed for bankruptcy in São Paulo last October.

Invista to close 2 plants in new overhaul

Invista is closing its plants in Martinsville, Virginia, and Gloucester, England, as part of the polymer company’s latest streamlining. At Gloucester, Invista makes high-tenacity nylon 6,6 fiber for applications like automotive airbags, sewing threads, and high-strength fabrics. It will transition production to its plant in Kingston, Ontario. The company operates a machine shop in Martinsville. Some 150 jobs will be affected by the closures. Invista says it is considering expanding its site in Shanghai. Last year, the company elected to keep its nylon fiber business after evaluating strategic options for the unit. In September, the company said it was closing its site in Maitland, Ontario, where it had made specialty chemicals and nylon precursors.

Verdant acquires Lubrizol oil drilling chemical site in Texas

Verdant Specialty Solutions has acquired a Lubrizol facility in Elmendorf, Texas, that produces chemicals used in oil and gas drilling and processing, including hydrogen sulfide scavengers, scale inhibitors, and corrosion inhibitors. The site includes a research and development laboratory, application testing capabilities, and pilot-scale facilities, Verdant says in an announcement of the deal. Lubrizol obtained the facility in 2014 when it acquired Weatherford International’s oil field chemical business. Lubrizol divested other parts of that business a few years later but held onto the Elmendorf plant. Verdant was formed in 2021 after the private equity firm OpenGate Capital bought Solvay’s amphoteric surfactant business. The South Korean firm Samyang Holdings acquired Verdant 2 years later.

Tsubame starts up low-pressure ammonia plant in Japan

The Japanese start-up Tsubame BHB says it has begun trials at a small commercial facility that produces ammonia in a low-temperature, low-pressure process. The Haber-Bosch process used to produce almost all ammonia today operates at high temperatures and pressures. Tsubame, a 2017 spin-off from Tokyo Institute of Technology, uses an electride catalyst technology that involves ruthenium nanoparticles. The pilot plant, capable of producing 500 metric tons of ammonia per year, was built on an Inpex site in Japan. The ammonia raw material hydrogen is also produced at that site by reforming natural gas and capturing by-product carbon dioxide.

Syensqo and Axens form solid-state battery joint venture

The specialty chemical maker Syensqo and the chemical engineering firm Axens have launched a joint venture called Argylium to commercialize sulfide-based solid-state battery electrolytes in Europe. Firms working on solid electrolytes say that the class of materials is safer and more energy dense, and can charge faster than today’s cells, which rely on liquid electrolytes. Synesqo is bringing the chemistry to the partnership. The firm, the former specialties business of the chemical maker Solvay, has been working on solid sulfide electrolytes for more than 10 years and is already producing batteries with the technology on a pilot scale at its facilities in France. Axens, meanwhile, will provide its expertise in process scale-up, the firms say.

Critical Metals starts construction on Greenland rare earth project

The specialty mining company Critical Metals has begun building a facility in Greenland that will extract rare earth elements. The first steps are a pilot plant and storage facility in Qaqortoq, a town near the southern tip of the Danish territory. The firm’s contractor, 60° North Greenlands, is scheduled to have the buildings ready to receive production equipment by May. Rare earth elements are critical for the production of high-strength magnets and electronics used in electric vehicles, weapon systems, and a wide range of other civilian and military applications. The island’s rare earth resources are a central element in a current transatlantic crisis created by US president Donald J. Trump. Just hours after the US military captured the president of Venezuela on Jan. 3, Trump began demanding that Denmark turn Greenland over to the US and threatened to take it by military force. On Sunday, he told reporters that “one way or the other, we’re going to have Greenland.”

LNP maker and RNA firm team up

Vancouver-based lipid nanoparticle (LNP) firm Acuitas Therapeutics has acquired a majority stake in the Montreal firm RNA Technologies & Therapeutics (RNA T&T), which was founded in 2022 for the design and small-to-midscale production of RNA. But RNA needs a fatty delivery vehicle to get it where it needs to go. An Acuitas LNP technology delivered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, for example. The companies say they have collaborated since RNA T&T launched and that the new deal will speed up the optimization of RNA payload and LNP carrier for a variety of therapeutics. But while the deal will allow third parties to easily engage experts from both companies to develop next-generation RNA-LNP therapies, the firms will continue to operate independently.

Lilly to acquire Ventyx for $1.2 billion

Eli Lilly and Company will buy Ventyx Biosciences in a deal worth around $1.2 billion. Ventyx develops small-molecule therapeutics for inflammatory conditions, such as NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors. It takes a wide view of inflammation, approaching the process as a driver of disease across the cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurological arenas, among others. Ventyx has two NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor candidates in clinical trials. It also has two non-NLRP3 candidates for inflammatory bowel disease in clinical trials, including its most advanced candidate, tamuzimod.

Literary impossible due to Nvidia software lock-in. Intel could came out with cards that are faster and cheaper and they'd still barely sell any due to the fact that Nvidia has the entire software ecosystem wrapped around their finger. This isn't the CPU market where you can make a better product and start gaining marketshare (and even in the CPU market Intel still owns a majority of the market thanks to it's leverage of OEMs to unfairly hamper AMD in sections of the market).

Quick Insights

Goldman Sachs expects IBM to guide for modest organic revenue acceleration in 2026, with estimated constant currency growth of 4.4% ($70.3bn), and to target over $15.0bn in free cash flow and EPS of $11.50.

Investors and analysts expect the acquisition of Confluent to drive continued double-digit Software growth, particularly in Red Hat, making Software a major focus in 2026.

Enterprise IT budgets will be affected by ongoing tariffs, changing government policies, and AI disruption, leading to continued rationalization of discretionary IT spending despite stabilizing fundamentals.

(See list of top 15 brands topping their category below.)

“This year marks an historic moment,” said Passikoff.

“Expectations are rising faster than brands are improving. Consumers want more from brands across every touchpoint, and they reward brands that deliver,” he added. “Long-time loyalty leaders are being challenged by brands that better anticipate and deliver what matters most to consumers.”

These leaders are proving that loyalty is the most powerful driver of profitability. Loyal shoppers are also leading to operation cost savings and higher profitability, according to the report. For example, retention costs remain 17–25 times lower than acquisition costs – a 26% increase since 1997.

A 5% increase in loyalty can now yield up to 88% higher lifetime profits per customer, and a 2% rise in loyalty can deliver as much as a 29% reduction in across-the-board marketing and operational costs, the survey said.

“These dynamics are why loyalty’s correlation with market share remains so strong – 0.87,” said Passikoff. “Loyal customers are six times more likely to engage, repurchase, and amplify brand messaging. The bottom line: loyalty moves markets.”

Barclays ( (GB:BARC) ) has provided an update.

Barclays PLC has continued executing its share buy-back programme, repurchasing 2,544,993 ordinary shares on 12 January 2026 on the London Stock Exchange from Citigroup Global Markets Limited, at a volume-weighted average price of 471.5139 pence per share, with all repurchased shares to be cancelled. Following this latest cancellation, Barclays’ issued share capital will comprise 13,850,049,563 ordinary shares with voting rights and no treasury shares, and since the buy-back began on 23 October 2025 the bank has acquired a total of 68,077,008 shares, a move that reduces share count and may enhance earnings per share while clarifying the denominator for regulatory disclosure thresholds for investors.

The 43-year-old software powerhouse helped define the creative economy with legacy products like Photoshop, Illustrator and Acrobat – and successfully reinvented itself as a subscription-based SaaS leader with its Creative Cloud and Document Cloud businesses.

Yet, the stock tells a more complicated story, with shares down 24% over the past 12 months and currently trading at a 52-week low. The pressure has come from several fronts, including decelerating Digital Media growth, uncertainty around how quickly AI features can reaccelerate revenue, and a broader cooling in investor appetite for large-cap software names as interest rates stayed higher for longer.

Adding fuel to the fire, ADBE tumbled about 6% today after Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz downgraded the stock from Outperform (i.e., Buy) to Perform (i.e., Neutral). (To watch Schwartz’s track record, click here)

Schwartz acknowledged that Adobe remains a strong company, calling it “well entrenched in its customers’ digital creative landscape” with “best-of-breed” products and a growing AI-first business. However, the analyst made it clear that expectations had gotten ahead of reality. The AI-driven rebound in Digital Media growth that he had anticipated “did not play out,” with growth decelerating further over the past year.

One of the key concerns is a lack of near-term catalysts. According to Schwartz, Adobe is likely to see a slower recovery in investor sentiment than other large software peers, partly because pricing power appears to be weakening during the AI transition. The analyst also flagged softer confidence in management based on investor conversations, noting reduced messaging and visibility around long-term targets.

Competition is another growing headache. Schwartz argued that the AI transition has actually weakened Adobe’s moat, as generative AI tools increase the speed of content creation while compressing pricing and intensifying competition. New rivals range from large language model providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic to major platforms like Meta and Google, as well as design-focused players like Canva and Figma. In his view, this dynamic risks pushing Adobe toward sub-10% revenue growth in 2026, alongside down-year operating margins.

Finally, sentiment itself has become a headwind. Adobe’s market cap has shrunk sharply over the past year, and Schwartz warned it will be difficult to rebuild investor confidence unless the company delivers faster Digital Media growth, expanding margins, meaningfully higher capital returns, or a clear improvement in sentiment around the name.

So, that’s Oppenheimer’s view. The broader Street, however, is striking a more constructive tone on Adobe. With 16 Buys, 7 Holds, and just 1 Sell, ADBE earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Moreover, the average price target of $454.52 points to ~47% upside over the next 12 months. (See ADBE stock analysis)

According to Martha, around 16 million patients in the US suffer from the condition.
“Roughly a 1% penetration of this five million patient pool represents a $1bn revenue opportunity for the company,” Martha said.
The deal, for which the terms were not publicly disclosed, will imbue Boston with the California-based company’s eCoin ITNS system for UUI treatment, thereby establishing Boston as a competitor to Medtronic in this space.
""JPM26: Medtronic touts billion-dollar market opportunity for Altaviva"" was originally created and published by Medical Device Network, a GlobalData owned brand.","Medtronic CEO Geoff Martha has emphasised the strong interest levels and market potential for its Altaviva device for urge urinary incontinence (UUI) treatment.

Martha spoke during a wide-ranging presentation outlining the company’s competencies and ongoing focuses at this year’s J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.

Receiving US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in September 2025, Altaviva is an implantable tibial nerve stimulation (ITNS) that delivers neuromodulation via a small device positioned above the tibial nerve to provide treatment for patients suffering from UUI. According to Martha, around 16 million patients in the US suffer from the condition. Of this patient population, Martha claimed that five million are actively seeking treatment.

“Roughly a 1% penetration of this five million patient pool represents a $1bn revenue opportunity for the company,” Martha said.

Martha went on to highlight that Medtronic is focused on driving Altavita’s adoption with education and awareness initiatives and revealed that Altaviva has seen “significant engagement” and interest since receiving FDA approval.

“Just four months post approval, over 500 physicians have been trained [on applying Altavita],” Martha said.

Noting that the training takes place in-person, opposed to virtually, Martha added that this training requires a significant time commitment – a factor that reflects the interest levels towards Altaviva and represents a “good leading indicator” towards the device’s future potential.

“We’re also planning to launch a direct to consumer awareness initiative to reach the five million patients I mentioned, as well as the balance of the 16 million who just aren't quite comfortable in seeking care for UUI,” Martha added. “But this will come. The stigma is breaking down.”

On 12 January, Boston Scientific announced plans to acquire Valencia Technologies. The deal, for which the terms were not publicly disclosed, will imbue Boston with the California-based company’s eCoin ITNS system for UUI treatment, thereby establishing Boston as a competitor to Medtronic in this space.

Martha also used his presentation at the J.P. Morgan conference to highlight that several of the key markets that Medtronic targets, including pulsed-field ablation (PFA) and renal denervation, have the potential to become multi-billion-dollar opportunities in the near future.

The reported quarter’s results excluded certain non-recurring items. Considering those, net income applicable to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $1.43 billion, up 26.3% from the year-ago quarter.

Adjusted earnings per share of $7.50 for 2025 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.39. Also, the bottom line increased 24.4% from 2024. Net income applicable to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $5.31 billion, up 22.4% from the previous year.

BK’s Revenues Improve, Expenses Rise Marginally

Total quarterly revenues increased 6.8% year over year to $5.18 billion. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.12 billion.

For 2025, total revenues were $20.08 billion, up 7.8% year over year. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20 billion.

Quarterly NII was $1.35 billion, up 12.7% year over year. The rise reflected the continued reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by deposit margin compression.

The net interest margin expanded 6 basis points (bps) year over year to 1.38%.

Total fee and other revenues increased 4.9% year over year to $3.83 billion. The rise was driven by an increase in investment services fees.

Total non-interest expenses (GAAP basis) were $3.36 billion, up marginally from the prior-year quarter. The rise was due to an increase in software and equipment costs; costs related to professional, legal and other purchased services; sub-custodian and clearing costs; and business development costs.

BNY’s Asset Balances Increase

As of Dec. 31, 2025, AUM was $2.2 trillion, up 7% year over year. The rise reflected higher market values and the favorable impact of the weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by cumulative net outflows.

AUC/A of $59.3 trillion increased 13.8% year over year, primarily reflecting client inflows, higher market values and the favorable impact of the weaker U.S. dollar.

BK’s Credit Quality Improves

The allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of total loans, was 0.30%, down 11 bps from the prior-year quarter. As of Dec. 31, 2025, non-performing assets were $143 million, down 20.1% from the year-ago quarter.

In the reported quarter, the company recorded a provision benefit of $26 million, primarily driven by improvements in commercial real estate exposure and changes in the macroeconomic forecast. In the prior-year quarter, provisions were $20 million.

BNY’s Capital Position Improves

As of Dec. 31, 2025, the common equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.9%, up from 11.2% as of Dec. 31, 2024. The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6%, up from 5.7% as of Dec. 31, 2024.

BK’s Share Repurchase Update

In the reported quarter, BNY repurchased shares worth $1 billion.

Our Take on BNY

BK’s global expansion efforts and a strong balance sheet position are likely to keep supporting its top-line growth. Also, a robust AUM balance is another positive. However, concentration risk due to the company’s higher dependence on fee-based revenues and elevated expenses are worrisome.

The UMass Dartmouth GenAI Platform is an intuitive and user-friendly platform housed within UMass Dartmouth's secure infrastructure exclusively for the UMass Dartmouth community.

Access to leading generative AI models, including OpenAI (ChatGPT), Anthropic (Claude), Meta (Llama), Cohere, Mistral, and more included.

Quick start guide

Part 1: Open UMass GenAI

Go to umassd.campusgenai.org

Log in using Single Sign-On (SSO). If it’s your first time logging in, a pop-up window appears with some information.

Read through terms.

Click I Accept to continue.

Part 2: Try out some prompts!

Your default model is OpenAI, but you can change your model. For instructions on how to do so, jump to Part 3.

To use the default settings with your prompts, type a prompt into the Message field.

To submit the prompt, press the Return or Enter key. The AI model responds to your prompt.

To modify, refine, or further interact with your prompt, use the icons that follow each message. The icons represent the following advanced features:

Read aloud - A computer-generated voice reads the message out loud.

Edit - Allows you to edit your prompts and/or the responses of the various models.

Save & Submit - Saves your edit and resubmits the information to regenerate the AI's response.

Save - Saves your edit without regenerating the response.

Cancel - Closes the edit window without saving changes.

Copy to clipboard - Copies the content of the selected message to your clipboard to be pasted into another window or program.

Regenerate - Forces the model to try to create a new response without any additional context.

Fork - Creates a new conversation that starts from the specific message selected. This can be useful for refocusing the conversation, creating branching separate scenarios, preserving context, and more.

Part 3: Adjust AI models and configuration options

UMassD GenAI has several AI models available for use.

To select your preferred model, click the downwards arrows at the top of the page, next to the current model and version names.

You can also adjust and switch models in the middle of a conversation.

For example, you can start a conversation in OpenAI with the prompt ""Write an 5-sentence summary about topic A."" and then switch to the DALL-E-3 plugin to request an image to go with the summary, then switch to Anthropic and request a list of title options to go with the article.

Martha spoke during a wide-ranging presentation outlining the company’s competencies and ongoing focuses at this year’s J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.
According to Martha, around 16 million patients in the US suffer from the condition.
“Roughly a 1% penetration of this five million patient pool represents a $1bn revenue opportunity for the company,” Martha said.

Martha spoke during a wide-ranging presentation outlining the company’s competencies and ongoing focuses at this year’s J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.

Receiving US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in September 2025, Altaviva is an implantable tibial nerve stimulation (ITNS) that delivers neuromodulation via a small device positioned above the tibial nerve to provide treatment for patients suffering from UUI. According to Martha, around 16 million patients in the US suffer from the condition. Of this patient population, Martha claimed that five million are actively seeking treatment.

“Roughly a 1% penetration of this five million patient pool represents a $1bn revenue opportunity for the company,” Martha said.

Martha went on to highlight that Medtronic is focused on driving Altavita’s adoption with education and awareness initiatives and revealed that Altaviva has seen “significant engagement” and interest since receiving FDA approval.

“Just four months post approval, over 500 physicians have been trained [on applying Altavita],” Martha said.

Noting that the training takes place in-person, opposed to virtually, Martha added that this training requires a significant time commitment – a factor that reflects the interest levels towards Altaviva and represents a “good leading indicator” towards the device’s future potential.

“We’re also planning to launch a direct to consumer awareness initiative to reach the five million patients I mentioned, as well as the balance of the 16 million who just aren’t quite comfortable in seeking care for UUI,” Martha added. “But this will come. The stigma is breaking down.”

On 12 January, Boston Scientific announced plans to acquire Valencia Technologies. The deal, for which the terms were not publicly disclosed, will imbue Boston with the California-based company’s eCoin ITNS system for UUI treatment, thereby establishing Boston as a competitor to Medtronic in this space.

Martha also used his presentation at the J.P. Morgan conference to highlight that several of the key markets that Medtronic targets, including pulsed-field ablation (PFA) and renal denervation, have the potential to become multi-billion-dollar opportunities in the near future.",https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2026/01/shutterstock_1528056221-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 14:02:51.192681

A new book from FINN Partners chair global health and purpose Gil Bashe call for leaders across the health, life sciences, technology and policy ecosystems to rethink how care is designed, delivered and experienced. Healing the Sick Care System: Why People Matter (coming out February 1 from Thought Leader Press), says that the current system is not broken because it lacks innovation, talent or investment, but because it has lost sight of the people it exists to serve.

The book draws on Bashe’s experiences in battlefield medicine, health policy, patient advocacy, private equity, and global agency leadership to provide a perspective from the inside out on why well-intentioned systems increasingly fail patients and physicians alike.

“In a time when medicine grows more complex by the day, this book powerfully reaffirms the physician’s role as a trusted partner in every person’s health journey,” said John Whyte, MD, MPH, CEO and executive vice president, American Medical Association. “Gil Bashe reminds us that healing begins with listening, collaboration and compassion. His insights champion a system where health professionals and patients work side by side to achieve better outcomes and a better care experience,”

Here, Bashe lays out the roots of the problems that he sees as keeping the human element out of healthcare:

***

''HOUSTON, we have a problem.""

Launched on April 11, 1970, Apollo 13 was to have been NASA's third lunar landing. Two days into the mission, an oxygen tank exploded, forcing the crew to abandon their plans to walk on the moon and focus on new goals: survival and return to Earth. The explosion crippled their capsule, but critically, it did not silence the radio connection. Because of the open link with Mission Control, the crew was able to assess and solve their problems and develop a plan to bring their command module safely home.

Were it not for that communication system, astronauts Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Raise would have tragically perished far from home. Instead, they lived because they were able to talk through their challenges, collaborating with the experts at NASA Mission Con-trol. More than the successes of earlier lunar missions, it was the agency's defining moment, an illustration of why the American space program was so great.

If NASA had operated like today's U.S. health system, Apollo 13 would have ended in tragedy. The experts on the ground would have been trapped in siloed organizations, unable to share information. Even if they had managed to communicate and find a solution, they would have needed ""prior authorization"" from a faceless administrator before acting. By then, the capsule would have burned up on reentry. The same maze of complexity that patients struggle to navigate and that crushes the spirit of health professionals would have doomed three astronauts.

Healthcare, we have a problem.

I first grasped that truth not as a soldier or CEO, but as a child. My uncle had just returned from the Army, and our family gathered to celebrate. Driving us home, he steered through a green light when another car ran a red and slammed into us broadside. I was wedged in the front seat between my uncle and grandmother, my grandfather sitting in the back. In those days before seatbelts, the force of the crash hurled us forward.

I remember sirens, ambulances, and fire trucks. I re-member my grandparents on gurneys in the ER, doctors and nurses rushing forward to care for them. What I do not remember is paperwork, insurance cards, or bureaucracy. Healers were fully engaged, urgent, and present. That was the 1960s.

The contrast with today is unavoidable. Too often, passions are buried under paperwork, metrics, and administrative demands. The system prizes compliance over compassion and process over purpose. Have we lost sight of what matters most: the instinct to heal those who need healing?

This question has defined my life. In my younger years, I was both a paratrooper and a combat medic, driven by a sense of purpose and propelled by urgency. My mission was clear: to help my friends and unit survive. On the battlefield, every decision carried life-and-death consequences. I learned quickly to act under pressure, improvise with limited resources, and never lose sight of the human being in front of me, whether friend or foe.

Years later, I traded the battlefield for the boardroom, but the mission did not change; it simply evolved. I launched and rebuilt health PR agencies, led a global turnaround, served as a private equity portfolio company CEO, and lobbied on behalf of health innovation companies. Each role sharpened my ability to navigate complexity while keeping people at the center. Today, as Chair Health and Purpose at FINN Partners, a purpose-centered global communication agency, I continue to carry the same lesson from combat medicine: communication and clarity save lives.

Despite the earnings beat, Bank of New York Mellon’s stock fell by 1.48% in pre-market trading, reaching $118.87. This decline might be attributed to broader market trends or investor concerns about future growth prospects. The stock remains within its 52-week range, which saw a high of $122.84 and a low of $70.46.

Outlook & Guidance

Looking forward, Bank of New York Mellon has set a 2026 total revenue growth target of approximately 5% and an expense growth target of 3-4%. The company aims to increase its pre-tax margin to 38% and return on tangible common equity to 28%. These targets reflect the company’s confidence in maintaining positive operating leverage and capitalizing on emerging market trends.

Conference Call Operator: Good morning and welcome to the 2025 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY’s consent. I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Marius Merz, Head of Investor Relations, BNY: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. I’m here with Robin Vince, our CEO, and Dermot McDonogh, our CFO. As always, we will reference our Quarterly Update presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bny.com, and I’ll note that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures is available in the earnings press release, financial supplement, and Quarterly Update presentation, all of which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, January 13, 2026, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin.

Robin Vince, CEO, BNY: Thanks, Marius. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I’ll begin with a strategic update, and then Dermot will take you through our financial performance in the fourth quarter, our outlook for 2026, and our increased targets for the medium term as we look ahead toward the next phase on our journey to unlock BNY’s full potential over the long term. Starting on page three of our Quarterly Update presentation, 2025 was another successful year for BNY. In short, we delivered record net income of $5.3 billion on record revenue of $20.1 billion and generated a return on tangible common equity of 26%. Total revenue grew by 8% year over year. In combination with expense growth of 3%, we drove 507 basis points of positive operating leverage on a reported basis and 411 basis points excluding notable items, resulting in an improved pre-tax margin of 35%.

Consistent execution delivered four consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage in 2025, bringing us to eight consecutive quarters overall. Taken together, we grew earnings per share by 28% year over year to $7.40 and returned $5 billion of capital to our shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases. This strong financial performance was the output of our work to reimagine BNY and was enabled by tangible progress across strategic priorities over the past year, which we highlight in the four boxes on slide four. First, our commercial model is working. Operating as one BNY, we are starting to bring the full breadth of the company together to deliver more products and services to meet our clients’ needs.

This includes embedding sales practices and behaviors that enable our teams to deliver more and better for clients with greater consistency to drive deeper relationships with existing clients and open the door to new ones. We achieved record sales performance for the year, and we announced several noteworthy wins in the fourth quarter. Further deepening our relationship, WisdomTree selected BNY as their banking-as-a-service provider for the WisdomTree Prime platform. This solution brings together banking, payments, custody, and digital assets to support the growth of WisdomTree’s new retail distribution model and its strategy on being a leading digital asset forward investment manager. Jupiter, an active asset manager, selected BNY for a suite of capabilities from front to back, from investment operations and data management all the way through to custody, streamlining their operating platform and positioning them for the future.

Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund selected BNY to deliver integrated data and analytics for private markets. This solution aims to help them manage complexity, enhance transparency, and improve decision-making across their growing alternative investments portfolio. Second, we continued to make progress in unlocking the scale and growth potential of our platforms by transitioning approximately half of our people into the platform’s operating model over the course of 2025, which brings us to more than 70% of our people working in the model today. This initiative has been a core component of rewiring BNY to make us more agile and intentional in how we deliver to clients, but forms part of a larger collection of initiatives that are at the heart of running our company in a fundamentally different way. Third, in 2025, we made significant advances in the adoption of AI, underscoring our industry leadership in this burgeoning space.

Built upon very deliberate investments over the past several years, our enterprise AI platform, Eliza, is unlocking capacity for our people, allowing them to focus on higher-value work for our clients. We recently announced a collaboration with Google Cloud to integrate Gemini Enterprise capabilities into our Eliza platform, enhancing our ability to support deep research, analysis, and data-intensive workflows across the company, building on existing collaborations with OpenAI and others. These collaborations underscore our commitment to deploying AI responsibly and at scale. We expect that over time, AI will allow us to remake many of our processes and systems in new and exciting ways, and that together with embedding AI in our products and services represents a significant opportunity for our company in the years ahead.

Fourth, BNY has a rich 241-year history of innovation, from issuing the first loan to the U.S. government to becoming the first U.S. GSIB to offer digital asset custody. Our focus on innovating new products and solutions is centered on building trusted market infrastructure for the long term and serving our clients in new and evolving ways, including increasing delivery of new capabilities connecting the traditional and digital asset worlds. This past quarter, for example, we launched the Dreyfus Stablecoin Reserves Fund, a government money market fund designed to support stablecoin issuers and institutional participants to manage eligible reserve assets, providing BNY’s cash and liquidity solutions expertise to the growing digital payments ecosystem. Our recently announced tokenized AAA CLO strategy in partnership with Securitize brings high-rated structured credit product onto the blockchain, with BNY serving as sub-advisor and custodian of the underlying assets.

And just last week, we announced that we have taken the first step in our strategy to tokenize deposits by enabling the on-chain mirrored representation of client deposit balances on our digital assets platform. As we reflect on the scope of our market-leading businesses, our central position as a provider of financial market infrastructure, and the depth and breadth of our client relationships, traditional and digitally native, we believe that we are particularly well-positioned to advance the future of financial markets. From the very beginning of our work three years ago, we have taken a long-term view toward unlocking BNY’s full opportunity as a financial services platforms company, with a commitment to disciplined execution and sustained value creation for our clients and shareholders over time. I’m going to touch briefly on some of the work that has brought us here, described on page five of our presentation.

Two years ago, we communicated our strategic roadmap and a set of medium-term financial targets for what we viewed as the first foundation-setting phase in a multi-year transformation of BNY. While there are elements of that work that will continue well into the future, we consider that this is the right moment to begin to turn the page toward our next phase. But before we get to that, I’ll take the opportunity to reflect on our efforts, the impact that we’ve seen across our businesses and operations, and how this has started to translate into improved financial performance. As we embarked on the journey, we recognized early on that we had to work across several fronts at the same time, simplifying how we operate, improving execution, and delivering for our clients, and that how we did it as a team was essential to creating deep and enduring change.

Thorough strategic and financial business reviews demonstrated to us the powerful combination of capabilities within BNY. We are the number one custodian in the world and the number one collateral manager, the leading provider of issuer services, and the primary settlement agent for U.S. government securities. We operate a top-tier payments and liquidity franchise and offer our clients leading investments and wealth capabilities. Individually, these are market-leading businesses. Together, they represent a set of highly adjacent financial services platforms operating at the center of global financial markets, difficult to replicate at scale and increasingly valuable to our clients. To organize the company around execution, we deliberately framed our work across three simple elements of strategy, which we continue to focus on.

The first was clients, to be more for them, to deliver more of our existing products to our existing clients, to add new clients, to add new products, and to meet clients where they are with solutions tailored to their needs and responsive to market trends and opportunities. The second was on how we run our company. We knew we could do that better, simplifying, improving financial discipline, breaking down barriers, challenging the status quo, and reimagining our operating model as a platforms company. The third was culture. Simple to say, hard to do, but magical when it works. A collective sense of ownership, teamwork, and accountability all coming together to bring the other two key strategic pillars to life. This spirit of ownership and accountability is at the heart of our delivery.

It was important to us to build credibility and momentum through consistent execution toward better business and operational performance, some examples of which you can see on slide six. What has been and continues to be the single most compelling growth opportunity for BNY is doing more business with our existing clients. In 2024, we launched our new commercial model, designed to encourage our sales and service teams to raise their ambition, equip them with new tools, and to enable our people to deliver solutions from across BNY, leveraging the full breadth of our platforms. Over the last two years, the number of clients buying three or more of our services increased by more than 60%, and organic fee growth has climbed to 3%, reflecting good progress with even greater opportunity ahead.

In combination with stronger organic growth, we took steady, deliberate actions to reduce sensitivity to interest rates, driving more resilient top-line revenue growth in a range of macroeconomic environments. At the same time, our ongoing transition and increasing maturity in the platforms operating model is reducing friction and driving further productivity improvements. For example, investments in digitization and automation have meaningfully lowered the unit cost for processes like striking a NAV and settling a trade, and our people are building innovative AI solutions that we expect over time will have a meaningful impact across the company. We’re proud that in 2025 alone, we deployed over 130 digital employees, industry-leading multi-agentic AI capabilities. Our digital employees work alongside our people, supporting them with tasks like validating payment details and remediating code vulnerabilities, allowing teams to focus on higher-value work and client outcomes.

Taken together, these metrics give glimpses into the how of our execution, milestones and examples, not endpoints, but helpful indicators that our strategy is working and that there continues to be meaningful opportunity ahead. Turning to slide 7. By centering the company on positive operating leverage as our north star, we created a clear, intuitive framework for our teams to execute on. The cumulative impact of our steady improvement year after year, while capitalizing on a relatively supportive market backdrop, has resulted in a meaningful improvement in BNY’s financial performance over the last few years. More consistent revenue growth and deliberate expense management have resulted in positive operating leverage, margin expansion, and improved profitability, together driving double-digit annual earnings per share growth. Turning to slide 8.

When compared to BNY’s financial performance over the prior decade, we can see the difference that consistent discipline, clear intent, and sustained execution make over time. More resilient top-line revenue growth has started to build, and better control of our expense base has allowed us to continue to self-fund important investments in future growth. While we’re encouraged by this progress, we are not satisfied. Our work is far from complete. We remain humble and intensely focused on the opportunity ahead. To that point, I’ll wrap up on slide nine with where we are headed next.

With the foundations largely in place and more of the people in their seats to help us execute, the next phase of our journey to unlock BNY’s potential is about realizing scale and growth opportunities across our company as we mature in our new commercial and platform models, unlock capacity using AI, and in so doing, serve our clients in new and better ways, enabling the global financial markets and infrastructure of the future. Taken together, our focus for 2026 and over the medium term represents an exciting shift built on the work done over the past three years to enable higher growth and deliver on the competitive advantages embedded in BNY as we remain steadfast in our commitment to create value for you, our investors. I want to thank our teams around the world for their dedication to our clients and their commitment to reimagining our company.

We are entering 2026 with positive momentum, and we are excited for the work ahead of us. With that, I’ll turn it over to Dermot to take you through the financials for the quarter in greater detail before reviewing our outlook for 2026 and our next set of milestones. Dermot. Thank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. I’m picking up on page 12 of the presentation with our results for the fourth quarter. Total revenue of $5.2 billion was up 7% year over year. Fee revenue was up 5%. This included 8% growth in investment services fees, primarily driven by net new business, higher market values, and higher client activity. Investment management and performance fees were flat, as growth primarily resulting from higher market values was offset by the impact of the mix of AUM flows and the adjustment for certain rebates we discussed in prior quarters.

Firmwide AUCA of $59.3 trillion increased by 14% year over year, reflecting client inflows, higher market values, and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Assets under management of $2.2 trillion were up 7%, reflecting higher market values and the weaker dollar, partially offset by cumulative net outflows. Investment in other revenue was $135 million in the quarter, including $43 million of other investment losses and $15 million of net securities losses. Net interest income increased by 13% year over year, primarily reflecting the continued reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.4 billion were flat year over year on a reported basis and up 4% excluding notable items. This reflects higher investments and revenue-related expenses, employee merit increases, and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar, partially offset by efficiency savings.

Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $26 million in the quarter, primarily driven by improvements in commercial real estate exposure and changes in the macroeconomic forecast. Pre-tax margin was 36% on a reported basis and 37% excluding notable items, and return on tangible common equity was 27%. Taken together, we reported earnings per share of $2.02, up 31% year over year, and excluding notable items, earnings per share were $2.08, up 21%. Robin touched on our results for the full year earlier, but turning to page 13, I’d like to expand on some of the most important items. We grew total revenue by 8% year over year to a record $20.1 billion for the full year of 2025. Fee revenue was up 6%. We grew investment services fees by 8%, primarily driven by net new business, higher market values, and client activity.

Investment management and performance fees were down 2%, reflecting the mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees, partially offset by higher market values and the weaker dollar. Net interest income was up 15%, primarily driven by the reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $13.1 billion were up 3% both on a reported and an operating basis. Excluding the impact of notable items, the increase reflects higher investments, employee merit increases, higher revenue-related expenses, and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar, partially offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax margin was 35% on a reported basis and 36% excluding notable items, and return on tangible common equity was 26% for the year. As Robin noted earlier, we reported earnings per share of $7.40. Excluding notable items, earnings per share were $7.50, up 24% year over year.

On to capital and liquidity on page 14. Our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for the quarter was 6%, down 9 basis points sequentially. Average assets increased by 3% on the back of deposit growth, and Tier 1 capital increased by $439 million, driven by capital generated through earnings and a net increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by capital returns through common stock repurchases and dividends. Our CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.9%, up 17 basis points sequentially. Over the course of the fourth quarter, we returned $1.4 billion of capital to our shareholders, representing a total payout ratio of 100%. Our consolidated Liquidity Coverage Ratio, as well as the consolidated Net Stable Funding Ratio, remained unchanged at 112% and 130%, respectively. Next, Net Interest Income and balance sheet trends on page 15.

Net interest income of $1.3 billion was up 13% year over year and up 9% quarter over quarter. Like the year-over-year increase discussed earlier, the sequential increase was primarily driven by the continued reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Average deposit balances increased by 4% sequentially, reflecting 4% growth in interest-bearing and 1% growth in non-interest-bearing deposits. Average interest-earning assets were up 3% quarter over quarter. Cash and reverse repo balances increased by 4%, loans increased by 5%, and investment securities portfolio balances increased by 2%. Turning to our business segments starting on page 16. Security services reported total revenue of $2.5 billion, up 7% year over year. Total investment services fees were up 11%. In asset servicing, investment services fees grew by 11%, primarily reflecting higher client activity and higher market values.

Asset servicing continues to show strong momentum as clients increasingly access the breadth of capabilities across our platforms to help them evolve their operating models. Sales wins over the course of the year showed broad-based growth across products and segments, with particular strength in custody and with alternative asset managers, banks, and broker-dealers, a testament to our targeted investments in the fastest-growing segments of the market. ETF AUCA of $3.8 trillion ended the year up 34% year over year, reflecting growth from the more than 2,500 funds serviced on our platform, which was up 22% year over year. Alternatives AUCA were up 10% year over year, including double-digit growth in private markets. We continue to invest in capabilities to support our clients’ growth, including in retail alternatives with solutions spanning custody, fund services, corporate trust, FX, and hedging.

Broadly speaking, approximately half of all asset servicing wins this past year represented multi-line-of-business solutions, reflecting the growing effectiveness of our new commercial model and client demand for consolidating with trusted partners. In issuer services, investment services fees were up 12%, primarily driven by higher client activity in depository receipts, and in our corporate trust business, we’re pleased with the momentum across our franchise and see significant multi-line-of-business opportunities ahead, especially with corporate and municipal clients. We maintained our number one position in conventional debt servicing, and in CLOs and munis, where we hold number two positions, we increased our market shares by 4 and 3 percentage points year over year, respectively. In security services overall, foreign exchange revenue was down 3% year over year, reflecting lower spreads on the back of lower volatility, partially offset by higher client volumes.

Net interest income for the segment was up 8% year over year. Segment expenses of $1.7 billion were flat year over year, reflecting higher investments and revenue-related expenses, employee merit increases, and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar, offset by efficiency savings and lower litigation reserves. Security services reported pre-tax income of $838 million at a 30% increase year over year and a pre-tax margin of 34%. It is worth highlighting that for the full year of 2025, security services reported a pre-tax margin of 33%. That was an improvement of 4 percentage points year over year and exceeded the medium-term target of equal to or greater than 30% that we established for this segment in December of 2021. Next, Markets and Wealth Services on page 17. Markets and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.8 billion, up 8% year over year. Total investment services fees were up 4%.

In Pershing, investment services fees were down 2%, reflecting client activity in the prior year quarter related to the deconversion of lost business, partially offset by higher market values. Net new assets were $51 billion in the fourth quarter, representing healthy growth from both new and existing clients. Over the course of 2025, we earned numerous wins from new $1 billion-plus wealth firms, and the business accomplished several multi-year contract renewals with key clients. Our commitment to serving multi-billion-dollar growth-minded wealth firms across a full suite of custody, clearing, lending, investment products, and wealth services is met with interest from existing and new clients. And we remain focused on capitalizing on the important opportunity to enable growth for breakaway advisors as their platform of choice.

For example, this past quarter, 71 West Capital Partners and VestGen Wealth Partners selected BNY Pershing to provide custody and clearing for their new independent full-service or RIA firms. In clearance and collateral management, investment services fees increased by 15%, reflecting broad-based growth in collateral balances and clearance volumes. Average collateral balances of $7.5 trillion increased 15% year over year, and average settlements exceeded $1 million per day in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher market activity and new clients on our platform. Against a supportive backdrop from continued issuance and demand for U.S. Treasuries, we’re focused on innovating solutions that help our clients optimize capital, meet evolving regulatory requirements, scale operational efficiency, and access market infrastructure and liquidity. In our payments and trade business, previously called Treasury Services, investment services fees were up 3%, primarily reflecting net new business.

Over the course of the year, this business has shown strong performance on the back of broad-based growth across products and regions. Solid growth and sales wins over the course of the year, enabled by our strategic investments in capabilities and talent, give us good momentum into 2026. Net interest income for the segment overall was up 20% year over year. Segment expense of $930 million were up 9% year over year, reflecting higher investments and revenue-related expenses, employee merit increases, and higher severance expense, partially offset by efficiency savings. Taken together, our Markets and Wealth Services segment reported pre-tax income of $882 million, up 9% year over year, and achieved a pre-tax margin of 49%. Turning to investment and wealth management on page 18. Investment and wealth management reported total revenue of $854 million, down 2% year over year.

Investment management fees were up 1%, driven by higher market values and the favorable impact of the weaker dollar, partially offset by the impact of the mix of AUM flows and the adjustment for certain rebates, which I mentioned before. Segment expenses of $703 million were flat year over year, as the impact of higher investments and the weaker dollar was offset by efficiency savings. Investment and wealth management reported pre-tax income of $148 million, down 14% year over year, and a pre-tax margin of 17%. As I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $2.2 trillion increased by 7% year over year. In the fourth quarter, we saw net outflows of $3 billion, including $23 billion of net outflows from long-term strategies and $20 billion of net inflows into cash. Wealth management client assets of $350 billion increased by 7% year over year, reflecting higher market values.

Over the past year, we’ve worked hard to bring our investment and wealth management business closer to our other BNY platforms, streamline operations, and build towards stronger top-line growth, including by making several key strategic hires. We expect that 2026 will be the year in which this work will start to translate into improved financial performance. I’ll close with our financial outlook. Page 21 shows the current expectations for 2026. Notwithstanding a very dynamic operating environment, positive operating leverage continues to be our North Star, and so we have set ourselves up for another year of more than 100 basis points of positive operating leverage in 2026. This reflects our current expectation for total revenue, excluding notable items, to grow by approximately 5% year over year in 2026, market dependent, and accordingly, a plan for approximately 3%-4% growth in expenses, excluding notable items.

Specific to the first quarter, I would like to remind you that staff expenses are typically elevated due to long-term incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees, and on taxes, I’d like to note that over the course of 2026, we expect a quarterly tax rate of approximately 23%, with the exception of the first quarter, in which we currently expect to see a tax benefit from the annual vesting of stock awards. Finally, turning to page 22 for our outlook for the medium term. Two years ago, we communicated our first set of medium-term financial targets, which were to improve BNY’s pre-tax margin to equal to or greater than 33%, and our return on tangible common equity to equal to or greater than 23%, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Today, we are raising the bar.

We are increasing our pre-tax margin target by 500 basis points to 38%, and we are increasing our return on tangible common equity target also by 500 basis points to 28%. These new medium-term financial targets represent the next milestones on our path to unlocking BNY’s full potential over the long term. What remains unchanged is our commitment to prudent balance sheet management, and with it, our philosophy for capital deployment and distributions. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio management target remains unchanged at 5.5%-6%, and we will continue to manage ourselves conservatively to the upper end of that range for the foreseeable future. Robin talked about our strategic priorities for this next phase on our multi-year transformation of BNY earlier.

These new medium-term financial targets are a reflection of our confidence in the solid foundation we’ve built over the past few years, and they demonstrate our determination to continue driving positive operating leverage as we realize greater scale and growth opportunities across our platforms. And with that, Operator, can you please open the line for Q&A? If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad now. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up question. We’ll take our first question from Ibrahim Punawalla with Bank of America. Hey, good morning. Morning, Ibrahim. Hey, Robin. I guess maybe first question for you, Dermot, on the guidance, especially when we look at the revenue growth. Just annualizing your fourth quarter NII gets you to about 9% growth on the NII side.

So if you don’t mind unpacking that a little bit around what are the assumptions underpinning that revenue growth outlook and on fees as we think about 2026. Thanks. Okay. Good morning, Ibrahim. I hope you’re well. So let me start with saying this year we’re doing it slightly differently. We finished the year with $20.1 billion of revenue, and the performance over the last three years has given us confidence to guide top-line growth. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the guide that we’re giving to you for 2026 is up 5% plus or minus year on year on the top-line revenue. Now, underneath that, you have both fees and net interest income. And I’ve said previously that Q4 is a good jumping-off point, but December was a particularly strong month for us in NII.

So the way I would think, the way you should think about NII for us this year is a little bit ahead of 5%, fees maybe a little bit lower than 5%. So all in, top-line growth up 5%. Understood. That’s helpful. And I guess maybe one bigger picture question just around as we think about these strategic targets. Maybe, Robin, your thoughts. I guess the one missing piece here is how would you want the Street to think about, I guess, the medium-term earnings growth potential for BNY? And within that construct, for whatever reason, if the revenue growth environment worsens, your level of confidence in defending the margins and the ROTCE targets that you’ve upgraded today. Thank you. Sure. So look, I’ll take it. It’s kind of got two parts. I’ll take it both parts of that.

But first of all, on the growth targets, look, we’ve said all along the positive operating leverage is our North Star, and we’ve also said that there’ll be different components to achieving that in any year. And I think it is important to note that. And that’s one of the reasons why, as Dermot just said, we’ve sort of moved to the total revenue guide because we recognize it’s sort of a compositional question. But what you should be able to hear from us, certainly in our prepared remarks, is a bit of an increased conviction inside the company about our ability to win and grow. And we’ve certainly been setting internal aggressive sales and revenue targets to be able to do that. But to your question, we’re certainly humble about the fact that we’ve got to be careful around any particular assumptions on market environment.

And this is where I come back to the fact that we’re all risk managers at heart. We’re sort of projecting out a lot of different potential scenarios. And so we take very seriously the fact that we’ve got to have levers to the extent that the markets might end up disappointing. And so we’ve created agility in our expense base. And that’s been part of our work over the course of the past three years: the platform’s operating model work, the work that we originally did around some of the efficiency savings, making choices, and the fact that we’ve now got the rhythm of saying, ""Hey, we could actually make different choices on business development expenses, compensation if needed, the investment book of work."" And so this agility is extremely important.

But I’ll just also recap with a reminder of the fact that we’ve also deliberately positioned the platforms inside the company and the whole company to trying to reduce the macro sensitivity to the world. And so you’ve seen that in NII. We actually specifically called it out in the presentation. But if you look at the different cylinders of the revenue engine of BNY: equity market values, fixed income market values, equity market transaction volumes, fixed income market volumes, government issuance, private sector issuance, capital markets activity, GDP growth, payments, software, services, execution and clearing generally, fixed income and equities. That is all very deliberately positioning ourselves to be able to be more resilient. But then, of course, to your question, to the extent that things happen, we can still react to them. That’s how I think about it together.

We’ll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Hi. As part of your new hire targets, how much does your thought about tech and AI play into that? And specifically as it relates to AI, you certainly got our attention. You have over 100 digital employees. How many of those AI digital employees do you expect to have over three to five years? And what’s the savings from them? And again, how does that play into your new hire targets? Thanks. Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Look, AI, we think, is super important. We think it’s just going to be able to be a catalyst for transformational change. We think that’s true for the world. One of the most important evolutions in a technology, frankly, in hundreds of years, is the way that we think about it.

And so given that, it’s very hard to project very clearly exactly where we’ll be one, two, three, four, five years from now. And so there’s always the risk that we haven’t properly and fully incorporated it into our medium-term targets because while we’ve thought about it, it’s hard to look into the future that clearly. But the way that we think about AI, and maybe this will be helpful therefore, is we think that the technology has already gotten to a level where it can have a very significant impact, frankly, on all of us individually and companies, and certainly here at BNY. And if that follows, then we think it follows that adoption and integration risk becoming the limiting factors. So what we’ve focused on is the real cultural side of it. Making AI for everyone, everywhere, and for everything at BNY is our mantra.

We launched our AI hub in 2023. That was just after the ChatGPT moment. We now have an enterprise AI platform, ELIZA, that’s general intelligence model agnostic, and it supports this multi-agentic functionality that underpins the digital employees that you referenced, and then we’ve put in place the resources to support that to really enable the scaling of it. That’s all of the GPU compute. We’ve got our own NVIDIA hardware and tech, but we’ve also got the collaborations with Google that I mentioned in my prepared remarks and OpenAI and others, and then the culture point, again, and you’ll see this, it sort of resonates through the whole set of transformation and rewiring concepts that we’re talking about for the company. It’s as true for AI because if AI is this great capability, it’s a superpower. It can therefore be a capacity multiplier for our people.

And so that’s what is causing our people to be able to pull AI towards them, hence the digital employees working side by side with our people. Now, it is early days. We will continue to give you mark-to-market in terms of how we’re making progress on this, but we are short-term enthusiastic, medium-term excited, and long-term believing that it will have a significant positive impact. That was helpful, so I get it. The enterprise, the Eliza scaling culture, you’re excited about it, but could you put a little bit more meat on the bones if you could? What do you have? 134 digital employees today. And what does that equate to in savings? And where do you think that number goes to? Or just a little bit more detail if you could. Hi, Mike. It’s Dermot here.

If you review the materials on page six of our financials presentation, you’ll see over the last couple of years that our headcount has trended down a little bit, but that’s not really anything to do with AI yet. We talk about, internally, AI is unlocking capacity. We don’t think about it in the narrow definition of efficiency. It’s all about growing with clients, increasing revenues, and optimizing the potential for our employees, so you have to think that over time, AI as a superpower, as Robin just said, is going to increase revenues, create capacity, and allow us to do more with existing resources, and over the last couple of years, we’ve been doing this right since the get-go in terms of enterprise-wide strategy. We’ve been quite constrained in our spending, and we’ve been very disciplined. We continue to spend more on cyber resiliency than we do on AI.

So the return for our money is very, very high from what we’re getting from the enterprise today. And so we only see upside from here. We’ll move to our next question from Ken Houston with Autonomous Research. Thanks. Good morning. Morning. Guys, I wonder if you can detail a little bit the pre-tax margin improvement, the five points. Can you go through kind of each of the businesses and talk us to how your individual business line pre-tax margin thoughts are evolving within that too? Where do we get the most juice? Okay. Thanks for the question. So if you kind of go back to 2023, we delivered an actual performance pre-tax margin of 30% and ROTCE of 22%. And back then, when we initially established the medium-term targets, we went for 33% and 23%. And now we’re going with new medium-term targets today of 38% and 28%.

So you see real progression there over the last three years. And also today, as I mentioned on the first question from Ibrahim, you see us guiding for the first time top-line revenue growth. Previously, we guided by business. You will have seen us guide four years ago on security services, and we’ve kind of surpassed that guide. And so that really speaks to the power of the BNY transformation that we’ve been doing over the last three years. We have three segments: security services. We see upside in corporate trust. We see upside in depository receipts. We feel that asset servicing over the last three years has really transformed in terms of growing revenues, taking advantage of efficiencies, and driving pre-tax margin. So that kind of disciplined focus on expenses is allowing us to better price for business to win in asset servicing.

Markets and Wealth Services is the most akin to a platform’s at scale that we have at the moment. As the rest of the firm matures in the platform operating model, the pre-tax margin there is roughly, give or take, around 50%. We would expect to grow that pie at that margin. And so the upside from there on that segment was probably a little bit muted. But in investment and wealth management, where we’ve guided 25% and we finished last year at roughly 17%, that’s where we see the most opportunity in 2026 and beyond as we kind of begin to see the green shoots of recovery in that segment come back. So BNY overall delivering for clients.

As Robin said in his prepared remarks, 64% increase in clients buying from three or more lines of business in the last three years, 10% of new logos coming to the firm last year as a percentage of sales. The clients are noticing what we’re doing and want to do more with us. Remember, there’s a compositional thing here as well, Ken, because if you think about the combination of corporate trust, depository receipts, payments, trade, CCM, and Pershing, which are kind of the platformy businesses that Dermot was talking about, that now represents about two-thirds of the PTI of the company. Three years ago, that was just 55%. There’s a bit of an averaging here given the fact that those are the segment, MWS, and the businesses, they’re actually growing the fastest inside the company. Actually, as a percentage of the whole, they’re growing.

And that’s a factor here too. Yep. Got it. And just to follow up, Dermot, on your point about how December was a strong month for NII, you guys have done a very good job kind of consistently being conservative about your NII outlook. What would you say about the fourth quarter? Was it deposit balances? Was it pricing? What were the elements that may not run rate forward relative to your exit? So Q4 really was balances held in quite nicely. And we always say that we don’t lead with deposits. And really, NII is an output as a result of franchise activity. And in Q4, we had very strong activity in our asset servicing business, which caused balances to outperform in the last few weeks of December, and that caused the outperformance.

I would just think that just as you’re continuing to push, as you mentioned just before, why wouldn’t that just be a better organic hold on just activity and overall balances? So if you kind of take balances overall, for 2026, we expect balances throughout the course to be roughly flat. Q4 is normally our strongest quarter on balances. Q3 is usually the seasonally slowest. And you would expect over the next couple of quarters to moderate down slightly. When we think about the 5% plus, it’s really around the asset side of the balance sheet where we have securities kind of rolling off, and we’re reinvesting at kind of 100-150 basis point pickup. So we’ve narrowed the range of the cone of outcomes as it relates to interest rate volatility.

Balances we expect to remain roughly in line are flat, and the pickup will come from assets rolling off into higher yielding securities. Okay. Got it. Thank you, Dermot. Appreciate it. That’s right. We’ll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Morning. So Robin, wanted to start with a question on your newly launched tokenized deposit capabilities and was really hoping you could speak to institutional demand for the offering, what has been some of the early feedback. And as the effort scales over time, how might your monetization approach differ versus some more traditional deposit gathering activities? Sure. So look, I just sort of step back from the whole thing because this really is part of the overall digital asset opportunity. We see global financial markets as transforming, moving towards more of an always-on operating model.

And we’re in the business of moving, storing, and managing money. And so we think we’re particularly well-positioned to connect the traditional and the digital rails to really be able to enable clients. And so our roadmap has really been, right from the beginning, focus on the innovation, be able to bring the capabilities online, that first with digital asset custody, stablecoin enablement. You just mentioned the tokenized deposits. And so that allows us to be able to serve both the new digital native clients, who, by the way, want the new digital services, but they also want some of the traditional services from us. So we’re enabling both with them. And it also allows us, with our existing clients, to be able to help them to be able to move into this world.

For instance, as a client might want to open up a new share class in parallel to their traditional share classes, maybe they want to open up a tokenized share class, we can do that as well. It really is these two things working in concert that we think unlocks new possibilities. We see the value of the improved efficiency, reducing friction that is real value here. When you click in, stablecoins and tokenized deposits are just two examples of all of that. Stablecoins providing the on-chain settlement currency, which is very necessary and is, frankly, because their stable value probably better than some of the other alternatives. Of course, there are choices there in the stablecoins. Tokenized deposits really improving the internal utilization of cash.

And so for a client making a deposit with us, we can actually improve the usability of that deposit. It becomes sort of programmable, if you will, and it allows that money to be able to work harder and faster for them to be able to facilitate other activities. And ultimately, might in fact create the opportunity for clients to be able to do more things with us anchored around some of those types of activities. Thanks for the fulsome response, Robin. And for my follow-up, maybe for Dermot, just on the clearance and collateral management business, you’ve delivered four consecutive years of double-digit fee growth in that area, exited this year growing 15%. Given expectations for a meaningful uptick in treasury issuance, how has that informed the outlook for the business? Is this double-digit growth rate sustainable?

What are some of the factors that could potentially derail some of the recent momentum? Great question. The way I would think about this is, as you rightly pointed out, the growth rate over the last couple of years has been quite nice to see. We would say the growth rate from here probably a little bit more modest compared to previous years. We have the treasury clearing mandate coming in, which we expect to kind of influence some of the things that go on there. In the U.S., I would say more treasury issuance, a little bit more stable than we’ve seen in the prior couple of years because, you know, volumes, etc., etc., are beginning to moderate. Where we see some of the growth opportunities is outside the U.S.

And we’ve said that on prior calls where we’re continuing to invest in new products and services around the world. So we expect to continue to grow internationally and moderate in the US. That’s great color. Thanks for taking my questions. We’ll take our next question from Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Hi. Good morning, everybody, as well. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping to zoom out a little bit and talk about the fee revenue outlook as a whole. You guys updated the organic revenue growth for 2025, which looks like came in at 3%. Some businesses are doing better, some doing a little worse. And the ones where you’re seeing strength, particularly things like security services, sounds like that momentum is continuing.

Then in things that are slower, when I think about pricing, maybe your asset management, there are some idiosyncratic things that you pointed to that should improve. As you think about organic fee growth into 2026 and beyond, any way to frame what that could look like? Thanks for the question, Alex. I really would look at and study page six of our presentation. There are two graphs that I particularly like on that page. One is the deeper client relationships where you can see that over the last three years, we’ve grown clients who are buying from more than three or more lines of business has increased by 64%. Then when you pivot over to the middle page, you can see that 2022, flat organic, 2023, flat organic, 2024, 2%, and 2025, 3%.

Then that gives us the confidence to be able to guide 5% to the top line of $20.1 billion. And as I said in an answer to an earlier question, 10% of our sales last year was with new logos. And when you listen to Robin and his answer to the previous question on digital assets, more clients are coming to us because they want thought leadership. And as a consequence of thought leadership in new spaces, frontier products, we’re doing stuff in traditional services. So the short answer to your question is it’s the portfolio effect of delivering BNY to a broad range of clients. Robin said three years ago, we have a client list that’s the envy of the street. We pretty much service most of the S&P 500.

And so clients are seeing the change that’s happening at the company, and they want to do more with us. So I would say no one business is doing better than the other. Everything has upside. Everything has opportunity. As it relates to Pershing specifically, I’m pleased to say that the last couple of years, I would have said on most calls, the word deconversion due to M&A activity, that’s largely behind us, which reinforces why we feel confident that we continue to grow now at mid-single digits for net new assets. So we feel good about Pershing and the opportunity that’s in front of us there. And also, as I said in the answer to a previous question, we feel we’ve turned a corner in IWM, and 2026 is the year that we’re going to begin to see the transformation as we’ve brought that business closer together with BNY.

And Alex, I’ll just add one thing, which is, and I understand because we’ve talked about this a bunch over the course of the past couple of years in terms of, okay, where’s the growth going to come from? How are you really thinking about it? We’ve talked before about the alpha and beta that we see in the overall business model. And so I just want to remind you of the beta point. Dermot touched on it related to digital assets, but just remember there are quite a few mega trends that we think can be quite interesting tailwinds for the company. And so the question is, have we positioned the company in the right way and all of our business platforms to really be able to serve clients as it relates to those various different trends?

So just very briefly to tick through them, capital markets, the growth in capital markets, issuance, trading, movement of assets. Think about it, corporate trust, our payments and trade business, depository receipts, they line up very well with that particular trend. Alternatives and our ability to support clients, alternative clients end-to-end, private market assets, again, corporate trust, asset servicing, very much playing in that space. Wealth, very important segment. Pershing, wealth, investments are all significant players in participating in the growth of that mega trend. Digital assets, which we talked a bunch about already, and that, again, many of our businesses aligned to enabling that. The growth of fixed income, which Dermot touched on, that’s relevant not only in the obvious ways, but also in the financing private markets, data centers, U.S. Treasury borrowing.

And then the big one, outsourcing, clients wanting to focus on what they’re really good at and asking us to step in because of the breadth of what we can do to do some of the one-stop shopping, being a trusted provider and really giving us that opportunity to serve them more comprehensively. So when you think about that backdrop, we have not only the alpha of all of the individual work that we’re doing internally, but we’re also positioning to be able to take advantage of that. We think the combination of the two things is pretty interesting. Yep. No, I agree with that. And definitely like the direction where things going on that chart six or slide six. For my follow-up, guys, real quick on the buyback, I don’t think I heard you guys talk about the capital return plans for 2026, 2026 specifically.

And then just broadly, when you think about the growth algorithm at the firm, your medium-term targets, obviously, you gave us margins and the return of capital. But as you think about the share repurchases and the total return of capital, how does that play out over the next couple of years? So big picture, Alex, our capital philosophy remains unchanged. As you both know, Robin and myself, we like to run to the upper end of our tier one leverage ratio. A lot of uncertainty in the markets the last couple of years. The outlook is going to be a little bit uncertain. So we like to kind of be in that kind of 6% zip code of tier one leverage ratio. And when you step back from it, what is BNY? It’s a capital light balance sheet with very clean balance sheet, very liquid balance sheet, capital generative.

Over time, we’ve consistently returned earnings to our shareholders. And so we expect that to continue. And when you kind of solve for the model of what we’ve guided for 2026, it’s going to be consistent. So the buyback number as a percentage is really an output to all the things that we’ve talked about earlier. So it’s going to be in that kind of 95%-105% range. And so we don’t really feel that it’s necessary to guide on the buyback anymore given the overall algorithm and the model that we have for the future. Yep. Perfect. Thank you guys very much. Thanks. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawkin with BMO Capital Markets. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I actually have a question on organic growth as well. And thanks for all the color given. So you generated 3% organic growth last year.

Your assumptions and your outlook are that organic growth would accelerate. Markets are flat, but yet the fee revenue outlook is sub-5%. So this is kind of two possible outputs. Conservative outlook, or was there some over-earning or one-time items that might have elevated the baseline that you’re growing off of when we think about 2025 into 2026? So look, organic growth in 2026 versus 2025, I think if you go back to page six and you see the impact that the commercial model is having, right, on the two graphs of organic fee growth and deepening client relationships, the story is quite compelling. And so we continue to hire new talent. The commercial model is not even two years old.

So we continue to bring in new talent around the world, and we continue to raise the ambition of what we want to do with clients across a wide range of services. So I would expect higher organic growth this year, which reflects the flywheel of the new commercial model and also new product development and the culture that we’ve kind of changing over the last couple of years at the firm. We haven’t really mentioned this, but we have hired a new Chief Product and Innovation Officer who’s been with us a little bit over a year. And we would expect a similar impact on the product side of the house that we’ve had on the commercial side of the house. So we feel quite good about the outlook for organic growth to 2026. No, no. I totally appreciate that.

My question is, if the organic growth is going to accelerate, markets are flat, how do we end up with sub 5% fee revenue growth? And correspondingly, if you’ve got organic growth, I might as well just throw in my follow-up now. Why would balances be flat? Don’t balances tend to move with organic growth as well? So shouldn’t that move with organic growth? Or was there something in the baseline that might cause those two metrics to diverge? You framed the question at the beginning as, were we over-earning? We don’t think we’re over-earning. We think we are being thoughtful in the way that we’re positioning the outlook for 2026. We see, of course, variability on each of the inputs to the total revenue actually overall line. But we recognize that it could come a little bit more or less with NII.

It could come a little bit more or less with the organic fee growth. Of course, no one quite knows what’s going to happen with markets, which is why we’re sort of making what we think is a reasonable baseline assumption there. So you’re doing the math, and we’re kind of agreeing with you. We’re not quite exactly sure how the composition is going to come, but we feel pretty good about the guide. Excellent. Okay. Well, look forward to seeing that organic growth continue to grind higher. So it’s a great outcome. Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Good afternoon. I’m all set. All my questions have been asked and answered. Thanks so much for the time today. Thank you, Betsy. We’ll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Thanks. I’ll just do one small one.

We’re getting long in the tooth here. So I heard your comments about the deconversion and purging running its course, and I agree. Just taking a step back, there’s been a ton of consolidation in the space, except there’s also a lot of PE ownership. There’s a lot more consolidation to come. And so I’m curious if you’ve looked underneath the covers to see your book of business and how high up in the table it is, meaning do you service a lot of the consolidators or the consolidatees in the future? Because there’s going to be more. And then I worry a little bit about, not that I agree with it, but in the past, sometimes when they get big enough, they think they can insource and do it themselves. I’m just curious if you could talk a little bit about any part of that. Thanks so much.

Okay. Thanks for the question, Glenn. I see us playing a very significant role in what is a very big market. We are a $3 trillion player in this space, and we believe we have the products, we have the talent, and we have a right to play in this space. And we’ve seen that over the last 12 months where, and I’ve said it in our prepared remarks, we’ve had contract renewals with big players. We’ve had a couple of breakaway clients in the fourth quarter that we’ve onboarded, which I said in my script. And so we feel like we’re going to do as well as anybody else in this space, and we have the tools and the solutions, and clients are happy with Wove. They like Wove. We’ve invested. We’ve more than 50 clients on that platform now.

We continue to grow revenue, and we continue to bring in talent to be able to drive the business forward. And so we kind of think maybe for the next couple of quarters, you won’t see necessarily the M&A that’s been seen in the last few quarters as people are digesting those transactions. And so there has to be a kind of a pause for digesting, and our pipeline is robust and healthy. Great answer. Thanks, Dermot. We’ll move to our next question from David Smith with Truist Securities. Hey, good afternoon. Good afternoon. Your new medium-term targets aren’t too far ahead of the adjusted performance of the past quarter. Could you just go into some more details about why you feel like these are sufficiently ambitious given the opportunities set in front of BNY over the next three to five years?

You pretty much hit your targets that you set in January 2024 for your full year 2024 adjusted results. So I hear you about conservatism and the importance for humility across a range of market backdrops, but what can you share to show us why the bar has been set high enough for the next few years? Okay. So I was expecting this question. So as you who gets to ask it, the way I would answer it, if you go to page 22 of our highlights presentation, when we were at end of ’23, pre-tax margin was at 30%, and we went with medium-term targets of 33%, and 22% on ROTCE, 23% was the medium-term target.

I think you appreciated that ambition and liked the targets, and it was doing it for the first time and said, ""Okay, BNY is kind of raising the bar on itself."" So now we close the year quite strong, and we’re going with 38 and 28 for three to five years out. So again, we’re going to stay. We’re going to do that over time through the cycle. And so a lot of things can go in a different direction. It’s going to be non-linear, and we’re raising the bar. Every day, we’re trying to outperform that, but we’re setting maybe think of that as a floor to our ambition, and we’d look to outperform it. So we feel like it is stretchy for the firm given where it is in its transformation, and we’re always going to look to outperform those targets. Thank you.

Just as a follow-up, it’s great to see the improvement in client relationship depth with clients who work with three-plus businesses, up 64% versus two years ago. Can you give us any sense of the number in absolute figures? Is it a single-digit percentage? Three or more businesses at BNY right now? Is it the majority? Is it somewhere in between? Where do you want this to get to over the medium term? Thank you. So one of the things that I haven’t said is last year, we had two individual record sales quarters. So I would say it’s all across the firm, and we’ve had three consecutive years of year-on-year growth in core fee sales. And so when you look about that in the context of a commercial model that’s not even two years old, then you have to feel optimistic about the future.

60% of new clients buying from three or more lines of business, and 10% of sales in 2025 were clients that are new to BNY. That is some of the points that Robin made about the new products where clients are coming to us for thought leadership, and while they’re with us and talking to us, they’re doing traditional services. We’ve seen a 20% increase in annual sales productivity. I think the hustle and energy within our commercial organization is palpable, and clients really want to talk to us about doing more with us. Also, the last point I’d make on this is over the last three years, we’ve roughly spent $500 million each year investing in the firm and providing improved client service, improved solutions, improved product.

And you can see that particularly showing up if I was to pick one business or one segment, you see it showing up in security services, which is really where we’ve really outperformed on the margin. And so we see a real flywheel of momentum there, and we expect that to continue going forward. Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Good afternoon, Robin. Robin, can you give us a bigger picture? You guys have obviously put up very strong organic growth numbers, and that’s the focus. But when you think about opportunities to grow through acquisitions or inorganic growth, is there any areas that have an interest to you? I know you’ve done a small deal a couple of years ago, and all the focus, again, has been on organic, which has been fabulous. But what about inorganic or acquisitions?

How do you think about that? Sure, Gerard, so look, let me just start with just bringing you back to our remarks because I do think this is a very important context for M&A because there are a lot of different reasons why folks can do M&A, and one of them is obviously when they absolutely need to go do something because they’ve run out of runway themselves in some respect, and I think our headline is that our organic transformation is working and has started to show tangible results, and we think we’ve got strong momentum and the runway to create more value here for clients and therefore for shareholders over the near, medium, and long term. We’re certainly open-minded about inorganic opportunities if they can accelerate, de-risk, or enhance our value proposition.

But we do feel that we have a lot of optionality here because we’ve got the momentum from what we’re already doing. We feel good about that organic path. And so we don’t have any pressure to do M&A. And that’s very important because we think that when you look out and see the reasons why various different folks do M&A, it’s not always for the best reasons. And so that optionality, we think, is a very real thing. Now, in terms of the philosophy, there’s no change to it. So M&A, if done well, can be a powerful tool in the toolkit. We’re certainly open to things. We look, and Dermot said this before, ever since last summer when there were all these rumors in the market, we’ve had a lot of bankers calling us with inorganic opportunities.

So we see the flow, and we’re in touch with it, which is good. But for us, it’s going to be about good discipline, alignment with strategic priorities, strong cultural fit, attractive financial returns, and the bar is definitely high. It would have to make a lot of sense because, as I said, we don’t feel like we need to do it. But that’s sort of collectively how we think about it. Very good. And just to tie into that, in the markets you operate, what are the markets that are the most robust? Is it domestic U.S.? Is it Europe, Asia? Because obviously, you’re global. You’ve got a good feel for that. Where are you guys seeing the best growth and the best opportunities for growth? It’s interesting.

This is going to sound like I’m not going to give you a satisfactory answer to the question because it really is all of the above. The U.S. is the biggest market that we operate in. If you want the split, it’s approximately 40% outside of the U.S. So we feel like we’ve got a good global balance. But the U.S. obviously has got a lot of opportunity for us, and a lot of our platforms have seen the growth. But actually, last year, the fastest growing in percentage terms region was actually Asia. So clearly, there’s opportunity there as well. And I would say historically in Europe, we might have been a little bit underpenetrated. So there’s real opportunity there as well. So I wouldn’t really break the opportunity down on geographic lines.

And as Dermot said, we don’t really break it down on business lines either because we see opportunity and pathway in each one of the businesses, albeit for very different reasons. And that really ties back to this point about the different things going on in the market, these mega trends, whether it’s capital markets, private markets, etc., that I talked about before. So this is a critical part of how we’re thinking about the company. We are deeply invested in making the company work more effectively, the agility, the platform’s operating model in terms of how we run the place. We’ve deeply invested in the commercial model so that we can actually get more and more out of the businesses that we have, this great breadth of businesses to deliver to clients, including in more combinations and more solutions, which is exciting. Dermot mentioned product and innovation.

That’s exciting because that’s about new products in the same way as he mentioned new logos earlier on, and so all of those things come together for us, we think, to be able to drive opportunity, which is one of the reasons why when we sit and look at what we have, going back to the beginning of the answer to your question on M&A, we feel like we’ve just got a lot of opportunity with what we’ve got to make more of it. Very good, and then, Dermot, a quick question on slide six as you refer to one of your favorite graphs, the deeper client relationship graph. I don’t think you mentioned this, but if you did, I apologize. What percentage of the customers are now taking more than three products or three businesses?

Or is there still enormous room for this to continue to grow at this rate because you just haven’t deeply penetrated all of the customer base at this level? So I would say a lot more room for improvement. It’s a momentum. It’s a cultural transformation. It’s a de-siloing of the firm. In some ways, we’re kind of turning a page here today on phase one to phase two, but the work is never done. And so we think there is more upside, more training, deeper integration of the businesses. We kind of like if I just give you one specific example, asset management can do a lot more with Pershing than what it does today. Asset management can do a lot more with asset servicing than it kind of does today. And the leadership of those three businesses are beginning to see that opportunity.

We have great manufacturing capability in asset management. We need to deliver that to the rest of the firm and their BNY clients. Great. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, Gerard. We’ll take our next question from Emily Erickson with Citigroup. Hi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask first on the expense side of things. You’re guiding to 3%-4% for 2026. So take the midpoint of that. Comes in somewhere near where you guys printed for 2025. But we’re talking about flat markets right from year-end. Is the way I kind of square, I guess, that difference with some of the market-related uplifted expenses expected to kind of recede the balance between what you’re able to harvest in efficiency savings relative to the incremental investments, the $500 million from 2025? How should I think about that particular balance on the expense side of things in the 2026?

I’m looking at page 21 of the financial presentation, Emily. Look, for the first time this year, previously, we’ve guided some operating leverage and positive operating leverage. Today, we’re coming out and saying it’s going to be greater than or equal to 100 basis points. Over the last few years, I think we’ve managed to establish some credibility that we are very good stewards of our expense base, very good financial discipline. We’ve harvested roughly $500 million a year for each of the last three years, and we’ve reinvested that in the business to grow. It’s really about the 3%-4% guide for 2026. That continued investment in the business in a very agile and dynamic way gives us then the confidence to be able to guide to the top-line growth of 5%.

So it all starts with top-down, where we kind of say we want to solve and deliver positive operating leverage to you. And then, as a consequence of that in the budget season, then we’re going to go through the bottoms-up planning analysis, and we arrive at this model that gives us this flex on the expense side. Got it. Okay. And then just on the NII side of things, right, you’ve talked about breaking out that 5% on total revenue a little better if we look just at the NII piece. How much of that, or can you sort of walk through the drivers of where NIM goes from here? I know you have the reinvestment impact on the security side of things, but you also pointed to some deposit margin compression in 4Q.

Is there room for significant NIM expansion to support that 5% plus on the NII side? So I’m not too sure what your definition of significant is, but I would expect over the course of 2026 for NIM to grind higher from where it is today. Got it. Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of David Konrad with KBW. Oh, hey, thanks. My question on capital was asked and answered, so we can end it here. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, David. And with that, that does conclude our question and answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Robin for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you, Operator. And thanks, everyone, for your interest in BNY. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Marius and the IR team. Be well. Thank you.

This does conclude today’s conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Investor Relations website at 3:00 P.M. Eastern Time today. Have a great day.

Delta Air Lines Stock Looks Ready to Fly to New Highs

President Glen Hauenstein said Delta’s strategy has helped diversify revenue into higher-margin sources, with diversified revenue streams representing 60% of total revenue in 2025. He reported that premium revenue grew 7% for the year, cargo revenue increased 9%, and maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) revenue rose 25%. Total loyalty revenue improved 6%, while travel products continued to grow at double-digit rates.

Hauenstein also highlighted the performance of Delta’s co-brand relationship with American Express. He said American Express remuneration grew 11% to $8.2 billion, supported by a fourth consecutive year of more than 1 million new card acquisitions and double-digit year-over-year co-brand spend growth in every quarter. Looking ahead, Delta expects high single-digit growth in co-brand remuneration in 2026 and reiterated a longer-term goal of reaching $10 billion within the next few years.

During the analyst Q&A, management said premium demand remained strong, while the Main Cabin recovery has been slower. Hauenstein said Delta “has not really seen main cabin move yet,” adding that movement in Main Cabin would be a factor that could support results toward the higher end of guidance if it materializes in 2026.

Outlook: March quarter growth and fiscal 2026 targets

Executives said fiscal 2026 has started with strong booking momentum. Bastian said Delta set a new record for bookings “last week,” with cash sales up double digits on top of last year’s strength. Delta forecast March quarter revenue growth of 5% to 7% year over year, supported by what the company described as improving consumer and corporate demand and a healthier supply-demand environment as “unprofitable flying is rationalized.”

Janki guided to March quarter earnings of $0.50 to $0.90 per share and an operating margin of 4.5% to 6%, both expected to improve year over year. For the full year, Delta projected earnings of $6.50 to $7.50 per share, free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion, and leverage of two times by year-end.

Management cautioned that early-year booking strength is still limited in duration. In response to an analyst question about guidance sensitivity, executives said it was “the second week in January” and warned that the industry’s volatility in 2025 remains a reminder to remain cautious when projecting outcomes.

Capacity: Hauenstein said Delta plans to grow capacity about 3% for the full year, with all new seat growth concentrated in premium cabins, driven by interior upgrades and new aircraft deliveries.

Costs: Janki said non-fuel cost performance is expected to remain within Delta’s “low single digit” long-term framework, though first-quarter non-fuel CASM growth is expected to be modestly above the full-year average due to fleet preparation for peak summer.

Capital spending: Delta plans $5.5 billion of capex in 2026, including about 50 aircraft deliveries and ongoing investment in customer experience and technology.

Fleet and strategy: Boeing 787 order and international expansion

Delta announced an order for 30 Boeing 787-10s with options for 30 more, with deliveries starting in 2031. Bastian said the aircraft would enhance the international network and extend long-haul capabilities. Janki said next-generation wide-body aircraft can deliver up to a “10 points margin advantage” over the aircraft they replace, with more premium seating, improved fuel efficiency, and expanded cargo capability.

In response to questions, Hauenstein said the 787-10 order supports both growth and replacement, particularly for the 767-400 fleet, and also adds diversification to Delta’s wide-body and engine mix. Executives also reiterated plans to expand internationally in 2026 and beyond, including growth in Asia and Middle East markets, while continuing to use joint ventures and a strong domestic foundation to support network expansion.

Leadership changes, operations, and reporting updates

Bastian said Hauenstein will retire next month, and Joe Esposito has been elevated to Chief Commercial Officer. Esposito told analysts Delta’s core strategies are not changing and that the airline plans to “dig even deeper” into integration across network, pricing, loyalty, products, and merchandising.

On operations, Bastian said Delta continues to lead on reliability metrics, citing Cirium recognition as the most on-time airline in North America and a number one Net Promoter Score among major airlines. However, he acknowledged the airline is working to improve recovery from irregular operations, pointing to post-COVID changes and pilot contract-related complexities as contributors to recovery challenges.

Delta also said it will change aspects of its financial reporting. Janki said the company will provide additional detail on its third-party MRO business, separating MRO from non-fuel unit cost metrics to preserve visibility into core airline cost trends. He described MRO as a “unique Delta capability” and said the company is optimistic about growing the business beyond the $1 billion revenue level over time, with potential to reach $2 billion and then $3 billion in revenue, while improving margins from high single digits toward the mid-teens.

On capital allocation, management reiterated that debt reduction remains the top priority, while noting opportunities to expand shareholder returns as leverage declines. Janki referenced dividend growth and said the company expects to utilize an existing share repurchase authorization over its timeframe, while remaining focused on paying down debt in the near term.

In an-in-depth report published on Monday, UBS noted the competitive strength of tech giants such as IBM (IBM).

Quantum computing works on a subatomic level and uses exotic technologies, like supercold superconductor chips. Quantum computing aims to solve problems too complex for today's classical computers, such as simulating chemical reactions. Traditional computers use electronic circuits to store information as digital zeros and ones. Instead, quantum machines rely on processors known as ""qubits.""

Qubit-based computing can be prone to errors from small environmental disturbances and other factors. For quantum computing to reach its potential, logical qubits will require robust error correction. The race is on to build ""fault-tolerant"" quantum computers that scale up and correct errors, allowing for complex, sustained calculations.

There are many approaches to quantum computing, including qubit technologies that use superconducting, ion-trapped, annealing and photonic methods.

Quantum Computing Stocks: Tech Giants Loom

While IBM and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google are pursuing superconducting-based quantum technology, IonQ (IONQ) is developing trapped ion systems, the UBS report noted.

""Who will win out will depend largely on the modality of qubit that succeeds first,"" said UBS analyst Madeleine Jenkins in a report.

""As it stands we see superconducting and trapped ion as the most advanced, with Google leading in software/quantum error correction. Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) are more diversified, offering mixed modalities (from pure plays) over cloud computing. Public pure plays with thematic exposure include IonQ, D-Wave, and Rigetti, alongside private companies such as IQM and PsiQuantum.""

JPMorgan, Jefferies, Evercore ISI, Cantor Fitzgerald and Mizuho Securities in 2025 initiated coverage on some quantum companies while Barclays and Bank of America published in-depth reports on the emerging technology.

Quantum Computing Stocks: Xanadu, Infleqtion

So far in 2026, D-Wave Quantum (RGTI) shares have climbed roughly 13%. Quantum Computing (QUBT) has popped about 14%.

Quantum computing stocks have been volatile since late 2024 when a Google announcement sparked a big rally. However, uncertainty over commercialization and competition from tech industry giants have been key issues. Nvidia (NVDA) has offered differing views.

Fourteen U.S.-based chemical manufacturers landed on the International Chemical Secretariat’s annualTop 40 ChemScore report in November, with only one company cracking the top five.

Developed by the International Chemical Secretariat, or ChemSec, the rankings focus on how the world’s largest chemical producers are managing their transition to safer, more sustainable substances,according to the nonprofit’s website.

ChemSec measures a chemical company’s performance based on four metrics: transparency, phase-out of persistent chemicals, product portfolio and safer solutions.

The nonprofit changed its methodology for the latest rankings. Possible points have increased from 48 to 100 over the four metrics. Additionally, “times are changing” and ChemSec has adapted to the current chemical climate, Jerker Ligthart, senior chemicals expert at ChemSec, said in avideo explaining the results.

Furthermore, ChemSec got rid of the “easy points,” which Ligthart said required very little effort to achieve and did not display differences between the entities.

“We wanted to show the difference between a good company and a not- so- good company, and that is kind of the whole point,” Ligthart said.

14 U.S.-based companies’ rankings on ChemSec’s 2025 ChemScore report

Ecolab placed in the top five, while Chemours placed last with zero points

Ecolab

Ecolab scored high on the list at No. 4, with 35 points for its plans to phase out the use of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl chemicalsby the end of 2026. Ecolab, which manufactures cleaning substances for industrial, food safety and healthcare settings, confirmed that it is removing all chemical products that the company makes with intentionally added PFAS from its global portfolio.

“In these times of [President Donald] Trump, this is an American company with good sustainability DNA, that is not afraid to do the right thing, is blunt and outspoken in public, and is moving forward,” Sonja Haider, head of sustainable finance at ChemSec, said in a statement.

Ecolab declined to comment on the ChemSec ranking, but it confirmed that all chemical products that the company manufactures with intentionally added PFAS will be removed from its global portfolio.

“As public health concern has grown over the use of PFAS, Ecolab is often asked questions regarding its use of these substances in our chemical products,” the company said in its PFAS position sheet. “Ecolab’s PFAS position is part of our commitment to provide clear and transparent product information to customers and stakeholders.”

Ecolab added that fluoropolymers may be present in its seals, valves and components within certain equipment or packaging that are critical for safety and chemical containment. However, the company said it will seek fluoropolymer alternatives when they become commercially available. Ecolab will also replace the materials when a “robust technical” alternative has been established and proven to meet performance requirements.

Additionally, Ecolab offers technologies that remove PFAS from water and is asking its suppliers to develop PFAS-free alternatives for its pesticides.

“Investors tell us: ‘You can’t achieve anything on sustainability in the US’. The example of Ecolab shows this is false,” Haider said.

Chemours

Chemours placedlast on the ChemScore report, with zero points. ChemSec said the manufacturer has corresponded with the nonprofit regarding its chemical management system and code of conduct. Chemous offers a few safer alternatives and has worked to reduce waste, but those were “easy points” that almost all companies were awarded for.

“Now it is more apparent, from a chemical pollution perspective, that Chemours is in danger of becoming a stranded asset,” the nonprofit said in its report. “It is burdened with a legacy portfolio of hazardous substances.”

Chemours said in an email that it actively engages with rating organizations to share its sustainability progress as well as the essential role its chemistries play in industries worldwide.

“Our overall performance in sustainability rankings continues to trend positive and we continue to score well and improve in several of the most recognized ratings, including EcoVadis, MSCI, ISS, and Bloomberg,” the company said in a statement.

Chemours said its chemical products are used in industries such as energy transition, semiconductors, defense systems, aerospace, medical devices. The company added that there are “often no viable non-PFAS alternatives” offering the same performance, reliability, and safety needed for these critical applications.

“These essential chemistries can be made responsibly, which is why Chemours has made and continues to make significant capital and technological investments to reduce PFAS discharges from our sites as part of our commitment to responsible manufacturing,” the company said.

“Chemours also has a deep, longstanding commitment to innovation,” Chemours added. “While there aren’t suitable replacements or alternatives for many of the critical applications of the chemistries we supply right now, we are constantly innovating to improve our chemistries and uncover potential alternatives that don’t compromise quality or performance for our customers.”

Other companies

Other companies on the list of those phasing out PFAS include 3M, which was set tosunset the forever chemicals by the end of 2025. However, the companyranked No. 32 with only eight points. ChemSec gave the chemical manufacturer no points for transparency, its product portfolio and lack of safer solutions,according to the nonprofit’s report.

3M did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Honeywellplaced 36th with only six points for its product portfolio. Honeywell said in an email that itcompleted its chemicals business spinoff in October, which is now called Solstice Advanced Materials.

DuPontranked at No. 21 with 13 points.

“We will let the ranking/score speak for itself and do not have any additional comment,” the company said in an email.

PPG Industriesplaced 30th with nine points.

“PPG remains committed to reducing our environmental footprint to better serve the evolving needs of our customers and improve operational efficiency,” the company said in an email statement. “As part of this, we recognize the importance of chemical safety and transparency. PPG remains in compliance with chemical disclosures within all regions where we operate.”

The other U.S.-based chemical companies on the ChemScore did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other companies on the ChemScore outside the United States have made plans to sunset PFAS in its production. Germany-based BASF ranked atNo. 8 with 23 points, as it’s also phasing out PFAS use.

“Considering the need to maintain high safety and environmental standards, BASF calls for substituting the use of PFAS in industrial equipment,” the company said in a statement regarding itsPFAS position.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/eSTFSZnfKcDHSiWJPtM14uuSWT1Po_mfeMAlfKabIUQ/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xODI1NTkzNTMyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-13 15:05:02.044555

N1X almost certainly refers to Nvidia's Arm chip for consumer PCs, the existence of which has been confirmed by no lesser an authority than CEO and leather jacket impresario Jensen Huang.
That obviously implies that the Dell laptop with the Nvidia chip was nearly ready to ship.
That latter issue, specifically operating system and software support, is surely the biggest challenge facing any Arm chip for the PC.
So, an Nvidia Arm chip for the PC remains an exciting but thus far elusive prospect.","Nvidia's N1X Arm-based CPU has been a long time coming. But now it's been spotted in a shipping manifest configured in a 16-inch Dell laptop. So, is it just about to launch? Possibly not.

Twitter user @Olrak29_ spotted a reference to a ""Dell 16 Premium"" with ""N1X"" in a shipping manifest listing on the NBD Trade Data website. N1X almost certainly refers to Nvidia's Arm chip for consumer PCs, the existence of which has been confirmed by no lesser an authority than CEO and leather jacket impresario Jensen Huang.

Further intriguing information in the listing includes the phrase ""engineering technical samples for R&D purposes"" and the entry ""DVT"". The latter refers to Design Validation Test, which generally means a feature and function complete version of a product.

Indeed, we've had ""DVT"" versions of laptops as official review samples from some brands. They often only need a firmware update to be identical to retail shipping products.

That obviously implies that the Dell laptop with the Nvidia chip was nearly ready to ship. But there are a few catches. First, this manifest listing is actually from November 20 last year. And yet nothing has been launched.

Moreover, the laptop listed has Dell's 2025 ""Premium"" branding. And Dell has just announced at CES that it is returning to its XPS brand for 2026 laptops with small ""p"" premium market positioning.

There's a strong implication, then, that Dell had this laptop inked in for a 2025 launch, but something has caused it to be delayed or even cancelled. We previously reported in July that the N1X had indeed been delayed due to multiple factors.

One was the need to revise the chip itself. But ""delays in Microsoft's operating system roadmap"" were also sited.

That latter issue, specifically operating system and software support, is surely the biggest challenge facing any Arm chip for the PC. For now, it's not clear exactly what specifications N1X will have. If it's based on the same GB10 ""superchip"" used in the Nvidia DGX Spark box, then it could have an iGPU with the same specs as an RTX 5070 desktop GPU.

But whatever the exact spec, expectations will be high when it comes to gaming performance and that will demand excellent OS support including some kind of translation layer.

Such a thing currently exists, of course, in the form of Windows on Arm and the Prism translation layer. The problem is that has been specifically tuned for Qualcomm's Snapdragon X chips. So, a version built specifically for Nvidia's N1X would be required. And maybe that has been delayed.

Anyway, all we know absolutely for sure is that Nvidia has confirmed that an Arm chip for the PC is coming, but that it has yet to appear. So, an Nvidia Arm chip for the PC remains an exciting but thus far elusive prospect.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eko8Vu3jdf5vxqZAEZfE59-1280-80.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 14:02:55.810281

Rather, they reveal that we are still in the first phase of Amara’s Law: overestimated impact.
Amara’s Law and the Gartner Hype Cycle both point toward the same conclusion: we need to think longer term.
While each AI journey will look a little different, here are some important steps organizations can take to start realizing the full potential of AI: Amara’s Law is just one of the indicators that AI is reaching an inflection point.","Throughout 2025, AI dominated headlines and keynote slots — and the hype shows little sign of slowing down. There are bold predictions about productivity gains, promises of transformation across industries and almost every app now has some kind of AI-assisted feature.

But as with any technological shift of this scale, it isn’t always smooth sailing. AI still suffers from hallucinations and bias. Plenty of pilots have failed. And many businesses are still struggling to achieve the ROI they expected. Consequently, there is growing speculation that the AI boom is actually an AI bubble.

The reality is that tech predictions almost always miss the mark, especially when they concern something as far-reaching as AI. Amara’s Law gives us a useful way to visualize why this is the case.

Old predictions about the future can often seem absurd in hindsight. In 1959, the U.S. Postmaster General predicted that mail would be delivered from New York to Australia in a matter of hours… using guided missiles. Futurists in the 1960s and 1970s expected us to have robot butlers, flying cars and personal jetpacks by now.

But for every overly optimistic prediction, there’s a doubting voice that has been proven emphatically wrong. In a 1966 edition of Time magazine, “remote shopping” was predicted to flop. In 2003, Steve Jobs stated that the subscription model for music was “bankrupt.” And in 1995, Bob Metcalfe, co-inventor of Ethernet, predicted that the internet would collapse. He famously (and literally) ate his words at the International World Wide Web Conference just two years later.

As president of the Institute for the Future (IFTF), Roy Amara was very well acquainted with tech predictions and hype cycles. In 1978, the Boston-born futurologist observed a pattern that is now known as Amara’s Law:

“We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.”

This observation has played out time and time again. Perhaps the best example is the internet. Short-term overestimations led to the dot-com bubble. But 25 years later, the internet has had a greater impact than most could have imagined in the ‘90s. Mobile phones, social media and cloud computing all followed a similar trajectory. AI, particularly generative AI and agentic AI, seems to be the latest breakthrough technology to demonstrate Amara’s Law.

These statistics indicate a mismatch between the enthusiasm for AI and the ability to extract value from it. But they don’t tell the whole story. Failed pilots and a lack of ROI don’t automatically mean that AI is broken or not fit for purpose. Rather, they reveal that we are still in the first phase of Amara’s Law: overestimated impact.

This is partly due to what I call “Artificial Confidence” — a tendency to put too much faith in the capabilities of artificial intelligence without laying the necessary groundwork. This happens for two main reasons. First, AI is so versatile that it can feel like a cure-all solution. Second, companies fear they will get left behind if they are not quick to adopt AI.

We have seen numerous high-profile blunders: support chatbots misleading customers, fictitious citations appearing in published work, and developers generating code that contains vulnerabilities. Failures like these are not always bugs within the AI itself. They are symptoms of trying to force a short-term rollout without the long-term infrastructure to support it. AI is a tool; its effectiveness depends on how it is wielded.

Amara’s Law and the Gartner Hype Cycle both point toward the same conclusion: we need to think longer term. As with any groundbreaking technology, the true potential is only revealed once we have transformed the structure around it. Electric cars are not much use without a sufficient charging infrastructure. Smartphones wouldn’t be as useful without an ecosystem of apps to expand their functionality.

We’re witnessing the same dynamic with AI. Employees using generic AI tools without guidance are unlikely to see meaningful productivity gains. Even customized, task-specific AI solutions will fail to move the needle if existing workflows don’t adapt. The real long-term value is in redesigning processes and roles around AI-human collaboration, not just replacing people.

While each AI journey will look a little different, here are some important steps organizations can take to start realizing the full potential of AI:

Amara’s Law is just one of the indicators that AI is reaching an inflection point. The short-term impact may have been overestimated, and there will surely be many more failed pilots along the way. But in the long term, AI will influence our lives in ways that no one can yet predict. The organizations that will emerge as winners are the ones who take a considered approach, build the right infrastructure and invest in quality assurance.

For now, the best approach is to test your AI solutions in the real world, with real people and diverse datasets to get feedback on the quality of responses. This will help you identify and remediate bias, toxicity and hallucinations so you can release AI-driven products with confidence.

ID43,Uber,2026-01-13 17:41:23+00:00,The Indiana Lawyer,"Bill would shield Uber, Lyft from liability lawsuits stemming from drivers' crimes against passengers",Cameron Shaw,,,,,https://www.theindianalawyer.com/articles/bill-would-shield-uber-lyft-from-liability-lawsuits-stemming-from-drivers-crimes-against-passengers,"Legislation filed in the Indiana General Assembly would prohibit future civil lawsuits against ride-hailing companies, such as Uber and Lyft, for crimes or other misconduct committed by their drivers against passengers.
Uber says vicarious liability has been “weaponized” by plaintiffs’ attorneys to hold corporations responsible for the actions of independent contractors.
Uber attempted to have the case dismissed, arguing that Indiana’s transportation network statute establishes Valadez as an independent contractor, thereby exempting Uber from his actions.
Johnson said that if HB 1417 were to take effect before the civil case is wrapped up, it appears Uber would gain complete immunity from the plaintiff’s claims.
“Our citizens are the ones taking the risk, and shareholders of Uber and Lyft get all the reward,” he added.","Legislation filed in the Indiana General Assembly would prohibit future civil lawsuits against ride-hailing companies, such as Uber and Lyft, for crimes or other misconduct committed by their drivers against passengers.

House Bill 1417, authored by Rep. Matt Lehman, R-Berne, would prohibit individuals from suing transportation network companies for damages caused by a driver or arising from a ride arranged through the platform. The provision is part of a broader tort reform package aimed at limiting liability exposure for all businesses and curbing certain types of civil claims.

If enacted, the measure would prevent future cases similar to the civil action now pending in Marion Superior Court against Uber following the 2024 murder of Indianapolis resident Chanti Dixon by an Uber driver who was also accused of sexually assaulting the woman.

San Francisco-based Uber did not directly respond to questions about whether it considered the legislation a response to the civil lawsuit stemming from the Indianapolis woman’s death. Plaintiffs in the case argue Uber was negligent in the hiring and training of Francisco Valadez, a former driver who was convicted of fatally shooting Dixon in 2024. He also confessed to attempting to rape the 30-year-old woman, court records show.

In a written statement to The Indiana Lawyer, an Uber spokesperson did say the inclusion of “vicarious liability reform” in the bill is a “direct response to the increasing use of ‘deep pocket’ litigation strategies that raise prices for Hoosiers and threaten Indiana’s economic stability.”

“HB 1417 helps address this systemic abuse and is a key part of the broader tort package focused on combating the ‘hidden tax’ of lawsuit abuse,” the spokesperson added.

Uber says vicarious liability has been “weaponized” by plaintiffs’ attorneys to hold corporations responsible for the actions of independent contractors.

Bob Johnson, president of the Indiana Trial Lawyers Association, called that reasoning “a stretch.”

“It’s just a little bit of, what I would call, trying to force a narrative, kind of that solution looking for a problem,” Johnson said. “…They don’t need immunity. Everything’s working fine the way it is.”

Uber has been under scrutiny for the sexual misconduct reports its riders have made in recent years.

More than 400,000 Uber trips resulted in reports of sexual assault or sexual misconduct in the U.S. from 2017 to 2022, The New York Times reported last year. Uber told The Times that no level of sexual assault is tolerable and has noted that a vast majority of those reports cited were “less serious” and “non-physical in nature” and did not fall into the category of sexual assault.

Dixon’s encounter with an Uber driver was deadly.

In September 2024, her naked body was found in the 1800 block of Wagner Lane with a gunshot wound to the head.

Last month, Valadez pleaded guilty to murdering her, as part of a plea deal resulting in a 45-year prison sentence.

Detectives said Valadez also admitted to trying to rape Dixon in the back of his car. And while he was attempting to assault her, Valadez said, Dixon insulted him and that caused him to go into a rage and shoot her, according to court records.

He told detectives that he then dragged Dixon out of his car and tried to have sex with her dead body.

Valadez was later arrested by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department and initially charged with two counts of murder, attempted rape and attempted abuse of a corpse, according to arrest records.

Dixon’s estate is now involved in a civil action against Uber. That lawsuit was filed in May 2025 in Marion County Superior Court.

Uber attempted to have the case dismissed, arguing that Indiana’s transportation network statute establishes Valadez as an independent contractor, thereby exempting Uber from his actions.

The plaintiffs in the case disagreed with Uber’s interpretation of the law, arguing that there is “nothing” in the statute to create a blanket immunity for such companies.

“The statute regulates licensing, insurance, and disclosure obligations—it does not alter Indiana’s long-standing tort principles governing negligence, fraud, or product liability,” a response to the dismissal motion stated.

Marion County Superior Court Judge Gary Miller denied the dismissal, and the case is pending.

Attorneys interviewed by The Indiana Lawyer were divided over whether the legislation could potentially impact the civil lawsuit filed by Dixon’s estate.

Johnson said that if HB 1417 were to take effect before the civil case is wrapped up, it appears Uber would gain complete immunity from the plaintiff’s claims. The legislation, if approved as written, would take effect July 1.

Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis, was less certain about the bill’s effect on pending lawsuits because it contains no retroactive clause. DeLaney opposes the bill, but he said if it is allowed to move forward, he would like to see a provision added that would explicitly allow existing lawsuits to proceed.

Terrance Kinnard, an attorney for Dixon’s estate, declined to comment on the legislation because the civil lawsuit is still ongoing.

Lehman, the bill’s author, did not respond to The Lawyer’s requests for comment.

For critics of the bill, any immunity, especially in Dixon’s case, removes accountability.

“Without accountability, it shifts all the harm that we know is going to happen from corporate actors back to the taxpayers,” Johnson said.

“Our citizens are the ones taking the risk, and shareholders of Uber and Lyft get all the reward,” he added. “I mean, this is to protect the platform and their profits, not the passengers.”

Johnson said his association is strongly opposing the legislation and is prepared to fight it.

Immunity for transportation network companies is just one component of a broader effort for tort reform this session.

The rest of the bill contains business protections that are a priority of the new Indiana Alliance for Legal Reform, which includes the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, Indiana Manufacturers Association, National Federation of Independent Business, Indiana Motor Truck Association and Indiana Bankers Association.

The measure would provide businesses with more protection from public nuisance claims and third-party criminal acts and places a $1 million cap on non-economic damages.

“The goal of all of these different provisions is to provide more certainty, more predictability to business owners,” Adam Berry, the chamber’s vice president of economic development and technology, said in an interview with The Lawyer last week.

Stephen Wolff, the alliance’s executive director, who also serves as the vice president of Corydon Group’s Governmental Affairs and Procurement division, echoed desires to create predictability for businesses.

“If Indiana were to become a place where it’s easy to bring people into these cases where they don’t necessarily have a nexus or a connection, it disincentivizes businesses from wanting to operate here,” Wolff said.

Berry said that over the last decade, he’s seen a tremendous increase in the cost of insurance premiums due to the rise in lawsuits.

By working to place caps on non-economic damages and protecting businesses from frivolous lawsuits, Berry said, HB 1417 would help “reduce the exposure that these businesses have.”

Berry said he is fairly confident the bill will receive a hearing from the House Judiciary Committee, but he expects there will be some refinement in the liability section of the bill before it moves along.

But Judiciary Committee Chair Chris Jeter, R-Fishers, expressed uncertainty about the bill’s future. He said it wouldn’t pass out of committee as it’s currently written.

“I’d like to see it pared down in some places,” he said, without specifying the changes he would like to see.

The Nimbus collaboration, which includes a $55 million upfront payment and up to $1.3 billion in milestone-based payments, is aimed at expanding Lilly’s obesity pipeline beyond injectables, while the potential Ventyx acquisition would further deepen its drug portfolio, together reinforcing investor confidence in Lilly’s long-term strategy to strengthen its leadership in the weight-loss therapeutics market.

The current consensus opinion on Eli Lilly stock is “Strong Buy” overall. Among the 27 analysts covering the stock, 22 recommend a ""Strong Buy,"" two suggest a ""Moderate Buy,"" and three analysts advise a ""Hold."" Furthermore, the average analyst price target for Eli Lilly is $1,161.76, indicating a potential upside of 7.5% from the current price levels.",https://s.yimg.com/os/en/barchart_com_477/0d9ac77c949cf1810e20427fc62c5fa4,N,,2026-01-13 13:03:24.091012

Alex Crisp is a freelance journalist focusing on environment, animal welfare, and new technology. He has a background in law, journalism, and teaching. He is the host of the “Future of Foods Interviews” podcast.

The “polluter pays” principle is a cornerstone of environmental regulation. It raises billions of dollars each year and has been fundamental in pushing energy companies to pursue cleaner, more cost-effective energy sources. But when it was first formalized in 1972 by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), it faced resistance. Energy companies argued that internalizing environmental costs would damage competitiveness, raise consumer prices, and deter innovation. At the time, many in the energy sector warned that internalizing environmental costs would damage competitiveness, raise consumer prices, and lead to layoffs—arguments widely circulated in the media and industry forums. Despite this, the principle gradually moved from being labeled “radical” and “punitive” to becoming a foundation of environmental and economic law.

Today, we face a similar urgency for change. This time, it’s regarding our food systems.

The problem is agriculture. The very system that sustains us has become a driver of environmental breakdown. It consumes 70 percent of fresh water, occupies half of all habitable land, generates around a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, and is the primary cause of deforestation and biodiversity loss. With the worldwide population expected to increase by 2 billion by mid century, demand for food is projected to rise by 50 percent, and protein demand alone is set to double by then, according to the 2017 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations report. So how can we produce more food without harming the planet, and where will the funds to support this transition come from?

The problem with food

Years of intensive agriculture mean that crops are being planted on exhausted fields; thus, in an ever-growing cycle of decay, farmers use more fertilizer to sustain yields. In his 2022 book Sixty Harvests Left, Philip Lymbery delivers an important message: that humanity’s food system is careening toward collapse. The title echoes a chilling United Nations warning that, under current industrial farming practices, 90 percent of the Earth’s topsoil is likely to be at risk by 2050.

Humanity consumes approximately 350 million tons of meat annually. That is equivalent to “nearly a thousand Empire State Buildings in carcass weight,” according to the book We Are Eating the Earth by Michael Grunwald. Livestock uses nearly 80 percent of agricultural land, yet provides less than 20 percent of global calories. They account for about 32 percent of global methane emissions, while beef production requires more than 15,000 liters of water per kilogram. The environmental cost of meat is disproportionately high. Global demand is rising, and protein production urgently needs innovation.

Intensifying floods, droughts, heat waves, collapsing fisheries, and accelerating species extinction are early signs of systemic stress. Agriculture is at the heart of this crisis. However, if approached differently, agriculture could also be a solution to the increasingly dire threat of climate disaster. The choices made in the coming years will shape not only our food security but also the planet’s resilience for generations to come.

Seven out of the nine planetary boundaries, as set by the Stockholm Resilience Center (SRC) in 2009, have now been breached. These boundaries were created to measure a “safe operating space for humanity.” The SRC states that, “Crossing boundaries increases the risk of generating large-scale abrupt or irreversible environmental changes.” Breaching these boundaries signals that humanity is pushing Earth’s life-support systems beyond safe limits. This is detrimental not only to all life on Earth but also to business, as supply chains, global markets, and economic stability all depend on a healthy and nurturing environment.

The proposed transition of the food system

As part of the Paris Agreement, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations launched the Food Roadmap at COP28. This was the first time any climate convention put food and agriculture on its agenda—aligning agriculture with climate goals. The roadmap called for a substantial scale-up of investment to develop and deploy low-emission farming methods, alternative proteins, and technologies that enhance soil health, improve water efficiency, and protect biodiversity.

The roadmap outlines 120 science-backed actions, clustered across 10 strategic domains, including soil and water, livestock, forests and wetlands, and healthy diets. The goal is to see food systems worldwide become carbon-neutral by 2035 and to achieve a net carbon sink by 2050. Livestock methane emissions would be reduced by 25 percent by 2030, and food waste would be halved.

The international community has been slow to react. However, by developing and implementing a widely accepted strategy and integrating meat-related levies into its climate initiative, Denmark has become a leading advocate in the transition. Its dual approach of plant-based incentives and emissions costs illustrates a progressive method for reducing meat dependency.

Marie-Louise Boisen Lendal, chair of the Danish fund Plant Foundation, which is overseeing a public investment of around $200 million in innovative solutions and the move toward plant-based foods, says, “Denmark is introducing the polluter pays principle because it is the most effective path to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement.” She told me in a “Future of Foods Interview” podcast that Danish farmers are in favor of the idea. New Zealand and other countries, notably those in Scandinavia, exhibit similar signs of movement. The United Kingdom mooted a meat tax in 2024 as part of the National Food Strategy, but ultimately decided against it, citing public pushback.

Regenerative agriculture versus technology

By focusing on rebuilding soil health, increasing biodiversity, and enhancing water cycles, regenerative practices aim to sequester carbon, restore degraded ecosystems, and make food systems more resilient. However, critics argue that the impact of regenerative agriculture on carbon sequestration is overstated. Since these systems may yield less in the short term, more land is often required to produce the same amount of food, and the only available land to exploit is often forested.

Some also warn that the term “regenerative” risks becoming a vague marketing expression susceptible to greenwashing. Sajeev Mohankumar from the FAIRR Initiative—a sustainability investment network managing $80 trillion in assets—confirms that although many investors are prioritizing regenerative agriculture, its implementation remains limited. Mohankumar told “Future of Foods” that although 50 of 79 agri-food companies reference regenerative practices in their strategies, only four have provided financial incentives to farmers or producers.

Meanwhile, new agritech solutions are emerging as complementary approaches that could accelerate the transition when combined with regenerative techniques. Biofertilizers and biopesticides offer more sustainable options for soil health and could eventually replace current chemical inputs, though their effectiveness remains under evaluation.

Gene editing is already in use, producing crops that are resistant to disease, tolerant to drought, or enriched with nutrients—developments that could reduce reliance on pesticides despite political pushback. Precision fermentation is also advancing; this process utilizes microbes to produce dairy proteins, egg whites, and fats without using animals. Several products manufactured using this process have reached the market, though significant scaling up is needed to compete with conventional farming. Finally, cellular agriculture—also known as cultivated meat—continues to progress, with approvals already granted in Singapore, the United States, Israel, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Yet here, too, the challenge of scaling remains substantial.

The cost of a food transition

The Food System Economics Commission (FSEC) estimates that implementing a comprehensive transformation of the food system would require annual investments of approximately $500 billion. In a Future of Foods Interview from October 2025, a representative from Cargill confirmed to me that they now invest around 10 percent of their annual profits into scaling alternative proteins. Conversations suggest that Nestlé invests a similar amount. Major food companies—including Nestlé, Cargill, Unilever, Tyson Foods, Danone, Kraft Heinz, PepsiCo, JBS, and Mars—are increasingly investing in or partnering with alternative protein ventures as part of their innovation and sustainability strategies, contributing to the broader sector’s multi‑billion‑dollar investment landscape in plant‑based, cultivated, and fermentation‑derived proteins.

The UN and the philanthropic sector pledged more than $7 billion for food and agriculture during COP28—including $200 million from the Gates-UAE initiative for innovation and $57 million from the Bezos Earth Fund for climate-smart agriculture. Additionally, a public-private SAFE Initiative in Africa and the Middle East has mobilized $10 billion. Global agricultural subsidies are estimated to be around $700 billion per year. The vast majority of this funding goes toward supporting the status quo, including intense and industrialized agriculture, which is often destined for animal feed or processed foods. Current government incentives primarily promote monocultures, industrial livestock production, and a heavy reliance on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.

The media and public perception

Few issues cut as close to home as food. Calls to curb meat consumption are growing louder, yet meat intake is climbing with rising incomes in emerging economies, coupled with entrenched habits in wealthier nations, pushing consumption higher. Resistance to reducing meat consumption runs deep. It isn’t just a meal—it’s culture. From Sunday roasts to steakhouse dinners and festive feasts worldwide, animal protein is tied to tradition and identity.

Plant-based alternatives can appear less satisfying and are often viewed with some suspicion. Confusion surrounding nutrition, combined with targeted disinformation campaigns, exacerbates this issue. In the UK, headlines in October 2024 in the Telegraph, such as “Lab-Grown Meat Is Proving to Be a Grotesque Misadventure,” captured skepticism toward the entire sector, citing high costs, technological hurdles, and public unease with labels like “Frankenmeat.” The Washington Post reported on health warnings tied to plant-based alternatives, highlighting scientific studies that grouped meat substitutes with other ultra-processed foods linked to heart disease, glossing over methodological nuances. For example, healthy plant-based foods should not be compared with a box of donuts.

The nonprofit Center for Consumer Freedom, funded by interests in the meat industry, launched full-page newspaper ads in 2020 that portrayed plant-based burgers as “ultra-processed imitations” or likened them to dog food. A similar campaign by the think tank, Center for the Environment and Welfare, compared cultured meat cells with “tumor” cells.

Proposals for meat taxes, climate-driven dietary shifts, or calls to reduce livestock farming are often framed by conservatives as attacks on tradition, national identity, and personal freedom. In Germany, farmers and political critics pushed back against proposed increases to meat taxes or VAT on meat, arguing such levies would burden consumers and harm livelihoods. In the Netherlands, discussions about a potential meat tax prompted political pushback, with government coalition parties and meat industry associations arguing that a levy could make grocery bills less affordable for ordinary consumers. In France, politicians have positioned steak and charcuterie as part of the cultural heritage, pushing back against calls for plant-based school meals. In the UK, media outlets such as the Telegraph have described proposals to reduce red meat consumption as an attack on the Sunday roast, tapping into working-class anxieties.

People still perceive meat as tastier, more convenient, and a more dependable source of protein than the alternatives available. Until substitutes can rival meat on these terms, the trend will likely continue upward.

A necessary change

The polluter pays principle is not a tax on consumers—it’s a tax on environmental damage, unnecessary harm to animals, and widespread deforestation. It’s a tax on corporations and manufacturers who have profited from the environment, earning billions.

Food systems should pay their actual ecological costs, as the era of subsidized industrial meat is winding down. By integrating this sector into the polluter-pays economy, we move from lip service to climate action, from compensation to transformation. Clean energy isn’t enough; clean food is next. “Much like the fossil fuel lobbyists who argue that the world can’t afford to do away with oil and gas if we want energy security, Big Ag lobbyists defend a current status quo that’s actively heating up the planet in the name of food security,” stated a 2023 Guardian article.",https://i0.wp.com/s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.nationofchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/25094635/food-day2-image.jpg?fit=1009%2C476&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-13 12:03:36.435303

The futures are trending higher after the December consumer price index came in at 2.7%, which matched Wall Street expectations. The reversal in the futures comes after a wild Monday that saw stocks get hammered on the open, amid news of Department of Justice subpoenas sent to Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell regarding his testimony to Congress last summer. Initially, all the major indices plunged on the news, then reversed sharply to finish higher on the day. Both the Dow Jones Industrials, which closed up 0.17% at 49,590, and the S&P 500, which ended the day higher by 0.16% at 6,977, once again printed new all-time highs as the January strength continues. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was last seen at 23,833, up 0.25%, and the Russel 2000 continued its red-hot start to the year, closing at 2,635, up 0.44%. The R2K is leading all the major indices in 2026, up 5.7% on the year. Wall Street is now looking forward to the start of the fourth-quarter earnings, with the big money-center banks reporting later this week.

Treasury Bonds:

Yields were higher across the entire Treasury curve on Monday, and you can bet that the controversy with the Federal Reserve receiving subpoenas was a big reason for the selling. The uncertainty about Fed independence and the potential for government intervention pushed bond prices down, echoing past “Sell America” events in 2025. The reality is this will likely blow over quickly, as a mountain of economic news and the start of earnings season will redirect attention. The 30-year bond closed at 4.84%, while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.19%.

Oil and Gas:

Prices were higher across the energy complex on Monday as geopolitical tensions in multiple regions around the globe and the potential for long-term changes to the global oil supply drove crude oil prices higher, with the WTI and Brent benchmarks both climbing. Brent Crude closed trading on Monday at $64.01, up 1.06%, while West Texas Intermediate finished the session at $59.63, up 0.85%. Natural gas stormed back after a wave of frigid weather swept across a large swath of the U.S. Monday, closing up 6.5% at $3.38.

Gold:

In what seems like a never-ending story, Gold closed Monday at $4,596, up another 1.94%. Wall Street’s $5,000 price targets for the precious metal could arrive much sooner than expected. The combination of numerous geopolitical hotspots and Federal Reserve news once again provided the stiff tailwind that has been present for well over a year. Silver also bolted higher on Monday, climbing a massive 6.6% to close trading at $85.14. Wall Street’s $100 price targets are getting closer by the week, and with most rebalancing finished, the path for Silver looks higher.

Crypto:

The crypto market traded range-bound and sideways on Monday, influenced by a “risk-off” environment, much like other asset classes, driven by rising geopolitical tensions and uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy, including the escalating dispute between the Trump administration and Federal Reserve Chair Powell. At 8A EST, Bitcoin was quoted at $92,010, while Ethereum was posted at $3, 131.

JNJ Price Action: Johnson & Johnson shares were up 0.46% at $210.68 at the time of publication on Tuesday.","Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) on Monday reportedly secured a partial legal victory after Delaware's highest court overturned a portion of a $1 billion damages award tied to its acquisition of surgical robotics company Auris Health.

In a unanimous ruling issued Monday, Reuters reported that the Delaware Supreme Court set aside part of a September 2024 judgment that had favored former Auris shareholders.

In 2019, Johnson & Johnson acquired Auris Health for approximately $3.4 billion in cash. Additional contingent payments of up to $2.35 billion, in the aggregate, may be payable upon reaching certain predetermined milestones.

What Happened

The lawsuit filed in 2024 claimed that Johnson & Johnson was struggling to develop its own surgical robot, Verb, despite significant investment.

With Verb behind schedule and surgical robotics strategically critical, Johnson & Johnson viewed Auris as a solution.

Auris agreed after securing Johnson & Johnson's commitment to apply commercially reasonable efforts consistent with a ""priority medical device.""

Following the acquisition, Johnson & Johnson failed to honor that commitment. Instead of supporting Auris' iPlatform's regulatory progress, Johnson & Johnson forced it into direct competition with Verb under ""Project Manhattan."" This halted regulatory momentum and diverted engineering resources. Although iPlatform ultimately outperformed Verb, Johnson & Johnson merged the two programs, effectively subordinating iPlatform to salvage its Verb investment.

Auris's former shareholders sued for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and fraud.

In 2024, the court found that Johnson & Johnson breached its obligations by failing to prioritize iPlatform, undermining the regulatory milestones, and acting to avoid the earnout. Johnson & Johnson also breached the implied covenant by failing to support a revised regulatory pathway. Separately, Johnson & Johnson was found to have committed fraud by failing to disclose a regulatory investigation tied to a Monarch milestone it had represented as virtually guaranteed.

Damages, including interest, exceed $1 billion, compensating Auris's former shareholders for lost earnout payments.

Why It Matters

Reuters noted that Justice Abigail LeGrow rejected a key finding made by the Chancery Court. She ruled that the lower court erred in concluding Johnson & Johnson had an implied obligation to secure regulatory approval by the end of 2021 for an iPlatform product related to abdominal procedures.

The Supreme Court said the language of the merger agreement did not support that requirement.

Despite that reversal, the justices upheld most of the findings issued by Vice Chancellor Lori Will, leaving intact conclusions that Johnson & Johnson failed to meet other contractual obligations.

The case was remanded to Will to reassess damages in light of the ruling.

What's Next

Johnson & Johnson said it is reviewing its options following the decision.

The court's decision on Monday sends the case back to the Delaware Chancery Court for a recalculation of damages. As a result, the total award, including interest, could decline by a couple of hundred million dollars.

In December 2025, a Baltimore jury ordered Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries to pay over $1.5 billion to a woman who claimed that decades of exposure to asbestos in the company's talc-based products caused her peritoneal mesothelioma, a form of cancer.

JNJ Price Action: Johnson & Johnson shares were up 0.46% at $210.68 at the time of publication on Tuesday. The stock is approaching its 52-week high of $215.18, according to Benzinga Pro data.

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

Founded in 2005, BTIG is among the top 10 U.S. brokers for high-touch equity volume executed and has been part of more than 1,275 announced investment banking transactions since 2015. With more than 700 employees, BTIG, LLC and its affiliates operate out of 20 cities throughout the U.S., Europe, Asia and Australia.

Following the transaction, the BTIG leadership team will join U.S. Bancorp and continue to lead the business going forward. LeRoy – a key architect of BTIG’s expansion since joining the firm in 2008 – will remain CEO of BTIG, reporting to Stephen Philipson, Vice Chair and Head of Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking at U.S. Bancorp. BTIG Co-Founder and Executive Chairman Steven Starker will continue his current day-to-day role of engaging and interacting with BTIG’s largest institutional and corporate clients and driving business development across all departments.

U.S. Bancorp has strategically built a robust capital markets business that has become an important driver of revenue growth. Today, U.S. Bancorp – which serves nearly 90% of the Fortune 1000 – ranks among the top companies in the investment grade bond and syndicated loan markets. The company also has well-established interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange capabilities. In recent years, the capital markets business has expanded into commodities, structured credit and subscription finance. This focus has translated into a capital markets business with approximately $1.4 billion in revenue in the 12 months prior to September 30, 2025, and a compound annual growth rate of 21 percent between 2021 and 2024.

U.S. Bancorp and BTIG have worked closely over the past decade. Since 2014, BTIG has been the company’s equity capital markets referral partner. In 2023, the two began an M&A advisory referral program. The partnership has resulted in many U.S. Bancorp clients experiencing the high-touch service and excellent execution for which BTIG is known.

“BTIG is a world-class firm with talented professionals who align with our unshakable commitment to lasting success and growth for clients,” said Philipson. “BTIG’s addition to U.S. Bancorp is a strategic move to fill key product gaps for our corporate and institutional clients, enabling us to offer a more comprehensive suite of capital markets services. At the same time, BTIG clients will gain access to U.S. Bancorp’s robust financial platform and extensive product set, including investment services, asset management, wealth management and payments.”

“Today marks an exciting new chapter for BTIG,” said Starker. “Joining forces with U.S. Bancorp will allow us to accelerate our growth and further enhance client service. We are energized by the shared vision between our organizations and confident that our combined capabilities will deliver significant value and drive future success.”

Walk into a hotel, a food processing plant, a pharmaceutical lab, or a data center, and chances are you’re walking through Ecolab Inc.’s real product: an invisible mesh of water, hygiene, and energy systems quietly keeping everything clean, compliant, and increasingly, low-carbon.

Ecolab Inc. is often described as a chemical or cleaning company, but that framing is now badly outdated. The company has spent the last decade rebuilding itself as a sustainability and operations technology platform: dosing chemicals with milliliter precision, monitoring water flows in real time, and optimizing industrial boilers with machine learning. The value proposition is clear and brutally pragmatic: use less water, less heat, less chemistry – while keeping higher standards of hygiene, safety, and uptime.

What makes Ecolab Inc. so relevant right now is the convergence of three pressures on its customers: regulatory emissions targets, volatile energy and water costs, and tighter hygiene expectations from consumers and authorities. That’s creating a premium on technologies that can cut resource use without requiring a full rip-and-replace of existing infrastructure. This is where Ecolab Inc. has turned its traditional field-services business into a data-rich sustainability engine.

Get all details on Ecolab Inc. here

Inside the Flagship: Ecolab Inc.

Ecolab Inc. does not have a single consumer-facing flagship product like an iPhone or a Tesla Model Y. Its flagship is an integrated portfolio that blends chemistry, hardware, and software across water treatment, cleaning & sanitation, and infection prevention. What unifies these lines is a simple promise: measurable savings and risk reduction for complex, high-stakes operations.

At the center of that promise are several core platforms that illustrate what Ecolab Inc. has become.

Digital Control: The ECOLAB3D and Nalco Water digital platforms

Ecolab’s most transformative product shift is its move into industrial IoT and analytics. The company’s Nalco Water unit and the broader ECOLAB3D platform act as always-on monitoring and optimization layers for water and energy systems.

Real-time sensing: Sensors embedded in boilers, cooling towers, and process water lines continuously track flow rates, temperatures, water quality, and chemical dosing levels.

Cloud analytics: Data streams into ECOLAB3D, which applies analytics and increasingly AI-driven pattern recognition to flag inefficiencies, leaks, scaling risks, microbial growth, or non-compliance.

Actionable insights: Instead of just selling chemical formulas, Ecolab Inc. delivers dashboards and alerts that translate into hard metrics: cubic meters of water saved, therms of gas avoided, tons of CO? emissions reduced.

The result is that Ecolab Inc. looks less like an industrial supplier and more like a subscription-based performance partner. For large manufacturing sites, food and beverage plants, and heavy industry, the difference between reactive maintenance and data-guided optimization can mean millions in avoided downtime and utility costs.

Water Management as a Strategic Product

One of Ecolab Inc.’s most strategically important product domains is water. As water stress intensifies globally, companies are being pushed not just to consume less, but to prove they are doing so.

Ecolab’s Nalco Water portfolio includes:

Water reuse and recycling systems that allow plants to reclaim and safely reuse process water instead of relying solely on fresh intake.

Cooling and boiler water treatment programs that reduce scaling and corrosion, enabling lower blowdown rates and higher efficiency.

Digital water intelligence modules inside ECOLAB3D that model plant-wide water balance, identify high?leakage zones, and benchmark performance against best practices.

The company positions water not merely as a cost line, but as a core ESG performance indicator. For global brands that publish annual sustainability reports, Ecolab Inc. offers something rare: auditable, meter-level data that links specific process changes to specific water savings. That makes it a behind-the-scenes enabler of public climate commitments and investor-grade ESG metrics.

Food Safety, Hygiene, and Infection Prevention

Another pillar of Ecolab Inc.’s offering is hygiene and infection prevention in hospitality, healthcare, food service, and manufacturing. In this arena, Ecolab’s products are less glamorous but no less critical: surface disinfectants, warewashing systems, laundry solutions, hand hygiene programs, and clean-in-place (CIP) systems for industrial equipment.

What’s changed is the digital layer and integration:

Connected dispensers and dosing systems ensure that cleaning agents are mixed at precisely the right concentrations – boosting performance while cutting waste.

Compliance reporting tools generate auditable logs of cleaning cycles, temperatures, and contact times, critical for regulated environments like food processing and hospitals.

End-to-end program design wraps chemistry in training, on-site consulting, and digital documentation, turning what used to be a commodity product into a high-stickiness service.

For hotels and restaurants, this means more consistent hygiene standards and lower product usage per wash or per room. For hospitals and labs, it can mean fewer hospital-acquired infections and better infection control compliance – metrics that carry serious financial and reputational weight.

Energy and Emissions: Decarbonization as a Feature, Not a Slogan

Ecolab Inc. increasingly positions its products as emissions-reduction tools. By optimizing water systems and cleaning processes, the company can directly reduce customers’ fuel and electricity use. For instance:

Tuning boiler chemistry and blowdown can improve fuel efficiency.

Better heat-exchanger cleanliness reduces the energy needed to achieve target temperatures.

Water reuse cuts the energy required for pumping, heating, and treatment.

The company quantifies these impacts in terms of carbon, embedding sustainability outcomes into its core sales narrative. This is critical for sectors under pressure to decarbonize operations – from food and beverage to data centers – but reluctant to overhaul physical infrastructure. Ecolab Inc. offers a relatively low-friction route to measurable emissions cuts.

Market Rivals: Ecolab Inc. Aktie vs. The Competition

Ecolab Inc. operates in a sprawling competitive landscape that spans industrial chemicals, specialty materials, digital water platforms, and hygiene solutions. Its closest rivals attack different parts of its portfolio, but few match its fully integrated chemistry-plus-digital-plus-service model.

Diversey – Competing on Hygiene and Institutional Cleaning

On the hygiene and institutional cleaning front, Diversey is a prominent direct competitor. Products such as Diversey Suma for kitchen hygiene and Diversey Oxivir disinfectant lines compete head-to-head with Ecolab Inc.’s food service, hospitality, and healthcare offerings.

Compared directly to Diversey Suma and related cleaning systems, Ecolab Inc. leans more heavily into end-to-end program integration and on-site service density. Ecolab field teams are embedded at many large customer sites, offering continuous optimization and staff training rather than periodic check-ins. Diversey’s strength lies in its agile innovation pipeline and targeted hygiene chemistries, but it has historically had less scale on the analytics and deep industrial water side where Ecolab Inc. is strongest.

Solenis – Rivals in Water and Process Treatment

In industrial water and process treatment, Solenis is one of Ecolab Inc.’s most relevant challengers. Its products such as Solenis OnGuard monitoring systems and specialty chemicals for pulp & paper, power, and chemical processing directly compete with Ecolab’s Nalco Water solutions.

Compared directly to Solenis OnGuard technologies, Ecolab Inc.’s edge is its broad, cross-industry footprint and the scale of its digital platform. Solenis offers deep technical strength in specific verticals, particularly pulp and paper, while Ecolab’s portfolio reaches from beverage bottling and mining to microelectronics cooling and data center water reuse. Ecolab Inc.’s ECOLAB3D architecture is designed to aggregate insights across sectors, allowing it to standardize best practices and benchmark performance across a global client base.

Veolia and the Water-Tech Giants

Zooming out, utilities and infrastructure companies like Veolia also compete for the water-technology budget. Veolia’s digital products, such as its Hubgrade performance monitoring platform, aim to optimize water and wastewater systems for municipalities and industry.

Compared directly to Veolia Hubgrade, Ecolab Inc. generally plays closer to the process level inside factories, plants, and buildings rather than at the municipal-network scale. Veolia is often engaged when a customer is outsourcing water infrastructure entirely, while Ecolab is embedded inside the customer’s own operations teams, tweaking chemistry and systems in line with production goals and safety standards.

Where Competitors Hit Hard – and Where They Fall Short

Rivals bring their own strengths:

Diversey can be more aggressive on price in specific hygiene categories, especially in markets where Ecolab’s service density is lower.

Solenis has strong specialization in particular industries, making it a formidable alternative for customers who prioritize niche technical depth over broad portfolio integration.

Veolia can bundle water-tech with large-scale infrastructure projects, offering an end-to-end solution that sits outside the typical remit of Ecolab’s service teams.

But none of these competitors fully replicate Ecolab Inc.’s core strategic play: high-touch field service tied directly to measurable sustainability metrics, all layered over a rapidly growing data and analytics stack. That combination is what turns everyday cleaning and water treatment into a long-term, sticky relationship rather than a recurring tender for lowest-cost chemistry.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Ecolab Inc.’s advantage is not one single blockbuster product, but a set of reinforcing moats built over decades and upgraded for a sustainability-first era.

1. Service-Led, Data-Backed Model

Ecolab Inc. employs thousands of field service specialists who operate on-site at customer locations worldwide. Historically, that meant inspecting boilers, troubleshooting dishwashers, or recalibrating dosing pumps. Today, those same teams are armed with dashboards from ECOLAB3D, predictive maintenance alerts, and quantified sustainability metrics.

This hybrid of service and software is hard to copy. Competitors can emulate parts of it – a good formula here, a smart sensor there – but replicating the global, always-on field presence and the integrated data stack is capital intensive and time consuming. Customers increasingly see Ecolab Inc. not just as a supplier, but as a quasi-outsourced operations partner.

2. Sustainability as a Business Outcome, Not a Marketing Add-On

Where many industrial players talk about sustainability in terms of marketing narratives, Ecolab Inc. has embedded it in contract-level outcomes. Proposals are framed in cubic meters of water saved, kilowatt-hours of energy avoided, and tons of CO? emissions reduced – all tied to the customer’s publicly stated ESG goals.

For global brands under scrutiny from regulators, investors, and consumers, this is compelling. Ecolab’s tools help turn high-level net-zero pledges into specific, trackable projects: retrofitting cooling towers to save water, optimizing CIP systems to cut hot-water usage, or reducing chemical over-dosing that leads to additional wastewater loads.

3. Portfolio Breadth Across Critical Sectors

Ecolab Inc. touches a long list of sectors that cannot afford failure: hospitals, pharmaceutical manufacturing, food processing, large-scale catering, hotels, mining, power, and the fast-growing data center segment. This diversification gives Ecolab resilience against downturns in any one vertical, and cross-pollination of ideas from one industry to another.

It also strengthens the business case for its digital platforms. When ECOLAB3D implements a new optimization strategy for cooling systems in a beverage plant, those learnings can be quickly applied to similar cooling challenges in data centers or electronics manufacturing. The more customers deploy the platform, the smarter and more valuable it becomes.

4. Incremental, Not Disruptive

Unlike pure-play climate-tech startups that often depend on customers making big, risky capital investments, Ecolab Inc. usually sells incremental improvements layered onto existing assets: better boiler chemistry, a smarter water treatment program, more efficient cleaning protocols. The payback periods are typically short, making CFOs more comfortable.

This incrementalism is a hidden advantage. It aligns with how industrial and hospitality operators actually upgrade: step by step, avoiding downtime and preserving existing equipment. Ecolab sits perfectly in that pattern, making decarbonization and water conservation feel manageable rather than disruptive.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

To understand how this product strategy flows into shareholder value, you have to look at the performance of Ecolab Inc. Aktie (ISIN US2824031014).

Using live market data from major financial platforms, Ecolab Inc.’s stock most recently traded at a price in the low-to-mid $220 range per share, with a market capitalization in the tens of billions of dollars. As of the latest available market session, the stock is trading closer to its 52?week highs than its lows, reflecting sustained investor confidence. The pricing and performance figures are cross?checked from multiple real?time sources, and the timestamp for this data is aligned with the latest trading session on U.S. markets; when markets are closed, these figures represent the last official closing price rather than intraday moves.

What matters more than the precise tick-by-tick movement is why investors are rewarding Ecolab Inc. Aktie. A few themes stand out:

Resilient, recurring revenue: Much of Ecolab’s business is built on ongoing service contracts and consumable products. Once embedded, customers are reluctant to switch due to the operational risk of changing water or hygiene partners.

Sustainability tailwinds: As more companies set science-based targets for emissions and water use, demand grows for exactly the kinds of optimization programs Ecolab Inc. sells. That positions the stock as a structural, not cyclical, growth story.

Digital expansion: The market increasingly values Ecolab’s digital platforms as potential margin enhancers and growth multipliers. Software-like economics layered onto an already sticky services base is a powerful narrative.

Investors are effectively betting that Ecolab Inc.’s integrated product strategy – chemistry plus IoT plus analytics plus field service – will keep translating into margin expansion and steady top-line growth. Each new deployment of Nalco Water digital monitoring or ECOLAB3D analytics increases switching costs for customers and deepens the company’s data moat.

There are risks, of course. Intense competition in hygiene and industrial chemicals keeps pricing pressure alive, and economic slowdowns can hit discretionary capital spending at customer sites. Regulatory shifts could also change how customers account for water and emissions savings, affecting how quickly projects are approved. But overall, the direction of travel is favorable: more regulation, more ESG scrutiny, and more need for proven, measurable sustainability solutions.

In that context, Ecolab Inc. Aktie is less a simple industrial stock and more a proxy for the industrialization of sustainability. The better its core products help companies save water, cut emissions, and stay compliant, the more embedded – and valuable – Ecolab becomes.

The Bottom Line

Ecolab Inc. is an archetype of a 20th-century industrial supplier that has quietly evolved into a 21st-century sustainability and data platform. Its flagship is not a single device or app, but a web of technologies and services that sit inside some of the world’s most critical and water-intensive operations.

In a market where climate and resource constraints are no longer abstractions but line items on the balance sheet, that positioning gives Ecolab Inc. both operational relevance and strategic leverage. Competitors can challenge it on price or niche domains, but few can match the breadth of its portfolio or the depth of its field-service and data infrastructure.

For customers, that means a partner capable of turning sustainability goals into concrete, plant-level actions. For investors, it means a company whose product strength and recurring-revenue engine are increasingly aligned with the biggest structural trend in global industry: doing more with less water, less energy, and less risk.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405021_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 10:01:14.722435

NEW YORK, Jan. 13, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Mantra Health, the digital mental health provider built exclusively to support student well-being and success across higher education, today announced the launch of Beacon, the first early alert and intelligence platform designed to improve student mental health, well-being, persistence, and success, which ultimately contributes to institutional retention efforts. The Jed Foundation (JED)*, a leading nonprofit that protects emotional health and prevents suicide for our nation's teens and young adults, will strategically advise on the implementation of Beacon.

Developed after 18 months of research and application, the persistence intelligence platform gives higher education institutions the clarity needed to proactively identify students at risk of dropout and make more strategic, data-informed investments in long-term retention initiatives across different populations. Named after the unwavering light guiding weary travelers to shore, Beacon offers a clear, steady path to support and care for students facing complex challenges and gives institutions the insights needed to make strategic investments.

The platform includes a semi-annual student well-being assessment administered to cohorts of students pre-determined by the participating institution, such as first-year students, graduate students, or the entire student body. Unlike traditional screening solutions that can take several months to return actionable insights, Beacon combines data from holistic student wellness assessments with institutional data to provide university leadership and staff with a dynamic, real-time view of student needs at the individual level and across populations.

""To make a significant impact on college student mental health, we encourage institutions to strategically transition from a reactive safety net to a more comprehensive and proactive system of preventative support,"" said Dr. Tony Walker, Senior Vice President of School Programs and Consulting at JED. ""Early detection and connection to resources like screening tools are critical to promote emotional and mental health and prevent suicide among young people.""

JED brings significant experience to its strategic advisory role on Beacon's implementation, including 25 years of work with over 550 colleges, 150 high schools, and 28 school districts representing over 670 schools. Through JED's proven technical-assistance programs and evidence-informed strategies, more than seven million students nationwide have been reached.

""Building an infrastructure for actionable risk identification is extremely challenging and very few institutions have the resources to build the real-time tools needed to make data-informed decisions. Beacon provides the opportunity to act proactively,"" says Matt Kennedy, CEO and Co-founder of Mantra Health. ""Once implemented, it will help institutions reach a far greater percentage of their student body, retain students at risk of stopping out, make more targeted institutional changes to improve student well-being, and create more efficient ways of connecting students to personalized care.""

While the launch of Beacon is a robust early alert and intelligence platform today, it signals the next phase of Mantra Health's vision for advancing student well-being and persistence. Mantra Health will continue to expand Beacon's predictive analytics and AI capabilities to help institutions move beyond identification to automated intervention modeling. By leveraging AI to synthesize students' needs with institutional resources, the platform will help leaders forecast which interventions will yield the highest measurable impact on student well-being and retention.

Beacon has already shown significant potential to drive meaningful change. An October 2025 launch at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), for instance, which focused on first-time, full-year students, achieved a nearly 39% completion rate and surfaced a critical group of students at higher risk of dropout. This led NJIT to make strategic decisions, including launching a six-part workshop series for around their high-risk areas, as well as conducting personalized outreach to students at risk of stopping out.

""With Beacon, the institution demonstrates care by directly giving students the opportunity to express where they have concerns with persistence and success. Beacon also provides assurance that students who report concerns impacting their ability to persist are, at bare minimum, receiving personalized resources,"" said Sean Dowd, MSW, Senior Associate Dean of Students at NJIT.

For institutions across the country, Beacon brings a new paradigm in supporting their student's well-being proactively rather than reactively. This ultimately increases their student body's persistence through to graduation and retains much-needed tuition revenue.

In October, J&J announced its intention to separate its Orthopaedics franchise into a standalone orthopedics-focused company called DePuy Synthes.
The separation should also improve its MedTech unit’s growth and margins as the Orthopaedics franchise has been a slow-growth business for J&J.
J&J expects to launch new products like Shockwave C2 Aero catheter and Tecnis intraocular lens in the United States in 2026.

The MedTech segment accounts for around 36% of J&J’s total revenues.

In the MedTech segment, though issues in Asia Pacific markets, specifically China, are hurting sales, J&J is successfully shifting its portfolio to high innovation, high growth markets, particularly in Cardiovascular. With the acquisitions of Shockwave in 2024 and Abiomed in 2022, J&J has become a category leader in four of the largest and highest-growth cardiovascular intervention MedTech markets.

Sales in J&J’s MedTech business have improved in the past two quarters, driven by the acquired cardiovascular businesses, Abiomed and Shockwave, as well as Surgical Vision and wound closure in Surgery. Improvements in J&J’s electrophysiology business also drove the growth.

The MedTech segment is expected to continue seeing strong momentum in Cardiovascular, Surgery and Vision in the fourth quarter, backed by increased adoption of newly launched products.

However, the company continues to face headwinds in China. Sales in China are being hurt by the impact of the volume-based procurement (VBP) program, which is a government-driven cost containment effort in China. Sales in China are likely to have been hurt by the impact of the VBP program in the fourth quarter.

In October, J&J announced its intention to separate its Orthopaedics franchise into a standalone orthopedics-focused company called DePuy Synthes.

The decision aligns with J&J’s efforts to shift its MedTech portfolio to high-innovation, high-growth markets like cardiovascular and robotic surgery. The separation should also improve its MedTech unit’s growth and margins as the Orthopaedics franchise has been a slow-growth business for J&J. An update on the progress of the Orthopaedics franchise spin-off is expected on the fourth-quarter conference call.

On the conference call, investors will also look for updates on the MedTech unit’s outlook for 2026. Earlier, J&J had said that in 2026, it expects better growth in the MedTech business than 2025 levels, driven by increased adoption of newly launched products across all MedTech platforms and increased focus on higher-growth markets. J&J expects to launch new products like Shockwave C2 Aero catheter and Tecnis intraocular lens in the United States in 2026. It also filed a regulatory submission for the OTTAVA robotic surgical system earlier this month. These new products may also contribute to growth in 2026.

Our estimates for the MedTech unit suggest a CAGR of around 5.4% over the next three years.

J&J’s Key Competitors in the Medical Devices Market

J&J’s MedTech unit faces strong competition from several major players in the medical device industry, like Medtronic MDT, Abbott, Stryker SYK and Boston Scientific BSX.

Boston Scientific markets products for cardiovascular, endoscopy, urology and neuromodulation. Abbott is known for its medical device products across cardiovascular, diagnostics and diabetes care.

Latest purchase brings Delta's order book to 130 Boeing airplanes as it builds future fleet

Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Delta Air Lines today announced the U.S. carrier placed its first direct order for up to 60 787 Dreamliners to support long-haul international growth and renew the airline's widebody fleet. Delta's purchase of 30 787-10 jets with opportunity for up to 30 more of the largest 787 variant will enable the airline's expansion and modernization plans on high-demand transatlantic and South American routes.

""Delta is building the fleet for the future, enhancing the customer experience, driving operational improvements and providing steady replacements for less efficient, older aircraft in the decade to come,"" said Ed Bastian, Delta's chief executive officer. ""Most importantly, these aircraft will be operated by the best aviation professionals in the industry, providing Delta's welcoming, elevated and caring service to travelers worldwide.""

With capacity for up to 336 passengers and 25% lower fuel use than the airplanes it replaces, the 787-10 offers the lowest operating cost per seat of any widebody airplane. Delivering superior comfort for passengers, the 787 Dreamliner features the largest windows of any widebody airplane flying today and air that is pressurized at a lower cabin altitude, which will help Delta's customers arrive at their destinations feeling more refreshed.

""We are excited that Delta Air Lines has selected the 787-10 to join its fleet of the future. The 787 Dreamliner's unmatched efficiency, range, and passenger comfort make it a perfect fit for Delta's international expansion and fleet modernization,"" said Stephanie Pope, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. ""Our team looks forward to delivering new Dreamliners to Delta and supporting their commitments to provide an exceptional passenger experience and advance sustainability in aviation.""

With more than 460 Boeing airplanes currently in service, Delta has flown most Boeing single-aisle and widebody models across its domestic and international networks over the decades. This new widebody order further strengthens that partnership and supports U.S. aerospace manufacturing jobs across Boeing's production system and supply chain.

Today's purchase brings Delta's firm order book to 130 Boeing airplanes, including the airline's order for 100 737-10 jets. The efficiency and flexibility of the 787-10 and 737-10 will enable Delta to fly more passengers on more routes as the airline expands and diversifies its network.

Founded in 1876 and headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, Lilly’s product lineup comprises leading treatments such as Mounjaro and Zepbound for type 2 diabetes and weight management, Trulicity and Jardiance for diabetes, Verzenio for cancer, Taltz for autoimmune conditions, and established insulin therapies like Humalog and Humulin.

The leading drug manufacturer plans to release its Q4 earnings shortly. Ahead of the event, analysts expect Eli Lilly to report a profit of $7.47 per share, up 40.4% from $5.32 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company has exceeded Wall Street’s EPS estimates in three of the last four quarters, while missing on another occasion.

Moving forward, analysts expect Eli Lilly to report an EPS of $23.95 in fiscal 2025, up 84.4% from $12.99 in fiscal year 2024. Its fiscal 2026 EPS is projected to rise 40.3% annually to $33.59.

LLY’s stock has surged 35.1% over the past 52 weeks, outperforming the broader S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 19.7% gains and the S&P 500 Healthcare Sector SPDR’s (XLV) 12.7% returns over the same time frame.

The Nimbus collaboration, which includes a $55 million upfront payment and up to $1.3 billion in milestone-based payments, is aimed at expanding Lilly’s obesity pipeline beyond injectables, while the potential Ventyx acquisition would further deepen its drug portfolio, together reinforcing investor confidence in Lilly’s long-term strategy to strengthen its leadership in the weight-loss therapeutics market.

As the technology giant prepares to release its quarterly figures, it has received another vote of confidence from Wall Street, with Bank of America issuing a positive update. However, alongside raising its price target, the firm's analysts have cautioned about near-term pressure on profit margins and slightly tempered expectations for the coming year.

The latest show of support came from BofA Securities, which on Tuesday morning reaffirmed its ""Buy"" rating for IBM shares while lifting its price objective from $315 to $335. This move aligns with the optimistic stance taken by Jefferies earlier in January. On January 6, Jefferies upgraded the stock and set a price target of $360, emphasizing the company's potential in cloud computing and its Red Hat division. Bank of America's confidence, in contrast, is primarily anchored to IBM's robust cash flow generation.

The stock has responded favorably to this analyst activity. It is currently trading near its 52-week high of $312.18 and has advanced more than 7% since the start of the year.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying IBM?

Long-Term Drivers: Software and Strategic Acquisitions

Despite some near-term cautions, the long-term outlook from analysts remains positive. The high-margin software business is seen as a key growth engine. Furthermore, the impending integration of the $11 billion acquisition of Confluent is viewed as a strategic positive that supports the buy recommendation. Looking ahead to fiscal 2026, Bank of America projects that IBM will generate approximately $15 billion in free cash flow, a figure that underscores the investment case for the equity.

Margin Pressures Loom as a Near-Term Challenge

The analysis is not without its caveats. Experts anticipate that the upcoming quarterly report will be impacted by an estimated $400 million in workforce restructuring charges. This expense is likely to cause IBM to fall just short of its own margin expansion target for fiscal 2025. Following what is expected to be an exceptionally strong 2025, Bank of America forecasts a somewhat more moderate performance for 2026.

All eyes are now on January 28. When IBM discloses its results for the fourth quarter of 2025, the critical focus for investors will be whether management's guidance for 2026 confirms the anticipated growth within the software segment.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2430353_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 11:15:22.461053

Earnings Snapshot: A Beat and a Miss The company's reported figures for the quarter ending December 31, 2025, show a clear divergence between profit and revenue performance relative to Wall Street forecasts.
Revenue (Sales): Reported at $5.18 billion, coming in below the estimated $5.29 billion.
This initial dip suggests investors are weighing the earnings beat against the revenue miss and any forward-looking commentary from management.

The global financial services company beat expectations on the bottom line but fell short on the top line, a dynamic that appears to be reflected in the stock's initial market reaction.

Earnings Snapshot: A Beat and a Miss

The company's reported figures for the quarter ending December 31, 2025, show a clear divergence between profit and revenue performance relative to Wall Street forecasts.

Earnings Per Share (Non-GAAP): Reported at $2.08, surpassing the analyst consensus estimate of $2.04.

Revenue (Sales): Reported at $5.18 billion, coming in below the estimated $5.29 billion.

This pattern of higher profitability on slightly lower revenue suggests effective cost management and potentially stronger performance in higher-margin business segments, even as overall revenue generation faced headwinds or timing differences.

Market Reaction and Recent Performance

The immediate market response to the earnings release appears cautious. In pre-market trading following the report, the stock is indicated lower, with a decline of approximately 0.6%. This initial dip suggests investors are weighing the earnings beat against the revenue miss and any forward-looking commentary from management.

Looking at a broader timeframe, the stock's performance has been relatively muted:

Over the past week, shares are essentially flat.

Over the past month, the stock has posted a modest gain of about 1.7%.

This indicates that the market had not priced in a significant positive surprise ahead of the report, and the mixed results are now being digested.

Press Release Summary and Forward Outlook

According to the company's press release, the fourth-quarter profit was driven by gains in fee revenue and interest income. This aligns with the earnings beat and points to strength in BNY Mellon's core servicing and treasury activities. The company has also declared its regular quarterly dividend, a sign of continued commitment to shareholder returns.

While the press release itself does not provide a specific quantitative financial outlook from management, analyst estimates for the coming periods offer a benchmark for future performance. Analysts are currently forecasting for BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORP:

Q1 2026 Revenue: Approximately $5.23 billion

Q1 2026 EPS: Approximately $1.87

Full-Year 2026 Revenue: Approximately $21.47 billion

Full-Year 2026 EPS: Approximately $8.40

Investors will likely focus on the upcoming conference call for management's commentary on the revenue trajectory, net interest income expectations, and fee growth trends for 2026 to assess if the company is positioned to meet or exceed these estimates.

Conclusion

BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORP's fourth-quarter results underscore the complex environment for global custodial and asset-servicing banks. The ability to expand profitability in the face of a revenue shortfall demonstrates operational discipline. However, the market's initial tepid reaction highlights the importance investors place on top-line growth as an indicator of underlying business momentum and market share. The path of interest rates and equity market levels in 2026 will be critical drivers for both the company's fee-based and interest-sensitive revenues.

After all those years chasing TV budgets, it has to irk the folks at Google just a tad that the company completely whiffed on an ad market that should have been a layup for the Silicon Valley titan.

After all - text ads that pop up when people are making very specific searches - often with high intent - is kind of Google’s thing. And it’s the backbone of the retail media boom of the past few years.

One that Google has largely sat out, allowing for the rise of huge threats like Amazon ads, as well as new rivals like Target, Instacart, Kroger and even Uber.

Is it possible that the explosion in conversational, AI-driven search could provide Google a do-over in retail media?

Earlier this week, Google and Walmart announced a deal that would see Walmart products not only featured in Google Gemini (the company’s answer to ChatGPT), but easy for consumers to buy them right from their AI chat. This pact follows a recent tie-up between Walmart and ChatGPT.

Could this be an entry point for Google to not only get a piece of retail media spending - which still appears to have a ton of upside - and even reshape digital shopping? That feels like a big leap, yet at the rate that AI is fundamentally altering the consumer internet experience, all bets are off. A few things to consider:

We don’t quite know yet how retail media ads will work in AI searches, if at all. Will consumers be as responsive? Will the ROI be as strong?

Even before we get to advertising, we don’t know how people will shop via AI engines. Historically, when people have used search engines to shop, they wanted choice, and there was a perceived neutrality. Yet increasingly, AI search is about answers.

If a person does find the shopping ‘answer’ they were looking for via an AI interface, the new promise is that they’ll be able to buy right there. Yet at least initially, many of these ‘check out within the AI chat’ integrations appear quite limited. From Jason Del Ray’s recently launched The Aisle newsletter: “Like with the other AI checkout launches, Google’s new shopping experience is limited by support for single-item purchases only, with payments flowing through Google Pay using credentials stored in Google Wallet. Google says PayPal support is coming, with other payment options expected later. No word on exact timing.” That seems like kind of a pain in the ass no?

Also - how will ChatGPT, Gemini and others balance commercial relationships with their perceived objectivity? Seemingly, shoppers won’t like - and may soon catch on - if and when the answer to every product search is something from Walmart.

To that end, what’s to stop OpenAI and Gemini, Claude, etc. from making retail partnerships with all the big players - from Albertsons to Home Depot to Best Buy? How do they make every partner happy without overly commercializing the experience?

It is interesting to note that Walmart has to date relied on the Trade Desk to power its retail media business. The Trade Desk has long touted itself as a champion of the open web, and a counter to Google. Meanwhile, Google and its AI rivals are supposedly choking off the open web. But here are Walmart and Google proving that above all populist digital causes, business is business.

It will be fascinating to see just how big of a player Google and Gemini can be in the future of shopping. There is little reason for people to abandon relying on Amazon for day-to-day products, and its instant gratification (do I really need AI to help me when I know what I want to buy?). Plus, more consumers are finding shopping inspiration on social platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Are we sure that AI shoppability changes that?

From Google’s point of view - maybe retailers were never going to let the company power their fledgling retail media businesses a few years back. Plus, Google was focused on going after the TV market with YouTube (a good bet it turned out), while fending off more than one regulatory lawsuit.

Yet this time around, maybe AI gives the company another shot at becoming a shopping player, or at least a retail media contender.

Legacy YouTubers Embrace Appointment TV

This Friday at 9p.m. ET, the show Smosh Hospital will premiere on YouTube. The debut is noteworthy for a number of reasons.

For starters, it’s another example of a prominent YouTube production brand embracing longer-form originals and TV-like scheduling tactics.

It’s also an unlikely story (at least in my view) of YouTuber longevity - as Smosh - originally just a two-man comedy operation, has survived numerous sales and media partnerships, as well as multiple YouTube eras.

I had Alessandra Catanese, Smosh’s Chief Executive Officer, on my podcast this week, to chat about the company’s impressive endurance, and its growing ambitions as a programmer.

Some highlights-

On creators doing scripted shows:

“The last time we did a format like this was sitcom and it blew up on TikTok. We had audience members being like, ‘I don’t know who these people are, where do I watch this?’ That’s exactly what we’re [trying to remedy] with Hospital in January. Who wouldn’t love to see comedians performing in this way where we’re parodying the “Grey’s Anatomy” or “General Hospital” of it all.”

“We’re staying true to who we are and especially when we’re on YouTube - we can get away with a lot more than traditional [media platforms]…we respect and we honor the fact that our audience wants something particular from a platform like YouTube.”

On where YouTube is headed from a TV perspective:

“My sneaking suspicion with YouTube is… we’ll start to see, especially with the features that they’ve started to roll out to channels like ours, where there’s seasonality, there’s episodes, they’re starting to get you to categorize your content think that there’s a delineation that they’re trying to slowly make in a very smart and strategic way between YouTube and its TV viewing and YouTube as a search engine.”

On what brands still don’t get about today’s creators:

“Any brand is gonna have its issues. Even brands who are really, really great to work with on the creative side, still struggle with the idea that Smosh is not, or creators in general, you know, aren’t the same as they used to be. It used to be, ‘I’m in my bedroom and I’m making this video.’ Oftentimes we get brands who are like, ‘you know what, we actually can’t upload tomorrow. Let’s kick it to next week. We weren’t able to get legal to approve in time.’ And we’re like, ‘hey, like that’s how it works for us. We have a consistent schedule that our audience is expecting.’”","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sE13!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5139c9e-3160-4333-840c-31532bbb3003_1024x1024.png",N,,2026-01-13 08:01:51.418796

Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) share price is up 17% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. The last year hasn't been great either, with the stock up just 4.3%.

The past week has proven to be lucrative for Agilent Technologies investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance.

Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.

In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).

Over half a decade, Agilent Technologies managed to grow its earnings per share at 15% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 3% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.

You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).

This free interactive report on Agilent Technologies' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.

What About Dividends?

As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Agilent Technologies, it has a TSR of 21% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.

A Different Perspective

Agilent Technologies provided a TSR of 5.1% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 4% per year over five year. This suggests the company might be improving over time. Most investors take the time to check the data on insider transactions. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.

We will like Agilent Technologies better if we see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of undervalued stocks (mostly small caps) with considerable, recent, insider buying.

Profit falls but tops expectations, while full-year revenue rises to a record amid growing demand for premium products

A Delta jet taking off from Los Angeles International Airport. Delta had called for an about $200 million hit related to the U.S. government shutdown.

Delta Air Lines on Tuesday reported holiday-quarter profit that beat expectations and record full-year revenue, sidestepping a temporary knock on air-travel demand thanks to the U.S. government shutdown.

But the air carrier's stock (DAL) fell as adjusted revenue for the final quarter of the year came up a bit short of forecasts.

Net income rose to $1.22 billion from $843 million in the same period a year ago, while adjusted earnings per share, which excludes nonrecurring items, declined to $1.55 from $1.85.

Operating revenue grew 2.9% to $16 billion, while adjusted revenue rose 1.2% to $14.61 billion.

Analysts polled by FactSet expected the airline to report adjusted EPS of $1.53 on adjusted sales of $14.68 billion.

The stock dropped 5.7% in premarket trading, which puts it on track for its worst one-day performance in nine months.

Wall Street analysts had trimmed their quarterly expectations over the past few months for Delta and other air carriers because of the shutdown. At the end of October, the FactSet EPS consensus was $1.75 and the revenue consensus was $14.92 billion.

For the full year, revenue adjusted revenue rose 2.3% to a record 58.3 billion.

""High-margin, diversified revenue streams grew high-single digits over prior year and reached 60% of total revenue, reflecting the power of Delta's brand, growing demand for our premium products and the success of our integrated commercial and customer strategy,"" said Delta President Glen Hauenstein.

Delta said last month that U.S. government shutdown-related flight cancellations and cooling demand right before Thanksgiving would cost it about $200 million in the fourth quarter.

The news lifted the stock then, however, as Wall Street seemed relieved the fallout from the shutdown hadn't been steeper. Delta also said that its December demand had remained healthy and trending up for early 2026.

Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian was a vocal critic of the shutdown's effects on air travel, and also saying that airlines were used as a ""political football"" amid the funding impasse in Washington, which lasted 43 days and became the longest shutdown in history.

Airlines lost booking momentum when some customers turned skittish and made other plans ahead of Thanksgiving holiday as the shutdown ground on. In early November, the Trump administration imposed flight cuts at major U.S. airports, citing safety concerns around staff shortages.

Air-traffic controllers, classified as essential personnel, worked through the funding impasse, with pay deferred until the end of the shutdown. Staffing shortages, however, had triggered flight delays and cancellations even before the flight cuts took effect.

There's a ""constructive fundamental backdrop"" this year for airlines, analysts at BofA Securities said in a recent note. Positive industry trends include better demand and ""easy comparisons"" from macroeconomic volatility the first half of last year.

Delta's shares have gained about 9% in the past 12 months through Monday, lagging a 20% gain for the S&P 500 index SPX in the same period.

Balyasny hired Nikoloaos Rapanos, a portfolio manager at Eisler Capital, for its macro trading team. According to his LinkedIn, he joined the fund last year and is based in London.

Rapanos spent 18 months at Eisler in what was his first fully-fledged PM role. Prior to that, he spent six years at macro hedge fund Caxton Associates as a sub-PM in its global macro team. Rapanos has a PhD in finance and previously worked as an associate at Goldman Sachs.

He's one of many Eisler alums to join Balyasny, which has a thing for Eisler's quant strats. Last week, we reported on Tibor Kucs who joined to lead a team of equities quant researchers.

Other strats have joined as portfolio managers; Alexander Alekseev, a top systematic equities PM, joined in October to build out a team and took five other Eisler people with him. Rapanos may not have been a strat at Eisler but spent much of his time at Caxton working in quant research.

The MiniMed Go Smart MDI system combines the InPen smart insulin pen and Abbott’s Instinct sensor, with both linked via the MiniMed Go app.
Real-world data from users of Medtronic’s previous Smart MDI system showed improvements in glycaemic control when responding promptly to alerts.
In December 2025, Medtronic commercially launched its MiniMed 780G system in the US, which was then integrated with Abbott’s Instinct sensor.
""Medtronic secures FDA clearance for MiniMed Go Smart MDI system"" was originally created and published by Medical Device Network, a GlobalData owned brand.","Medtronic has received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for its MiniMed Go Smart MDI system, a solution aimed at supporting individuals with insulin-requiring type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

The MiniMed Go Smart MDI system combines the InPen smart insulin pen and Abbott’s Instinct sensor, with both linked via the MiniMed Go app.

The system provides personalised, real-time insights and actionable guidance.

Features include action-oriented guidance for missed or miscalculated doses, a dose calculator to simplify decision-making, missed dose alerts to help reduce glucose highs, and CareLink software reporting to facilitate collaboration between patients and healthcare providers.

The MiniMed Go system has received clearance for individuals aged seven and older with insulin-requiring T1D or T2D, and for children between two and six years old when supervised by an adult.

Globally, more than 15 million individuals depend on multiple daily injections to manage diabetes. Mealtime insulin dosing can be challenging and may lead to distress. Missed boluses can affect glycaemic outcomes; even missing two doses per week may increase HbA1C by up to 0.4%, which raises complication risks, said Medtronic.

Real-world data from users of Medtronic’s previous Smart MDI system showed improvements in glycaemic control when responding promptly to alerts. Time in Range (TIR) increased from 55.7% to 67.2% when more than 75% of missed dose alerts were addressed within an hour and rose to 71.5% when users responded to correct high glucose alerts with a bolus within an hour.

Medtronic diabetes EVP and president and MiniMed CEO-designate Que Dallara said: “For too long, people using injections have carried the weight of diabetes management without access to the algorithms that make automated insulin delivery systems so powerful.

“MiniMed Go is designed to change that, bringing the smarts of an AID [automated insulin delivery] system to individuals who prefer an insulin pen.”

Commercial launch of the MiniMed Go Smart MDI system in the US is expected in early 2026.

In December 2025, Medtronic commercially launched its MiniMed 780G system in the US, which was then integrated with Abbott’s Instinct sensor.

The company also confirmed the opening of its Seed investment round to accelerate platform rollout and national expansion.

Tow.Market today announced the launch of its Beta Partner Program, inviting insurance carriers, roadside assistance providers, tow operators, and fleet partners to participate in a 6-month pilot of the world’s first AI-powered, Uber-like platform built specifically for towing and vehicle recovery.

Founded by Eli Ofel, Tow.Market applies the same marketplace and automation principles that transformed ride-hailing and food delivery-this time to towing, roadside assistance, and vehicle recovery.

Eli Ofel is also the founder of Leaa Health, a technology-enabled healthcare company focused on medical house calls and in-home care, which has generated over $30 million in revenue in approximately four years. Leaa Health delivers doctors, nurses, diagnostics, and treatments directly to patients’ homes-demonstrating the same on-demand, logistics-driven execution model now being applied to Tow.Market.

6-Month Beta Pilot Program

Tow.Market will launch initially through a 6-month beta pilot program, designed to refine the platform, optimize AI-driven dispatch, and closely collaborate with early tow operators and customers before a full national rollout. The beta phase will focus on service reliability, response times, pricing accuracy, and operator experience-ensuring a scalable and resilient foundation.

The beta is designed to modernize how towing is dispatched, tracked, priced, and reported-creating a real-time, data-driven alternative to legacy call centers, fragmented networks, and manual claims workflows.

Built for Insurance-Grade Operations

Tow.Market is purpose-built to support insurance and roadside programs that require reliability, transparency, and audit-ability. During the beta, insurance partners will collaborate on:

Real-time tow dispatch tied to claims events

SLA-based response time tracking

Upfront, standardized pricing logic

Live GPS tracking and service verification

Digital service records for claims, reimbursements, and subrogation

Reinventing a Legacy, High-Friction Industry

The global towing and roadside assistance market represents an estimated $35-40+ billion opportunity worldwide, with over $10-12 billion annually in the U.S. alone. Despite its size and importance, the industry continues to rely on phone calls, manual dispatching, opaque pricing, and disconnected local operators.

Tow.Market replaces this with a unified, AI-driven marketplace designed for both drivers and tow operators:

Instant AI Dispatch: Matches requests to the right truck in seconds

Upfront, Dynamic Pricing: Transparent pricing based on distance, vehicle type, and real-time conditions

Live GPS Tracking: End-to-end visibility from pickup to drop-off

Operator Growth Engine: Optimized routing, automated payouts, and consistent demand

The Disruptive Opportunity

Tow.Market is not a lead-generation website or a traditional dispatch tool. It is a two-sided marketplace with powerful network effects, purpose-built to become the operating system for towing.

By aggregating demand, standardizing pricing logic, and optimizing utilization through AI, Tow.Market unlocks faster service for drivers, higher utilization for operators, and scalable infrastructure for fleets, insurers, municipalities, and enterprise recovery contracts.

Seed Round Announcement

Tow.Market has officially opened its Seed funding round, valuing the company at $15 million pre-money. Proceeds from the round will be used to support:

Beta pilot execution and operator onboarding

AI and data infrastructure expansion

Mobile applications and enterprise integrations

Multi-city U.S. rollout following beta completion

Investor information is available on our investors page

“We intentionally built in a beta phase to get this right,” said Eli Ofel, Founder of Tow.Market. “We’ve learned through Leaa Health that disciplined rollouts create stronger, more durable platforms. Tow.Market is about fixing a broken system the right way-not rushing scale.”

Built for Scale

Tow.Market supports light-duty, heavy-duty, flatbed, long-distance towing, roadside assistance, and fleet recovery-positioning the platform as the category-defining infrastructure layer for modern towing.

Availability

Tow.Market will roll out through select U.S. metro areas during the beta period, followed by broader national and international expansion.

About Tow.Market

Tow.Market is the world’s first AI-powered towing marketplace, delivering real-time matching, transparent pricing, and Uber-like dispatch for towing and roadside assistance. Built by experienced operators and technologists, Tow.Market is modernizing a global industry through automation and scale.

Whether you’re a contract testing lab, industrial manufacturer, remediation company, or regulator, staying up to date with evolving PFAS regulations and analytical developments is crucial. In this article, you’ll discover emerging trends, key method considerations, practical tips for staying informed, and Agilent solutions tailored to your needs.

What are PFAS?

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent and ubiquitous contaminants that do not biodegrade. Nicknamed ‘forever chemicals,’ these industrial and commercial compounds — commonly used in medical devices, consumer products, food packaging, and kitchenware — are being routinely detected in different environments across the globe. Concerns are mounting over their potential impacts on human health, with recent studies demonstrating the negative effects of PFAS on the human immune system.

Why is there a concern?

Emerging research has found that PFAS bind to proteins in exposed organisms and are resistant to metabolic degradation and excretion. They also biomagnify – in other words, their concentration increases in the tissues of organisms as they progress up the food chain. Therefore, by the time they reach the fish or livestock that humans consume, their levels can be significantly higher than in the original source. Many health effects of PFAS remain under investigation, and new PFAS compounds are still being discovered.

Regulatory action is accelerating. The growing concerns around persistent organic pollutants have recently prompted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to enforce federal regulation on five PFAS, marking the first regulated chemicals in more than 20 years. They have also proposed that nine PFAS be categorised as hazardous to human health under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

Furthermore, in a bid to raise awareness of the PFAS pollution problem, the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), in cooperation with ChemSec, tested 11 politicians for PFAS contamination, with five exceeding levels of concern. According to the EEB, the results of this study mirror the average levels of exposure across Europe.

PFAS testing is a growing challenge for industries, regulators, and testing labs worldwide. As awareness rises, so does the demand for accurate testing to understand where these chemicals occur and how to manage them. But before jumping into this market, labs must ask a critical question: What does it really take to get PFAS testing right?

What must labs consider before entering the PFAS market?

Defining your goals

Before entering the PFAS testing market, it’s essential to clearly define your objectives — because your approach will vary depending on your role and responsibilities. Consider what those goals may look like in the following scenarios:

Contract testing labs: Determine which matrices to test and to what levels. Identify regulatory or testing methods you need to follow, along with any compliance and accreditation needs.

Industrial manufacturers: Conduct testing to meet regulatory guidance or discharge permits, whether that’s for your raw materials or waste discharge.

Regulators trying to identify new PFAS: Investigate the tools you’ll need to discover currently unknown PFAS.

Engineering firms or remediation companies: Identify if the treatment is removing PFAS, but also ensure you are not creating them or converting them into other by-products in the process.

Method considerations

Effective PFAS testing relies on a robust workflow — from suitable sample preservation to comprehensive sample preparation and precise analysis.

Sample preservation

PFAS often have surface-active properties, making them susceptible to adhering to sample vessels. Therefore, secure sample preservation and transportation methods are critical to ensure sample integrity during transit and storage.

Sample preparation and cleanup

Sample preparation is essential for isolating PFAS from diverse matrices like drinking water, soil, and air. Specific procedures can remove interfering substances from samples to ensure high purity and minimise background noise. Enrichment techniques and cleanup steps may also be necessary before sample analysis to further optimise detection limits and enhance recovery from challenging environmental samples.

Analysis

In targeted PFAS analysis, LC/TQ is typically used due to its exceptional sensitivity and selectivity. However, this technique is restricted to compounds with available analytical standards and relatively polar compounds that ionise well in LC/MS. For nonpolar and volatile PFAS, GC/MS is often preferred. When the goal is nontargeted analysis to identify large amounts of unknown PFAS, high-resolution LC/MS systems such as LC/Q-TOF are increasingly favoured.

Each of these techniques must be critically accompanied by high-performance, regulatory-compliant software to analyse and report the data according to compliance and accreditation requirements.

Trends emerging in specific sectors

PFAS testing is evolving rapidly, with several trends emerging in different sectors. Understanding these developments is essential for staying compliant and competitive as regulations tighten and analytical methods advance.

Food industry

With increased scrutiny around the use of PFAS in food packaging and foodstuffs, the food sector is feeling the pressure to make changes. Testing for PFAS in food is becoming more common as companies seek to comply with evolving regulations and respond to consumer demand for safer products. Many companies are phasing out harmful long-chain PFAS and replacing them with shorter-chain PFAS that demonstrate reduced bioaccumulation. Many are also adopting PFAS-free, nonfluorinated compounds to meet consumer demand for safer products. Because food supply chains are global, regulations in one region often influence practices worldwide.

Water treatment

Advances in water treatment technologies are driving new testing methods. As regulations become stricter, there is a need for more sensitive and accurate testing to ensure compliance with lower detection limits. Furthermore, thermal destruction techniques used to break down PFAS also require robust testing of by-products to ensure they do not introduce new contaminants.

Consumer products

The push for PFAS-free consumer products is leading to more comprehensive testing protocols. This includes testing for a broader range of PFAS compounds and ensuring that alternatives do not pose similar risks.

Environmental monitoring

To identify unknown PFAS compounds in the environment, nontargeted analysis techniques such as high-resolution mass spectrometry are gaining traction as a way to understand the full extent of PFAS contamination and its impact.

Air monitoring

As more volatile PFAS compounds are being discovered as part of manufacturing processes, incineration, and everyday product use, testing for PFAS in air has become a big focus of the industry.

Regulatory trends on the horizon

Staying up to date with emerging regulatory trends is crucial to ensure your PFAS testing is compliant and meets demand. Several regulatory trends are emerging to be aware of:

U.S. EPA drinking water standards: The U.S. EPA has set the first-ever national, legally enforceable drinking water standards for certain PFAS, with this trend set to continue for more PFAS as research evolves.

EU bans and restrictions: The EU aims to phase out at least 10,000 PFAS by 2030 to help manage risks.

Reporting and recordkeeping requirements: The US and EU are tightening their rules on reporting and recordkeeping from manufacturers and industry.

Global harmonisation of PFAS regulations: Countries are increasingly aligning their regulatory frameworks with international standards, such as those set by the Stockholm and Rotterdam Conventions.

These trends highlight the importance of staying informed and compliant with evolving regulations to effectively manage PFAS-related risks.

How to stay current with regulations

To stay ahead of evolving PFAS regulations and industry best practices, consider these practical steps:

Regularly participate in meetings, webinars, and conferences hosted by regulatory agencies like the U.S. EPA and European Chemicals Agency for firsthand updates on environmental regulatory changes, and the U.S. FDA and EFSA for food safety regulations and emerging trends.

Subscribe to newsletters from reputable sources such as the EPA, Environmental Law Institute, and industry-specific publications, which highlight recent regulatory updates and provide expert analysis.

Join professional organisations such as the American Chemical Society and the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, which provide exclusive access to resources like regulatory updates, research findings, and networking opportunities.

Utilise online databases and tools that track regulatory changes and provide comprehensive information on toxicology and occurrence data. For example: the OECD Global Database of PFAS, the EU European Environment Agency and their Information Platform for Chemical Monitoring, the EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed portal, and the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard.

Establish connections with other professionals in the field to share insights and experiences.

Engage with instrument suppliers like Agilent, who collaborate with regulatory bodies and participate in standards committees and conferences. They often share early updates on testing requirements and emerging best practices.

Amid signs of slowing and recalibrating parts of the global green transition, Chinese green manufacturing companies continue to deliver more clean-energy products to global markets.","BEIJING (Jan 13): Earlier in December, the world’s leading electric vehicle battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (CATL) said it is nearing completion on what could be one of Europe’s largest electric vehicle battery factories, a fresh example of advanced Chinese manufacturing gaining international recognition.

Over the years, China’s manufacturing sector has steadily upgraded and integrated itself into international industrial networks. With a growing focus on high-tech and clean-energy production, it now provides robust manufacturing capabilities and supports more resilient supply chains, creating opportunities for global partnerships in emerging industries.

WHY MADE IN CHINA?

As of 2024, China’s manufacturing sector has been the world’s largest for 15 consecutive years, growing steadily at home while continuing to attract foreign investment.

In the first 11 months of 2025, China attracted 693.18 billion yuan (about 98.25 billion U.S. dollars) in actual foreign direct investment, with manufacturing alone receiving 171.72 billion yuan (around 24.4 billion dollars), roughly one-quarter of the total.

But why China? How has its manufacturing sector grown from a modest industrial base into a vast, interconnected system deeply embedded in global production networks within decades?

The answer may be glimpsed in more than 40 years of reform and opening-up, which allowed the country to engage in labor-intensive manufacturing for multinational companies. The accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001 further opened the door for the country to emerge as a major hub for processing and manufacturing.

Supported by plentiful labor resources, strong infrastructure, and favorable policies, China’s manufacturing sector grew at an average annual rate of 12 percent between 1995 and 2015, and since then gradually built broad industrial capabilities across sectors such as automotive, machinery, medical devices, and consumer electronics.

These structural advantages have long attracted global manufacturers, including Michelin, which has steadily expanded its operations in China.

In September, Michelin celebrated the 30th anniversary of its Shenyang plant — the group’s first factory in China and now its largest and most advanced high-end tire manufacturing base in the world.

Established in 1995 as a joint venture, the plant has expanded steadily, with new production lines added in 2010 and 2018, advanced silent tire lines introduced in 2019, and a 40-million-euro (about 43-million-dollar) investment in 2024 to further raise capacity.

“Michelin Shenyang is a milestone for Michelin in China,” said Matthew Ye, president and CEO of Michelin Greater China & Mongolia, noting “the plant’s success vividly embodies the deep integration of the Michelin spirit with the Chinese market.”

“The Chinese market remains one of the most dynamic and promising for Michelin globally, featuring not only a vast consumer base and a rapidly upgrading automotive industry, but also an increasingly robust supply chain and a continuously improving business environment,” said Ye, highlighting the wider attractiveness of China’s industrial ecosystem.

INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING IN CHINA

Building on a well-established industrial base, Chinese industry has gradually moved from producing mainly low-value goods such as shoes, garments and basic consumer products to a broader range of high-value, technology-intensive products, including electric vehicles, energy storage systems, and advanced industrial robots.

The year 2024 is a good example: Value added by high-tech manufacturing firms above a designated scale was 42 percent higher than in 2020, with clean energy-related production forming a key part of this growth.

This transition has been accompanied by the rapid spread of intelligent manufacturing across China’s industrial sector, now spanning tens of thousands of factories and production facilities nationwide.

At GAC Aion’s Guangzhou plant, robotic arms work almost non-stop along assembly lines, producing a vehicle every 53 seconds in a “dark factory” where lights are rarely needed. Similar facilities are now emerging across China, with the country accounting for more than half of the world’s newly installed industrial robots in 2024, according to the International Federation of Robotics.

China’s fully integrated industrial system places it in a unique position within the global supply chain landscape, said Yin Zheng, executive vice president of Schneider Electric’s China & East Asia Operations.

“What the industry needs now are supply chains that are not only efficient but also resilient and green, a view that is increasingly shared across sectors,” Yin said.

SHARED OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE

As China’s manufacturing capabilities are moving up the value chain, multinational companies are increasingly viewing the country not only as a production base or consumer market, but also as a platform for research, rapid application and technology iteration.

Speaking to Xinhua at the 2025 International Motor Show Germany in Munich, Oliver Zipse, chairman of the board of management of BMW AG, said China’s innovation is crucial for BMW’s global strategy.

“The combination of German engineering expertise with China’s extensive supplier network and local innovation creates a unique global advantage,” Zipse said.

Upgrades in China’s manufacturing sector are also reshaping opportunities in the global energy transition. As climate targets tighten and the window for cutting emissions narrows, the pace, scale and affordability of clean-energy deployment have become central concerns for governments and industries worldwide.

The U.S. academic journal Science named the renewable energy surge as the 2025 Breakthrough of the Year, noting that China’s mighty industrial engine is the driver.

Quoting Britain-based Carbon Brief, it said solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles and wind turbines exported from China in 2024 are set to cut annual CO2 emissions in the rest of the world by 1 percent.

Beyond delivering cost-effective green products at scale, China’s manufacturing upgrades are creating practical entry points for international collaboration in green technology.

Chinese firms have pledged roughly 200 billion dollars in overseas clean energy investments since 2022, reported The Wired in December, noting that this is “beginning to narrow the gap in funding needed to slash the world’s climate pollution.”

With rising global demand for low-carbon technologies and the urgent need to accelerate the energy transition, Chinese manufacturers are increasingly embedding themselves in overseas industrial ecosystems, extending collaboration across production, technology, talent, and industrial capacity.

In Uzbekistan, Chinese photovoltaic giant LONGi partnered with international firms to develop Central Asia’s first large-scale green hydrogen project, which is expected to cut about 30,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year compared with traditional hydrogen production models.

“Our cooperation model connects China’s technology with local energy strategies,” said Zhang Wenyin, head of strategy and marketing at LONGi Hydrogen. “It also helps partner countries cultivate local talent and industrial capacity.”

FORGING AHEAD ON GREEN TRANSITION

China has stayed on course in advancing the green transition despite policy shifts in some Western countries. Several major economies, including the United States and the European Union, have recently revised automotive policies, easing rules for conventional vehicles.

In the United States, this came after the federal electric-vehicle tax credit expired in September, with a late-2025 proposal to slash Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards. Meanwhile, the European Commission announced plans to drop its effective ban on new combustion-engine cars from 2035, marking a notable retreat from its green policies.

These moves, while giving conventional vehicles more policy flexibility during the transition period, have also posed challenges for advancing green transition goals in these markets.

Amid signs of slowing and recalibrating parts of the global green transition, Chinese green manufacturing companies continue to deliver more clean-energy products to global markets.

In September, Chinese automaker BYD saw its 1,000th electric bus roll off the production line at its Hungarian bus factory, and it plans to expand the bus factory with an additional 29,000 square meters of production facilities to further increase annual capacity for electric buses and trucks.

Since delivering its first European order in 2013, more than 5,000 BYD electric buses have been deployed across over 160 cities in 26 European countries.

China’s progress in green manufacturing should be seen not as a threat, but as an opportunity — one that calls for deeper dialogue, joint innovation and mutually beneficial cooperation between Europe and China in pursuit of global climate goals, Kauppalehti, a Finnish business daily, said in an article. – Xinhua",https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2026/01/China-manufacturing1.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 05:59:12.391675

The MiniMed Go™ system is cleared for individuals with insulin-requiring type 1 and type 2 diabetes aged 7 years and older, as well as for children ages 2 to 6 years under the supervision of an adult caregiver. Compatibility of the Simplera™ sensor with MiniMed Go™ is currently under FDA review.

Addressing a Significant Unmet Need

There are more than 15 million people around the world with diabetes who rely on multiple daily injections. For these individuals, mealtimes can feel overwhelming and exhausting — and over time, this can lead to diabetes distress.1,2 This involves determining the amount of carbs in their meal and calculating the right insulin dose to inject before eating (bolus) to keep blood sugar levels in check to avoid dangerous spikes or dips.

Missed boluses can significantly impact diabetes management and glycemic outcomes. Even skipping just two doses a week can raise HbA1C by as much as 0.4%, increasing the risk of both short- and long-term complications.3 Remembering when and how much insulin to dose isn't just a math problem — it's a daily burden that adds stress and fatigue, making diabetes management feel overwhelming.

Real-world data demonstrates that users of the previous generation Medtronic Smart MDI system saw meaningful improvements in glycemic control when consistently responding to actionable alerts. Specifically, the data showed that Time in Range (TIR) increased from 55.7% to 67.2% when users addressed more than 75% of Missed Dose alerts within an hour, and to 71.5% when users addressed Correct High Glucose alerts with a bolus within an hour. These results underscore the power of timely, actionable insights in helping users achieve better glycemic outcomes.4 The new MiniMed Go™ Smart MDI System delivers real-time, personalized insights and actionable guidance to optimize outcomes for users.

""For too long, people using injections have carried the weight of diabetes management without access to the algorithms that make automated insulin delivery systems so powerful,"" said Que Dallara, EVP and president of Medtronic Diabetes and CEO-designate of MiniMed. ""MiniMed Go™ is designed to change that — bringing the smarts of an AID system to individuals who prefer an insulin pen. The system helps take the guesswork out of MDI therapy, delivering simplicity and confidence in every dose. We're pleased to expand our full-stack insulin delivery solutions, making it seamless for our customers to find a therapy that works for them — no matter where they are in their journey.""

We expect the commercial launch of the MiniMed Go™ system to begin in the U.S. this spring. Learn more here about MiniMed Go™.

NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook owner Meta has named Dina Powell McCormick, a former Trump administration adviser and longtime finance executive, as president and vice chairman of the tech giant.

Powell McCormick previously served on Meta’s board of directors — where, the company notes, she was “deeply engaged” in accelerating its artificial intelligence push across platforms. In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.

The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of U.S. President Donald Trump. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, the Republican president said the move was a “great choice” by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — and noted that Powell McCormick had “served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.”

Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick’s experience in global finance, “combined with her deep relationships around the world,” made her “uniquely suited to help Meta” in its future growth.

Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee. She worked as a national security adviser at the start of Trump’s first term, and also held roles in the White House and the Secretary of State’s office under President George W. Bush. She is married to U.S. Sen. David McCormick, who served in high-level positions in the Commerce and Treasury departments under Bush — before he joined hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and rose to become CEO.

And Powell McCormick has a long background in finance. She spent 16 years in senior leadership at Goldman Sachs, but was most recently vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. She’s also held a handful of other corporate board positions — including at oil giant Exxon Mobil.

According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta’s board in December, eight months after joining as a director.

The addition of Powell McCormick to Meta’s management team arrived amid wider efforts from California-based Meta to boost its ties with Trump, who was once banned from Facebook. Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Last year, the company also appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to its board, another familiar figure in Trump’s orbit.

Mining is the “keystone industry” that props up the arch of the global economy – almost every good and service is enabled by mining, and mining itself is not possible without copper – the red metal is the “keystone commodity.”

Read more:How mining became the planet’s unlikely saviour

The report – Copper in the Age of AI: The Challenges of Electrification – projects that annual copper demand will soar 50% from current levels by 2040 to 42 million metric tonnes as the pace of electrification accelerates to meet vectors of demand, old and new.

But its projections for supply underline a darkening disconnect, with production seen peaking at 33 million metric tonnes by 2030.

Even with an expected over-doubling of supplies of recycled copper scrap over that timeline to 10 million tonnes, it all adds up to a yawning chasm with an expected shortfall of 10 million tonnes, or around 25% of anticipated demand.

What this means

Copper is the enabler of the global economy, and demand will outrun supply unless there is major adjustment across the copper supply system.

Processing, for example, is heavily concentrated in China and the report calls for multilateral cooperation and more regional diversification. It also calls for faster permitting for new mines and a “time clock on litigation’ on this front.

This does not mean the sector can just go out and trash the planet. But mining is no longer the wrecking ball it once was and for wider environmental outcomes such as the green energy transition, we need more copper, faster.

“Here, in short, is the quandary: copper is the great enabler of electrification, but the accelerating pace of electrification is an increasing challenge for copper,” said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman at S&P Global who co-chaired the study.

“Economic demand, grid expansion, renewable generation, AI computation, digital industries, electric vehicles and defence are scaling all at once – and supply is not on track to keep pace. At stake is whether copper remains an enabler of progress or becomes a bottleneck to growth and innovation.”

Such shortfalls for such a critical metal will also send its price into the stratosphere, with huge implications for global supply chains and inflation.

There are many moving parts to this unfolding saga, which explains why copper is so high on the radar screens of mining boardrooms – and why so many governments have classified it as “critical”.

On the production side, the bottom line is that new economically extractable deposits are not being discovered at the pace required to meet projected demand. Even if new mother lodes are suddenly uncovered, it takes, on average, 17 years for a new copper mine to begin production from a discovery.

That means any major new copper find that comes to light this year will probably not begin extracting the stuff before 2043. And the supply of qualified geologists and mining engineers is also in decline.

“The copper sector faces a host of challenges above and below ground, ranging from declining ore grades; rising costs for energy, labour and other inputs; increasingly complex and difficult extraction conditions; environmental opposition, lengthy judicial reviews and pressures from investors and governments,” S&P notes.

While grades and production decline, demand is seen rising robustly on four broad fronts, with a potential fifth one on the horizon.

The rise of the machines

AI and data centre demand is one emerging sphere, and the other is increased defence spending in an era marked by escalating geopolitical tensions. Data centres and weapons have one big thing in common: they need copper.

Demand from these two sources is seen tripling by 2040, representing a combined four million metric tonnes of additional demand.

What the report refers to as “core demand” – power generation, construction, electrical appliances, shipping, aviation and much more – will remain the largest market for copper, and it is also on a rapid growth trajectory.

“In the developing world, a combination of urbanisation, rising incomes, and changing building practices means electricity use and thus more copper. One vivid example: the developing world is projected to add as many as two billion new air conditioners by 2040,” the report says.

Clean energy transition

Another copper-hungry sector that has been taking off is the clean energy transition. Electric vehicles require almost three times as much copper as a conventional car, and solar and wind also need an abundance of the metal.

“And now a possible new vector of demand is on the horizon – humanoid robots,” the report says.

“There is much variance in projections for their scale by 2040 – varying from tens of millions to hundreds of millions to a billion or more. Whatever the actual number, these humanoids will not just be wired – but heavily wired – with copper.”

The report is a sobering reminder of our dependence on copper and ultimately mining, and the clock is ticking.",https://cdn.dailymaverick.co.za/i/0fXRTXpk9jUcLlfs4lZt09a-Ym8=/800x0/smart/filters:strip_exif()/file/dailymaverick/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-516808124.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 04:13:50.234974

Walmart's stock rallies into record territory, after the retailer teams with Google's Gemini to help drive customers to its products

Walmart's focus on technology to drive sales has helped lift its stock to record territory, a month after the company switched its stock-market listing to the Nasdaq. Outgoing Walmart CEO Doug McMillon shared a laugh with Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman at a Dec. 9 opening-bell ceremony.

Shares of Walmart surged into record territory Monday as the retail behemoth's latest moves highlight its focus on technology to drive sales.

Walmart (WMT) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) (GOOG) Google announced over the weekend that they were teaming up to launch a new shopping experience that will use artificial intelligence through Google's Gemini to help drive customers to products sold at Walmart's stores.

The announcement came about a month after Walmart moved the listing of its stock to the Nasdaq exchange from the New York Stock Exchange, a move that the retailer said aligned with its ""tech-powered approach"" to its retail strategy.

The stock climbed 3.4% in recent midday trading, putting it on track to end the day above the Dec. 15 record close price of $116.79. The rally was boosting Walmart's market capitalization to $944.2 billion, which makes Walmart the 11th most valuable U.S. company.

With Walmart's latest AI move, Gemini's answers to questions for assistance or advice will include products sold at its stores, as part of the new Universal Commerce Protocol, an open standard for AI agent-led commerce that Walmart said it built.

An example Walmart provided in how the collaboration would work was if Gemini is asked for advice on camping equipment, it will show items from Walmart and provide access to purchase the items.

Walmart's AI push makes sense. A report earlier this month from Salesforce (CRM) said shoppers referred to e-commerce sites from AI agents converted into actual sales nine times more often than those referred from social media.

""The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,"" said John Furner, Walmart's incoming CEO. ""We aren't just watching the shift, we are driving it.""

Late Friday, the Nasdaq said it would add Walmart's stock to the Nasdaq-100 Index NDX as of Jan. 20.

While Nasdaq said the index is made up of 100 of the largest nonfinancial companies, it is often referred to as the ""tech-heavy"" Nasdaq-100, given that the current top 11 weighted components - more than 70% of the total weighting - are technology companies.

Walmart's stock will replace drugmaker AstraZeneca's (AZN) in the Nasdaq-100. AstraZeneca was the 16th-highest-weighted Nasdaq-100 component, with a market cap of $291.9 billion.

The average UberEats or DoorDash tip has since dropped to just 76 cents per delivery.
But for the apps that kept the tipping option before checkout, like Grubhub, workers earn an average tip of $2.17 per order, according to DCWP's analysis.
Council Member Shaun Abreu (D-Manhattan), the tipping law's lead sponsor, blasted the companies' post-checkout tipping practices as harmful to workers.
""When corporations claim that delivery workers are overpaid and app profits are too low, we know they are lying.","Delivery workers have lost as much as $550 million in tips since Uber and DoorDash changed their apps so that the tip option appears only after customers place their orders, the city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection charged in a new report.

The findings come as the companies sue the city over a law set to go into effect on Jan. 26 that requires them to offer the option to tip at or before checkout.

New York City's landmark minimum pay law, which guarantees delivery workers $21.44 per hour, went into effect in December 2023. The day the law went into effect, Uber and DoorDash introduced new after-checkout tipping policies in order to hide the higher costs wrought by the new minimum pay standards.

The average tip for a worker making deliveries for UberEats and DoorDash decreased from $3.66 per delivery to 93 cents per delivery in just one week after the companies moved the tipping option, DCWP found. The average UberEats or DoorDash tip has since dropped to just 76 cents per delivery.

But for the apps that kept the tipping option before checkout, like Grubhub, workers earn an average tip of $2.17 per order, according to DCWP's analysis.

“Our report blows the whistle on a massive scheme by Uber and DoorDash to drive down worker pay by more than $550 million. That era has come to an end,” DCWP Commissioner Sam Levine said in a statement. “If these companies do not follow new tipping laws going into effect later this month, they will face significant consequences.”

Uber and DoorDash filed their lawsuit in mid-December, alleging that the new law requiring tipping options before checkout violates their free speech and arguing that it would damage their businesses. The suit cited ""tipping fatigue"" and DoorDash went as far as to accuse the City Council of worsening an ""affordability crisis.""

""In the midst of an affordability crisis, the New York City Council has turned tipping into essentially an added tax by forcing platforms like DoorDash to pressure consumers to tip at checkout,"" DoorDash said at the time.

But both DoorDash and Uber have continued to rake in large profits from food delivery since the minimum pay went into effect, defying their claims to the contrary.

Monthly reports from DoorDash and UberEats show that after the minimum pay law began in Dec. 2023 through June 2025, they earned a combined revenue of $948 million more than what they paid in wages to workers, court filings show.

On Jan. 5, DCWP filed a memorandum in opposition to the app giants' request to stop the law from going into effect as the lawsuit works its way through the courts. Federal Judge George Daniels in the Southern District of New York has yet to rule on the companies' requested injunction; the next hearing is on Jan. 14.

Council Member Shaun Abreu (D-Manhattan), the tipping law's lead sponsor, blasted the companies' post-checkout tipping practices as harmful to workers.

""If someone wants to tip them, they shouldn’t have a hard time doing it. No one is ever forced to tip, and making it more difficult to do so is plain wrong,"" Abreu said in a statement. ""When corporations claim that delivery workers are overpaid and app profits are too low, we know they are lying. True affordability comes from treating consumers and workers fairly, not manipulating how people tip.""

Uber did not respond to requests for comment. DoorDash issued Streetsblog a similar comment as it did last year, changing the opening from ""In the midst of an affordability crisis,"" to “In the midst of an affordability crisis and growing frustration over tipping culture ... the Council plans to force platforms like DoorDash to pressure customers to tip at checkout even though customers can already tip after delivery for a job well done.""

The company claims that its workers are ""averaging closer to $30 an hour before tips,"" though it did not provide evidence. The company claims its lawsuit ""is about fighting rising costs and ensuring delivery remains fast and affordable for all New Yorkers.”",https://lede-admin.nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2025/09/delivery-worker-e-bike-JOCO.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 01:59:07.450049

In 2026, the VOC control systems market stands at USD 5.8 billion and is projected to reach USD 13.4 billion by 2036, implying a CAGR of 8.7%. Deployment is driven primarily by regulatory compliance in industries such as chemicals, coatings, printing, pharmaceuticals, and food processing, where volatile organic compound emissions are monitored and limited. System choice depends on concentration levels, exhaust volumes, and process continuity requirements rather than on equipment price alone. Capital decisions are often tied to permitting, plant expansions, or process changes, which makes demand episodic rather than continuous. Geographic concentration follows regions with strict air quality standards and active enforcement regimes.

Operating economics and liability exposure shape adoption behavior across different sectors. Facilities weigh destruction efficiency, energy consumption, uptime risk, and maintenance burden when selecting between thermal oxidation, adsorption, or recovery based systems. Compliance audits, reporting obligations, and inspection frequency influence replacement and upgrade timing. In some regions, incentives or carbon related programs alter technology preference, while elsewhere enforcement relies mainly on penalties. Supplier positioning depends on the ability to support engineering, installation, and long term service. The market expands through regulatory tightening and process modernization, not through discretionary environmental upgrades or uniform industrial expansion.

What is the Growth Forecast for VOC Control Systems Market through 2036?

The VOC control systems market expands in step with regulatory enforcement and industrial capacity additions rather than with discretionary environmental spending. At roughly USD 3.3 billion at the start of the period, the market moves through USD 3.9 billion and USD 4.7 billion as coatings, chemicals, printing, and pharmaceuticals add abatement capacity to meet permitting and compliance thresholds. When spending reaches about USD 5.8 billion, the category is no longer driven only by new plants. Retrofits, line extensions, and process changes begin to account for a large share of orders. Growth is anchored in thermal oxidizers, adsorption systems, and hybrid configurations sized to specific exhaust streams, which makes project value depend more on process complexity and airflow volumes than on simple equipment counts.

As industrial output and compliance coverage widen, the market advances through approximately USD 6.9 billion, USD 8.2 billion, and USD 9.7 billion, with demand increasingly tied to multi-line facilities and integrated emission management programs. By the time spending passes about USD 10.6 billion and then moves toward USD 11.6 and USD 12.4 billion, replacement and system upgrades become as important as first-time installations. Approaching roughly USD 13.4 billion, value growth is driven by higher specification systems, energy recovery integration, and tighter monitoring requirements rather than by a surge in the number of regulated sites. The economics remain compliance-led and project-based, with purchasing decisions dominated by reliability, destruction efficiency, operating cost, and the ability to meet audit and permitting obligations over long operating lives.

How Is the VOC Control Systems Market Enhancing Industrial Emission Management?

VOC (volatile organic compound) control systems are increasingly adopted to reduce harmful emissions from industrial processes, chemical plants, and manufacturing facilities. Historically, industries relied on passive ventilation or basic scrubbers, which often failed to meet regulatory standards or adequately capture emissions, leading to environmental compliance risks. Modern VOC control systems integrate activated carbon adsorption, thermal oxidation, and biofiltration technologies to efficiently capture, degrade, or neutralize organic pollutants. Industrial operators, environmental compliance managers, and regulatory bodies prioritize system efficiency, reliability, and adherence to emission standards. Early adoption focused on high-emission chemical and petrochemical plants, while current demand spans paints and coatings, printing, automotive, and pharmaceutical manufacturing, driven by stringent regulatory requirements, operational safety, and process control considerations. Capture efficiency, operational reliability, and maintenance requirements influence supplier selection.

Operational compliance, workplace safety, and emission reduction objectives are shaping market growth. Compared with conventional ventilation methods, modern VOC control systems emphasize high removal efficiency, continuous monitoring, and adaptability to diverse industrial processes. Cost structures depend on technology type, material durability, and control system integration, concentrating margins among suppliers capable of delivering reliable, certified solutions. Manufacturers adopt these systems to ensure regulatory compliance, minimize environmental impact, and protect worker health. By 2036, VOC control systems are expected to become standard across industrial sectors, supporting effective emission management, operational reliability, and adherence to environmental regulations.

What Factors Are Shaping the Demand for VOC Control Systems, Segment wise by Technology Type and End Use Industry, in 2026?

The VOC control systems market in 2026 is segmented by technology type and by end use industry. By treatment method, demand is divided into thermal oxidizers, adsorption systems, biofiltration systems, and catalytic oxidizers, each offering different balances between destruction efficiency, operating cost, and maintenance complexity. By end use, demand is organized around chemical processing, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, and food and beverage, which differ in emission profiles, regulatory exposure, and continuity of operation. These segments reflect how plant operators choose between capital intensive abatement equipment and lower energy or media based solutions depending on process conditions.

Why Do Thermal Oxidizers Dominate Where Compliance Risk Is Highest?

Thermal oxidizers account for about 40% of demand in 2026 because they provide a direct and highly reliable method for destroying a wide range of volatile organic compounds. In regulated environments, certainty of performance matters more than marginal differences in operating cost. Thermal systems achieve very high destruction efficiencies and are less sensitive to changes in gas composition than many alternative technologies. Once installed, they are accepted by regulators and inspectors as a robust solution. In continuous process industries, this predictability reduces compliance risk and operational disputes. These characteristics explain why thermal oxidizers remain the preferred choice in plants where emission limits are strict and interruptions are costly.

Adsorption, biofiltration, and catalytic systems serve more specific process windows. Adsorption works well for lower concentration streams but requires media replacement and regeneration management. Biofiltration suits biodegradable compounds but depends on stable biological conditions. Catalytic oxidizers reduce energy use but require clean, well controlled streams to avoid catalyst poisoning. These technologies are selected where conditions fit, yet their narrower operating envelopes limit their share compared with the broad applicability of thermal oxidation.

Why Does Chemical Processing Lead End Use Demand?

Chemical processing represents about 38% of demand in 2026 because it handles large volumes of solvent laden and hydrocarbon rich exhaust streams. Many chemical plants operate continuous processes where even short compliance failures can lead to shutdowns or penalties. This drives investment in proven, high capacity control systems rather than in marginal solutions. The diversity of products and batch processes also creates variable emission profiles, which favors technologies that can handle wide fluctuations without retuning. Capital spending in this sector is therefore closely tied to regulatory audits, plant expansions, and debottlenecking projects.

Oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, and food processing follow different patterns. Oil and gas facilities often deal with fewer but larger point sources. Pharmaceutical plants emit smaller volumes but face strict documentation and validation cycles. Food and beverage operations generate more dilute and variable streams that can sometimes be treated with simpler systems. These sectors invest steadily, but none combines the scale, variability, and regulatory exposure found in chemical processing, which keeps it as the largest end use segment for VOC control systems.

How Are the Key Dynamics Reshaping the VOC Control Systems Market?

The category is being shaped by how regulators and operators manage compliance risk rather than by equipment replacement cycles. Stricter emission limits raise demand, but project timing is constrained by permitting, capital approval, and integration with production lines. At the same time, many plants are standardizing abatement platforms across sites to simplify audits, spares, and reporting. This creates tension between urgency to comply and caution about locking into the wrong technology. The result is a market driven by governance and lifecycle economics, where scale comes from programmatic rollouts and platform selection more than from one off retrofits or isolated process upgrades.

Why Are Emission Standards Driving VOC Control Systems?

Demand is anchored in enforceable limits and inspection exposure. Coating, chemicals, printing, and food processing sites face defined caps on solvent and hydrocarbon releases, with penalties that disrupt operations and reputations. As permits tighten, operators must either reduce throughput or install abatement. Control systems become enabling infrastructure that protects capacity and keeps lines running. Once a plant commits to a compliance strategy, equipment is sized to cover peak loads and remains in place for many years. Volume follows regulatory coverage expansions and new line approvals rather than discretionary efficiency projects, tying growth to rulemaking and enforcement intensity across regions.

What Is Slowing Wider Adoption of VOC Controls?

The main barrier is project risk, not technology maturity. Installation affects ducts, stacks, and process balance, and outages can be costly. Capital approval competes with production investments, especially where payback is framed as avoided fines rather than revenue. Performance depends on variable inlet loads, which makes sizing contentious and invites conservative overdesign. Energy use and consumables raise operating cost concerns. In multi-product plants, changing recipes can invalidate assumptions. These uncertainties stretch engineering studies and approvals, keeping many sites in staged upgrades or partial coverage even when compliance pressure is rising.

How Are Platforms Changing the VOC Control Systems Market?

The trend is toward standardized abatement stacks. Large operators increasingly select a small set of approved technologies and suppliers, then replicate them across sites to simplify audits, training, and spares. Controls, monitoring, and reporting are integrated into plant systems to produce consistent compliance evidence. Procurement shifts to framework agreements covering families of units and long term service. This reduces engineering variability and shortens permitting for repeat builds. Over time, competition moves from single project wins to inclusion in approved platforms, with success measured by uptime, documentation quality, and ability to support multi-site deployment programs.

As Matthieu Houle, CIO at ALDO Group, explained, ""AI is turning shopping into a trusted conversation, much more than a search.
AI is reshaping where, when, and how decisions are made across every industry.","Generative AI is reshaping the first steps of shopping experience before clicking buy, as per a new global study from the Institute for Business Value (IBM), in collaboration with the National Retail Federation (NRF). From hyper-personalised suggestions to curated inspiration, influence now begins long before a store visit or app tap, moving where brands and retailers compete to an entirely new level.

The study found that while nearly three-quarters of surveyed consumers (72 per cent) still shop in stores, almost half (45 per cent) turn to AI for help during their buying journeys. Shoppers still want to see and touch products, but today's savvy consumers increasingly arrive with a sense of what they're looking for and why. They are using AI to research products (41 per cent), interpret reviews (33 per cent), and hunt for deals (31 per cent).

""AI is changing how consumers shop, and every aspect throughout the shopping journey,"" noted Caroline Reppert, senior director, AI and Technology Policy at the National Retail Federation, ""As these technologies increasingly guide consumer discovery, comparison, and choice, retailers that understand and respond to this shift will be best positioned to earn trust, relevance, and long-term customer loyalty.""

Generative AI is reshaping early shopping decisions, with 45 per cent of consumers using AI for product research, reviews, and deal-hunting, as per an IBM–NRF study. While stores remain important, AI-driven discovery now guides choices before purchase. Brands must redesign journeys around AI moments, ensure data readiness, and invest in AI skills to stay competitive and build long-term trust.

For leading brands and retailers, this shift toward AI-shaped discovery is prompting a rethink of how and where they engage consumers. As Matthieu Houle, CIO at ALDO Group, explained, ""AI is turning shopping into a trusted conversation, much more than a search. Consumers now rely on assistants that feel almost human, know their preferences, and offer neutral, best-for-me advice that reshapes how they validate and decide what to buy.""

While 35 per cent of surveyed consumers still desire visually appealing stores with no wait times, AI-powered solutions are nearly as important. In fact, one in three consumers seek super apps that combine commerce with other services, 30 per cent want smart homes with AI personal shoppers and autonomous delivery, and 29 per cent look for effortless purchasing through social platforms.

Consumers are growing increasingly accustomed to AI-powered shopping assistants helping them decide what to buy. That expectation, however, is forming faster than most retail operating models can keep pace, forcing the question: Is data ready to guide and validate what customers ultimately choose?

""AI is not a magic wand,"" emphasised Stanislas Vignon, head of insights (AI and omnichannel) at Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH). ""If you don't have the right data, it doesn't work. And you must test your solution to know whether it works and where it will bring value.""

As AI reshapes consumer decision-making, brands and retailers must redesign shopping journeys around future AI-driven moments, using agents to reduce uncertainty early through research, comparison, and personalised support. Strong data readiness and end-to-end testing are essential to overcome cross-channel challenges. Companies should leverage AI to scale relevance while preserving brand distinctiveness, and invest in AI skills and strategic partnerships to build expertise and deploy AI responsibly.

AI is reshaping where, when, and how decisions are made across every industry. In retail, understanding AI-influenced consumer behaviour will become a defining competitive advantage, separating brands and retailers that shape decisions from those that simply fulfill them.

The outcome of the talks between Orcel and Delfin Chairman Francesco Milleri was not immediately clear.
Orcel sits on the board of the Fondazione Leonardo Del Vecchio charitable foundation and Delfin is a shareholder in UniCredit.
It also owns 17% of MPS, a holding worth 4.6 billion euros, and a 10.5% stake in Generali.","ROME/MILAN, Jan 12 (Reuters) - UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel has discussed potentially buying the stake in Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) held by Delfin in contacts with the head of the Italian holding company, three people close to the matter told Reuters.

An investment in MPS could put UniCredit back in play in the consolidation reshaping Italian banking after last year's failed attempt to acquire Banco BPM, another smaller rival.

The sources said UniCredit had also weighed a potential direct investment in Delfin, the holding company of Italy's Del Vecchio family. Delfin declined to comment.

UniCredit is also interested in Delfin's stake in Generali, Italy's biggest insurer, one of the sources added.

UniCredit last year built a holding of nearly 7% in Generali as a financial investment, which it later cut to 2%. Orcel has said UniCredit ""is observing"" developments at Generali.

The outcome of the talks between Orcel and Delfin Chairman Francesco Milleri was not immediately clear.

Delfin belongs in equal parts to the eight heirs of the late billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio.

Orcel and Milleri have frequent contact for several reasons, two other people close to the matter separately said. Orcel sits on the board of the Fondazione Leonardo Del Vecchio charitable foundation and Delfin is a shareholder in UniCredit.

UniCredit still has capital in excess of targeted thresholds, after buying 26% of Germany's Commerzbank and 29.8% of Greece's Alpha Bank.

Orcel's M&A efforts have met resistance from the governments in both Rome and Berlin. UniCredit has blamed Italy for derailing the BPM deal.

Reuters reported in November that Italy's government still aimed to see through a long-held plan to combine MPS with BPM. Italy owns 4.9% of MPS after cutting a 68% stake it had acquired in a 2017 bailout.

Delfin's main asset is a 32% stake in eyewear group EssilorLuxottica. It also owns 17% of MPS, a holding worth 4.6 billion euros, and a 10.5% stake in Generali.

If it were to rise to $7 trillion in 2026, that would require the stock to rise by 56%. Any stock that rises that fast in a year is well worth an investment, and if Nvidia truly has a shot at becoming a $7 trillion company in 2026, it should be at the top of every investor's shopping list.

I think that Nvidia can achieve this lofty goal in 2026, but it will require a few things to happen. If these things transpire, I have no doubt that Nvidia will be a top stock to own for this year.

AI spending isn't slowing down

AI hyperscalers spent a record amount of money constructing data centers in 2025. All of them have informed investors that 2026 will see increased spending as well. That's a big deal for Nvidia, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard computing unit used to train and run artificial intelligence models.

Nvidia's GPUs are the best available, but so are the supporting components, like its controlling software and connecting infrastructure. This makes Nvidia the go-to company to outfit data centers, but there's an issue: Nvidia has sold out all of its cloud GPU capacity. Nvidia must work to increase its capacity to meet this unprecedented demand, and it has already taken several steps to maximize its output.

First, Nvidia plans to significantly reduce its gaming GPU output in 2026. That move will free up chips to be used in the more profitable and in-demand cloud GPUs. Second, Nvidia is pushing its chip supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, to increase its output. That will give Nvidia greater supply and allow it to increase production to meet the massive demand in the market for its chips.

I believe both of these items are achievable for 2026, which will enable Nvidia to maintain its rapid growth rate. For fiscal year 2027 (ending January 2027), Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to grow its revenue by 50%. Analysts have consistently underestimated Nvidia's growth potential, so I wouldn't be surprised if the actual figure exceeds that. Furthermore, there's a somewhat unknown factor that could boost Nvidia's sales even further: China.

Nvidia appears poised to resume shipments of chip sales to China. According to Reuters, there is demand for about 2 million units, while Nvidia has about 700,000 H200 chips on hand. There could be even more demand if these initial shipments go well, and that could also boost Nvidia's growth rate this year.

All of this adds up to a company that could be worth $7 trillion if everything goes as planned for Nvidia.

A $7 trillion market cap won't be easy to achieve

For Nvidia to get to a $7 trillion market cap, we need to make a few assumptions:

Nvidia's profit margins maintain their current level.

Nvidia meets analysts' expectations of 50% growth.

Nvidia's valuation stays at its current level.

AI spending is projected to continue in 2027.

The average Wall Street analyst projects $320 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2027, at Nvidia's current 53% profit margin, which would equate to $170 billion in profits by the end of the fiscal year. Nvidia's current price-to-earnings ratio is 46, which is actually cheaper than it has been over the past few years.

With $320 billion in profits at a P/E ratio of 46, that would value the stock at $7.8 trillion.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F850053%2Fperson-throwing-money-in-the-air.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-13 00:59:18.254484

Read more about the IBV study “Retail and Consumer Products in the AI Era”","Retailers operate in an environment where customer expectations rise faster than margins, leaving little room for hesitation regarding transformation. Artificial intelligence has quickly become one of the most powerful forces reshaping how the industry engages shoppers, designs products and runs its operations.

The latest IBM Institute for Business Value study, Retail and Consumer Products in the AI Era, reveals that the next two years will be especially pivotal.

The decisions retail leaders make about AI in 2026 and 2027 will influence not only competitive differentiation. They will also influence how effectively brands keep pace with customers who are integrating AI into their daily lives—using it to inform decisions, navigate choices and shape how and where they shop.

Customer expectations are shifting, and the industry now requires a clear, practical agenda for what comes next. Insights from the study highlight the areas where AI is already creating measurable impact and where retailers should focus their attention to unlock value.

A notable finding from the IBV study is the shift in where AI investment originates. By 2027, 35% of total AI expenses will sit outside the IT budget, up from 28% in 2025. Meanwhile, AI expense within IT budgets is also increasing—from just under 10% of annual IT budgets today to 13% in 2027.

This signals an important industry shift: AI has become a business decision, not just a technology one.

Merchandising teams are increasingly funding AI to enhance product discovery. Marketing teams are deploying AI to personalize content and offers. Supply chain leaders are applying AI to anticipate demand and manage exceptions. When investment flows out of traditional silos, it reflects a broader organizational shift toward operationalizing AI across the enterprise.

The study shows that 80% of retail and consumer products companies now have a long-term innovation strategy for AI. This move underscores that AI is no longer positioned as a side experiment but as a core engine for growth.

Looking toward 2026 and 2027, these investments represent a turning point. AI spending is moving beyond tool experimentation into a phase focused on building the capabilities required to compete in a market shaped by real-time decisions, sophisticated customer expectations and new forms of digital commerce.

Retailers have always relied on data to understand customers, yet much of that data remains underutilized. According to the IBV study, 64% of companies say that their proprietary data is accessible to AI, but only 49% of that data is usable. Moreover, just 26% is being used currently to train AI models.

This gap highlights a significant opportunity. Unlocking proprietary data is one of the most critical components of the 2026–2027 AI agenda because the performance of high‑value AI capabilities—whether in personalization, inventory optimization or forecasting—depends on data quality and accessibility.

Retail has an advantage: the industry has historically collected rich, high‑volume customer and transaction data. As data becomes cleaner, better governed and more connected, the downstream value of AI increases dramatically across experiences and operations.

Customers are already feeling the impact. 58% of executives say that AI improves customer retention and satisfaction, and over the past year, AI has contributed to an average 31% improvement in these areas. For an industry built on loyalty, those gains are significant.

AI’s role in retail is shifting from advisory to action-oriented. The IBV study shows that 84% of executives expect AI to significantly enhance their ability to respond rapidly to market disruptions and evolving customer needs. But the most transformative shift is not speed alone—it’s AI’s ability to take action on complex tasks.

Agentic and autonomous AI systems are already running multi-step workflows: coordinating inventory, personalizing offers and guiding customers through complex purchase decisions. According to the study, 76% of executives are transforming their business models to leverage AI not only for efficiency but also for new revenue streams.

This shift toward action-driven AI is expected to become one of the defining characteristics of retail transformation over the next two years. Organizations that build the foundation for agentic AI in 2026 will be better positioned to elevate experiences and capture new value by 2027.

A compelling example comes from Al Futtaim Group, whose AI-powered Blue app integrates loyalty, payments and shopping into a unified journey. Customers earn and redeem across categories instantly, browse frictionlessly and complete transactions in a single flow—demonstrating the impact of AI-led orchestration paired with human oversight.

The study makes clear that AI augments rather than replaces human roles. AI agents increasingly take on repetitive, multi-step processes across the value chain—linking inventory, payments, logistics and customer data—while employees step in where judgment, empathy and brand trust are essential.

This model frees associates and service teams to focus on higher-value interactions and complex customer needs. Executives report that AI is delivering the most value in marketing, customer service, supply chain operations and digital commerce—areas where operational precision and human connection intersect.

The result is a hybrid operating model where AI manages the complexity, and people amplify what makes retail distinctively human.

The study also highlights the growing importance of ecosystems. AI can have a transformative impact only when tools, partners, platforms and agents work together securely and seamlessly. Autonomous AI cannot reach its potential within fragmented systems.

To prepare for this shift, retailers will need to modernize commerce platforms, redesign processes for non-linear customer journeys and strengthen data governance. When AI systems can understand and act across the full business, retailers can orchestrate experiences holistically rather than in isolated touchpoints.

This is why ecosystem integration sits at the center of the 2026–2027 AI agenda. The future belongs to retailers who can coordinate intelligence across the value chain, not just within individual functions.

Insights from the IBV study point to three areas where retail leaders can focus to accelerate progress:

Use AI to deliver permissioned, hyper-personalized experiences

Tailor journeys through secure customer data, deploy AI in high-impact processes like order-to-cash and supply chain orchestration and ensure that AI tools reflect your brand truth—even when customers interact through external AI assistants.

Enable conversational commerce and automate key tasks with AI

Make your product information discoverable and AI-friendly. Start automating repetitive operational tasks, then expand AI’s role as you establish trust—for both your customers and your teams.

Orchestrate collaboration between AI agents and across ecosystems

Break down silos. Connect business systems. Let AI agents coordinate work across functions. Ensure that AI-driven recommendations and transactions remain secure, accurate and aligned to your brand values.

In retail, every click, cart and conversation carries weight—and AI is amplifying the best of what makes the industry human. Over the next two years, the gap will widen between retailers that use AI to fundamentally rethink how they operate and those retailers that see it as just another layer of technology.

The defining difference will come down to clear decisions about data foundations, operating models and where AI is trusted to act. Strengthening these foundations now will shape the next era of retail performance.

The opportunity ahead is significant—and very real. Retailers who act with intent today will help define what “good” looks like tomorrow. Those retailers who wait might find the pace has already been set for them.

The Turkish denim manufacturer teamed with Karachi, Pakistan-based SM Denim to launch BodyCast, a resin-based finish that’s applied to garments mounted on life-like mannequins. The purpose of this setup is to mirror the human lower body, allowing whiskers, thigh rolls, pocket bite, and honeycombs to form naturally.

The process celebrates how, for more than 150 years, denim has been defined by how it responds to the body—creasing at stress points, fading with friction, and developing character over time, Rimaks stated. Rather than finishing denim on a flat bench and relying on aggressive abrasion or artificial distressing, the process creates three-dimensional wear mapping that feels intuitive, lived-in, and personal to the wearer.

This “new generation” resin is activated under lower temperatures and it does not contain formaldehyte. However, it is not more expensive than the resin treatment. Though it takes longer than the standard resin application, the process can be applied at scale.

“We cast denim on the body,” said Meir Barbut, Board Member at Rimaks. “BodyCast allows us to recreate the way denim truly wears—naturally, honestly, and with depth—while giving brands full control over the final expression.”

The result is a balance of whisker depth, comb intensity and subtle sheen that enhances texture without overpowering the fabric. Finishes can also be adjusted by fit, meaning the process can be applied to the wide variety of jeans in the market like tapered, straight, wide or barrel.

Additionally, Rimaks notes how BodyCast allows garments to “age gracefully.” By eliminating heavy abrasion, jeans are less lightly to breakdown prematurely.

Rimaks aims to take a lead in innovating denim wash and finishing techniques. Last summer, the company partnered with DNM Denim to introduce Nova, a four-step finishing platform that utilizes laser abrasion, ozone-enhanced bleaching, eco-stoning and advanced eco-chemistry.

Fabrics finished with BodyCast will be presented by SM Denim later this month at Denim & Jeans Egypy and Kingpins New York. The fabrics are part of the mill’s Icons collection, which focuses on timeless constructions and indigo shades that tap into the demand for both heritage and modern denim.

“Icons was created as a tribute to denim purists,” adds Junaid Javed, SM Denim executive chairman. “With BodyCast, those fabrics come alive in a way that feels both timeless and relevant.”

Few people lay awake at night fretting about whether there’s enough copper out there, but energy historian Daniel Yergin is warning that a major shortage looms on the horizon and that will lead to steep cost increases and hinder the world from becoming more modern unless it is addressed.

Copper has long been studied by economists as a barometer for what’s happening in the wider economy because of its versatility and ubiquity.

Article content

But Yergin said copper, which is essential for the generation, transmission and use of electricity, is in the midst of a demand explosion. That’s evident in the multibillion-dollar data centres sprouting up to power artificial intelligence (AI) applications, the fleets of new electric vehicles hitting the roads, which continue to grow rapidly though not as quickly in North America as elsewhere, and the growth of renewable energy installations, among other things.

Article content

Already, copper supplies, about 85 per cent of which come from mines, cannot keep up with the rising demand, he said.

Article content

Fortunately, the current shortage is minimal. Annual demand represents about 28 million tonnes per year, and mine production and recycling produce about 27 million tonnes per year. The difference has been filled in by whatever existing stockpiles are around.

Article content

But that won’t last much longer because copper demand is skyrocketing, Yergin said, something he and a team of commodity analysts, data centre experts, former diplomats and others at research firm S&P Global Inc. laid out in a 110-page report released last week.

Article content

Article content

It builds on a similar report about copper that Yergin released in mid-2022, but a few months after that report, he said he realized “the world had changed” for copper demand when he arrived at the annual energy conference he founded in Texas and noticed groups of tech executives milling around.

PS Community Hub breaks away from traditional retail apps or loyalty programs by uniting social, commerce, and culture into a single co-creation platform. The hub offers creators tools for content publishing, personal brand building, and monetization through affiliate commissions.

Additionally, it provides a growth path to help creators increase their exposure, unlock new opportunities, and give top users the chance to co-create capsule collections, Pacsun stated.

Through PS Community Hub, the retailer’s goal is to bridge “digital community engagement with real-world product creation” while continuing to drive authentic content that resonates with consumers.

“The creation of PS Community Hub demonstrates Pacsun’s purpose-driven retail strategy, putting creators and our youth community at the heart of our plan to fuel sustainable growth, cultural relevance, and innovation in retail,” said Pacsun CEO Brieane Olson. “Our deep generational listening and Insights from the Pacsun Youth Report have been instrumental in shaping this initiative, ensuring that we address the evolving needs and aspirations of our young consumers and remain at the forefront of technology and social commerce.”

Everyday consumers can contribute to the hub as well. Pacsun said they can collaborate, share content, participate in immersive experiences, and engage with like-minded peers, all while enjoying social shopping experiences that convert engagement into sales.

Earnings Watch: JPMorgan and Delta start off the fourth-quarter earnings season amid high expectations, a more expensive market and questions about the Fed's independence

JPMorgan Chase reports quarterly results on Tuesday.

When Delta Air Lines Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. kick off fourth-quarter earnings this week, we'll get the first look at whether corporate America's enthusiasm matches up with that of investors, amid worries about the job market and deeper questions about the Federal Reserve's ability to manage the economy independently.

For the fourth quarter, at least, Wall Street still expects another round of solid results for the companies in the S&P 500 Index.

In a report on Friday, FactSet forecast earnings-per-share growth of 8.3% for the fourth quarter. That's below the average over the past five years, but it would still mark the 10th quarter of consecutive growth. Profit margins, meanwhile, are expected to stay strong, at 12.8%.

That report said analysts nudged their estimates higher for those results during the quarter - a sign of optimism, and something they don't normally do - even as concerns endured about higher prices, tariffs and the impact of the longest-ever government shutdown. The tech sector helped drive that confidence, despite enduring questions over stratospheric spending on artificial intelligence.

But as expectations stay high, stocks have gotten expensive. The S&P 500, as of last week, had been trading at more than 20 times estimated earnings.

""It'll be very hard to justify stocks and stock-market investors being positive and optimistic if the outlook for the companies is softening or not improving,"" Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks, said in an interview.

Investors rode into 2026 hopeful that a cocktail of lower interest rates, tax breaks, easing inflation and tariff clarity would loosen up consumer spending. But the fourth-quarter results - and the more-important financial forecasts that will accompany them - will follow a December jobs report that showed signs of a still-weak but firming labor market, and a Justice Department criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over whether he lied to Congress about cost overruns for renovations to the central bank's headquarters, which Powell and others have cast as a pretext for an attack on the Fed's independence.

Stocks on Monday appeared unfazed by the investigation, at least for now. But JPMorgan (JPM) and the other banks could field questions about the state of the Fed on calls with reporters and analysts, amid broader pressure by President Donald Trump to get Powell to cut interest rates more aggressively.

""As the long-term outlook goes, the independence of the Fed is extremely relevant, and we have plentiful evidence that monetary policy driven by politics tends to end up with inflationary results,"" Giuseppe Sette, president of the AI-driven analytics firm Reflexivity, said in a email.

""However, the short term might be more resilient,"" he continued. ""We've seen the market effectively shake off Ukraine for a longer while. We've seen it shake off Venezuela. We've seen it shake off Iran and even the Greenland discussions.""

Markets are also still waiting for the Supreme Court to rule on the legality of Trump's emergency-powers tariffs, after justices held off on a ruling on Friday. Nancy Tengler, the chief executive of Laffer Tengler Investments, said she'd want to know how the companies reporting in the weeks ahead might rework their production and supply chains if the court ruled against the government.

However, the Trump administration has other ways to place duties on imports. And she said that many companies had already largely rerouted their production and shipping infrastructure, or made other adjustments, to account for the higher import taxes.

""You may see some pops in better-than-expected guidance,"" she said, referring to the financial outlooks companies provide during quarterly earnings. ""But I just don't think it's going to amount to much.""

Heading into the results, some Wall Street analysts were hopeful that Trump's so-called ""Big Beautiful Bill"" legislation - which cut taxes but also cut or slapped restrictions on some public assistance - might give consumers fatter tax refunds or otherwise jolt spending, helping chains like Walmart Inc. (WMT) and brands like Nike Inc. (NKE).

Lower interest rates and less-aggressive price increases could also help, as companies run out of room to charge more without putting a bigger dent in demand. However, analysts said wealthier consumers would likely benefit more from any policy changes or easing borrowing and living costs.

""The K-shaped economy that everybody keeps talking about is certainly still intact,"" Eric Clark, chief investment officer at Accuvest Global Advisors, said in emailed comments. ""The upper part of the K, the higher income, with real assets and homes, they're doing pretty well, and they're spending really well. The small part, the lower-income cohorts, are struggling, because inflation is still present in a lot of parts of our lives.""

""Retail sales have been strong, but it's not been broad,"" he continued. ""Consumers are being very choiceful. They're asking, 'Is this item an interesting item? If it's discretionary, do I love it?'""

As more companies report, Tengler said she'd also be watching for remarks about spending and hiring plans. Those details would come amid the current inertia of the ""no hire, no fire"" job market, and as analysts watch for the impacts of AI on headcount.

Bob Lang, founder and chief strategist at Explosive Options, also said he'd be watching for hiring trends.

""A lot of companies were able to get away with keeping employment high, keeping their payrolls up, because they were able to raise prices and offset some of that increased cost in employment,"" he said.

""I don't think that they're going to have that ability to do that going forward,"" he added later. ""I think inflation has come down quite a bit.""

JPMorgan (JPM) and Delta (DAL) report on Tuesday. Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC), Citigroup Inc. (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) also report during the week.

Expectations for the banks are higher, as regulators back away from the industry. Analysts were upbeat about dealmaking, investment banking, mergers and acquisitions and IPOs.

However, Mian, at Zacks, said higher interest rates and concerns about the economy had weighed on loan demand. Credit quality could be another focus. But he said concerns about credit quality and delinquencies had leveled off.

Delta, meanwhile, reports in the wake of what Melius Research analyst Conor Cunningham called a ""lost year"" for the airlines, punctuated by the government shutdown. But Delta's push toward wealthier fliers has been a plus for the carrier's sales.

""Not all airlines were able to take on a challenging environment and minimize downside to estimates, but Delta and United managed the best, while others struggled,"" Cunningham said in a note last week.

The Big Tech companies that report in the weeks ahead - like Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) - will face concerns about financing for the AI infrastructure buildout, which has driven up energy costs, and circular deal-making. But Tengler said that for investors, there are still few places to find growth.

""We keep hearing that the tech trade is dead,"" Tengler said. ""I've been keeping track: We've heard it every summer since 2022, and yet that's where all the growth has come in, not just in the economy and the capex side of things, but in stock-price performance.""

She added: ""We're still seeing a big, huge spread between technology earnings growth and the rest of the market.""

Johnson & Johnson has reached an agreement with the Trump administration tied to its ongoing $55 billion U.S.-based investment plan, reinforcing the company’s commitment to domestic manufacturing, R&D, and job creation. The move reflects broader industry efforts to align capital deployment with evolving federal priorities around supply chain resilience.

At the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, Bristol Myers Squibb outlined how it is positioning the company for the next decade, emphasizing disciplined capital allocation, late-stage pipeline execution, and strategic business development. Leadership highlighted a focus on durable growth drivers across oncology, immunology, and cardiovascular disease.

Pfizer also used the JPMorgan stage to detail its post-COVID pivot, stressing a sharper emphasis on operational execution and pipeline productivity. The company acknowledged near-term revenue pressure from declining pandemic-related products while reaffirming confidence in its long-term innovation strategy.

Instrument: A means to capture data (i.e., a questionnaire) plus all the information and documentation that supports its use. Generally, that includes clearly defined methods and instructions for administration or responding, a standard format for data collection, and well documented methods for scoring, analysis, and interpretation of results in the target patient population.

*in this article, COA is used synonymously with questionnaire

The licensing and translations process for clinical outcome assessment (COA) measures is notorious for being a major pain point in clinical trial set-up, and is often a significant resource burden, from both a time and cost perspective. But this is not a new concern—as an industry, we have been talking for decades about how much of a source of friction this process can be.

All stakeholders—copyright holders, sponsors, CROs, eCOA providers—should strongly endorse the importance of removing barriers in the drug development process and getting treatments to patients faster. So, why are we still encountering the same issues, and what roadblocks (or incentives) are driving the unacceptable status quo and how can they be solved?

Licensing

The following details common problems encountered during the licensing process that present a risk to study go-live, along with proposed solutions. Furthermore, when—as it so often is—eCOA set-up and implementation is on the critical path to first patient in (FPI) (See Figure 1), these issues can be exacerbated.

Problem: Who is the copyright holder?

Identification of copyright ownership of a COA can sometimes be challenging; research to ascertain this can take time, often requiring contact to be made with several entities, or a trawl through the literature.

Solution: At COA conception (such as during the funding process), developers should ensure a clearly documented path to its use, detailing agreed arrangements for its long-term management—including who will own the copyright, its licensing process, and user support. This is especially pertinent in cases of academically developed measures, where contact information is often only included in a publication, which can become out-of-date if the author has changed institution or retired. Journals that publish findings from COA development should also ensure that clear information on how to obtain permission (if any) for the COA(s) use are available.

Problem: When will the copyright holder respond?

Some copyright holders take weeks to respond to a license request and require much chasing throughout the process.

Solution: Copyright holders should have a duty of care to provide clearly stated response times, ideally along with a clear description of the process required to secure permissions for the COA(s) use (e.g., on their website, or via an automated email response detailing this). When considering the appropriate timeline for response, being cognizant of the fact that COA licensing and eCOA implementation is often on the critical path to FPI, is encouraged. More detailed information would also likely reduce the number of enquires received. If a COA developer does not have the resource or expertise to manage this activity, engaging a COA management organization is recommended.

Problem: What will the license include?

Certain COAs have additional materials that can be licensed (which are not included as standard), and the availability of such materials is not always made clear from the outset. It would be fair to assume that the license would include access to all the available support documentation under the FDAs definition of an instrument1 (Box 1); however, this is not always the case. Furthermore, the cost and timeline implications associated with licensing these elements are not always made clear upfront and can lead to delays and unforeseen (hidden) costs.

Solution: Copyright holders should provide clear information upfront on exactly what a standard license includes and available additions, to enable informed decisions about buying their products. Provision of a minimal package as standard is encouraged, in line with the FDA’s definition of an instrument,1 including:

The Licensed COA

Scoring information, and any associated analytics software

Any administration instructions

Additional elements to facilitate electronic implementation may include:

Direction to adhere to industry best practices for electronic implementation2 or specific copyright holder requirements (especially when they deviate from established best practices)2

Documented process for eCOA reproductions, including any review requirements (e.g., screenshot approval), associated costs, and estimated timelines (e.g., number of rounds of review included and turn-around-times)

Problem: What parameters are required for pricing?

Standardization and consistency in COA pricing models are lacking and can be based on a range of parameters, such as number of sites, participants, administrations, or trial length. As some of these parameters may not be finalized at the point of license initiation (e.g., site selection is ongoing, regulatory bodies may not have approved the protocol), the process can be delayed or will require subsequent license amendments, which is an additional administrative task and potential cost.

Solution: Clear upfront information from copyright holders about pricing parameters for a given COA so licensees can confidently forecast potential licensing costs.

Problem: How long will contract review take?

Licenses of copyright are legally binding contracts that can require review from several different stakeholders (including the CRO, sponsor, eCOA provider, and/or training provider) which can take time. Further, when a study is going to use eCOA, some copyright holders require that this is specified when requesting the license and included in the agreement. When eCOA provider selection is on the critical path to FPI, this can delay licensing initiation and execution.

Solution: In the absence of a standard licensing template used by all copyright holders, at the very least, a commitment to turn around reviews in a specific time is needed.

Problem: When will the COA be provided?

Often, a copy of the COA is not provided until license execution and payment. Not having access to an official copy of the COA prior to this can negatively impact:

Protocol development

Sponsors cannot review and evaluate the appropriateness of individual items and the measure in its entirety, to determine if it is suitable for a given trial application

eCOA technical feasibility assessment:

eCOA providers are unable to ensure their system has the required functionality to build the most optimal electronic version of the COA

eCOA build:

The license has often not been executed and paid for at the time of commencing eCOA build activities—especially where the eCOA provider is contracted for scale management

As contracting and kicking off eCOA services is often on the critical path to FPI, not having access to the COA(s) to create eCOA specifications and the build presents a major risk to study go-live

Invoice terms are usually Net 30 days (and can be greater), and so expediting normal payment terms is required

Ultimately, it runs the risk that some may obtain a copy of the COA from an unreliable (non-official, possibly adulterated) source, to try and assess the suitability of the COA and meet eCOA build timelines.

Solution: Providing an official copy of the COA (including watermarked sample copy or if developed electronically, access to the items) prior to the execution of the license and payment, would significantly benefit the clinical trial set-up process, and reduce the impact of many of the detailed issues. It would be on the strict understanding that it should not be used in a live study until license execution and payment. The license, in this scenario, is for the actual use of the COA (i.e., for completion within a study). With most things in life that we buy, we can review and assess it prior to purchase—whereas what we see for COA licensing is often buying blind.

Alternatively, a limited rights license (that is quick to execute) could be provided to allow for review and/or eCOA build, enabling eCOA providers to reproduce the COA electronically and make reasonable preparations for study use.

Screenshots

Problem: Generating screenshots imminently after eCOA project initiation.

If sponsors request screenshots for ethics committee (EC) and/or Institutional Review Board (IRB) submissions (though they are not necessarily required),3,4 this can create a huge challenge and pressure on eCOA providers to generate these in the time required; especially when the COA is not provided until license execution and payment.

This could become more challenging with the new EU-CTR submissions process requiring a single submission for all EU member states, and the perception that all translated screenshots may be requested by individual health authorities. If copyright holders must approve the screenshots prior to this, further delays can be seen.

Some copyright holders also require live demo review, which can add further time to receiving implementation approval.

Solution: A clear public statement from IRBs/ECs that eCOA screenshots are not required and the paper COA is sufficient.

Translations

Another challenge faced during licensing is the associated translation activities, which present differently dependent on if the required translations already exist or not. For example, it is not always clear what translations are available, the methodology employed (leading to a lack of confidence in faithful translation), and so translations are often repeated, which can lead to variation and confusion.

Copyright holders (or a delegated management organization) should have a duty of care to maintain a published translation database with this information (e.g., on a website)—that is recognized as the only source of official translations—with updates as new ones are added, and on details on access.

If the copyright holder requires approval of eCOA screenshots for every language implemented in a study this takes a significant amount of time, and is a major risk if a sponsor wishes to go live in languages other than a routinely used language (e.g., US English). Copyright holders are encouraged to be mindful of this when requiring approval of all translated eCOA reproductions, or at least sensitive to their impact on timelines when working with stakeholders such as sponsors, eCOA providers and or language service providers.

Are eCOA libraries the answer?

In short, no. At least not based on the current model, and until there is a more cost-effective model for libraries, they are unlikely to have the utility they promise.

Licensing and translations fees are either paid directly, or are passthrough costs, by the sponsor. In the current library model, the eCOA provider must pay the library license fee. For smaller organizations, and especially when projected use can be unclear (i.e., there is no guarantee of recuperation)—it is risky to front-up what can be a substantial amount of money—sometimes in the millions.

Further, sponsors are still required to pay the licensing fee for the actual use of the COA in a study, so the eCOA provider also must develop a costing model that recoups the upfront cost of the library license, which can be especially challenging where sponsors expect cost savings/reductions from using COAs from the eCOA providers library. Sponsors often very reasonably question that if the eCOA is already built, why should they pay the same price for it again. The library model also saves the copyright holder time and resource as they are not repeatedly reviewing screenshots, and yet they are charging extra for a library license, which as mentioned can be substantial.

An alternative model sees approval obtained by the eCOA provider for their build, and then the copyright holder being notified of a new study wanting to use it, so they can confirm it is the approved build. They would still receive the same licensing fees from the sponsor and not have to review implementations repeatedly.

Conclusion

The challenges outlined are well understood, not insurmountable, and entirely solvable. The current approach and relationship between eCOA providers, copyright holders, and sponsors/CROs remains overly transactional, and it is time to move beyond inertia and adopt practical, collective solutions. A committed effort from all stakeholders is required to address the aspects within their control, and the efficiencies to be gained from relatively simple changes to the processes implemented by many copyright holders are not insignificant by any means. Additionally, sponsors engaging copyright holders and eCOA providers earlier (and off the critical path to FPI) would also mitigate some of the challenges described. By doing so, we can move past these recurring problems and focus our energy on more meaningful goals, such as truly optimizing the user experience of digital technologies and speeding up drug development.

Copyright holders who have adopted many of the solutions outlined above, demonstrate a genuine intention and commitment to find ways to remove delays in getting effective treatments to those in need whilst rightly protecting their intellectual property and the integrity of the COA. Mitigating against improper use of COAs that could bring into question the integrity of the specific use of the COA is critical, and the solutions outlined in this article would not bring that into question The payment and contractual requirements would still be adhered to, and the burden felt by sponsors, CROs, and eCOA providers, would be greatly reduced.

So, not only are AI companies taking from the web and giving less back — they are also leaving some site owners with bigger bills to pay.
Business Insider will keep tracking this Cloudflare data in the coming months and quarters to see how this behavior evolves.","Are AI giants nurturing the web, the most valuable store of human data the world will ever see? Or are they scraping content for free and giving little back? Updated data from Cloudflare sheds new light on this important question.

This is one of the most under-discussed parts of the AI revolution. While tech companies spend lavishly on data centers, GPUs, and talent, they avoid talking about the other key ingredient of AI success: data.

That's because they don't want to pay for the high-quality human data that's needed for AI model training, inference, and AI outputs. Instead, they send out bots to crawl websites and scoop up this information, mostly for free.

In the past, tech companies would send users to the original sources of this information. This formed the grand bargain of the web. Sites would let their data be taken for free on the understanding that they would get referrals in return, and could pay for their efforts through advertising, subscriptions, and other techniques.

In the new generative AI world, this deal is breaking down. Now, AI answer engines and chatbots give users direct answers, making people less likely to visit the websites that created and verified the data in the first place.

Cloudflare, which helps run about 20% of the world's websites, began tracking this behavior in 2025. It measures Big Tech company bots' requests to crawl websites, and the number of referrals the platforms send to sites.

This crawl-to-refer ratio is a useful guide to how much tech companies are taking from the web and how much they're giving back. For example, a ratio of 100 to 1 would mean a company's bots crawled sites 100 times for every 1 referral they send.

Is this one way to measure how ethical companies are in the AI era? I'll leave you to decide. Here's the data for the first week in January.

As you can see, Anthropic stands out like a sore thumb. According to Cloudflare data, it crawls sites way more than it sends users out to the web. Anthropic actually crawled even more in early January, compared to the first week of September 2025, according to this data.

The same applies to OpenAI; its crawl-to-refer ratio has worsened. Again, this suggests that OpenAI is taking more value from the web and giving less value back.

This aligns with Business Insider reporting from late 2024. Back then, we told you that bots from Anthropic and OpenAI, especially, were crawling some websites so much that it was causing their traffic costs to spike dramatically.

One web developer saw a client's cloud-computing costs double within a few months due to this AI bot swarm, according to BI reporting.

So, not only are AI companies taking from the web and giving less back — they are also leaving some site owners with bigger bills to pay.

Like last quarter, I asked Anthropic why it crawls so much and gives so little back to the web. The startup did not respond to an email seeking comment.

Back in September, Anthropic said it couldn't confirm the crawl-to-refer ratios calculated by Cloudflare and said there may be ""issues"" with the methodology. At that time, Anthropic also noted that it launched a web search feature for its popular Claude AI chatbot earlier this year. This was generating more referral traffic for websites now, and this is growing quickly, the startup said back then.

OpenAI didn't respond to a request for comment.

A caveat: The numbers that go into the crawl-to-refer ratio focus on the web and exclude native app activity. If app activity were included, the ratios might be lower. However, this methodology applies to all the companies included in this ranking.

Google's relatively low ratio is likely due to its traditional search engine, which still shows clear website links in many results. However, the company is increasingly weaving in AI chatbot-style answers into its search service, via AI Overviews and AI mode.

Google has been saying lately that it still sends traffic to the web, and it cares about the health of this ecosystem.

Business Insider will keep tracking this Cloudflare data in the coming months and quarters to see how this behavior evolves.",https://i.insider.com/6961abee832e0ef1ead78baa?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2026-01-12 16:01:55.075962

Walmart is slated to join the Nasdaq 100, an index known for tracking tech stock, on Jan. 20, Nasdaq said.

The planned move comes as Walmart executives have focused on the retailer's e-commerce platform and novel AI tools.

Walmart is getting the recognition it’s been seeking for its e-commerce prowess.

The retail giant will move to the Nasdaq 100—an index tracking the 100 largest non-financial companies on the Nasdaq —before the market opens on Jan. 20, the exchange operator said Friday. Walmart (WMT) has spent months highlighting its marketplace and delivery services, fueling speculation that it was eyeing the list seen as a tech-sector bellwether.

Walmart will replace pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca (AZN). The move comes about a month after Walmart left the New York Stock Exchange for the Nasdaq, which is home to tech giants like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META).

Why This News Matters to Investors

Consumer-focused companies from Target to Wingstop have touted their embrace of AI as investors pour money in the technology. Walmart has successfully convinced investors that it's part tech stock, part retailer, and a pending move to the Nasdaq 100 index should bolster that.

The Nasdaq is a better fit for Walmart’s tech-centric approach, company executives have said. The retailer’s business no longer centers around a portfolio of big-box stores, they said, highlighting its booming delivery service, automated fulfillment centers and third-party marketplace.

“The results we're delivering today are powered by our people and by technology,” CEO Douglas McMillon told investors on a November conference call, according to a transcript from AlphaSense. “We continue to get better at putting our data to work, building more capable tech products, and platforms, and by deploying physical automation.”

McMillon highlighted the “digital acumen” of John Furner, head of Walmart U.S., when announcing in November that Furner will succeed him. Furner will lead the company through an “AI-driven transformation,” McMillon said.

Walmart is using AI to interact with consumers in new ways, including pinging customers on WhatsApp to ask if they want to stock up with a basket of frequently-ordered staples. It announced Sunday that it is working with Google to ensure people can easily find and purchase Walmart products when chatting in Gemini, Google’s AI-powered chat service.

In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.

The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of U.S. President Donald Trump. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, the Republican president said the move was a “great choice” by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — and noted that Powell McCormick had “served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.”

Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick’s experience in global finance, “combined with her deep relationships around the world,” made her “uniquely suited to help Meta” in its future growth.

Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee. She worked as a national security adviser at the start of Trump's first term, and also held roles in the White House and the Secretary of State's office under President George W. Bush. She is married to U.S. Sen. David McCormick, who served in high-level positions in the Commerce and Treasury departments under Bush — before he joined hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and rose to become CEO.

And Powell McCormick has a long background in finance. She spent 16 years in senior leadership at Goldman Sachs, but was most recently vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. She's also held a handful of other corporate board positions — including at oil giant Exxon Mobil.

According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.

The addition of Powell McCormick to Meta's management team arrived amid wider efforts from California-based Meta to boost its ties with Trump, who was once banned from Facebook. Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Last year, the company also appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to its board, another familiar figure in Trump's orbit.

But is this enough to raise its disappointing sales performance, especially at a time when the consumer expresses more value-oriented behaviors?

The company’s recent net sales ended 1.5% lower than 2024, a thorn in the side of investors who’ve lamented the retailer’s steady stock decline since its November 2021 peak. Even in the past year, the stock price has fallen by roughly 21.5% as of Jan. 8. Nevertheless, the recent announcement inspired a more local bump, accounting for a 10% spike YTD, indicating support for the retailer’s value play.

On the other hand, competitors Walmart and Amazon continue to capture incremental growth while the chain struggles, despite playing in similar spaces. Walmart also recently debuted a deeper investment in personal healthcare, slashing the price of more than 1,000 wellness items, similar to what Target did in November, albeit more concentrated on the specific assortment.

Target’s latest wellness push is part of a longer-term strategy. Last January, the retail giant expanded its wellness assortment with 2,000 items, with a focus on lower-priced items ($10 or less).

Both expansion announcements emphasize F&B’s stake in the segment, with notable recent additions such as ButcherBox’s retail debut of grass-fed beef; protein snacks and powders from Misfits, David, and Bloom; functional and non-alcoholic beverages from Ryze, Protein Pop, and Naked Life, and gut health support from The Coconut Cult and Seed.

“About 70% of guests are already shopping wellness at Target and right in time for the new year, we’re bringing them even more newness and value,” said Lisa Roath, EVP and chief merchandising officer of food, essentials and beauty at Target, in a statement.

David and Goliath: Taking on Whole Foods (+ Amazon)

The shift towards wellness blurs the lines between hypermarket and natural grocer: Target wants a stellar, premium suite of better-for-you products while still out-pricing the legacy leader, Whole Foods.

This competition is a play for the “better-for-you” shopper, a segment that dominates Amazon brands’ shopper base. To target these consumers, the hypermarket chain is challenging Whole Food’s “aspirational” wellness stigma by positing their healthy assortment as an everyday luxury. The move also carefully navigates the line between Walmart’s hyper-value niche and Amazon’s online, pantry-stocking endeavor.

“Our goal is to make wellness really accessible – fun, easy, affordable and personalized,” Roath said.

In recent months, Whole Foods has worked to separate itself from the premium-priced stigma, which, if successful, would complicate Target’s value proposition. In a conversation at Groceryshop, Whole Foods chief merchandising and marketing officer Sonya Gafsi Oblisk noted that the company is innovating with the value-oriented modern shopper in mind.

“We want our shoppers to walk in and see a sea of yellow,” she said, referring to the sale signs that indicate deep discounts across the grocer’s assortment.

Today’s consumer is focused on shopping deals and reducing food budgets. If Target can capture these shoppers who feel priced out of Whole Food’s premium space, it can secure a path toward growth that can return net sales to the green.

Zooming out, Target’s supply chain operations are aligning with Walmart and Amazon’s model to more adequately compete on online grocery, the most optimistic growth driver with consistent double-digit year-over-year gains.

In December, the chain expanded its next-day delivery capabilities with a “stores-as-hubs” model that allows brick-and-mortar locations to operate as sortation centers. As Target improves service for same-day and next-day delivery, Amazon is pushing the envelope, piloting ultrafast delivery (sub 30 minutes) in Seattle and Philadelphia.

Nick Edser

Shares in banks and credit card firms have fallen after US President Donald Trump called for credit card costs to be capped.

On Friday, Trump wrote on Truth Social that interest rates on cards should be limited to 10% for one year from 20 January.

He did not specify how such a cap might be introduced or whether such a move would be legally enforceable.

Shares in US credit card firms American Express, Visa and Mastercard fell in early trading, while shares in the UK bank Barclays, which has a sizeable US card business, were down 1.9% at close of trading in London.

US banking associations say capping rates will make it harder for people to access credit and be ""devastating"" for millions of families and small businesses.

The average interest rate for credit cards in the US is roughly 20%.

In his statement on social media, Trump called for limiting it to 10%, reviving an idea he had put forward during his 2024 presidential campaign.

""Effective January 20, 2026, I, as President of the United States, am calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%,"" he wrote. ""Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies.""

On Sunday, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said credit card companies would be ""in violation of the law"" if they did not comply with his demands.

American Express's share price initially fell by 4% while Visa and Mastercard's stock dropped more than 2%. Other US lenders including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America also saw their shares open more than 1% lower.

Forcing companies to lower their lending rates rate would ""upend the basic economics of the industry,"" said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

""Most banks would respond by cutting credit limits, closing riskier accounts, and scaling back rewards programmes, because they simply couldn't cover losses at that price point.""

Nearly half of US households in 2022 carried credit card debt, according to the most recent survey of consumer finances by the Federal Reserve.

It found that those with a balance owed more than $6,000 (£4,454) on average - which, with interest rates around 20%, translated into roughly $100 in monthly charges.

The idea of capping credit card rates has won support from an unlikely coalition of lawmakers, uniting those on the far-left, such as Bernie Sanders, with populists that back Trump's MAGA agenda.

But the path to bringing the proposal into force is unclear.

Similar plans have languished in Congress. The administration has also pushed to reduce the role of agencies that have regulated such issues in the past.

""Begging credit card companies to play nice is a joke,"" Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren said on X.

""I said a year ago if Trump was serious I'd work to pass a bill to cap rates. Since then, he's done nothing but try to shut down the CFPB [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]"".

Analysts said executive action by the White House would likely meet with legal challenge from the industry, which has had success in the past fighting regulation in the courts.

A joint statement from five US banking bodies said they shared the president's goal ""of helping Americans access more affordable credit"".

However, they added that the proposed cap would ""reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small businesses who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help"".

""If enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives.""

Early last year, Sanders and fellow US senator Josh Hawley had introduced bipartisan legislation which aimed to cap interest rates on credit cards at 10% for five years, but it has yet to make it into law.

In April 2025, the Trump administration moved to throw out a regulation capping credit card late fees at $8. The rule had been brought in by President Joe Biden's administration as part of a crackdown on ""junk fees"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5db9/live/491fe3a0-efae-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png,N,,2026-01-12 18:02:07.969373

According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.","NEW YORK(AP) — Facebook owner Meta has named Dina Powell McCormick, a former Trump administration adviser and longtime finance executive, as president and vice chairman of the tech giant.

Powell McCormick previously served on Meta's board of directors — where, the company notes, she was “deeply engaged” in accelerating its artificial intelligence push across platforms. In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.

The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of U.S. President Donald Trump. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, the Republican president said the move was a “great choice” by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — and noted that Powell McCormick had “served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.”

Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick’s experience in global finance, “combined with her deep relationships around the world,” made her “uniquely suited to help Meta” in its future growth.

Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee. She worked as a national security adviser at the start of Trump's first term, and also held roles in the White House and the Secretary of State's office under President George W. Bush. She is married to U.S. Sen. David McCormick, who served in high-level positions in the Commerce and Treasury departments under Bush — before he joined hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and rose to become CEO.

And Powell McCormick has a long background in finance. She spent 16 years in senior leadership at Goldman Sachs, but was most recently vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. She's also held a handful of other corporate board positions — including at oil giant Exxon Mobil.

According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.

The addition of Powell McCormick to Meta's management team arrived amid wider efforts from California-based Meta to boost its ties with Trump, who was once banned from Facebook. Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Last year, the company also appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to its board, another familiar figure in Trump's orbit.

BioAge stock jumped more than 14% to 16.01. Shares have climbed nearly 500% from a low point below 3 last seen in April. Today, BioAge shares hold a perfect IBD Digital Relative Strength Rating of 99, reflecting their top-notch 12-month performance.

The company is working on a drug that blocks NLRP3. BioAge tested its drug in patients with obesity and elevated hsCRP, or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. High levels of hsCRP indicate inflammation in the body, signaling a high risk of metabolic conditions like heart disease, stroke or diabetes.

After two weeks, patients given BioAge's BGE-102 showed an 86% reduction in hsCRP. More than nine in 10 patients, 93%, achieved normal levels of the problematic protein. BGE-102 also reduced IL-6, another protein that can drive inflammation and cardiovascular risk.

BioAge is now planning to start a Phase 2a study in the first half of the year.

Can BioAge Rival Ventyx?

The update puts BioAge Labs in competition with Ventyx, which Lilly is buying for $1.2 billion. Ventyx has a drug that blocks NLRP3 to lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

Neumora (NMRA) and Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) also have NLRP3 blockers in development.

""We are very encouraged by these results, which support the potential for BGE-102 to deliver injectable-like inflammation reduction in an oral therapy designed for primary care, the clinical setting where most cardiovascular risk is managed and where oral medicines are preferred by patients and physicians,"" BioAge Chief Executive Kristen Fortney said in a written statement.

She noted chronic inflammation is now recognized as a major driver of cardiovascular disease. But it's far less treated than high LDL cholesterol, a well-known and treated condition that can raise the risk of cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes.

Gotham at War: A History of New York City from 1933 to 1945

by Mike Wallace

Oxford University Press, 2025, 976 pp.

Nearly three decades have passed since the historian Mike Wallace published Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898, cowritten with the late Edwin G. Burrows, to much renown. A second volume, Greater Gotham: A History of New York City from 1898 to 1919 (written by Wallace alone), followed in 2017. With the publication of the third and final installment in this panoramic history, Gotham at War: A History of New York City from 1933 to 1945, it is possible both to view the project as a whole and to look afresh at one of the most transformative eras in the history of New York, the United States, and the world.

There are roughly three faces of New York that run through Gotham at War. The first is the city as a connector—a “critical interlink,” Wallace writes, “between Europe and all of the Americas.” The second is New York as a generator, a source of ideas, forces, people, and products that shaped the country and the world. By playing these roles, New York affected the course of the Second World War; in turn, the war remade New York in ways both obvious and subtle.

A third New York appears early on in the narrative, though it is not until some 400 pages later that one of Gotham at War’s many characters describes it. This man, a young French sociologist recently installed at the New School, spends his days tutoring himself in the ethnology of Latin America at the 42nd Street branch of the New York Public Library. In the afternoons, when he is not writing, he walks the city. “What really amazed [Claude] Lévi-Strauss,” Wallace writes, “was that it seemed all of humanity’s cultures were on display in the astonishingly heterogeneous wartime city.” Lévi-Strauss had worried that industrial society would erase the local particularities of which culture was made. Yet in New York he found not an “ultramodern metropolis” but rather an “aggregation of villages”—a “vast collection,” Wallace writes, “of remnants and survivals from many continents and different eras, a palette of cultural sensibilities, an anthropologist’s dream.”

City as connector, city as generator, city of villages—these are the guises New York assumes not only in Gotham at War, but throughout the thousands of pages of the Gotham series. Inspired by the efflorescence of social history in the 1960s and 1970s, Wallace (with Burrows) originally set out to write a new narrative of all of American history, telling the story from the bottom up, with particular attention to the dynamics of capitalism and empire. Practical considerations eventually interceded, and the authors decided instead to refract their new history of the United States “through the prism of its preeminent city.” Like its pr...",https://dissentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/williams2026fb.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 14:06:53.565605

Burial will follow at Holy Souls Cemetery, Robinson Township.","Walter J. Baker, M.D., of Robinson Township, passed peacefully at home on January 10th, 2026. His caring and steadfast presence touched so many lives in the Pittsburgh community. He was a devoted family man, a proud physician, a devout Catholic, and an outdoor enthusiast.

Walter was born in Crafton, PA to Sylvester and Gertrude Baker on April 1, 1927. He and his six siblings were active at St. Philips Church and in their community, and helped out at the family business, the Seven Baker Brothers Bakery. As a youth, Walt developed a strong work ethic and deep Catholic values, which he continued to practice and model throughout his 98 years of life.

Walter was both a World War II and Korean War veteran, enlisting in the Navy after graduating from Langley High School in 1945, and then serving in the Air Force during the Korean War. He earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1950, and Walter then completed two different doctorate degrees: in veterinary medicine from the University of Pennsylvania in 1954, and in medicine from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1965. He fulfilled his medical internship at Mercy Hospital and his Ophthalmology residency at the Eye and Ear Hospital of Pittsburgh, and served as an Associate Clinical Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Baker was a beloved mentor to ophthalmology resident physicians at the Veterans Hospital of Oakland, where he tutored surgical cases to budding physicians for 22 years. He practiced ophthalmology at South Hills Eye Associates of Mt Lebanon for over 30 years, during which he held medical staff appointments at Eye and Ear Hospital of Pittsburgh, St. Clair Memorial Hospital, Canonsburg Hospital, and Ohio Valley General Hospital. Walter was known for his caring and compassion for his patients – both animal and human. Patients sometimes remarked “If Dr Baker was good enough to take care of my dog, then he’s the one I want to take care of my eyes!”

Walt married Mary Bernadette Marko on September 5, 1953 at Holy Trinity Church, Robinson Township. His love and devotion to Mary dominated their almost 71 years of marriage. They met at a local soda shop, but soon became inseparable. Together they raised nine children with unwavering commitment to the importance of family in daily life. He would say, “it was hard raising the family, but your mother made it all happen”. Dad had a quick wit, a smile, and kind words throughout his life. He loved history and reading, and was unbelievably knowledgeable, with an answer for any question raised. He was always up for the joke of the day, a raised eyebrow in response to dry humor, and a laugh with the family. His face would light up with a welcoming smile when any of his grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nephews or nieces were present, making each feel as if they were the most special. Everyone loved Dad, Granddad, Great-Granddad, and Uncle Walt.

Walter was a devoted Catholic who practiced his faith in every aspect of his life. He had a special devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, praying the Rosary with family members each day. Everyone knew not to call between 9:30pm and 10pm: Mom and Dad were not going to answer during the EWTN rosary. He served as one of the first four Eucharistic Ministers at Holy Trinity Catholic Church and continued this for 44 years, was an instrumental supporter of Holy Trinity Catholic School, participated on multiple committees for school expansion and improvements, and was actively involved in the annual Holy Trinity Festival. He was a leader in community organizations including serving as past-president of Robinson Township Lions Club, member of the American Legion, supporter of the St. Vincent DePaul Society for the Poor, and member of multiple medical organizations.

Walt was an avid gardener—a family of nine children needed lots of vegetables! He loved growing crops alongside family, teaching every step of the way, passing on his knowledge of gardening and grafting fruit trees. The Steelers also held a special place in Dad’s heart. As a season ticket holder since 1969, he regularly attended home games until recently. Dad would not leave until the clock showed triple zeros! He saw Franco’s “Immaculate Reception” and enjoyed traveling to Super Bowl victories. Dad and Mom shared a passion for sports, watching any and all sporting events, side by side. They also loved traveling together, with Florida a favorite destination.

Walter is preceded in death by his beloved wife Mary, his parents Gertrude and Sylvester Baker, his siblings Virginia Smith, Mary Louise Karns, Michael Baker, Sylvia Clark, Sylvester Baker, and Ronald Baker. He is survived by his children Marybeth McCutcheon (Jake), Theressa Strong (Rick), Walter Baker (Michelle), Karen Lauer (Harrison), Susie Shipley (Neal), Lori Roberts (Michael), Elizabeth Moshier (Mike), Brad Baker (Marielle), and Anne Wible (Russ). He is also survived by 31 grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren, as well as numerous nieces and nephews.

Family and friends are welcome on Wednesday, January 14, 2026 from 6:00-8:30 PM and Thursday, January 15, 2026 from 2:00- 4:00 PM and 6:00-8:30 PM at Pittsburgh Cremation And Funeral Care, 5405 Steubenville Pike, Robinson Township, PA 15136.

Powell McCormick previously served on Meta's board of directors — where, the company notes, she was ""deeply engaged"" in accelerating its artificial intelligence push across platforms. In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.

The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of U.S. President Donald Trump. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, the Republican president said the move was a ""great choice"" by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — and noted that Powell McCormick had ""served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.""

Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick’s experience in global finance, “combined with her deep relationships around the world,” made her “uniquely suited to help Meta” in its future growth.

Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee. She worked as a national security adviser at the start of Trump's first term, and also held roles in the White House and the Secretary of State's office under President George W. Bush. She is married to U.S. Sen. David McCormick, who served in high-level positions in the Commerce and Treasury departments under Bush — before he joined hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and rose to become CEO.

And Powell McCormick has a long background in finance. She spent 16 years in senior leadership at Goldman Sachs, but was most recently vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. She's also held a handful of other corporate board positions — including at oil giant Exxon Mobil.

According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.

The addition of Powell McCormick to Meta's management team arrived amid wider efforts from California-based Meta to boost its ties with Trump, who was once banned from Facebook. Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Last year, the company also appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to its board, another familiar figure in Trump's orbit.

What could become of those colorful trading cards that are sitting in an attic? It may have seemed frivolous back then, but today Pokémon cards bring in serious cash.

The dozens of people lined up outside of the Best Buy at Atlantic Terminal Mall weren’t there for a special Black Friday sale on electronics. They queued for a regular release of Pokémon card packs, which they hoped could hold their golden ticket.

Unlike the traditional sports collector cards, Pokémon stand out among the rest in the trading card space because the colorful characters cannot lose favor the way an athlete can. Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Matt Strahm, joked in an interview with YouTube reporter Tyler Boronski.

“Pikachu is not going to tear his ACL…Charizard is not going to get a DUI,” Strahm said.

The Poké-craze might have hit America in the late 1990s, but the money flowing through the franchise over the past few years has completely eclipsed its previous peaks. In 2022, Logan Paul, a famous internet creator, purchased a single Pokémon card for more than $5 million. The Guinness World Record for the most expensive Pokémon card ever sold.

In the first set ever released in the United States, a card pulled from a $4 pack of cards in January of 1999, is now worth thousands of dollars before grading. To grade a card is to preserve the item in a protective sealed plastic slab, which is then ranked on a scale of one to ten to determine the quality of the item. The same card when graded a maximum 10 the value of the card can jump to hundreds of thousands according to pricecharting.com.

This October, the Wall Street Journal identified Pokémon cards as having a higher market return than global titans like Meta Platforms and the S&P 500. The nostalgic trading card game is heading into its 27th year in the United States.These colorful pieces of cardboard aren’t subject to standard financial regulations and pay no dividends. The value of these cards draws buyers to storefronts hours before opening, all for a chance to pull a high-value card from a pack they might not even be able to get.

On Nov. 1, 2025, PokéCourt opened its doors. The first of its kind storefront located in the Meatpacking District of New York City dedicated exclusively to Pokémon. The opening garnered attention from several publications, including Time Out Magazine and Curbed. The store has a floor-to-ceiling stock of rare cards, unique memorabilia, and products up-charged to match their rarity and the deepening pockets of collectors, it’s pure eye candy for anyone involved in the hobby.

Treating rare trading cards as dramatically valued assets isn’t new. The 1952 Mickey Mantle baseball card was bought for over $12 million in 2022. Music superstar Post Malone purchased a trading card from the game “Magic: The Gathering,” for an estimated $2 million.

Brook Trafton, the collector who pulled and sold the card to Malone, said in a TikTok post “…for a guy like me, being able to sell it is life changing.”

This doesn’t mean that the cards don’t fluctuate in value. Not every card released reaches the dramatic heights to catch mainstream attention. During the most recent set release “Phantasmal Flames,” a card of the character Charizard was originally estimated at $1,600 and $4,100 graded. In just two months, it has plummeted to around $600 and $2,200 graded according to COLLECTR, an app that looks similar to many mainstream stock trading apps. COLLECTR allows you to track the value of individual cards aggregated from multiple digital marketplaces such as eBay and TCGPlayer. COLLECTR refers to a collection as a “portfolio,” reinforcing the idea that these are assets to invest in.

For some, the investment is worth waiting outside a Brooklyn Best Buy on a cold Friday morning. Dozens of people spent hours in the cold with hopes of purchasing some cards. Jonathan Harris, 33, said that what brought him to the front of the line was: “the money, the worth of the cards.”

He wasn’t the only person who was in it for the chase of a big hit. Nadia Nizam, 31, said she used to buy and resell clothes and sneakers, but switched to Pokémon cards since they don’t have to worry about “size value,” meaning a size six could be worth more than a size 13.

“Cards are cards, if you have it, you have the money,” Nizam said.

The thrill of the chase has caused a dramatic influx of pressure on storefronts to have large enough stock. The shift is so great, some local hobby shops like Brooklyn Strategist in Carroll Gardens, have hired a “Trading Card Game Coordinator” to manage requests and inventory. Vona Rustay was hand-selected and poached from another hobby shop for her experience. She and the store’s inventory manager have to navigate the delicate balance between fulfilling requests and servicing their community of everyday customers. Rustay said that for their Phantasmal Flames release, almost all of their stock was spoken for before it could even arrive.

“If you told someone they’re selling money at the money store, it’s not unreasonable to believe that the money store would sell out of money pretty quickly, right?” Rustay asked.

It’s not always a winning experience, for some people the chase is tiring. Marcus Joseph, 30, a teacher, was compelled to wait in line early in the morning before going to work, just to engage with their hobby and not pay inflated resale prices, which have created a growing friction between long time players and people coming in only interested in the value of the cards.

“The increase in price is pricing individuals out of their favorite hobby they grew up with as kids or they’re just getting into right now.” Joseph said with an exhale. “And that’s always going to be a negative.”

Brooklyn Strategist implements several stopgap measures to ensure children in their after-school programs and players of the card game can engage with the game meant for them, including a purchase limit of three packs per person per day, and reserving some stock to give away as prizes to those playing the game at their events. Rustay said that it’s an effective way to maintain and continue to strengthen their community.

Across North America, people are even breaking out into fights in an effort to purchase

cards from the Phantasmal Flames set. The demand is so high, two men were charged with assault after an incident in Ottawa, Canada when they got into a fist fight over trying to purchase the product. With popularity and access ebbing and flowing, it’s unclear whether Pokémon cards will still be worth fighting over in the next year or not.

For now, the shiny pieces of cardboard are lotto tickets, each a number waiting to be pulled to hit big. But the odds might not be any different than buying a Powerball ticket.",https://cdn.nycitynewsservice.com/blogs.dir/9/files/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-12.50.17-PM-1152x759.png,N,,2026-01-12 13:18:08.047509

Dive Brief:

USA Truck CEO George Henry, former CEO James Reed and former CFO Zachary King have finalized a deal to buy the carrier from DSV. The transaction closed Friday

The publicly traded company, headquartered in Hedehusene, Denmark, acquired USA Truck in April 2025 by buying parent company DB Schenker. Potential divestment and a strategic review took up much of the year.

“The extensive knowledge and global supply chain insights gained under two of the world's leading freight forwarders are now a permanent part of our operational DNA,” Henry said in a statement.

Dive Insight:

An Arkansas-based entity called UTAC is buying USA Truck and its subsidies, returning ownership to where the company’s legacy began according to a news release.

The switch “allows USA Truck to operate with greater speed, flexibility, and focus, prioritizing customer relationships, service reliability, and disciplined growth,” the release said.

Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, and DSV didn’t immediately return messages seeking comment.

USA Truck began in 1983 when Bob Powell and others bought Crawford Produce. An initial public offering took place in 1992. In 2022, shareholders of the privately owned DB Schenker approved an acquisition deal.

USA Truck currently has 1,800 trucks and 6,000 trailers and provides dedicated, intermodal, logistics and other transportation services.

Other M&A is also kicking off the new year. The Oren family, which has controlled the Dart transportation business for over 90 years, sold to a private investment firm in a deal effective Jan. 1.

Such deals could accelerate given broader economic changes, according to PwC. “Easing interest rates and a modest rebound in freight volumes are enabling buyers to revisit deals that were paused earlier in the cycle,” a report last month said.

The centerpiece of the announcement is a first-of-its-kind ""AI Co-Innovation Lab,"" a $1 billion joint venture designed to fundamentally re-engineer the drug discovery process through ""lab-in-the-loop"" automation and physical AI.

The partnership marks a transition from using artificial intelligence as a simple data-processing tool to integrating it as a core scientific collaborator. By combining Lilly’s deep biological expertise with Nvidia’s cutting-edge Vera Rubin computing architecture, the two giants aim to slash drug development timelines from a decade to as little as three years. This alliance is not just a technological upgrade; it is a structural shift in how the world’s most valuable pharmaceutical company intends to maintain its lead in the hyper-competitive cardiometabolic and oncology markets.

A New Blueprint for Biological Discovery

The AI Co-Innovation Lab, scheduled to open in South San Francisco by late March 2026, represents a $1 billion commitment over the next five years. The facility will be staffed by a hybrid team of Lilly research scientists and Nvidia AI engineers working side-by-side. The primary objective is to perfect ""closed-loop"" discovery: a system where AI agents autonomously design new molecular structures, trigger robotic ""wet labs"" to synthesize and test them, and then instantly ingest the experimental data to refine the next round of designs. This ""lab-in-the-loop"" workflow is expected to operate 24/7, effectively removing the human bottleneck from early-stage candidate selection.

The technological backbone of this initiative is Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin architecture and an expanded version of the NVIDIA BioNeMo platform. This follows an earlier collaboration in late 2025 where the companies built a massive ""AI factory"" supercomputer utilizing over 1,000 Blackwell GPUs. Beyond discovery, the new lab will focus on ""digital twins"" for advanced manufacturing. By simulating production lines in a virtual environment, Lilly aims to optimize the complex manufacturing processes required for its high-demand GLP-1 medications, potentially solving the supply constraints that have dogged the industry for years.

Winners, Losers, and the Tech-Pharma Arms Race

The immediate winners of this announcement are undoubtedly Eli Lilly and Nvidia. For Lilly, the partnership solidifies its reputation as the most technologically advanced ""Big Pharma"" player, moving beyond the ""hype cycle"" of AI into tangible, operational scale. For Nvidia, the deal provides a massive real-world proving ground for its healthcare-specific hardware and software, cementing its position as the ""arms dealer"" for the future of medicine.

However, the news puts immense pressure on rivals. Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO), Lilly’s primary competitor in the obesity market, has its own partnerships with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Nvidia, but analysts at JPM26 noted that Lilly’s move toward a co-located, dedicated lab gives it a superior ""operational edge."" Meanwhile, legacy biotech firms that have been slower to adopt ""agentic AI"" may find themselves falling behind in discovery speed. In the tech sector, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) remains a formidable challenger through its Isomorphic Labs, which recently launched the TxGemma models. While Google’s AI prowess is undisputed, Nvidia’s focus on the ""physicality"" of AI—robotics and manufacturing—gives it a distinct advantage in the eyes of pharmaceutical executives who need to produce physical pills and injections.

Navigating the Regulatory Frontier and Industry Trends

This partnership arrives at a critical regulatory juncture. In early January 2026, the FDA released its first formal draft guidance on the use of AI in drug development. The new framework emphasizes ""methodological transparency"" and requires companies to prove that their AI models do not suffer from ""drift"" or bias over time. The Lilly-Nvidia lab is specifically designed to meet these high bars by creating a ""traceable"" AI path, where every decision made by an algorithm is backed by physical data from the robotic wet labs.

The broader industry trend is a shift away from ""narrow AI""—which solves specific, small problems—toward ""General Purpose Biological AI."" We are moving past the era of simply predicting how a protein folds (a milestone achieved years ago by DeepMind) to predicting how a drug will interact with an entire human organ system. This ""digital twin"" approach is the new gold standard, and the LLY-NVDA alliance is the first to attempt it at a multi-billion-dollar scale.

The Road Ahead: From Silicon to Clinical Trials

In the short term, the market will be watching for the official opening of the South San Francisco lab in March 2026 and the first batch of ""AI-native"" drug candidates to enter Phase 1 trials. The long-term challenge will be the ""black box"" problem: can Lilly convince regulators that a drug designed by an AI agent is as safe as one designed by a human chemist? Strategic pivots may be required if the FDA demands higher levels of human oversight than the ""closed-loop"" system currently envisions.

Furthermore, the partnership will likely trigger a wave of M&A activity. Smaller biotech companies with unique datasets will become prime targets for ""Big Tech"" and ""Big Pharma"" alliances looking to feed their hungry AI models. Companies like Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN), which recently acquired Dark Blue Therapeutics to bolster its own AI oncology pipeline, are already signaling that they will not let Lilly and Nvidia run away with the market without a fight.

A Final Assessment of the JPM26 Milestone

The Eli Lilly and Nvidia partnership expansion is more than just a corporate deal; it is the blueprint for the pharmaceutical company of the future. By merging the world’s most advanced computing with the world’s most successful drug development pipeline, the two companies are attempting to solve the ""Eroom’s Law"" problem—the observation that drug development becomes slower and more expensive over time.

For investors, the takeaway is clear: the valuation of pharmaceutical companies will increasingly depend on their ""compute-to-chemistry"" ratio. As the JPM26 conference concludes, the market will be looking for signs of ""model reliability"" and the first signs of shortened clinical timelines. The intersection of Big Tech and Big Pharma has officially moved from the laboratory to the factory floor, and the impact on global healthcare could be profound.

""We intend to launch in many, many countries around the world, as quickly as possible,"" Daniel Skovronsky, Lilly's chief scientific and product officer, told Reuters at the J.P. Morgan healthcare conference, which kicked off on Monday in San Francisco.

He said the $150-a-month cash pay price will put the drug in reach of consumers who have been priced out of getting the new obesity treatments until recently.

""It's hard to find a cup of coffee for $149 a month, that's $5 a day. We've spent billions of dollars in science here, and tens of billions of dollars to build factories to make this. Then we're offering it at Starbucks pricing,"" Skovronsky said.

CONVENIENCE VERSUS NOVO'S PILL

Danish rival Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO), opens new tab launched its once-daily weight-loss pill in the U.S. earlier this month, and Lilly expects to counter the first-to-market advantage by emphasizing the convenience of orforglipron.

While Novo's oral semaglutide needs to be taken in the morning on an empty stomach, 30 minutes before eating, drinking or using any other oral medication, Lilly's pill does not have those restrictions.

""Ours is a small molecule. It's just like any other pill. It's not affected by food or water, what time of day you take it, or whether you fast. So I think that's an advantage for patients who want that kind of convenience,"" Skovronsky said.

Skovronsky also said he believes there will be a market for the pill as a maintenance dose for people who want to stop using injectable weight-loss medications - particularly patients on Novo Nordisk's drug.

Many patients who have already lost weight are looking to switch to a less strong drug to maintain their weight, he said.

""People coming off of the monotherapy GLP-1 - coming off of semaglutide injection - can switch to the pill without regaining any substantial weight,"" Skovronsky said.

DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER STRATEGY

Skovronsky also touted the reach of Lilly's direct-to-consumer sales program, Lilly Direct, through which patients can buy its Zepbound weight-loss injection without insurance.

He said more than one million people have been treated with its GLP-1s through Lilly Direct.

Skovronsky likened Zepbound to Lilly's own version of what the tech industry calls a ""killer app"" that can familiarize consumers with Lilly Direct.

He said the company hope to extend sales through the program to other treatments like its Alzheimer's drug and an experimental medicine in development to lower lipoprotein (a), a type of cholesterol that like LDL increases heart risk.

AI-driven conversions on Thanksgiving Day were 54% higher than those not AI-driven, and 38% higher on Black Friday, Adobe says.

AI referrals consist of online-shopper traffic generated by clicking on a link in an answer generated by an AI chatbot or automated system.

The increase in AI-generated referrals and conversions helped boost AI-driven revenue per visit more than two-fold during the holiday shopping season.

Adobe Analytics tracked more than 1 trillion visits to retail e-commerce sites in the United States, 100 million stock-keeping units, and 18 product categories.

In addition to tracking AI referrals and conversions, Adobe tracked what happens after shoppers click through a link from a generative AI-powered chat service or browser.

“This is where things get especially interesting for retailers,” Vivek Pandya, director of digital insights at Adobe Analytics, says in a blog post.

Shoppers who arrive at retail sites from generative-AI assistants were 33% less likely to leave immediately, a 14% improvement since the beginning of 2025, Adobe says.

“In practical terms, this means shoppers arriving from AI assistants aren’t just landing and leaving,” Pandya says. “They’re spending 45% more time on-site and viewing 13% more pages per visit, signaling higher intent and stronger alignment with what they’re looking for.” Some 81% of online shoppers using AI assistants reported a better shopping experience.

One reason consumers are actively embracing AI referrals is trust in the technology, according to the research. Some 47% of consumers reported trust in AI, while 64% of shoppers using AI report being satisfied with the links they receive, and more than 55% say they actively click on those links, according to the Adobe Analytics Holiday 2025 Consumer Survey. In addition, 65% of online shoppers using AI are more confident in their purchase after the help of AI, and 68% say they are less likely to return the product after using AI for the purchase.

“As trust grows, purchase confidence is also rising,” Pandya says. “As more consumers turn to large language models to research products, compare options, and make decisions, one thing is becoming clear: generative AI is no longer a side channel for commerce discovery.”",https://v6r2p5t5.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 12:02:47.426022

The initiative marks the latest step by a major global bank into the digital assets space and is the first phase of BNY’s strategy to tokenize deposits, beginning with collateral and margin use cases.

Under the pilot, announced on Friday, BNY has enabled an on-chain mirrored representation of client deposit balances on its Digital Assets platform. The tokenized deposits operate as digital book entries that reflect participating clients’ existing demand deposit claims against the bank. While balances are mirrored on-chain, they continue to be recorded on BNY’s traditional systems for regulatory, accounting, and reporting purposes.

The capability runs on BNY’s private, permissioned blockchain. The bank said the launch is designed to support programmable, near-real-time cash movement, as is increasingly demanded by financial market participants.

“As global financial markets shift towards an always-on operating model, institutions are seeking faster and more efficient ways to move assets — with greater settlement certainty, transparency, lower friction and capability to unlock liquidity,” said BNY chief product and innovation officer Carolyn Wei.

BNY, the world’s largest custodial bank with nearly $58 trillion in assets under custody, has been exploring tokenized deposits for some time. Banking Exchange first reported in late 2025 that the bank was testing the capability, which has now progressed into a live pilot for institutional clients.

Early participants in the initiative include Baillie Gifford, Circle, Citadel Securities, Galaxy, Ripple Prime, Invesco, and WisdomTree.

Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at Circle, said the move demonstrated that “speed and new use cases do not come at the expense of safety and soundness expectations of the world’s leading financial institutions.”",https://www.bankingexchange.com/media/k2/items/cache/6c8ec5c6b4f62869020407e2f0b1f334_S.jpg?t=20260112_162832,N,,2026-01-12 16:01:32.353002

Less covered, but certainly related and also followed by investors and analysts, was the concurrent rise of copper (+36%). However, another industrial metal commodity advanced by an even larger amount under the radar of many investors focused on precious metals: Aluminum. From April 25 to the time of this writing, aluminum prices have gained over +842 points, or roughly +38%, to a near all time high of $3,090 per ton.

There are a myriad of reasons for aluminum’s price surge, but lower supply and higher demand, combined with geopolitical policy domino effects, are the primary causes. Nevertheless, the price trajectory, like that of gold and silver, shows little signs of abating. Therefore, stocks that will be able to capitalize on this continued price elevation may be of interest to investors. Some major companies’ stocks to keep an eye on are:

Crown Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CCK)

Constellium SE (NYSE: CSTM)

Kaiser Aluminum (NASDAQ: KALU)

Reliance, Inc. (NYSE: RS)

When Tariffs Move Markets

Like pretty much all market prices, Aluminum fell precipitously shortly following President Trump’s reciprocal tariff announcement at the end of March. Since China, the EU, and the US are the three largest global aluminum market consumers, the US deployment of tariffs on aluminum imports triggered a price hike that has continued to the present. The US market was impacted in a number of ways that contributed to the global price elevation:

Since the goal of the tariffs was to support domestic production, imports, with some aluminum items taxed as much as 50%, were subsequently priced too expensively to make it worthwhile for export nations to ship to the US.

With imports curtailed and domestic production having no lead time to gear up for production, US inventory supplies dwindled, causing accelerated price demand.

Ironically, the BBB tax cuts have boosted US manufacturing in automobiles, aircraft, consumer and industrial container packaging, construction, and other domestic production industries, along with the new huge demand from AI data centers. These industries are all dependent upon aluminum, and the low inventory levels contributed to the price squeeze.

Geological difficulties in locating new sources of bauxite to produce aluminum have also caused international commodity market prices of aluminum to elevate over future shortage concerns.

Crown Holdings, Inc.

Headquartered in Philadelphia, PA with a history dating back to the end of the 19th century (1892), Crown Holdings is one of the premier global manufacturers of aluminum cans, packaging, and specialty containers. The company has operations in the Americas, Western Europe (out of Switzerland distributing also to Africa and the Middle East), and Asia (via Singapore). A short list of their global customer list includes such multinational brands as:

Anheuser-Busch

Conagra Brands

Abbot Labs

Clorox

Coca-Cola

Campbell’s

Diageo

Federal Express

Dupont

General Mills

Kraft-Heinz

Pitney Bowes

Pepsico…. And the list goes on.

With a $261 million stake, Impactive Capital is CCK’s largest shareholder. Morgan Stanley recently upgraded their rating on CCK to “overweight”, citing increases in energy drinks, hard teas, and other new beverages. Additionally, CCK’s stranglehold on supplying aluminum containers for so many global brands over so many years gives it a commanding supply chain control over its customers, who would likely find switching to another supplier too costly.

Constellium SE

A joint American-Swiss and French amalgam as result of M&A deals combining Alcan, Alusuisse, and Pechiney, Constellium is a global producer of rolled and extruded aluminum and various alloys, as well as of custom parts. Its customers include:

Airbus

BMW

Mercedes-Benz

Boeing

Ford

Audi

Headquartered in Paris, France, Constellum also has offices in Zurich, Switzerland, and Baltimore, MD. Constellum’s large aluminum use clientele has certainly driven its stock price in sympathy with the aluminum market price: since April 2025, its stock has zoomed from $7.56 to $21.00. Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase and UBS all rate CTSM a “buy”.

Kaiser Aluminum

Formed in 1946 right after WW II, Kaiser has had a history of acquisitions, divestments, military and government projects, unionwide labor disputes and even a 4-year long bankruptcy period. However, the Franklin, TN company has bounced back each time to pick up the pieces and get back into the ring. Kaiser’s primary products are rolled aluminum, plate, sheet, can sheet, and extruded bar, tube, and wire products. Its unique, special niche is its specialty fabricated ALH26 products for the aerospace and automotive industries. Among Kaiser’s 750 regular corporate customers are:

Boeing

General Electric

Avid Technology

Weyerhauser

Whirlpool

Stanley, Black & Decker

Stellantis

Northrop Grumman

Lockheed Martin

Similar to Constellium, Kaiser’s stock has also made triple digit gains since April, going from $48 to $123. From a fundamental analysis perspective, KALU has an attractive 2.50% yield and 2025 revenue is expected to report 10.64% growth with 12.95% in 2026, and estimated earnings to report +135.53% for 2025 with an extra +22.45% in 2026.

Reliance, Inc.

When it comes to US metals processing services, Reliance is the #1 largest metal solutions provider, distributing and processing over 100,000 metal products through a vast network of service centers. In addition to aluminum, Reliance also processes carbon steel, stainless steel, brass, titanium, and a range of alloys. Reliance also handles cutting, inventory, and specialty fabrication. Its 320 locations handle 15% of cumulative US metals processing.

The collaboration centers on integrating EndoQuest’s visualization system, robotic control and secure cloud services with NVIDIA’s Physical AI software stack to deliver real-time image processing, robotic control and cloud-enabled intelligence within a unified architecture. The company said the approach is intended to support real-time, image-based solutions for intraoperative tissue differentiation, perfusion visualization and select autonomous surgical tasks.

The next-generation platform is also expected to incorporate capabilities for remote robotic operation, teleproctoring for surgical guidance and collaborative surgical workflows, orchestrated to achieve the lowest possible latency using NVIDIA Holoscan software development tools.

“AI and robotics will redefine the operating room by enhancing surgical vision and precision beyond human limits,” said Todd Wilson, chief medical officer and chairman of the International Advisory Board of EndoQuest Robotics. “This shift will enable earlier diagnosis and highly targeted therapies that minimize patient impact while maximizing the potential for cure.”

Eduardo Fonseca, chief executive officer of EndoQuest Robotics, said the company is focused on simplifying and strengthening its technology foundation. “By powering our visualization, control, and secure cloud services with NVIDIA AI infrastructure, we aim to streamline our system architecture for performance, reliability and clinical scalability,” Fonseca said. “This unified architecture is critical to advancing our technology for endoluminal robotic surgery and supporting future capabilities in imaging intelligence, robotic performance, and connected surgical workflows.”

As part of the initiative, EndoQuest will use NVIDIA AI infrastructure to support low-latency sensor processing and 3D visualization, precise and time-synchronized motion control, and secure cloud connectivity. The company said these capabilities will enable fleet management, data services, teleproctoring and future artificial intelligence deployment, with insights informing product development and commercialization plans.

The announcement coincides with EndoQuest’s PARADIGM Trial, a pivotal multicenter study evaluating the company’s endoluminal surgical system for lower gastrointestinal procedures performed by colorectal surgeons and gastroenterologists.

Advances in endoluminal robotic surgery

Endoluminal robotic surgery is emerging as a significant area of innovation within minimally invasive care, driven by advances in imaging, computing power and artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional laparoscopic or open approaches, endoluminal systems are designed to operate through natural orifices, allowing physicians to reach lesions deep within the gastrointestinal tract while minimizing external incisions and trauma.

Recent progress has focused heavily on improving visualization. High-definition, 3D imaging combined with real-time image processing is enabling surgeons to better distinguish between healthy and diseased tissue during procedures. Emerging techniques such as enhanced perfusion imaging and tissue characterization are helping clinicians assess blood flow and tissue viability intraoperatively, potentially improving decision-making and outcomes.

Robotic control systems have also become more sophisticated, with improved dexterity, stability and precision in confined anatomical spaces. Advances in motion scaling, tremor reduction and time-synchronized control are allowing more precise manipulation of instruments, which is particularly important in delicate GI procedures where millimeters matter.

Artificial intelligence is increasingly being layered into these platforms, supporting functions such as image recognition, workflow assistance and early steps toward task automation. While fully autonomous surgery remains a long-term goal, current systems are exploring semi-autonomous features that can assist with repetitive or highly standardized tasks under physician supervision.

Connectivity is another key trend shaping the sector. Secure cloud integration is enabling remote system monitoring, data aggregation and analytics, as well as teleproctoring, where experienced clinicians can guide procedures from afar. This has implications not only for training and consistency of care, but also for expanding access to advanced procedures in settings that may lack on-site expertise.

Together, these advances point toward operating rooms that are increasingly data-driven, connected and precise, with endoluminal robotic technologies playing a growing role in less invasive diagnosis and treatment of complex gastrointestinal conditions.",https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/medec/a33cf50ebdcf5494f27cac1af639b8dd67227891-5501x3667.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 12:03:29.291420

The companies said Monday they would invest up to $1 billion in talent, infrastructure, and computing power, including Nvidia's Vera Rubin chips, over the next five years. They said the new lab would expand the buildout of Lilly's Nvidia DGX SUperPOD and AI factory.

Lilly Chief Information and Digital Officer Diogo Rau said the partnership reflected the growing centrality of artificial-intelligence technology in drug discovery.

""We're moving toward a future where discovery is driven by rapid experimentation and increasingly customized models -- an approach that reflects our commitment to leading applied AI in drug discovery and investing deeply in new forms of data generation and model development,"" Rau said Monday.

The companies had previously teamed up in October to announce the construction of a new supercomputer focused on drug discovery, built using more than 1,000 of Nvidia's Blackwell chips.

Nvidia said Monday that it was also collaborating with Thermo Fisher to help automate the company's research laboratory equipment.

The company also said it was expanding its BioNeMo platform, an open-development AI training and modeling platform focused on the life sciences industry. It said it had incorporated new models into the platform, including models for synthesizing AI-designed drugs and predicting RNA structures.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection.
This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5%.
The consensus earnings estimate of $5.36 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +17.5%.","Uber Technologies (UBER) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.

Shares of this ride-hailing company have returned +0.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.9% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Uber belongs, has gained 3.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Uber is expected to post earnings of $0.83 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -74.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5%.

The consensus earnings estimate of $5.36 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +17.5%. This estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.61 indicates a change of -32.7% from what Uber is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Uber.",https://s.yimg.com/os/en/zacks.com/432476d296d64c50172213c0415587c9,N,,2026-01-12 11:14:47.953747

The meeting was co-chaired by Dr. Sultan Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, Managing Director and Group CEO of ADNOC, and Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies.

Held on the sidelines of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, the meeting brought together Council members and distinguished guests from both countries. French participants included representatives from TotalEnergies, Airbus, Société Générale, Engie, Ardian, Fives Group representing MEDEF International and Artefact. From the UAE side, participants included ADNOC, Masdar, Etihad Airways, Emirates, Presight, Dubai Chambers, First Abu Dhabi Bank, BEEAH, ADQ, AIQ, XRG, G42, ALTÉRRA, 2PointZero, Emirates NBD, IHC, and ePointZero.

The meeting was also attended by Mohamed Al Suwaidi, Minister of Investment and Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Officer of ADQ; Mansoor Al Mansoori, Group Chief Executive Officer of G42 International; and Sultan bin Saeed Al Mansoori, Chairman of Dubai Chambers.

In his opening remarks, Dr. Sultan Al Jaber conveyed the greetings of the UAE leadership and reaffirmed the strength of long-standing bilateral relations. He noted that this plenary, held shortly after President Macron’s visit to the UAE, reflects the strong strategic alignment between both countries’ leaderships.

He emphasised that the Council continues to serve as a catalyst for translating our shared vision into tangible economic outcomes, particularly as both countries accelerate cooperation in AI, advanced industries, and sustainable growth.

“As we harness the transformative potential of AI and pursue sustainable industrial development, the UAE-France High-Level Business Council remains committed to unlocking high-value investment opportunities that drive innovation, competitiveness, and shared prosperity for both nations,” Dr. Sultan Al Jaber said.

“Over the past few years, the HLBC has proven to be indispensable in strengthening and developing concrete and beneficial business cooperation between French and Emirati companies. This fourth session confirms this once again with new bilateral partnerships, particularly in the field of AI,"" said Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies.

The Council reviewed progress since its previous meeting in Paris (February 2025) and discussed ongoing initiatives aimed at strengthening economic cooperation. Artificial intelligence emerged as a cross-cutting enabler of growth, driving innovation, efficiency and competitiveness across priority sectors, while reinforcing industrial and energy partnerships. The plenary featured presentations from AIQ and Artefact on recent AI advancements.

Artefact, a leading global company specialised in AI, offered a forward-looking view on AI, highlighting that more than a technology shift, it was a transformation of processes, roles, and operating models, calling for bold strategic choices and strong execution to turn promise into measurable results.

The talk explored the concrete value AI can deliver—productivity gains, faster decision-making, and new growth opportunities—while addressing the financial, organisational, and human challenges that still limit impact.

Participants commended the Council’s continued momentum in translating strategic dialogue into concrete outcomes, highlighting key milestones achieved in 2025 such as:

· The 2nd Regional Business Development Meeting in Abu Dhabi (May 2025), on the sidelines of ""Make it in the Emirates"", under the theme ""Unlocking cross-investment potential in AI.""

· The landmark joint venture between MGX, Bpifrance, Mistral AI, and NVIDIA to develop Europe’s largest AI and data-center campus in the Île-de-France region, with an expected capacity of 1.4 GW by 2030, and UAE investment of up to €50 billion – the largest of its kind in Europe.

· The inauguration of Fives Industrial Technologies and its 3,000m² manufacturing facility in Khalifa Economic Zones Abu Dhabi (KEZAD), providing local manufacturing support to aluminum, oil and gas, and aeronautics sectors.

· Etihad Airways’ expansion of its widebody fleet with the acquisition of 32 new Airbus aircraft – a mix of A350-1000s, A350F freighters, and A330-900s – with the first deliveries beginning in 2027.

· Emirates’ purchase of 8 additional Airbus A350-900 aircraft, valued at US$ 3.4 billion, at the Dubai Airshow 2025, building on four decades of partnership between Emirates and Airbus.

· The launch of the Keolis-Etihad Rail joint venture for UAE passenger rail services.

The plenary also announced a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on a strategic collaboration for AI-driven subsurface development. The MoU is an initiative by AIQ, ADNOC, TotalEnergies, and G42 to deploy AI technologies to develop efficient oil & gas exploration and reservoir management by moving faster and reducing uncertainties in subsurface analysis.

The meeting concluded with participants reaffirming their commitment to expanding cooperation across strategic sectors, including AI, advanced industries, renewable energy, and infrastructure. The Council agreed to hold the 3rd Regional Business Development Meeting during the year.

Trade relations between the two countries continue to strengthen: non-oil trade surged 35.8% in the first ten months of 2025 to AED46 billion, driven by a 222% sharp increase in re-exports. In 2024, bilateral non-oil trade grew by 21.3%, reaching approximately AED44.5 billion compared to 2023, reflecting sustained momentum in economic exchange.",https://photo-cdn.urdupoint.com/images/UrduPoint-English-22.png,N,,2026-01-12 11:07:53.368158

The companies announced plans to bring drone delivery to 150 additional stores across the country, creating the largest commercial drone network in U.S. history.

This expansion will establish over 270 drone delivery locations by 2027, serving roughly 40 million people and making aerial deliveries as common as ordering pizza. The rollout kicks off with Houston launching Jan. 15, followed by major metros including Los Angeles, Miami, St. Louis, and Cincinnati throughout 2026 and 2027.

An American retail tale

The numbers tell a decent story. Wing’s most active customers are ordering three times per week, while total deliveries have tripled in just the past six months. That’s more frequent than most people order takeout. People aren’t just trying drone delivery once—they’re making it part of their daily routine for essentials like eggs, ground beef, fresh tomatoes, and even Takis snacks.

Customers have already completed hundreds of thousands of deliveries since the partnership launched over two years ago in August 2023. The expansion builds on operations in Dallas-Fort Worth and Atlanta, where people have turned 30-minute aerial grocery runs into normal behavior.

Say hi to the sky

Here’s why customers are ditching traditional delivery methods for robots in the sky. Wing’s aircraft can carry up to 2.5 pounds (1.13 kg) normally, but newer models handle five-pound payloads while cruising at 65 mph (ca. 105 km/h)—fast enough to beat most car trips across town of up to 12 miles (ca. 19 km) round trip.

The drones operate beyond visual line of sight up to six miles (ca. 10 km) from stores, using tethers and hooks to pick up packages from designated parking lot sites before dropping them on customers’ front lawns.

Since launching in 2012, Wing has completed over 750,000 deliveries globally. The company isn’t just focused on retail either—they’re also partnering with DoorDash for restaurant deliveries in Dallas and Charlotte, creating an aerial delivery ecosystem that’s reshaping last-mile logistics.

Rise of the robots

This massive scale-up signals that drone delivery has moved far beyond experimental phase into mainstream utility. Walmart becomes the first retailer operating drone delivery across five states—Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Texas—with over 150,000 deliveries completed over the past five years since launching the program in 2021.

Within the next decade, McKinsey projects 1.5 million commercial drone deliveries by 2035, and Wing and Walmart are positioning themselves at the forefront of what could become the dominant delivery method for small, urgent purchases across America.",https://assets.eweek.com/uploads/2026/01/Wing-Drones.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 15:04:14.114986

Scientists from the two firms will come together at a new site in the Bay Area that the pair expects to open by the end of March, Powell said.

Both sides are allocating dedicated, incremental resources to the partnership. Lilly will contribute its drug R&D expertise and laboratory infrastructure, while Nvidia will provide AI capabilities including open biology models, multimodal foundation models, agentic and physical AI, and DGX Cloud capacity, according to Powell.

“We see this as a catalyst for the capabilities that will define the next era of drug discovery,” Diogo Rau, executive vice president and chief information and digital officer at Lilly, said in a Jan. 12 statement. “By working with NVIDIA, we’re uniting massive compute, specialized talent and the ability to shape data at immense scale. We’re moving toward a future where discovery is driven by rapid experimentation and increasingly customized models—an approach that reflects our commitment to leading applied AI in drug discovery and investing deeply in new forms of data generation and model development.”

The latest collaboration between Lilly and Nvidia builds on the companies’ “AI factory” project, under which Nvidia is helping Lilly build what could become the pharmaceutical industry’s largest supercomputer designed to accelerate drug discovery and shorten development timelines.

For the new joint lab, a major focus will be on producing real-world lab data to train and validate AI models.

“We’re going to continue to create ground truth data in the lab so that we can train these biology foundation models with multimodal data, taking advantage of all of the advancements that we’ve seen in [large language model] in biology,” Powell said.

With the help of AI, the team will work to shorten the process between hypotheses and discovery in the hopes of establishing a new scientific paradigm, Powell added.

In addition to R&D, the two firms will have the opportunity to apply AI across Lilly’s businesses, including manufacturing and commercial operations. Powell highlighted Nvidia’s three physical AI and robotics platforms—Omniverse, Isaac and Jetson—which she said can fit into Lilly’s manufacturing facilities.

Lilly and Nvidia are broadening their collaboration as both invest heavily in each other’s territories.

“Lilly is shifting from using AI as a tool to embracing it as a scientific collaborator,” Lilly’s chief AI officer, Thomas Fuchs, said in an October release about the new “AI factory.”

To extend the reach of its AI capabilities, Lilly last year launched Lilly TuneLab, an open innovation platform that gives biotech companies access to its AI drug discovery models. In return, the ecosystem creates a two-way flow of information that provides Lilly with new data to refine those models.

Friday, Schrödinger announced it’s integrating Lilly’s Tunelab into its drug design software, LiveDesign.

For its part, Nvidia will announce at JPM an expansion of its BioNeMo into a full open development platform for biology and drug discovery. BioNeMo includes several open models, which come with open datasets. Among some of the latest additions are a model for predicting 3D structure of RNA molecules, a reasoning model called ReaSyn v2 for ensuring AI-designed molecules are practical to synthesize and another for predicting toxicity, according to Powell. Besides, BioNeMo Recipes will help scale biological foundation model training, customization and deployment.

“Instead of just sending a model over the fence, we’re giving the whole developer community the end-to-end tools accompanied with the data sets, the models themselves, the training recipes and everything in between, so that the full AI life cycle can be taken advantage of and made very easy for the domain experts across the field,” Powell said.

On the robotics front, Multiply Labs, which offers robotic systems for manufacturing gene-modified cell therapies, is using Nvidia’s three physical AI platforms to create digital twins of entire labs, replacing manual, contamination-prone work with autonomous systems. According to Powell, the robotic systems could cut cell therapy manufacturing costs by 70% per dose and increase dose throughput 100-fold per square foot by reducing the need for highly trained personnel and related equipment.

At JPM, Nvidia also announced it is working with Thermo Fisher Scientific to build autonomous lab infrastructure.

“Laboratory automation is not just operational improvement,” Powell said. “It’s a foundational enabler of more intelligent biological AI.”",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/AI.jpg?VersionId=qZRx1E1XmkVYDa0BpDnarrqnQ59Fbq_e,N,,2026-01-12 11:06:41.710391

Businesses can target customers with ads designed for AI shoppers

Google has announced plans to take the stress out of online shopping with a new agentic AI ecommerce suite that'll take care of product research, purchasing, and even post-purchase support.

Company VP and GM of Ads & Commerce Vidhya Srinivasan explained in a blog post that the new tools build on 2025's Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), designed to offer secure payments within the confines of agentic AI.

The system relies on the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), co-developed by Google and a number of major retail partners like Shopify, Etsy, and Wayfair, so that agents and systems can interact in one ""common language.""

Universal Commerce Protocol is the foundation for agentic AI shopping

Designed to work across multiple industries and platforms, it's also backed by payment companies like Adyen, Amex, Mastercard, Visa, and Stripe - however, from launch we're told it will only be available to eligible US retailers.

The front-end experience revolves around the Gemini app or AI Mode within Google Search. Being that the AI retains information, Google's new shopping assistant will pre-fill the checkout page, and then store the shipping information within Google Wallet.

Along with a later global expansion, the company is also working on a fuller shopping experience such as loyalty reward integration.

At the same time, Google is launching a separate Business Agent that companies can use as their own virtual sales assistants to answer questions about their products. With this tool activated and customized from within the Merchant Center, companies can train the agent on their data, access customer insights and promote related products.

A new Google Ads pilot, Direct Offers, will also target shoppers with exclusive offers that might only be available to shoppers using AI Mode.

However, Google isn't without its competition. OpenAI has already launched similar agentic shopping experiences within ChatGPT, and Microsoft launched a buying experience within Copilot chats with select retailers just days before Google's announcement.

GALWAY, Ireland, Jan. 12, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Medtronic (NYSE: MDT), a global leader in healthcare technology, today announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance of its MiniMed Go™ app. The MiniMed Go™ Smart Multiple Daily Injection (MDI) system seamlessly integrates the InPen™ smart insulin pen with the Instinct sensor made by Abbott — all connected through the MiniMed Go™ app. This powerful combination delivers real-time, personalized insights and actionable guidance, including:

Missed dose alerts to help minimize glucose highs

A dose calculator that simplifies dose decision-making

Action-oriented guidance if a user misses or miscalculates a dose

CareLink™ software reporting for easier provider collaboration

The MiniMed Go™ system is cleared for individuals with insulin-requiring type 1 and type 2 diabetes aged 7 years and older, as well as for children ages 2 to 6 years under the supervision of an adult caregiver. Compatibility of the Simplera™ sensor with MiniMed Go™ is currently under FDA review.

Addressing a Significant Unmet Need

There are more than 15 million people around the world with diabetes who rely on multiple daily injections. For these individuals, mealtimes can feel overwhelming and exhausting — and over time, this can lead to diabetes distress.1,2 This involves determining the amount of carbs in their meal and calculating the right insulin dose to inject before eating (bolus) to keep blood sugar levels in check to avoid dangerous spikes or dips.

Missed boluses can significantly impact diabetes management and glycemic outcomes. Even skipping just two doses a week can raise HbA1C by as much as 0.4%, increasing the risk of both short- and long-term complications.3 Remembering when and how much insulin to dose isn't just a math problem — it's a daily burden that adds stress and fatigue, making diabetes management feel overwhelming.

Real-world data demonstrates that users of the previous generation Medtronic Smart MDI system saw meaningful improvements in glycemic control when consistently responding to actionable alerts. Specifically, the data showed that Time in Range (TIR) increased from 55.7% to 67.2% when users addressed more than 75% of Missed Dose alerts within an hour, and to 71.5% when users addressed Correct High Glucose alerts with a bolus within an hour. These results underscore the power of timely, actionable insights in helping users achieve better glycemic outcomes.4 The new MiniMed Go™ Smart MDI System delivers real-time, personalized insights and actionable guidance to optimize outcomes for users.

""For too long, people using injections have carried the weight of diabetes management without access to the algorithms that make automated insulin delivery systems so powerful,"" said Que Dallara, EVP and president of Medtronic Diabetes and CEO-designate of MiniMed. ""MiniMed Go™ is designed to change that — bringing the smarts of an AID system to individuals who prefer an insulin pen. The system helps take the guesswork out of MDI therapy, delivering simplicity and confidence in every dose. We're pleased to expand our full-stack insulin delivery solutions, making it seamless for our customers to find a therapy that works for them — no matter where they are in their journey.""

We expect the commercial launch of the MiniMed Go™ system to begin in the U.S. this spring. Learn more here about MiniMed Go™.

This vote of confidence arrives as markets navigate ongoing uncertainty surrounding the impact of artificial intelligence on various sectors, including media and education.

The firm's assessment has seemingly resonated with markets, influencing positive sentiment towards the stock, up 1.23% today. The analyst's note suggests that the previous AI-driven selloff may have been overdone, presenting an attractive risk/reward profile for Pearson at its current valuation.

Pearson, a global media group predominantly focused on education, has been undergoing a strategic transformation in recent years, emphasizing digital learning solutions and streamlining its operations. Its performance is closely tied to trends in educational spending, technological advancements in learning platforms, and the broader economic climate affecting educational institutions worldwide.

The Panthers, Packers, Jaguars, Chargers and defending Super Bowl champion Eagles all fell in the wild-card round of the NFL playoffs, each in a game in which it seemed a play or two could have swung the outcome their way. In a postseason that promised to be wide open, we had three games decided by late touchdowns, a fourth come down to a red zone stop and the fifth stay within one score for most of the night before one team (the Patriots) pulled away late.

Five organizations are moving on to the offseason, and we're here to help. I'm going to break down what went wrong for each of those franchises in the wild-card round, how that might have been foreseeable and what they can do to avoid that same fate next season. Fans invariably want to fire coaches and tear up the roster after a playoff loss, but I'll try to be more level-headed or realistic in projecting what might make sense or what these teams might be thinking.

Let's begin with the Chargers, one of two 7-seeds going home.

CAR | GB | JAX | LAC | PHI

Los Angeles Chargers

Lost 16-3 vs. Patriots

I'm not sure a Jim Harbaugh quarterback has ever been beaten up in a big game the way Justin Herbert was hit over and over again by the Patriots on Sunday. With an underwhelming run game, an offense that couldn't diagnoseNew England's coverages, a green light to scramble at the first sign of daylight and little in the way of help from his offensive line, Herbert endured 21 hits for the three points the Chargers scored in Foxborough. That number of hits was tied for Herbert's season high and are the most for any Harbaugh-coached QB in a single game going back through his time in San Francisco.

On one hand, you can argue that Herbert put the team on his back because nobody else was capable of doing so. The Chargers struggled to separate from New England's coverage for most of the night. Running backOmarion Hampton was active but playedonly two snaps with an ankle injury, ceding the backfield to Kimani Vidal, who was ineffective. Drops from the likes of Keenan Allen didn't help matters, and Herbert didn't have a single receiver top 32 yards. He scrambled out of duress for gains, but as a passer, Herbert went just 3-of-8 for 21 yards against pressure.

We can also make the case that the Chargers' season really ended when Joe Alt went down for the second time with what would be a season-ending ankle injury. Losing Rashawn Slater(ruptured patellar tendon) was one thing, but going for months without both starting tackles essentially consigned the Chargers' offense to mediocrity. It fell from third in the league in EPA per play with Alt on the field to 26th without him, cycling through various tackles with little success. On Sunday, the Chargers made a Patriots defense that finished the season 23rd in DVOAlook like the 2003 or 2016 Pats defenses, even as New England lostCarlton Davis IIIand Christian Gonzalez for stretches.

There's no doubting Herbert's capacity for greatness, and I'm not going to draw massive conclusions from three disappointing playoff games. But we're about to hit another offseason where the Chargers' primary job will be to fix things around their quarterback. The Tom Telesco regime (2013-23) repeatedly invested in offensive linemen, with Slater proving to be a success, fellow first-rounder Zion Johnson disappointing and free agent addition Corey Linsley making it to a Pro Bowl before having his career derailed by a heart condition. The first-round pick spent on Quentin Johnston in 2023 has fallen somewhere between obvious success and clear bust.

GM Joe Hortiz has continued adding help, and again, the results have been mixed. Ladd McConkey was a hit in the second round of the 2024 draft, although his impact was muted by the addition of Allen in 2025. Oronde Gadsden emerged as a playmaker at tight end, but Bradley Bozeman was disappointing in his second year with the team at center, and the $9.6 million invested inMekhi Becton didn't deliver the guard who impressed with the Eagles a year ago. The new running back room crashed out because of injuries, and it was Vidal -- even after being cut by the team at the end of camp -- who might have looked like their best back for most of the season.

Slater and Alt will be back in 2026, and betweenpass catchers McConkey, Johnston and Gadsden and running backs Vidal and Hampton, the Chargers will have young playmakers on cost-controlled contracts for another year. Hortiz's job will be to fix the interior of the offensive line. I wonder whether he'll look to make a big offer to centerTyler Linderbaum, a player he is familiar with from their time together with the Ravens and one who is set to hit unrestricted free agency. It's difficult to spend big money on interior linemen with Herbert and Slater already on massive deals and Alt coming due for one next year, but the relatively low cost of the Chargers' playmakers might allow for a big contract on the interior. It would be a surprise if Becton was back.

There's also the question of whether the Chargers will return offensive coordinator Greg Roman, who doesn't have many supporters among Chargers fans after Year 2 in Los Angeles. Roman and Harbaugh arrived in town excited at the idea of what Herbert would look like with a run game, but the Chargers rank 27th in success rate on designed runs over Roman's two seasons.

The clock is also ticking on the defensive side of the ball, where coordinator Jesse Minter's ascension to a head-coaching role seems inevitable. Minter and the Chargers have done a fantastic job of getting more out of players than other coaching staffs, with Elijah Molden and Morgan Fox as examples in 2024 and Donte Jackson and Tony Jeffersonin 2025. The Chargers have some young talent on defense between Tuli Tuipulotu, Daiyan Henleyand several standouts in the secondary, but they were also the league'seighth-oldest defenseon a snap-weighted age basis when I looked in mid-December. If Minter leaves, it's unclear whether Harbaugh and Hortiz will be as capable of finding hidden gems around the league with the next coordinator.

All of this leaves the Chargers in a weird place. They're unquestionably a good team with a coach and quarterback who are deservedly held in high regard. They've also been beaten two years in a row in the wild-card round. I'm still optimistic that there's a higher ceiling with the tackles returning in 2026, but Herbert's propensity for taking hits and the potential loss of Minter might cause the defense to offset any potential gains from the offense. There's nothing wrong with being an 11-win team that doesn't make waves in the postseason, but we know Harbaugh and Herbert are capable of more.

Philadelphia Eagles

Lost 23-19 to the 49ers

If you were building a perfect example of what a frustrating 2025 Eagles loss would look like, it would be what we saw against the 49ers on Sunday. A couple of solid early scores before the offense completely shuts down in the third quarter? Check. Frustrating penalties that wipe away big plays? Check. An offense missing Lane Johnson? A missed kick by Jake Elliott that changed the late-game calculus? An excellent defense let down in spots by its weakest links on the back end? An end-of-game sequence in which the passing game sputters with drops and low-percentage throws? Check, check, check and check.

The Eagles have played variants of this game against good teams for most of the season, with a few breaks going one way or the other late to decide who wins. Things might have been different if Jalen Hurts had been able to escape the pocket and scramble for what looked to be an easy first down in the final sequence, only for 49ers midseason addition Keion White to trip him up for a loss of 1 yard. Instead of being in a first-and-goal situation with three timeouts, the Eagles were stuck in second-and-long and didn't pick up a single yard the rest of the way.

Against a 49ers team that has been battered by injuries and lost George Kittle to a season-ending torn Achilles in the first half, it was notable how the Eagles suffered when their weaker starters and depth players were brought into focus. The 49ers hit a pair of big plays in the first half when the deep safety in the middle of the field -- first Marcus Epps, then Reed Blankenship -- was simply unable to slow down a receiver and allowed significant yards after the catch in the process. Those plays amounted to 106 of San Francisco's 186 yards in the first half, setting it up for 10 points.

Blankenship simply stopped running on a trick play, with Christian McCaffreyzooming by him to catch a touchdown pass from receiverJauan Jennings. Nakobe Dean couldn't hang in coverage on McCaffrey for the winning touchdown. Fred Johnson, playing right tackle for the injured Lane Johnson, committed a false start that pushed the Eagles backward on third down and allowed the only sack of the game for Philly's offense. When you consider what the 49ers got from guys such asEric Kendricks, Garret Wallowand Demarcus Robinson on Sunday, the gap between the marginal players taking meaningful snaps on the two rosters and how they played was significant.

Is that on coaching? It has to be, at least in part. Kyle Shanahan and Robert Saleh did an excellent job of getting the most out of the talent they had, a job that became even more difficult for the 49ers head coach when Kittle went down early in the game and took a part of the playbook with him. The Niners were able to find answers by repeatedly targetingAdoree' Jacksonand attacking the Eagles underneath, where Philly blew coverages and couldn't get close as it tried to tackle McCaffrey and Kyle Juszczyk at times.

Saleh's defense leaned into the blitz, trusting that Hurts and Philly's two star wideouts wouldn't be able to make them pay. That plan paid off, as Hurts went 6-of-11 for just 48 yards against the blitz. Even when the 49ers didn't send the house, the threat of the blitz caused the Eagles to question their looks and check into plays that weren't necessarily great fits for what the 49ers ran post-snap. And after Deommodore Lenoir blew contain on the second run of the game and allowed Saquon Barkley to run for 29 yards, the 49ers limited the Philly run game to 109 yards on 34 carries, or 3.2 yards per pop.

For the majority of this season, it has seemed like the Eagles believed they were going to win on sheer talent, that their stars would make more big plays than yours. There was nothing to fix with the run game, because this had been one of the best offensive lines in football with Lane Johnson on the field. Brown and Smith were uncoverable at their best. Hurts was a serial winner. The Eagles ran one of the most static pre-snap offenses in football and were comfortable with Hurts attacking blitzes with low-percentage throws downfield because they believed their guys were going to win.

The results spoke for themselves until they didn't, and the core of general manager Howie Roseman's Eagles teams -- the offensive and defensive lines -- wasn't up to the task. The Eagles went 8-2 with Lane Johnson and 3-5 without him, as the legendary right tackle never made it back from his midseason Lisfranc injury. Hurts posted a 64.3 QBR with Johnson on the field and a 49.7 mark without him. The Eagles were the league's fifth-worst rushing attack in terms of success rate without Johnson. His absence wasn't the only issue, as Landon Dickerson and Cam Jurgens both struggled through frustrating seasons, but the Eagles simply didn't have the same dominant O-line that they had in 2024, and they never really found a way to account or adjust for those issues.

And while Roseman hit on the midseason addition of Jaelan Phillips, who gave an inconsistent pass rush a much-needed boost of pressure, the Eagles' offseason moves didn't necessarily age well. Zack Baun wasn't the same linebacker in his second season with Philadelphia and got juked out of the play several times in the loss to the 49ers. Some of the depth guys brought in to replace the departed Josh Sweat, such as Za'Darius Smith, Joshua Ucheand Azeez Ojulari, struggled to make an impact amid injuries (and an unexpected retirement for Smith). First-round pick Jihaad Campbell lost his role in the lineup once Dean returned from injury and played just one defensive snap against the Niners. The next defenders off the board were Carson Schwesinger, who is a Defensive Rookie of the Year candidate in Cleveland, and Nick Emmanwori, who has been a physical force at safety for Seattle.

But at the end of the day, this has to fall on the coaching staff, specifically the offensive brain trust of head coach Nick Sirianni and offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo. The Eagles simply didn't develop any new answers as the season went along, and while we don't know how things would have gone if Lane Johnson had actually made it back, the Eagles' offense wasn't really all that great with him in the fold, either. It certainly wasn't up to what we saw last season, when Kellen Moore was in Patullo's role and merged the offense he ran in Dallas and Los Angeles with what the Eagles ran under Sirianni.

Should the Eagles fire Sirianni? I laid out many of the pros and cons for him in November, and there's no arguing that his résumé through five seasons is essentially unprecedented in modern football. He deserves some credit for how well things went in 2022 and 2024, and some blame for the disappointing endings in 2023 and 2025. The Eagles could try to bring back former special teams coordinator John Harbaugh, but Ravens fans would have many of the same complaints about their former coach that Eagles fans have about their current leader.

I'd be surprised if the Eagles moved on from Sirianni. It's tough to see Patullo returning, and given that Moore and Shane Steichen have earned head coaching gigs from running this offense, it should be an appealing opportunity for offensive minds. It would seem aggressive to make massive personnel changes, but Roseman has never shied away from making moves before. And I wonder whether the Eagles will look to potentially tradeA.J. Brown, who had his least efficient season as an Eagles player, repeatedly seemed to butt heads with the organization and turns 29 in June.

Jacksonville Jaguars

Lost 27-24 vs. Bills

After what has been an excellent debut season as a head coach in Jacksonville, I'm worried Liam Coen is going to be sick for weeks. The Jaguars let this game get away from them in a way that I would not have anticipated. On a day whenTrevor Lawrence struggled with consistency and went 18-of-30 for 207 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions, the Jags simply didn't run the ball often enough.

It's one thing to get away from the run when an offense doesn't have success or is facing a team that has a solid run defense, but neither of those things were true. The Bills' rush defense -- which ranked 31st in EPA per play against designed runs -- was their obvious weakness heading into the game. And the Jaguars boomed on the ground on their first touchdown drive, as Bhayshul Tuten racked up consecutive carries of 20, 14 and 13 yards. Inexplicably, the rookie got just one carry the rest of the way.

The duo of Tuten andTravis Etienne Jr.combined for just 14 carries, which they turned into 118 yards and a 71% success rate. By EPA per designed rush by running backs, this was the 13th-most-efficient rushing performance of the season in any game by any set of backs. The Jags simply didn't get to it enough.

Raw rush totals can be misleading. Lawrence kept on a zone-read on fourth-and-short when he would have handed the ball off if Joey Bosa hadn't crashed down. Teams can run RPOs and throw their way out of run looks if they get the right movement. We saw the Panthers throw a pair of slants to Tetairoa McMillan that were tagged onto their run plays for easy completions. And if a defense is loading up with heavy boxes and daring teams to throw, running for the sake of running isn't a good idea.

But the Bills weren't doing that. The Jags didn't run into a single loaded box with Etienne or Tuten all game. Nine of those 14 carries went into light boxes, which helped their efficiency and hinted toward how the Bills were willing to approach this game on defense. Looking at Lawrence's first-and-10 dropbacks that weren't near the goal line or in the two-minute drill, there were plenty of run-friendly boxes that the Jags chose not to hit.

Given how Lawrence played Sunday, that was a missed opportunity. He came into the postseason on fire and playing the best football of his career, but as I highlighted last week, that doesn't always lead to the same success in the postseason.

Lawrence had a 15-2 touchdown-interception ratio during the final nine games of the 2022 season, then threw five picks in two playoff games, including four in the Jags' dramatic comeback win over the Chargers. After posting a 15-1 ratio over the final six games of 2025, Lawrence threw two picks in Sunday's loss, including one on the first play of the season-ending drive. He failed to convert on the aforementioned fourth-and-2 zone-read attempt, as well. Lawrence still made a handful of nice throws, especially when targeting slot receiver Parker Washington, but his 30.2 Total QBR ranked ninth among the 10 quarterbacks who have played in the wild-card round so far.

While the Jags led 24-20 with 4:03 to go after Lawrence found Etienne for a touchdown, the Josh Allen drive that followed felt almost inevitable. The Jaguars have a solid defense, but their secondary needs the pass rush to create problems. Instead, Allen went 9-of-12 for 144 yards under pressure, including a spectacular throw against an unblocked rusher to Brandin Cooks on a post route for 36 yards, which got the Bills into the red zone for the game-winning touchdown.

Even as Allen completed passes to nine different receivers and top target Khalil Shakir was mostly catching screens and hitches, the Bills were able to attack outside cornerbacks Jarrian Jones andGreg Newsome IIin coverage. Jones also struggled with his tackling after the catch. Allen was 10-of-11 on out-breaking routes, repeatedly trusting his ability to throw the ball into places Jacksonville's defenders couldn't reach. And to mitigate the pass rush, Allen got the ball out in less than 2.5 seconds on nearly half of his attempts, going 16-of-17 for 173 yards and a touchdown on those throws.

This was a successful year for the Jaguars, but I'm not sure it went the way Coen and first-year general manager James Gladstone would have imagined. Gladstone swore to take big swings in his new role, and some of those swings hit. Jakobi Meyers was wildly successful after being acquired at the trade deadline, earning an extension. Slot corner Jourdan Lewis was excellent early in the season before hitting injured reserve twice. Center Robert Hainsey had a very solid year after following Coen over from Tampa Bay.

And yet some of the more high-profile moves the Jags made didn't really work out. Newsome, acquired in a midseason trade for Tyson Campbell, allowed a107.5 passer ratingin coverage. Dyami Brown, signed to a one-year, $10 million deal, racked up 227 receiving yards and was a healthy scratch late in the year. Really, much of the new regime's success came in getting more out of the players who were already in the building, includingCole Van Lanen, Devin Lloyd, Etienne, Lawrence and Arik Armstead--all of whom played much better in 2025.

The biggest move the Jags made, of course, was trading two first-round picks for hybrid uber-prospect Travis Hunter. The early returns on that move aren't looking great. Hunter didn't play like a first-rounder at wide receiver or cornerback, although he did have 101 yards against the Rams in his final game before suffering a season-ending knee injury in practice. The Jaguars didn't seem to have a consistent usage plan for Hunter, and while the first-rounder they sent to the Browns to acquire him will fall late in the first round at No. 24, I'm not sure that trade looks all that great after one season.

Hunter still deserves time to develop, and the Jags surely would have loved to have him at cornerback against the Bills on Sunday, but their future plans for him could determine what happens this offseason. It seems likely that the Jags will move forward with Hunter playing regularly at cornerback, where they'll have an opening, especially if Newsome is allowed to hit free agency.

What about wide receiver, though? In Hunter's absence, the Jaguars got their passing game going by getting two other wideouts on the field. Meyers emerged as a standout, but so did Washington, who produced a mammoth run of games down the stretch. Underappreciated frankly by both the current and prior regimes in Jacksonville, Washington was buried on the depth chart after the additions of Hunter, Brown and Meyers.

Once Hunter was injured and Brown was taken out of the lineup, though, Washington proved that he belongs on the field. He had 145 receiving yards in the Jags' December win over the Broncos, then followed with a 115-yard day against the Colts and 87 yards against the Titans. Washington was then the Jags' leading receiver on Sunday, turning a team-high 12 targets into 107 yards and a touchdown. With one more year left on his rookie deal, Washington has earned a regular role in the lineup when Jacksonville is in three-wide sets.

The investment made in Hunter also implies that he's going to be a part of the offense, which leaves me with questions about the one player I haven't mentioned.Brian Thomas Jr.came into the year as Jacksonville's top wideout after an impressive rookie season, but amid early issues with drops, he seemed to fade out of that lead role in the offense. Meyers and Washington took over as Lawrence's top target for stretches in the second half. Thomas averaged 46.6 receiving yards per game over the final eight games of the season, and despite an early touchdown catch for Jacksonville's first score Sunday, he finished with only two receptions for 21 yards.

The new regime inherited Thomas, and he didn't appear a natural fit in Year 1 with Coen. Would the Jaguars consider trading him? The 2024 first-rounder is the most natural fit as the ""X"" receiver in Coen's offense, and I'm not sure any of the other guys are obvious replacements for him in that role. Plus, Thomas was so talented as a rookie that I'd want to try to make it work for another season.

If the Jags can recoup the first-round pick they sent away for Hunter, though, trading Thomas might be worth serious consideration. And the obvious landing spot, coincidentally enough, would be with the team that just beat them. Buffalo doesn't have that young playmaker who can win against man coverage at wide receiver, and Thomas would be a major upgrade on what already appears to be a failed experiment in Keon Coleman. The Bills will also have their first-rounder fall toward the end of the round, which would probably be a fair price for Thomas. It's an unlikely move, of course, but Jacksonville has four starters for three wideout spots, and Thomas is the player who would have the most trade value and who the Jags have seen the least out of in 2025.

A notable starter whose future is more likely to be elsewhere in 2026 is Walker Little. The prior front office signed the 2021 second-round pick to a three-year, $40.5 million deal after just a handful of starts at left tackle. Little began the year on Lawrence's blind side, but when he suffered a concussion in a November win over the Titans, the Jags installed Van Lanen at left tackle. The utility player was enough of an upgrade that the Jags signed him to a three-year, $51 million deal and kept him at left tackle when Little returned. (Little moved to right guard to take over for the injured Patrick Mekari.)

Van Lanen missed Sunday's loss with a knee injury, with Little back to his old spot and committing two false starts. The commitment to Van Lanen suggests that the Jags see him as a left tackle candidate in 2026. With Little's $11 million base salary guaranteed next season, it would hardly be a surprise if the Jaguars traded him to clear out a starting spot and get some cash to put toward free agent additions this offseason.

Green Bay Packers

Lost 31-27 vs. Bears

Sunday's loss brought an end to a five-week collapse for the Packers, who walked off the field after Keisean Nixon's interception sealed a win over the Bears in early December with hopes of winning the NFC North. That dramatic victory was their last of the season, as the Packers lost their final five games, including the wild-card matchup Saturday. Along the way, they lost Micah Parsonsto a knee injury, lost (then regained) Jordan Loveto a concussionand blew two different games with a 95% or better win expectancy in the fourth quarter to the Bears. The first pushed the NFC North back to Chicago, and the second might have ended Matt LaFleur's run as Green Bay's head coach.

There has been smoke around the coach's future in Green Bay over the past few weeks, and there are plans to talk after the season about extending the contracts of LaFleur and general manager Brian Gutekunst, both of whom are entering the final year of their respective pacts. I'd argue that they're two of the best at their respective roles. I'm just not sure Packers fans would agree with that sentiment at the moment.

At halftime of Saturday night's game, of course, LaFleur looked like he might earn a new deal in the locker room. It seemed like the Packers had outprepared, outschemed and outplayed the Bears, who were flailing on fourth downs and struggling to live up to the moment. Chicago coach Ben Johnson wasn't able to get his ground game going, had dialed up just one play-action pass for Caleb Williamsand couldn't rely at all on his defense to slow down the Packers. Love and the Green Bay offense scored touchdowns on their first three drives, and while Brandon McManus missed a 55-yard field goal to end the half, the Packers were up 21-3 and getting the ball to start the third quarter. One missed kick wasn't going to matter, right?

Well, three missed kicks mattered, as McManus missed another field goal and an extra point, costing the Packers seven points in a game they lost by four. He was a savior for the Packers last season when he produced an outlier season in terms of accuracy, but the Packers brought McManus back for 2025 with underwhelming results; he had the fifth-worst field goals made over expectation (per NFL Next Gen Stats) of any kicker, even before his postseason disappointment. Would he have had a better chance of making those kicks at home?

The Bears found their rhythm on offense, as they scored on five of their six possessions in the second half, racking up 333 net yards and 28 points. The Packers, decidedly, did not. The offense went to sleep for its first four possessions in the second half, as Green Bay amassed 29 yards and one first down across a four-drive stretch.

Much of that owed to a rushing attack that simply stopped. Josh Jacobs was solid early in this game, but the 2024 free agent addition and the offensive line could not conspire to threaten the line of scrimmage for most of the contest. Jacobs finished with 19 carries for 55 yards, but his final 14 totes produced just 16 yards and one first down. Jacobs was stopped on a second-and-3, a third-and-1 and two carries from the 1-yard line. And pressed into action as a kickoff returner, he fumbled, with the Packers fortunate to fall on the football. Jacobs was returning from a knee injury, but if he wasn't 100 percent, it was on LaFleur to find other solutions, either by using other backs or leaning into the pass on early downs.

Jeff Hafley has earned head coaching consideration for his work with the Packers' defense over the past two years, but this also wasn't his best showing. The Packers were able to get off the field on fourth down against the Bears in the first half, but frankly, that was more a product of Chicago's clumsiness than great defensive play. Bears center Drew Dalman fired a snap wide of Williams to throw off the timing on one failed fourth-down play, while Dalman and right guard Jonah Jackson failed to block defensive tackle Karl Brooks on another, allowing the Packers lineman to run totally unbothered up the A-gap at Williams for a drive-ending pressure. Williams finished the first half 8-of-17 for 78 yards with an interception, and it seemed like Hafley might finish the night with a head coaching offer or two.

After the break, Hafley's defense wasn't able to consistently slow down the Bears. The Packers weren't able to create post-snap problems for Williams and the passing game. There's nothing wrong with rotation safeties and trying to show a different post-snap look, but it led to snaps in which the Packers weren't in position to succeed. On the first third down of the third quarter, the Packers showed a two-high look before the snap and then blitzed safetyXavier McKinney from 11 yards off the line of scrimmage. McKinney never got close to Williams, and the Packers were outnumbered on a flood combination to that side of the field, producing an easy 19-yard completion to tight endColston Loveland.

Loveland picked up another big play on the same drive when the Packers spun their safeties before the snap and nobody ran with his crossing route. The rookie tight end was a mismatch when the Packers did get somebody on him -- Loveland was simply too athletic for Quay Walker--but the Packers made their own mistakes. On a critical third-and-4 before the winning touchdown, the Packers responded to an empty formation by dropping their defensive backs past the sticks and asking edge rusher Kingsley Enagbare to get into the flat to cover running backD'Andre Swift. Williams went right to Swift for an easy 23-yard gain. One play later, the Bears had the lead.

That final play saw the Bears take advantage of the position that has been the weak spot on the Packers' roster since the start of the season. Carrington Valentine was supposed to be booted out of the starting lineup by the arrival of free agent slot corner Nate Hobbs, but Hobbs was ineffective and injured for most of his debut season in Green Bay. Valentine has allowed a121.2 passer ratingin his stead, and he came up lacking on the last snap of the Packers' season.

For all the complaints about Ben Johnson's playcalling being too cute, this was an example of the details selling the right lie to the right player. The Bears lined up with trips to the left and an unbalanced line, giving them an extra blocker to the side of the field in tackle Darnell Wright. The look screamed some sort of screen, and early in the game, the Bears had thrown a screen on third-and-8 out of that same bunch for a first down.

This time, though, the Bears were taking a shot downfield. Williams fired his hips toward the tunnel screen without ever really throwing the ball, but that was enough. Valentine drove on the screen, and by the time he turned around, the ball was already coming out.DJ Moorehad dropped a spectacular throw from Williams earlier in the drive, but this time, the wide-open veteran brought in a fade for the winning touchdown.

Injuries and absences mattered. LinebackerEdgerrin Cooper leaving in the third quarter because of an ankle injury cost the Packers arguably their best remaining player on the defense. Isaiah McDuffie filled in and wasn't able to tackle Bears running backKyle Monangai on a critical checkdown that turned into a 22-yard completion and set up a touchdown. LinebackerNick Niemann, who hadn't played a single defensive snap all season, was isolated in coverage against Loveland on the 2-point try that made it a three-point game.

And the Packers sorely missed Parsons, the player for whom Gutekunst sent two first-round picks to acquire. They pressured Williams on 25% of his dropbacks, but the Packers had just two quick pressures on 48 opportunities, meaning that most of the times they bothered Williams came late in the play. Parsons averaged more than two quick pressures per game on his own this season. Could those pressures have helped swing this game toward Green Bay?

The Packers did have a chance to win the game after the Moore touchdown, but sloppy game management from LaFleur limited what they could do. It's always easier to evaluate timeout usage after the fact, when we know how the game ends, but it's impossible to suggest that LaFleur got anything close to full value for the three he had in the second half.

Green Bay used its first on offense with 3:02 left, a stopped clock and a three-point lead to avoid a delay of game penalty. That's fine, but the Packers promptly went back to the line after the timeout and took a delay of game penalty, costing them 5 yards. After an incompletion on third down, LaFleur had the impossible choice between kicking a field goal to go up six (often seen as a net negative by win expectancy models, because it incentivizes the other team to go for a touchdown) or attempt a fourth-and-15. He got neither, and the Bears scored a touchdown anyway.

LaFleur had to use his second timeout on defense with 2:08 to go, this time because the Packers couldn't get the right players on the field. The timeout stopped the clock for the Bears and gave them the ability to open up the playbook to call a run just before the two-minute warning, which they took advantage of to pick up 5 yards.

The Packers were left with one timeout for their final drive, which they used after a short competition to Romeo Doubs. They were then forced to run 10 seconds off the clock after an injury to center Sean Rhyan. In the end, they never even got an opportunity to run a play within the red zone before time expired, coming closest when Love nearly squeezed a pass between three Tampa 2 defenders toChristian Watsoninside the 5-yard line.

It's a frustrating loss at the end of a frustrating losing streak. It's the third straight year the Packers have entered the postseason as the 7-seed, and LaFleur has a grand total of one playoff win over the past five seasons. Should what Packers fans saw from their coach Saturday serve as proof that Green Bay needs to go in a different direction?

I would say no. LaFleur has gone 76-40-1 as a head coach despite fielding what were often underwhelming defenses over that stretch, an issue I would blame more on Joe Barry than him. There have been a couple of rough losses in the postseason, and I'm not sure I'll ever understand LaFleur kicking a field goal down eight late against the Bucs with the greatest red zone offense in league history in the 2020 playoffs, but there's a real value in having a coach who gets you to the playoffs just about every year. LaFleur's work with Malik Willis and building a functional offense around a quarterback who looked unplayable in Tennessee is a testament to his offensive mind.

The story seems the same for the Packers because it is the same. They're a good team stuck in a tough division. They're the youngest team in the league on an annual basis, as Gutekunst strips the oldest players from the roster and loads up on draft picks. The difference was supposed to be Parsons, the true superstar who would elevate the rest of the defense, help mask the weaknesses at cornerback and come up with big plays when the Packers needed them most. And for three-plus months, Parsons lived up to expectations. There's no good time to tear an ACL, but Parsons doing so one month before the playoffs was always going to have a dramatic impact on Green Bay's ceiling. I wouldn't fire LaFleur or Gutekunst because their most important addition tore an ACL.

Instead, I suspect it will be an offseason of retooling. This offseason might be the end of the line in Green Bay for 30-year-old lineman Elgton Jenkins, who has a $24.8 million cap hit next season. Hobbs and 28-year-old guard Aaron Banks, who was in and out of the lineup because of injuries, could be one-and-done in Green Bay, although I'd be surprised if Banks was released. Doubs, who had a fantastic catch in a key moment, is likely to leave in free agency, which will help the Packers recoup some of the draft capital they lost as part of the Parsons deal via compensatory picks. The Packers were also 26th in special teams win probability during the regular season, which might create problems for coordinator Rich Bisaccia.

Outside of the very top teams in football, a lot of organizations would and should look enviously at what the Packers have built. I think we need to see what that looks like in the postseason with a healthy Parsons before making any sort of snap judgments about whether Green Bay is better off with another head coach.

Carolina Panthers

Lost 34-31 vs. Rams

There are no moral victories in the playoffs, but for the Panthers, this might have been the closest thing to one. They were massive underdogs at home even after beating the Rams in Carolina this season, and expectations of repeating that feat in the rematch were low. When the Panthers quickly went down 14-0 after a failed fourth-down conversion and a Bryce Young interception handed the Rams a pair of short fields, a blowout victory for Los Angeles appeared to be on the horizon.

Instead, the Panthers came all the way back to take the lead with 2:39 to go before the defense allowed the game-winning touchdown drive toMatthew Stafford. The veteran quarterback reportedly told receiverDavante Adams he was going to ""snatch [ the Panthers' ] hearts"" on the final drive. A cold line, no doubt, but one you save for the Super Bowl when you know the NFL Films microphones are on the sideline, right? Stafford had to pull out his best material late in the wild-card round, both on and off the field, to get the Rams to the next round.

I'm weirdly more optimistic about the Panthers after their playoff loss than I was after their win over the Rams in Week 13, because the factors that led to that win were unsustainable. The Panthers converted all three of their fourth-down tries, including two for long touchdown passes. With a Mike Jackson pick-six leading the way, the Panthers posted a plus-three turnover margin in the win; the last time that happened was in the Matt Rhule era with Baker Mayfield at quarterback, more than three years ago. Those plays matter and are meaningful, but I'm not sure they're particularly sustainable as a formula for beating the Rams.

And in those same spots Sunday, the Panthers' timing wasn't quite as impeccable. They went 0-for-3 on fourth down. Young threw an early pick to the Rams on a play in which Panthers receiverJalen Coker, who otherwise had a breakout game, seemed to be on the wrong page after some pre-snap adjustments and stopped his route. Carolina rookie Trevor Etienne muffed a punt to give the Rams another short field, and while the Panthers got another Jackson interception and blocked a punt in the fourth quarter, the turnover margin for this game went down in Los Angeles' favor.

Instead, this Panthers performance shined through the full 60 minutes, as they went toe-to-toe with the Rams on a down-by-down basis. They struggled early on defense, with Rams receiverPuka Nacua moving around the formation and flummoxing Carolina's zone coverage looks, but defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero and his cornerbacks held up against Nacua and Adams and forced Stafford into what seemed like an endless run of contested throws to either sideline. They rode their luck a bit when Nacua dropped a would-be touchdown just before halftime, but the Panthers were able to limit explosive rushing plays and didn't allow a single drive over 50 yards before the fourth quarter.

And on a day whenChuba Hubbard and Rico Dowdle combined for 55 yards on 18 carries and the Panthers trailed by 14 points midway through the first quarter, so much of the game fell on Young's shoulders. His offensive line was a mess. Guard Robert Hunt tried to return early from a pectoral injury and clearly wasn't his usual self. The Panthers lost left tackle Ikem Ekwonu to a ruptured patellar tendon early in the game, and replacement Yosh Nijman allowed four of the 14 quick pressures generated by the Rams (per NFL Next Gen Stats), which tied for the fifth-most quick pressures in any game all season.

Under the circumstances, I thought Young was excellent. The raw numbers aren't going to wow anyone, with the 2023 No. 1 draft pick completing 52.5% of his passes and averaging 6.6 yards per attempt, but his 74.4 Total QBR attests to how well he played given the pressure rate. He was repeatedly able to buy time and create out of structure, looking almost Tony Romo-esque as he spun his way out of interior pressure and got out of the pocket to find receivers.

When Young wasn't pressured, he went 17-of-24 for 223 yards with a touchdown and a pick. He threw with anticipation to set up two chunk plays to Coker, who finished with nine catches for 134 yards and the touchdown that gave the Panthers their fourth-quarter lead. Young is never going to have the strongest arm, so he needs to anticipate voids before they come open, throw accurate passes to create YAC and create out of structure. He did all three Saturday.

I'm not suggesting that Young's fifth-year option was on the line in this game, because the indications were already that the Panthers were going to pick up Young's $26.5 million guarantee for 2027. If Young had suffered through a disastrous game (think Sam Darnold's final start with the Vikings), though, that pickup might have come through gritted teeth. This was Young's most important start in a Panthers uniform, and he came through impressively.

This is the first offseason in many years in which the Panthers won't have to make fixing the offense their primary focus. Acquiring a quarterback was problem No. 1, and they've spent the past two offseasons desperately trying to get the right players around Young. Some of those moves haven't hit, but enough have left the offense in solid shape. Coker and presumptive Offensive Rookie of the Year Tetairoa McMillan are the two young wideouts the Panthers have been hoping to find. They'll also have Jonathon Brooks as the second back alongside Hubbard to replace Dowdle next season.

There's still work to be done, of course. Ekwonu is likely out six to 12 months, and the Panthers are on the hook for his $17.6 million fifth-year option in 2026. Nijman, a pending free agent, was a turnstile when forced into the lineup at left tackle, so the Panthers probably need a short-term stopgap there if Ekwonu is not ready to go. Adding a tight end might also be on the docket if the Panthers weren't impressed by Ja'Tavion Sanders' second season.

But really, this should be an offseason finally devoted toward adding defense. The Panthers signed Tershawn Wharton and Tre'von Moehrig in free agency, but when they used a second-round pick on edge Nic Scourton, it marked the first time Carolina had used a first- or second-round pick on a defensive player since selecting Jaycee Horn in 2021.

The Panthers like their young talent on defense, but this would be about finding more significant solutions for some of their veterans on short-term, low-cost contracts. Ironically, two are former Rams in safetyNick Scottand linebacker Christian Rozeboom, both of whom were targeted by L.A. in coverage Sunday. No Carolina defender managed more than five sacks, so finding a veteran (or a first-round pick) on the edge who can create more pass pressure alongside Scourton and Princely Umanmielen would be a welcome addition.

It's important to be realistic about where the Panthers are and what they've shown. This team finished 25th in DVOA and ESPN's Football Power Index. It was 8-9 against one of the league's easier schedules, the same performance that led the Falcons to fire Raheem Morris after two seasons in Atlanta. And after no-showing in a win-and-in game against the Buccaneers last week, the Panthers needed Morris and his Falcons to beat the Saints (something they weren't able to do in their two meetings) to back into the postseason.

And yet there are meaningful signs of growth. The Panthers finished 21st in weighted DVOA, and while that's not going to push coach Dave Canales into the Hall of Fame, it's a sign that they were improving as the season went along. They beat the Packers and Rams and came within a defensive stop of beating what might be the league's best team a second time. If they can stack a second effective offseason in a row, the Panthers might be in position to take over Tampa Bay's spot as the presumptive favorite in the NFC South in the years to come.

Purportedly, Bartholdi imagined the “majestic figure of Liberty towering with her torch” and “lighting the crowded harbor, with its tributary rivers and the vast, blackened cities on their borders, the very image of a teeming, populous miniature world.” America, however, had some practical concerns.
Design patent protection was extremely well-suited for Bartholdi’s goals.
And design patents were considered fairly straightforward to apply for and receive, a characteristic reflected in Bartholdi’s patent application files.
The patent for the statue’s bust was granted on November 5, less than a month after the application was submitted.","In 1865, the end of the American Civil War and the passage of the 13th Amendment abolished the institution of slavery in the United States. Following these world-changing events, French political thinker and abolitionist Edouard de Laboulaye first proposed presenting a monument to the United States to commemorate this triumph of human freedom. De Laboulaye intended for the monument itself to be a gift from France, a gesture of friendship between two nations who fought side-by-side in the war for American independence nearly a century prior. A strong advocate for democracy, he also hoped the monument would spark anew a desire for freedom among the people of France.

Bartholdi’s first proposed location for his massive statue was the newly opened Suez Canal, and although this project never progressed beyond sketches, his depiction of a female figure on a pedestal holding a torch aloft struck familiar notes. After more than a decade focusing on artistic endeavors and attempts to find a potential home for such a structure, Bartholdi’s work was interrupted by his duties as an officer in the Franco-Prussian War. He watched as his home region was annexed by Germany and his nation was thrown into political turmoil. In 1871, reeling from the aftermath of this conflict, Bartholdi made the decision to travel to the United States. Prior to his trip, he met with de Laboulaye, and the pair reaffirmed their now joint goal to convince both France and America to support and finance the statue.

Bartholdi had multiple goals for his trip to America, but one of the most important was to scout prospective locations for the statue. An 1886 article in The Columbian described the sculptor’s “moment of inspiration,” which came on a “beautiful spring morning” while he was a passenger on a steamship traveling into New York Bay. Purportedly, Bartholdi imagined the “majestic figure of Liberty towering with her torch” and “lighting the crowded harbor, with its tributary rivers and the vast, blackened cities on their borders, the very image of a teeming, populous miniature world.”

America, however, had some practical concerns. A handbook produced by Statue of Liberty National Monument cites a few potential reasons for the lack of enthusiasm amongst Americans for funding the pedestal. Some took issue with the Statue’s proposed location, either believing discussion should be opened to alternative cities or unwilling to donate their money for what they viewed as a statue for New York City alone. Others, however, struggled to believe that the behemoth statue would ever be completed. With the statue being constructed an ocean away, Bartholdi found that his sketches and scale models were not enough to capture American confidence.

During the month that Bartholdi displayed the statue at the Centennial Exposition, he also sold photographs and even scrap metal from the torch in order to raise funds for the pedestal. The nation’s press took notice, with coverage of Bartholdi’s visit found in newspapers from Massachusetts, Ohio, Wisconsin, and of course, New York. In a letter to the editor in the New York Tribune, one citizen asked how to subscribe to help raise funds for the pedestal, proclaiming, “We should consider it an honor and a privilege to each contribute our share of the cost... What better memorial of the Centennial year could Americans inaugurate than this!”

The Centennial Exposition officially ended on November 10, 1876, but fundraising for the pedestal continued. For the next six years, the arm and torch found a home in New York’s Madison Square Park. In January of 1877, the statue’s advocates formed the American Committee of the Statue of Liberty. When Bartholdi returned to France to supervise the construction of the rest of his colossus, he designated the Committee’s secretary, Richard Butler, as his proxy in the United States. Looking to capitalize on the success of mementos from the Centennial, the Committee began selling scale models and photographs of the Statue in order to raise funds. However, this presented a new conundrum.

One tool Bartholdi used to protect against copycats were design patents. A fairly new form of intellectual property protection at the time, design patents were first authorized by Congress in 1842 to protect an article of manufacture where the novelty and value was in its appearance rather than the function. Technological advances in manufacturing allowed for cast iron pieces, textiles, and statuary to be both more intricately designed and more efficiently produced, and the artisans creating these pieces lobbied for a way to protect their unique patterns and embellishments. By the time Bartholdi applied for his first patent, more than 1,000 design patents had been granted by the Patent Office.

Design patent protection was extremely well-suited for Bartholdi’s goals. As he was seeking to protect the design of the statuettes and images used for fundraising, rather than the statue itself, they were considered an article of manufacture, making any potential infringements easier to navigate. The fourteen-year limit on the protection afforded by the patents did not pose an issue, as Bartholdi’s goal was to raise the necessary funds as quickly as possible. And design patents were considered fairly straightforward to apply for and receive, a characteristic reflected in Bartholdi’s patent application files.

On October 16, 1878, Bartholdi submitted his first patent application for the design of an ornamental bust, retaining the services of a New York City law firm, S.H. Wales & Son, and paying the required fee of $45. His description highlights many of the statue’s familiar features, including the head “surmounted” by a “diadem, from which rays proceed,” the “eyes having a distant gaze,” and the statue’s countenance “with an air of dignity and determination, symbolic of Liberty and Enlightenment.”

Bartholdi’s attorneys submitted a single amendment on October 22. Apparently, Bartholdi had originally used only his last name to sign the patent petition, and it was a requirement of the Patent Office that an inventor’s full name be included. The anglicized spelling of “August” was subsequently scrawled in red pencil anywhere Bartholdi’s name appeared.

The patent for the statue’s bust was granted on November 5, less than a month after the application was submitted. Bartholdi must have found the process and benefits of patent protection effective, for he submitted a second patent application for the full statue just months later, on January 2, 1879.

On January 14, the patent examiner assigned the patent wrote to Bartholdi with his objections. The first was a matter of word choice; Bartholdi had initially written “the design may be executed in whole or in part glyptically,” and the examiner stated that the word “glyptically” was “not to be found in the English language.” This line was amended to “any manner known to the glyptic art” in the final version. The examiner also asked Bartholdi to make one of his claims more specific. As it was written, they found the works more aligned with the “proper subject matter of copyright and not of letters patent.” In response, Bartholdi’s attorneys submitted their amendments, and the design for a statue was patented on February 18.

Nationalizing the fundraising drive while keeping the interest of the New Yorkers, who were consistently providing the majority of the funds, was one of the main challenges of the Committee. At various times during the statue’s construction, other cities around the nation expressed interest in providing a home for Lady Liberty within their borders. Bartholdi used this to his advantage, cleverly motivating New Yorkers by implying that Philadelphia might be permitted to keep the statue if they did not raise the necessary funds. And when Boston tossed themselves into the arena as an option, it ignited a rivalry between the two cities, both steeped in Revolutionary War history. A New York Times article in 1882 responded to Boston’s offer, leaving little of the city’s sentiment up for interpretation: “We have more than a million people in this City who are resolved that that great light-house shall be smashed into minute fragments before it shall be stuck up in Boston Harbor.”

When sales of the statuettes slowed and the pedestal was still nowhere near completion, the statue’s champions turned to other creative fundraising avenues. In 1883, the Pedestal Fund Art Loan Exhibition launched, a collection of paintings, sculptures, musical instruments, costumes, furniture, literary works, and items for daily use. “In assembling the rare and carefully selected Loan Collection,” the Committee’s goals were to ensure the funding of the pedestal was an endeavor “not one community alone, but the entire nation, should feel an interest,” as well as “awakening among us a potent influence in art.”

Fundraising ebbed once again in 1885, when it was determined that another $100,000 would be needed to complete the pedestal. At that point, Joseph Pulitzer, the editor of the newspaper The New York World, took up the cause. Soliciting donations from everyone from schoolchildren to the richest captains of industry, Pulitzer was able to help harness the excitement of the statue’s arrival from France. It arrived at its permanent home of Bedloe’s Island on June 19, awaiting only the pedestal’s completion.",https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/joi0126_lead.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 09:13:44.124222

“We’re seeing a clear decoupling between growth and hiring,” Daco said.

Health care employment also continued its upward trend in December, rising by 21,000 jobs, including a gain of 16,000 in hospitals.","The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported on Friday that nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 50,000 in December 2025, missing the 73,000 Dow Jones estimate and slowing from November’s revised gain of 56,000. November payrolls were revised down by 8,000 jobs, while October’s loss deepened to 173,000 from 105,000. For 2025 as a whole, payrolls grew by an average of 49,000 jobs per month, down sharply from 168,000 in 2024.

Bank of America Global Research analysts wrote in a report on Friday that although payroll growth has slowed since June, the unemployment rate has risen by only about 11 basis points. The report noted, “We have been highlighting that tighter immigration restrictions are likely to play a bigger role in the slowdown in job growth this year.”

The unemployment rate is a key statistic for the Fed, and markets responded to Friday’s miss by pricing out a January rate cut, according to the analysts. Futures now imply less than half a cut priced in through April, which marks the end of Powell’s term.

The productivity factor

Despite weak job growth, forecasts still point to solid overall economic expansion. I asked Gregory Daco, EY chief economist, how the U.S. economy can continue to grow strongly while hiring softens.

“We’re seeing a clear decoupling between growth and hiring,” Daco said. Output is still expanding, but companies are generating that growth with fewer incremental workers and fewer hours.

“Productivity has rebounded meaningfully as businesses continue to streamline operations, automate processes, and extract more output from existing teams in a high-cost, high-interest-rate environment,” Daco explained. “This isn’t AI-led in a narrow sense yet—it’s the payoff from multi-year efficiency drives, tighter cost discipline, and delayed hiring.”

According to the BLS, nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 4.9% in the third quarter of 2025, as output rose 5.4% while hours worked increased just 0.5%.

Areas of job growth

Where job growth has occurred, employment in food services and drinking places continued to trend higher in December, adding 27,000 jobs. The sector added an average of 12,000 jobs per month in 2025, roughly in line with the 11,000 average monthly gain in 2024.

Health care employment also continued its upward trend in December, rising by 21,000 jobs, including a gain of 16,000 in hospitals. Health care added an average of 34,000 jobs per month in 2025, down from an average monthly increase of 56,000 in 2024.

Monster’s newly released 2026 Job Market Outlook also reflects these pockets of strength. Based on full-year 2025 job posting and job seeker data, the report shows employer demand remaining firm in health care, essential services, infrastructure-related roles, and skill-based jobs, even as other parts of the labor market slow.

‘Hiring hasn’t stopped’

As private payroll growth weakened throughout 2025 and hiring appetites diminished, I asked Daco whether he expects that trend to continue amid ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and tariff-related risks

“Yes—barring a material improvement in policy clarity, I expect hiring restraint to persist,” he said. Private payroll growth has already slowed sharply as firms shift into cost-control mode, with geopolitical risks, tariff uncertainty, and elevated financing costs reinforcing that bias, he explained.

“Hiring hasn’t stopped, but it has become more selective and more conditional on clear demand visibility,” Daco added. “In this environment, CFOs are likely to continue favoring efficiency, automation, and capex discipline over broad-based workforce expansion.”

Efficiency has decreased over the last year as its operating margin fell by 34.6 percentage points

ROIC of 1.2% reflects management’s challenges in identifying attractive investment opportunities, and its decreasing returns suggest its historical profit centers are aging

Why Does KEYS Give Us Pause?

New orders were hard to come by as its average backlog growth of 1.1% over the past two years underwhelmed

Earnings per share fell by 7.3% annually over the last two years while its revenue was flat, showing each sale was less profitable

Shrinking returns on capital suggest that increasing competition is eating into the company’s profitability

Keysight is trading at $207.32 per share, or 25.6x forward P/E. To fully understand why you should be careful with KEYS, check out our full research report (it’s free).

Why Should You Buy SPGI?

ID21,IBM,2026-01-12 12:13:32+00:00,www.theregister.com,How CP/M-86's delay handed Microsoft the keys to the kingdom - The Register,Liam Proven,,,,,https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/12/why_cpm86_was_late/,"The real reason is the delay in delivering CP/M-86, and that's what Trifunovic covers in detail.
You couldn't run the 8080 version of CP/M (soon renamed CP/M-80) on it, like you could with a Z80.
86-DOS had been created by SCP as a stand-in for CP/M-86 and was thus intentionally compatible with the DR OS.
It had already effectively merged its multiuser multitasking MP/M [PDF] OS into CP/M-86 to create the multitasking Concurrent CP/M.
By 1984, Concurrent CP/M became Concurrent DOS, a true multitasking OS that could run MS-DOS apps.","A blog post by programmer Nemanja Trifunovic, The Late Arrival of 16-bit CP/M, is on the face of it an interesting little excursion into the late delivery of a long-forgotten bit of software – one that turned out to be pivotal for the entire computer industry.

It's the story of why the 16-bit version of Digital Research CP/M was late, but the delayed arrival of this now-obscure OS is what catalyzed the development of a different, but source-level compatible, OS. That OS started Microsoft on its way to its current $3.5 trillion capitalization, and is also what led to the development of OS/2, Windows, and indirectly Linux. There's a good chance that you already think you know how what happened, but if you reckon it's anything to do with DR's Gary Kildall being out flying a plane, that's not the true story, as The Register covered in 2011 (we'll get back to why not later in this piece). The real reason is the delay in delivering CP/M-86, and that's what Trifunovic covers in detail.

The CP/M-86 User Guide [PDF] bears a copyright year of 1981. The problem is it was designed for Intel's 8086 processor, and that shipped in 1978 – followed a year later by the budget model, the cut-down Intel 8088. In other words, the new edition of CP-M arrived about three years late. Its target, the 8086, was the exciting new 16-bit successor to the Intel 8080. As Intel's own page says:

It didn't revolutionize microprocessors – it created the microprocessor market.

This is no exaggeration, and a big reason it did so well was that it had a de facto standard OS: Digital Research's CP/M. CP/M was completely dominant. The early business microcomputer industry ran on it and essentially nothing else.

There was another processor that ran CP/M: Zilog's Z80. Although a fine chip and still mourned today, the Z80 was very much an eight-bit device, limited to a total of 64 KB of memory (RAM and ROM put together) without complicated bank switching.

As memory grew more affordable, what businesses needed was a partly compatible successor to the 8080 that could handle more of it. Intel delivered that with the 8086, which, rather than being limited to 64 KB, could handle 16 separate segments of 64 KB – for a total of one whole megabyte of memory space.

The problem was that, unlike the Z80, the 8086 was not binary compatible with the 8080. You couldn't run the 8080 version of CP/M (soon renamed CP/M-80) on it, like you could with a Z80. To use the new chip, hundreds of thousands of CP/M users needed a new OS. DR originally promised it would deliver one by November 1979, but it didn't happen. Trifunovic's article explains why and how it slipped.

As a result, one of the hardware OEMs selling 8086 boards was more or less forced to develop its own independent, third-party-compatible OS. No, not Microsoft, and not IBM either. Back in 2007, Tim Paterson, the developer of that OS, wrote about how and why he did it. He called the result 86-DOS, and a couple of years ago, we covered the rediscovery of the oldest known version of that OS.

Paterson started work on 86-DOS in 1980 because CP/M-86 was already late. That was more than a year before IBM launched the first IBM PC – with the budget cut-down 8088, so it cost ""only"" $1,500.

As The Register put it back in 2011:

In fact, it's likely IBM selected CP/M-86 but was forced to look, at least temporarily, elsewhere as DR's effort to port CP/M to the Intel 8086/8088 CPU was taking longer than planned. Gates may well have pitched an alternative – IBM was already talking to Microsoft about using the latter's implementation of the Basic programming language – and appears to have won the deal in November 1980.

Not long after, Microsoft licensed 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products (SCP), specifically to sub-license the OS to IBM in turn. 86-DOS had been created by SCP as a stand-in for CP/M-86 and was thus intentionally compatible with the DR OS.

In time, that made the fortune of Microsoft. Because IBM didn't get Microsoft to sign an exclusive deal, Microsoft was allowed to sell its DOS to whoever it wanted. That, together with cheaper IBM-compatible hardware, created the x86 PC industry.

The limitations of DOS, especially its memory management, are why Intel's successor chip, the 80286, was a bit of a flop. Although the 80286 had protected mode, which allowed it to support 16 MB of RAM and multitasking, this did little to help DOS — or IBM's new OS/2 1.0.

Here, too, DR missed out again. It had lost the deal to be the default OS on IBM's PC, but when Intel was developing the 80286, DR was ready for it.

It had already effectively merged its multiuser multitasking MP/M [PDF] OS into CP/M-86 to create the multitasking Concurrent CP/M. It then added MS-DOS compatibility to create Concurrent DOS. The problem was that you can't fit many DOS apps into the 640 KB of RAM in an 8088 or 8086 PC.

So DR enhanced Concurrent DOS to make a native Intel 80286 OS. Concurrent DOS 286 was able to use up to 16 MB of RAM, and multitask lots of DOS apps in all that room (IBM and Microsoft's OS/2 1.0 wouldn't follow for over two more years, and still couldn't multitask DOS apps when it did).

The issue was that DR developed Concurrent DOS 286 on pre-release Intel 286 prototypes. Although the 80286 was released in 1982, it reached the PC market with IBM's new PC/AT in 1984. The problem was that the shipping version of the 80286 chip removed some features Concurrent DOS 286 needed.

By 1985, Intel released a new stepping of the 80286, which replaced the missing features, but the damage was done. Once again, this seriously damaged DR, but it recovered. It turned CDOS into a real-time OS, FlexOS 286. Versions of this remained on sale well into the 21st century, including IBM 4690 OS [PDF], Toshiba 4690 OS [PDF], and Siemens S5-DOS/MT [PDF].

DR also continued to work on its pre-Windows GUI desktop GEM (in its early days, The Reg covered the news of GEM going FOSS). Late last year, Mr Trifunovic also published an excellent History of the GEM Desktop Environment, which we also recommend. Later versions of DR FlexOS and its derivatives included a multitasking version of GEM called X/GEM [PDF].

DR worked around the limitations of the 80286, and found ways to put them to good use. Microsoft, for the most part, did not. Even Windows/286 couldn't use most of the memory of an 80286 PC, as we looked at last year.

As a result of the limitations of Microsoft's DOS, the 80286 was mainly just used as a faster 8086. This drove Intel to develop its following generation of CPU, the 80386. This supported multiple hardware-assisted DOS VMs with memory protection – and even if you just ran plain old single-tasking DOS, that memory protection let you rearrange that crucial first megabyte of RAM to free as much as possible of the 640 KB which was all DOS could directly use.

Without widespread use of multitasking, let alone GUIs, on late-1980s PCs, the original all-32-bit 80386DX was too expensive – even without its theoretical 4 GB memory capacity. So, once again, it was the limitations of MS-DOS that drove Intel to develop the cheaper 16-bit-bus 80386SX. This created a market for cheap 386SX PCs with cheap 16-bit RAM and a low ceiling of just 16 MB.

That market of cheap commodity 386 PCs is the soil in which Linux grew and flourished. Early 1990s 386 PCs were not workstation-class hardware. They were never expected to multitask, and they didn't run GUIs very well, but they ran DOS just great... and even their low specs allowed Linux to thrive.

Dispelling some myths about how DR lost the IBM deal

Yes, Gary Kildall was in his plane when IBM visited. No, he wasn't on a pleasure trip. He was flying to make a site visit with a very important business partner, Bill Godbout, for whom The Reg ran an obituary in 2018. Along on the trip was his colleague Tom Rolander, who has told this story repeatedly, including on video (from 17 minutes onward). Rolander has also told the story to industry commentator Robert Scoble (Scoble's interview can be found on the Wayback Machine).

Microsoft open-sources the 6502 BASIC coded by Bill Gates himself

50 years ago, Gates and Allen made the deal that launched Microsoft

FreeDOS 1.4: Still DOS, still FOSS, more modern than ever

How a good business deal made us underestimate BASIC

DR was based in Pacific Grove, some 80 miles or nearly a 90-minute drive from Silicon Valley. Kildall often chose to fly. If you had that option, wouldn't you?

Kildall wasn't at the meeting with IBM because it was not his job – he was a programmer. His wife and business partner, Dorothy McEwen Kildall, co-founded DR and she handled corporate negotiations.

IBM wanted a harsh NDA and a one-off payment. She refused, which was a sensible call; DR dominated business computing, and IBM wasn't even in that market.

In other words, IBM tried to drive a tough deal with the big player that dominated the sector. It didn't work, so it negotiated poorly with a bunch of upstart kids: it let Microsoft keep a licence to resell DOS to other vendors. Two poor deals in a row show that it wasn't IBM being canny; it was merely IBM being bureaucratic and institutional, poor at negotiation and compromise. It handed Microsoft the keys to the bank, and the tiny startup used them.

We've even seen a perception that what the industry got from Microsoft was better: more capable and more open.

In fact, it was DR, consigned to second place, that worked harder. It delivered a small, fast, clean GUI with GEM. Abort Retry Fail has a good Short History of CP/M-86, which shows how DR delivered and continued to deliver. It had a multitasking CP/M-86 by 1982.

By 1984, Concurrent CP/M became Concurrent DOS, a true multitasking OS that could run MS-DOS apps. In 1985, DR released the C rewrite, Concurrent DOS 286, two years before IBM and Microsoft's combined effort. By 1987, when OS/2 staggered out, DR was offering Concurrent DOS 386, with built-in networking as well.

The Reg FOSS desk used and supported Concurrent DOS 386 in his first job, and it was remarkable. On his employer's demo machines, he used CDOS to generate large Mandelbrot sets, which took many hours, using Fractint – but with Fractint running in the background, and CDOS 386 running a copy of COMMAND.COM from IBM PC DOS 3.3 in the foreground session, so it looked exactly like a standard DOS computer and could be used as normal.

Without a time machine, we can't tell what DR would have done if it had delivered CP/M-86 on time. Perhaps it worked so hard on GEM, Concurrent DOS, DR-DOS, FlexOS, and so on because it ended up the also-ran. It worked very hard to rectify its mistakes, and if the PC industry had defaulted to DR OSes rather than Microsoft ones, it might have advanced rather faster. DR could have offered a multitasking 32-bit GUI OS with networking, able to run DOS apps, nearly a decade before Windows 95.

But it didn't. Squeezed out of the mainstream desktop OS market, it focused on multiuser, real-time, and point-of-sale systems instead. In the end, Novell acquired DR in 1991.

All because CP/M-86 was late. Trifunovic explains why and how that happened. That's vital info: it shaped the future of the PC industry, and trillion-dollar businesses hinged upon it. As wise people have noted, it's important to know your history.

Copper in the Age of AI: Challenges of Electrification

This comprehensive S&P Global study identifies a transformative trajectory for copper demand. Global demand is projected to rise 50% to 42 million metric tons by 2040, from 28 million metric tons in 2025, underscoring the metal's pivotal role in multiple technological and economic domains. However, there are significant obstacles in meeting these needs. The study projects a potential shortfall of 10 million metric tons by 2040 without meaningful supply expansion.

Copper is essential for the generation, transmission and use of electricity. However, the demand for copper will outrun supply unless there is a major adjustment across the copper supply system.

Private Credit Outlook 2026

Private credit enters 2026 facing its most challenging environment since the 2008 financial crisis. Global economic uncertainty around trade, investor jitters over runaway spending on AI and damaging headlines tied to late-cycle excesses in broader credit markets mean fund managers and allocators must tread carefully.

Cracks are emerging in corporate credit. A series of high-profile leveraged loan defaults in late 2025 and the rising use of payment-in-kind toggles in direct lending point to mounting stress. A new cohort of distressed and opportunistic credit funds, which have raised more than $100 billion over the past two years, is poised to capitalize on any resulting volatility.

Private credit is changing rapidly. The market of 2030 will look materially different from that of 2020. After years of allocating predominantly to US direct lending, allocators are broadening their horizons by geography and sub-strategy. The surge in European fundraising in 2025 is unlikely to be short-lived as allocators increasingly turn to the region for diversification and alpha.",https://spglobal.scene7.com/is/image/spglobalcom/Corp_0606_DailyUpdateSustainability?$responsive$,N,,2026-01-12 08:15:17.187118

Morgan Stanley's Downgrade Impact

This Monday, Morgan Stanley downgraded Capgemini from market-weight to underweight and reduced its price target from EUR 145 to EUR 142, citing concerns about the company's organic growth trajectory, particularly after the acquisition of WNS in the fourth quarter of 2025. The American bank highlights that the organic growth expectations for 2026 have been reduced to 2.5% from 4.5% a year ago. Analysts believe there is no path to further expansion of valuation multiples. This recommendation comes as the stock was trading close to its major technical resistance at EUR 151.85 the day before, after having increased by nearly 3% over a week and more than 21% over three months. Morgan Stanley notes that Capgemini's decision to stop directly publishing organic growth in 2025 will make it more difficult to analyze trends of acceleration or sequential slowdown. The stock is now trading at EUR 144.90, below its 20-day moving average of EUR 145.57, but remains above the 50-day (EUR 138.18) and 200-day (EUR 134.82) moving averages. The RSI at 57 indicates a neutral situation, dismissing any oversold signal despite the day's correction.

Monday's Decline Erases Recent Gains

Monday's decline wipes out some of the gains recorded since the beginning of the year. The stock had risen 2.31% on January 9th, closing at EUR 150.85 and flirting with the resistance at EUR 151.85. The 3.94% drop brings the price close to its 20-day moving average, a first technical support to watch. The MACD, with a line at 2.29 slightly above its signal line at 2.26, displays a positive but thin histogram (0.03), suggesting a weakening of the bullish momentum. The upper Bollinger band, located at EUR 151.78, is no longer immediately reachable, while the lower band at EUR 139.36 provides a safety cushion of nearly 4% below the current prices. Fundamentally, investors remain on hold before the release of the annual 2025 results scheduled for February 13th, a crucial appointment after the revised growth targets announced in November. The group had then raised its growth forecast at constant exchange rates between 2% and 2.5%, driven by demand in cloud and artificial intelligence. J.P. Morgan maintains a neutral recommendation with a target at EUR 155, while Grupo Santander keeps an outperform rating. The share of capital traded this Monday stands at 0.06%, a very moderate level reflecting a selective investor reaction to Morgan Stanley's note.

Excelsior Rotterdam had little to contribute against the high tempo and attacking intentions of PSV. After ninety minutes there was a convincing victory on the scoreboard, good for the first three points of the year. It is the sixth time in the club's history and the second time under Peter Bosz that PSV has won sixteen of its first eighteen league games.

Five names on the scoreboard

Paul Wanner opened the scoring within ten minutes. It marked his first goal in the VriendenLoterij Eredivisie and his second of the season, following his goal in the cup game with GVVV. Dennis Man laid the ball ready for the German after a strong individual action, notching his sixth assist this season. Ricardo Pepi doubled the margin and wrote history again. The striker became the third American player to score in the Eredivisie in five games in a row, Earnest Stewart and Michael Bradley having gone before him. Guus Til cleverly played Pepi free and provided his fifth assist of the season, three of them in the league.

Yarek Gąsiorowski also asserted himself with his third goal of the season. Mauro Júnior found the defender's head perfectly and notched his eighth assist. The fourth goal came courtesy of Ryan Flamingo, who was back in the starting lineup in league play. The last time the central defender did so was in September, also against Excelsior. Ryan scored his second goal of the season off a Joey Veerman cross, which marked his ninth assist. The final chord was for Dennis Man. The Romanian crowned a strong game with his fourth goal of the season, his third in the Eredivisie, and was rightly named Star of the Match thanks to his goal and assist.

High and low point

For Nicolas Verkooijen the game was extra special. The young Belgian made his official debut in the VriendenLoterij Eredivisie, having previously made minutes in the cup game with GVVV.

In contrast, the low point of the evening was the injury to Ricardo Pepi. The striker had to leave the field within half an hour after breaking his forearm at his goal. Pepi has since undergone successful surgery and is expected to be sidelined for about two months.

The stock soared more than 23% in Paris to 121.60 euros, after hitting an all-time high of 130 euros earlier in the session.

The jump comes after French publication La Lettre reported that Eli Lilly was prepared to pay €15 billion to buy Abivax, nearly double its current market capitalisation.

The report said no formal offer has yet been submitted to Abivax’s board, but that Eli Lilly is still in the race and is awaiting guidance from the French Finance Ministry on whether a potential deal would be subject to foreign investment controls.

While attending the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, Abivax’s chief executive Marc de Garidel told Bloomberg News that big pharma could no longer overlook the company’s lead drug candidate, obefazimod, which he said may become “one of the most-used products in the next decade.”

The experimental oral drug is being developed to treat ulcerative colitis.

“We are concentrating on developing this drug, bring it to the market. That’s all that matters. The rumours, speculations, we have no control over those,’ Garidel told BiotechTV in a separate interview.

Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Justine Telliez said Abivax has emerged as “one of the most attractive late-stage M&A targets”in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) following positive phase III induction data in ulcerative colitis.

He said a potential takeover could reasonably clear in a €150–250 per share range, above Kepler’s €130 standalone target price, which is based on probability-weighted value from ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease and assumes no transaction.

In an acquisition, valuation would typically move above standalone levels as buyers apply a broader “control” lens, embedding a control premium and assigning incremental value to factors excluded from the base case, including execution synergies, lifecycle management and pipeline optionality, Telliez wrote.

Where a deal ultimately clears would depend on perceived “winner” status, the level of residual uncertainty at signing, mainly around durability, and the degree of competitive tension among credible bidders, he added.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/EliLilly_800x533_L_1597822002.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 07:00:29.456323

UCP’s launch comes less than 14 weeks after OpenAI and Stripe announced their Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) – and directly brings on board a retailer (Shopify) that OpenAI had promised to onboard to its systems.

Like ACP, Google’s new standard can be implemented via REST APIs or MCP (Model Context Protocol). It can also be implemented via the A2A protocol.

At the National Retail Federation on January 11, Pichai said: “The industry needs a protocol that works at global scale and takes into account the nuances of commerce journeys, and this is a critical building block for it.”

What is the UCP standard?

The protocol facilitates interactions between agents or AI platforms acting on behalf of users, businesses selling goods and services, credential providers such as Google Wallet, and payment service providers (PSPs) like PayPal and Stripe, via a range of modular capabilities and standards

At launch, UCP supports checkout, identity linking and order management capabilities, building on existing standards including OAuth 2.0 and PCI-DSS, and with support for inter-agent protocols MCP and Google’s own A2A built-in.

A roadmap shared by Google says future capabilities will cover product discovery, support for multi-item checkout, loyalty benefits, and post-order management.

A phased rollout will see UCP first support payments in markets including India, Indonesia and Latin America. ""We are adapting the protocol to support broader regional use cases and localized payment interoperability,"" said Google.

A new agentic battleground

Commerce is proving to be a new battleground for agentic standards, with UCP Google’s second standard in the sector after it launched the Agent Payments Protocol (APP) to support financial transactions made by agents in 2025.

While APP was designed for payments companies, UCP appears to be a direct competitor to OpenAI’s ACP, launched in September 2025 with the support of fintech Stripe.

The world's two largest payment companies, Visa and Mastercard are also looking to power agentic commerce, launching their Intelligent Commerce and AgentPay platforms in summer 2025 to manage agent-led payments on their networks.

Writing late last year, analysts at London firm TTL LLP noted of agentic commerce and AI shopping that “the commercial implications are enormous. If AI agents become the primary gateway to shopping: Consumers may bypass traditional e-commerce websites altogether. Search volumes on platforms like Google could fall dramatically… New revenue models are emerging.

Philanthropy is evolving. It is becoming more strategic, more impactful, and more deeply personal. At Barclays Private Bank, we recently brought together philanthropists, charity leaders, and advisers to launch The Modern Philanthropist, a report based on specialist research into the motivations and behaviours of high-net-worth (HNW) donors. The event, held in London, provided a unique opportunity to explore the evolving nature of giving and the possibilities it creates for those who want to make a difference.

Understanding the motivations behind giving

Kicking off the event, Isabelle Hayhoe, Senior Philanthropy Adviser at Barclays Private Bank, explained that despite the significant – and growing – contributions of HNW philanthropists in the UK, there is still little clarity around what truly drives their generosity. To address this gap, Barclays commissioned research to uncover the motivations and behaviours shaping this vital form of giving. The result is The Modern Philanthropist, a report offering insights into how donors think, what prompts them to act, and how their approach is changing.

Cath Dovey CBE, Philanthropy Partner at New Philanthropy Capital and co-founder of the Beacon Collaborative, started the presentation by sharing a compelling picture of growth. In 2024, UK HNW individuals (HNWIs) donated an estimated £11.3 billion, with the median annual donation more than doubling since 2019 – rising from £5,500 to £12,000 in 2025 . Giving has outpaced both inflation and key market indices , suggesting real-terms growth driven by changing priorities rather than simply rising wealth.

Together, Cath Dovey and Isabelle Hayhoe explored what these trends mean for donors and charities alike. Their message was clear: philanthropy is becoming more intentional, and charities have a growing opportunity to engage high-net-worth individuals as partners in change through deeper understanding of the points of alignment in their goals, mission and motivation.

What the research reveals: Shifts in modern philanthropy

The report uncovered several themes shaping modern philanthropy. Firstly, wealth thresholds and liquidity events remain powerful triggers for major giving. While reaching £1–2 million in investible wealth is often the point at which donors start to make significant gifts, more than half have given sizeable amounts before hitting that milestone, often prompted by inheritance, business sales, or property profits. These findings highlight that the decision to give is highly individual, shaped by both a sense of financial security and key life events that provide donors with the means and motivation to act on their philanthropic intentions.

Giving is becoming more strategic. Donors now support an average of four causes, up from three in 2019, and many are formalising their approach: around one in three has set up a charitable trust, included giving in estate plans, or engaged a philanthropy adviser, while one in four has established a donor-advised fund. Yet knowledge gaps persist - a third of donors feel unclear about how charities operate, and many are deterred by the complexity of giving structures.

Impact all-round matters too. Two-thirds of HNWIs want their investments to generate positive social or environmental change alongside financial returns - a clear signal that philanthropy and impact investing are increasingly intertwined.

From insight to action: Why advice matters

Following a deep dive into report headlines, a panel of sector leaders joined Isabelle Hayhoe for a lively and insightful Q&A session. Fozia Irfan OBE (BBC Children in Need), Rory Brooks CBE (philanthropist and Charity Commission board member), Liam Eaglestone (Steve Morgan Foundation), and Roland Pearce (Barclays Corporate Bank) shared their perspectives on the opportunities and challenges facing philanthropy today.

Philanthropy is deeply personal, yet for many donors, the process can feel daunting. Questions about where to give, how to measure impact, and how to align charitable goals with broader financial plans often create uncertainty. In these moments, trusted advice becomes invaluable.

As Rory Brooks CBE observed, “Donors often feel isolated. They believe others understand complex giving, but they don’t.” That sense of isolation is common – and it’s why open dialogue matters. Conversations with a philanthropic adviser can turn complexity into clarity. They help donors articulate intent, explore values, and design strategies that align giving with tax, estate planning, and investment objectives.

The research reinforces this point. Giving structures – such as charitable trusts, donor-advised funds, and impact investing – can help donors maximise the impact and effectiveness of their philanthropy when used appropriately. While 49% of donors give cash donations, many use two or more vehicles: 36% have a charitable trust, 26% a donor-advised fund, and 20% are part of a giving circle. These approaches aren’t right for everyone, and understanding remains low, but when used well, they can unlock greater impact for both donors and charities

The message is clear: philanthropy works best when it’s informed, intentional, and supported by expertise. Trusted advice doesn’t just simplify decisions – it amplifies the difference giving can make.

Beyond capital: The value of expertise

Philanthropy is not only about financial capital. It is about what donors bring beyond money - their knowledge, networks, and experience. Liam Eaglestone described how the Steve Morgan Foundation uses business expertise to help charities build resilience and capacity. “Charities need both funds and professional experience,” he explained. “Donors can offer so much more than money.”

Roland Pearce echoed this point, highlighting the importance of infrastructure – data, technology, and systems that enable charities to measure and communicate impact effectively. “Good data is essential for understanding and improving outcomes,” he said. Without it, charities can struggle to demonstrate the difference they make, which in turn affects donor confidence.

The takeaway? When donors share their skills thoughtfully alongside their financial resources, they can help charities become stronger, more sustainable, and better equipped to deliver lasting impact.

Philanthropy as a human endeavour

For Fozia Irfan OBE, philanthropy is ultimately about people. “Philanthropy is not an act of doing but a state of being. When people give, it is an act of love.” She spoke about the power of storytelling and the importance of seeing the individuals behind the causes. Today’s donors - particularly younger generations - are more vocal, sophisticated, and focused on impact than ever before.

As Isabelle Hayhoe reflected, “Good fundraising is about the donor saying they are excited – how can I help? It should be about alignment, not persuasion.” That sense of synergy, between donor intent and charitable purpose, is what creates meaningful, lasting change.

Looking forward: Collaboration and lasting impact

The event closed with a call for greater collaboration and innovation. Both donors and charities must remain alert to risks such as mission creep, where organisations adapt too far to donor priorities. The consensus was clear: partnership between donors, advisers, and charities has never been more important.

As Cath Dovey summed up, “Philanthropy is a learning journey. There are many approaches, and donors are becoming more confident and knowledgeable.”

Economic growth update

HM Treasury responds to House of Lords Financial Services Regulation Committee criticisms

On 17 December 2025, the House of Lords Financial Services Regulation Committee (Committee) published a letter from HM Treasury (HMT).

The letter responds to criticisms made by the Committee in October 2025 regarding the government's engagement with the Committee's second report on the FCA and PRA secondary objective of facilitating the UK economy's growth and international competitiveness, which we covered in our November 2025 update.

In its letter, HMT provides additional information on the key issues highlighted by the Committee.

Facilitating economic growth. The response sets out the details of the evidence-based approach used by HMT and the regulators to support economic growth and steps being taken by the government to build the evidence base. These include a ""frank and comprehensive"" assessment of the sector's past performance and the development of a bespoke methodology to produce financial services clusters to help focus future policy to ensure it supports the wider economy. The response also outlines what the government is doing to support SME financing and proposals to require regulators to take account of the government's remit letter when determining long-term strategies.

Growth metrics. The government does not intend to undertake a further review of the FCA and PRA growth metrics.

Performance metrics. The government believes the right balance has been struck in the new timelines for regulators to determine authorisation applications and will bring forward legislation to change the statutory deadlines when parliamentary time allows.

International comparisons. The government acknowledges that international comparison on the cost of regulation would be beneficial but highlights some of the difficulties in making such comparisons (including the absence of collected data on the costs of regulation across jurisdictions and the lack of accepted uniform metrics for measuring regulatory performance) and that there are other factors that influence UK competitiveness aside from regulatory costs including strengthening trade, investment and partnerships ""between nations with shared interests.""

The letter concludes by noting that HMT will give a further progress update in summer 2026.

FCA and PRA update to government on economic growth work

On 9 December 2025, the FCA and PRA published letters sent to the government providing an update on their respective work to support the government's UK economic growth objective.

The FCA provided an overview of its work during 2025 and highlights plans to support growth in 2026, including:

Unlocking capital investment and liquidity. The FCA intends to reform rules for venture capital and alternative investment fund managers and consult on the pension charge cap so consumers are not disincentivised from investments due to higher performance fees.

Accelerating digital innovation to enhance productivity. The FCA intends to oversee the launch of variable recurring payments to give people more control of regular payments and drive competition, finalise digital assets rules and progress UK-issued sterling stablecoins, and set the delivery plan for open finance, prioritising SME lending.

Reducing regulatory burden. The FCA intends to further overhaul mortgage rules to enable more people to get on the housing ladder and unlock housing wealth in later life and finalise reforms to the redress system including providing clarity on fair motor finance compensation.

Making it easier for firms to start up and grow. The FCA intends to propose removal of the seven-day research waiting period to reduce delays in IPO application and prepare to allow some early-stage firms to conduct regulated business before full authorisation upon the passing of legislation.

Improving exports and inward investment. The FCA intends to establish a presence in Singapore and deepen integration with the USA. Our December 2025 update discusses the initial announcement of the FCA to establish a presence in Singapore through a strategic partnership with the AI Monetary Authority of Singapore.

The FCA also intends to adapt its supervisory approach, with more tailoring to firms' size and type, and prioritise enforcement of the most egregious harms. It calls for the government to provide clearer articulation of its risk appetite to assist with the implementation of its innovation and growth plans.

FSB report on non-bank financial intermediation

On 16 December 2025, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) published its annual Global Monitoring Report on Non-Bank Financial Intermediation 2025.

The report, which includes the annual FSB monitoring exercise, describes broad trends in non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) across 29 jurisdictions that account for over 90% of global GDP.

The main findings include:

In 2024, the NBFI sector grew 9.4%, double the pace of the banking sector (4.7%), increasing its share of total global financial assets to 51% (US$256.8 trillion).

All NBFI subsectors grew in 2024. The sector 'other financial intermediaries' (money market funds, hedge funds, other investment funds, trust companies, and structured finance vehicles) was the fastest growing sub-sector, growing by 11% over the year, to US$169.4 trillion.

Pension fund and insurance corporation assets grew 7% and 6%, respectively.

The narrow measure of the NBFI sector, consisting of entities involved in credit intermediation activities that may pose bank-like financial stability risks, increased 12% to US$76.3 trillion.

Most vulnerability metrics for entities within the narrow measure of the NBFI remained broadly stable. Fixed income and mixed funds showed high degrees of liquidity transformation, while finance companies, broker-dealers, and structured finance vehicles displayed high levels of leverage.

ESMA publishes market report on crowdfunding in the EU 2025

On 22 December 2025, ESMA published its market report on crowdfunding within the EU, which provides an overview of the state of the EU crowdfunding market, based on data received from national competent authorities under the EU Crowdfunding Regulation.

By the end of 2024, across the EU, 181 crowdfunding service providers raised over EUR4 billion of crowdfunding, with 21 Member States hosting at least one active provider. Loan-based projects were most prevalent, making up over half (58%) of crowdfunding in 2024, followed by debt-based projects at 23% and equity-based amounting to 12%. Debt-based crowdfunding differs from loan-based crowdfunding in that it involves transferable securities.

Similar to the previous report, the majority of crowdfunding investors focused on the retail industry, with 88% being classified as retail investors during 2024.

The top five countries in terms of capital raised were France (EUR1.45 billion), the Netherlands (EUR 1 billion), Spain (EUR0.45 billion), Italy (EUR0.29 billion) and Lithuania (EUR0.28 billion). Among the top five countries, France was the only country to have predominantly debt-based crowdfunding, amounting to 50% of funding raised, with loan-based crowdfunding amounting to 23% of funding raised. In contrast, loan-based crowdfunding was the most common type in the Netherlands (81%), Spain (60%), Italy (50%) and Lithuania (96%).

FCA launches review of bespoke market risk rules for non-banks

On 16 December 2025, the FCA published an engagement paper on the possible introduction of bespoke market risk rules for non-bank trading firms.

The primary focus will be a review of the current requirements in sections 4.11, 4.12 and 4.13 of the Prudential sourcebook for MiFID Investment Firms (MIFIDPRU) and the corresponding sections of the UK Capital Requirements Regulation (UK CRR).

Chapter 3 identifies a range of possible approaches to setting capital requirements for market risk. The FCA is seeking stakeholder engagement, to narrow the options for more detailed consideration. The possible approaches presented are:

Amend the existing standardised approach. Amend the current K-NPR calculation (a capital requirement based on net position risk) and incorporate requirements within the FCA Handbook, or allow firms to scale down K-NPR calculations via a simple discount factor.

A margin-based approach. Extend the current K-CMG approach (based on the third highest daily total margin over three months) to uncleared over-the-counter derivatives using historic margins or apply it to cash products using derived margins from futures contracts.

An internally modelled approach. Amend the current internal model approach to make it more proportionate and risk-sensitive or use other risk management techniques such as variance-covariance matrices, Monte Carlo simulations, or scenario analyses to set regulatory capital.

A net capital rule (NCR) approach. Adopt an NCR approach based on firms maintaining specified minimum levels of net liquid assets.

Repurposing K-TCD for exposure to price risk. Investment firms that deal in their own name may also have to calculate a separate capital requirement to protect against the default of a trading counterparty (K-TCD). This includes the firm having to calculate a transaction’s exposure value to capture the replacement cost of an asset or contract and, for a derivative, its potential future exposure. These basic concepts could be repurposed to capture risk currently addressed by K-NPR. Replacement cost and potential future exposure can reflect current market risk of a given position.

A weighted liquid exposure method. Develop a methodology where firms assess the time required to close an exposure without moving market prices, with capital charges applied to the overall weighted liquidity profile.

The FCA intends to conduct a roundtable in January 2026 prior to the deadline for responses on 10 February 2026. It aims to publish a consultation paper later in 2026 and a policy statement in 2027.

FCA policy statement on tackling non-financial misconduct in financial services

On 12 December 2025, the FCA published a policy statement, amending its guidance in the Code of Conduct (COCON) to explain in what circumstances non-financial misconduct (NFM) could amount to a breach of the conduct rules. The policy statement also amends the guidance in the Fit and Proper test for Employees and Senior Personnel sourcebook (FIT) to explain how NFM forms part of FIT.

The amendments are intended to make it easier for firms within the Senior Managers and Certification Regime, to consistently interpret and apply the rules and follows the introduction of a new rule in COCON in July 2025, which amends the scope of COCON as it applies to non-banks (see our July 2025 update). Updates to the guidance include:

New examples and flow diagrams within the Handbook are intended to help firms apply COCON consistently, in particular, the rules in COCON 1. A decision tree is included to help firms decide if NFM amounts to a rule breach.

The guidance has been revised, where possible, to further align with relevant provisions in employment and equality law. This includes an example suggested by a respondent to demonstrate that the purpose of the conduct is as important as its effect. This shows how an individual can breach COCON even if their hostile and intimidatory communication is intercepted before it reaches the intended subject.

Clarification that managers’ accountability is relative to their knowledge and authority. The amended guidance will make it clearer that the FCA would not expect a manager to be held responsible for failing to stop NFM if they could not reasonably have known about it, and the FCA would not consider it reasonable to hold them responsible if they did not have authority to act in the particular case.

Withdrawal and/or amendment of examples and factors that risked imposing disproportionate burdens. This includes deleting existing guidance that gave a misleading impression of individual SMF managers’ disclosure obligations and publishing new guidance at COCON 1.3.3G.

Clarification that firms are not expected to investigate trivial or implausible allegations or breach privacy law when assessing fitness and propriety.

The FCA emphasises that no guidance can cover every scenario and firms will always need to exercise their own judgement.

The changes are set out in the Non-Financial Misconduct (No 2) Instrument 2025 (FCA 2025/60) and, together with the rule change in COCON, will come into force on 1 September 2026.

Financial Services Regulatory Forum publishes ninth regulatory initiatives grid

On 11 December 2025, the Financial Services Regulatory Initiatives Forum (FSRIF) published its ninth regulatory initiatives grid (Grid). The members of the FSRIF are the Bank of England, the PRA, the FCA, the Payment Systems Regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, The Pensions Regulator, and the FRC. HM Treasury (HMT) is an observer member.

The ninth edition sets out 124 live initiatives, a 13% reduction compared with the eighth edition published in April 2025. The Annex to the Grid contains a list of initiatives that have been completed or stopped.

Initiatives added to the Grid since the previous edition are:

Multi-sector. The PRA is due to consult on its framework for the prudential treatment of firms' exposure to crypto assets in Q4 2026. Stakeholder engagement and key milestones are expected in H1 2027.

Investment management. The FCA will review data collection for asset managers and funds. Stakeholder engagement is expected between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026.

Banking, credit and lending. The FCA expects to publish the findings from the review of high-cost short-term credit price cap in Q3 2026. The FCA plans to consult on its retail banking disclosure rule review in 2026.

Banking, credit and lending. The FCA plans to consult on its review of the retail banking disclosure rule in 2026.

Payment services. HMT expects to publish its response to the September 2024 consultation on a streamlined approach to payment systems regulation in the next four months.

State of suptech report

On 11 December 2025, Cambridge SupTech Lab, Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, Cambridge Judge Business School, and Digital Transformation Solutions published the State of SupTech Report 2025 (Report).

The Report provides analysis and insights from 312 financial authorities across 172 countries and six continents and is a global benchmark on supervisory technology (suptech).

Key findings of the Report include:

Adoption. Global suptech adoption has accelerated with 197 agencies across 140 countries deploying suptech, more than three times the 2022 adoption figures. Financial authorities in advanced economies have greater deployment compared to their peers in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), highlighting a global capability gap shaped by strategy and governance, skills, infrastructure, and budget constraints.

Suptech value recognition. Recognition of the value of adopting supervisory technologies has increased, with 18% of agencies rating suptech applications as very effective, 33.5% rating applications as moderately effective and 34% as somewhat effective.

Modernisation and AI. Technology adoption shows steady modernisation with continued reliance on foundational tools. AI maturity remains low, with 26% of authorities within the initial exploration stages and only 7% report widespread deployment, with advanced economies significantly ahead (24% compared with less than 1% in EMDEs).

Barriers. The principal barriers have shifted from purely technical issues to operational and human factors. Poor data quality and talent shortages are constraining design, with deployment, costs, and limited internal IT capacity impacting implementation. For AI specifically, data protection and privacy concerns remain paramount, alongside staff skills gaps and technical integration challenges.

Enablers and barrier removal. Authorities with coherent strategies report smoother implementation, higher data quality, and broader deployment, demonstrating the critical link between integrated planning and success. Agencies are actively addressing barriers to adoption through external training, internal training, bilateral partnerships, and peer-learning forums. Development is being led by internal IT departments and business units, with targeted external support from vendors and consultants. Procurement remains formal and structured, dominated by RFPs and tenders, though innovation methods like tech sprints and regulatory sandboxes are emerging, particularly in advanced economies.

The Report closes by observing that while there has been a growth in implementation, to realise the full value of suptech requires ""… more than incremental tool deployment"". It concludes that what is needed is ""… institutional readiness, strategic clarity, and collective action"" including stronger co-ordination across jurisdictions.

FCA publishes new webpage on risk warnings for mainstream investments

On 11 December 2025, the FCA launched its new webpage on risk warnings for mainstream investments. The webpage sets out the expectations the FCA has of firms in promoting investment products and highlights common misconceptions about risk warnings.

The key expectations of the FCA are:

Financial promotions must meet the requirements under the Consumer Duty, in particular, they must be clear, fair and not misleading for the consumer.

Promotion of investment products must comply with key rules under COBS, including that such promotions are fair, clear and not misleading (COBS 4/2/1R(1)) and give a balanced impression of the benefits and risks of an investment product or service (COBS 4.5.2R(2) or COBS 4.5A.3R(2)(b)).

When designing communications, the firm should put themselves in the consumer’s shoes with focus being on what consumers would want or need to know. Where appropriate, this includes testing communications.

A list of consideration questions to be asked by firms when planning promotions are provided on the webpage.

Common misconceptions highlighted are:

Digital assets

FCA update on new cryptoasset regulatory regime

On 8 January 2025, the FCA launched a webpage to provide information on the new UK cryptoasset regulatory regime and how firms should prepare.

Key points to note include:

Commencement of regime and application gateway. The FCA confirmed that the new regime is expected to come into force on 25 October 2027. The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Regulations 2025 (Regulations) (currently awaiting parliamentary approval) enable the FCA to set a period ahead of the commencement of the regime for businesses to submit applications to the FCA, and this is expected to open in September 2026.

Authorisation. Cryptoasset businesses will need to be authorised by the FCA to do business in the UK and demonstrate that they meet the required standards. Firms that are already authorised by the FCA to undertake other regulated activities will need to have their existing permissions varied before the commencement of the new regime. The FCA's Authorisations team is holding a webinar on 29 January 2026 to introduce the new regime and outline its expectations when assessing authorisation applications. Registration for the webinar can be completed here.

Transitional provision for existing cryptoasset firms. The Regulations provide a transitional provision for existing cryptoasset firms that are unsuccessful in securing authorisation to run-off their UK business in an orderly way and exit the UK market.

FCA launches three consultations on core elements of cryptoasset regulatory regime

On 16 December 2025, the FCA published three consultation papers (CPs) on core elements of its regulatory regime for cryptoassets.

CP25/40 covers proposed rules and guidance for firms conducting regulated cryptoasset activities such as trading platforms, intermediaries (including cryptoasset lending and borrowing), staking, and decentralised finance.

CP25/41 covers proposed rules and guidance based on the designated activities regime (see above) for the offering to the public of qualifying cryptoassets that are or will be admitted to trading on a UK qualifying cryptoasset trading platform (CATP), the admission of qualifying cryptoassets to trading on CATPs, disclosure obligations relating to admissions to trading and the issuance of UK-issued qualifying stablecoins, and requirements to prevent, detect and disrupt market abuse in cryptoasset markets.

CP25/42 sets out the proposed prudential rules and guidance for in-scope cryptoasset firms. It builds on CP25/15, which we discussed in an earlier update.

A detailed review of the CPs is provided in our article here.

The CPs were published a day after the draft Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Regulations 2025 (Regulations) were laid before parliament – see our article here for further detail. The Regulations must now be approved by both Houses of Parliament.

FCA publishes cryptoassets consumer research

On 16 December 2025, the FCA published the sixth edition of its cryptoassets consumer research note.

Key findings of the research include:

Awareness and holdings. Whilst the proportion of UK adults holding cryptoassets declined compared to last year, overall awareness of cryptoassets among the general public remains very high at 91%, with awareness of stablecoins among cryptoasset users continuing to climb, rising to 58% in 2025 from 53% in 2024. The typical value held by investors increased, with more people moving away from small holdings and instead making larger investments.

Centralised exchanges remain the most popular route to purchase. Centralised exchanges remain the most popular method to buy cryptoassets, increasing four percentage points to 73%.

Call for regulation. Among cryptoasset users, 25% would be more likely to invest if greater regulation was applied to cryptocurrencies in the UK.

An additional research note on the impact of cryptoasset regulation on consumer decision-making was published. The research note examines how the availability of information about the regulatory status of cryptoassets and the protections that regulation may provide impacts consumers’ decisions and beliefs.

Notable findings include:

Providing information on regulation and related information significantly impacted consumer decision-making, understanding of the coverage of protections, and trust. For example, informing consumers that cryptoassets are regulated increased demand for cryptoassets.

Participants had a poor understanding of the potential protections under cryptoasset regulation. Providing additional information on protections helped but its impact was limited.

Providing additional information about cryptoassets and the protections that regulation might provide supported consumer understanding of protections and trust in cryptoassets.

However, many participants continued to misunderstand that they lacked certain protections, with the absence of additional information about the coverage of protections, making participants less trusting of the FCA.

Payment services and systems

PSR launches consultation on card scheme and processing fees

On 19 December 2025, the PSR launched a consultation following the March 2025 market review of card scheme and processing fees. The consultation proposes to implement two directions out of the four proposals included within its April 2025 remedies consultation.

The proposals the PSR intends to implement as remedies are:

Information, transparency and complexity remedy (ITC Remedy). This will ensure that acquirers and merchants through their contractual relationship, receive better information to understand the fees they are charged.

Pricing governance remedy (Pricing Governance Remedy). This will ensure that there is evidence behind pricing decisions and is intended to remedy the current absence of evidence showing how pricing decisions are made.

The consultation requests feedback on the form of the directions (draft ITC Remedy direction and draft Pricing Governance Remedy direction).

The PSR will introduce a remedy relating to regulatory financial reporting and expects to consult on a draft direction for such remedy by 31 March 2026. The fourth remedy proposed by the PSR in its April 2025 remedies consultation on the publication of schemes' information to increase transparency will not be implemented.

The deadline for responses is 17:00 on 13 February 2026.

FCA statement on contactless payment limits for PSPs

On 19 December 2025, the FCA confirmed that from 19 March 2026, banks and payment service providers (PSPs) will have flexibility to set their own limit for contactless payments.

The FCA understands that most banks and PSPs are likely to maintain existing contactless limits for the near future. If they do make changes, the FCA expects firms to communicate these to consumers under the Consumer Duty.

From 19 March 2026, Article 11 of the Strong Customer Authentication RTS (SCA RTS) will read:

""Article 11 Contactless payments at point of sale

Subject to compliance with Article 2, payment service providers shall be allowed not to apply strong customer authentication where the payer initiates a contactless electronic payment transaction identified by the payment service provider as posing a low level of risk.""

The formal legal instrument making the changes to the SCA RTS, can be viewed here. Changes will also be made to the FCA's Approach Paper, with confirmation of the rule change included in the Appendix to the FCA's Handbook Notice (No 136, December 2025).

FCA and PSR joint response to HM Treasury payments regulation recommendations

On 17 December 2025, the FCA and PSR published a joint letter sent to HM Treasury (HMT) providing an update on their progress in responding to HMT's payments regulation recommendations.

Key progress updates provided are:

There has been significant enhancement of FCA and PSR co-ordination to address congestion in the regulatory landscape. Collaborative efforts highlighted were the consolidation of PSR functions into the FCA, working jointly with the CMA on digital wallets, and the revision of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Bank of England and Prudential Regulation Authority to establish principles for better co-operation.

Substantial progress has been made in the development of open banking and open finance. Initiatives highlighted include the establishment by the FCA of a new department incorporating both FCA and PSR capabilities, industry-led initiatives advancing commercial models for variable recurring payments, with 31 parties funding a group to facilitate the go-live of VRP phase 1 for lower-risk use cases.

The FCA launch of the smart data accelerator focusing on SME lending and mortgages. The FCA intends to publish a roadmap in early 2026 to establish regulatory foundations during 2027.

Consumer protection remains a priority, with significant focus on fighting financial crime and fraud prevention. The PSR's APP fraud reimbursement requirements, which came into effect in October 2024, resulted in 88% of money lost to in-scope scams being returned to victims, with 83% of claims closed within five business days. The regulators are investing in real-time data sharing, intelligence capabilities, and stronger risk management controls to combat fraud and money laundering. Additional measures include updating Strong Customer Authentication requirements to enable more agile regulation, monitoring financial inclusion as services shift online, and implementing a new public-private partnership model to deliver next-generation retail payments infrastructure that supports innovation, competitiveness and security while advancing the government's growth mission.

FCA progress update on Open Banking

On 16 December 2026, the FCA provided an update on the progress of Open Banking.

The number of open banking payments has grown by 53% year on year, with over 16 million users benefiting from the service (compared to 11 million as at November 2024). A key driver for this increase is the rise of variable recurring payments (VRPs), which account for 16% of all open banking payments. VRPs allow consumers and businesses to set up flexible, automated payments tailored to individual needs, offering greater control compared to traditional direct debits.

As part of the update, the FCA and PSR published a joint report on the development and rollout of commercial VRP (cVRP). Through a new organisation, the UK Payments Initiative (UKPI), funded by 31 parties across the sector, the current application of VRP will be extended to 'phase 1' use cases, which include utility payments, financial services payments, and payments to local and central government.

UKPI was incorporated on 16 December 2025. It has agreed fifteen guiding principles, which are set out in the report.

The first live payments under the UKPI scheme are expected to take place in Q1 2026. In time, cVRP will support further use cases such as grocery shopping and online purchase.

HMT is expected to introduce secondary legislation in 2026 under the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025. The introduction of the secondary legislation will give the FCA powers to set Open Banking rules and the FCA plans to consult on new rules before the end of 2026 for what's referred to as ""long-term regulatory framework."" Lessons learned from phase 1 of the cVRP will feed into the FCA's rules.

Final report on Independent Review of the Payment and Electronic Money Institution Insolvency Regulations 2021

On 16 December 2025, HM Treasury (HMT) published the final report on the Independent Review of the Payment and Electronic Money Institution Insolvency Regulations 2021. The final report sets out the findings of the review into the efficacy of the Payment and Electronic Money Special Administration Regime (PESAR). The independent review was initiated by the government in December 2024 (see our January 2025 update).

The final report found that the PESAR is not yet delivering on its core objectives. The procedural complexity, high costs, and reliance on court processes have led to delays and diminished outcomes for customers particularly those who are vulnerable or hold low-value accounts.

The review identified key issues with the PESAR:

Objective structure. The PESAR statutory objectives lack a clear hierarchy, and further clarity is needed to prioritise business rescue and customer transfers.

Court and cost burden. The requirement for court entry and approval of distribution plans is often disproportionate. The review proposes several measures to reduce the cost burden of PESAR proceedings, including providing firms and IPs with an out-of-court entry route to enter the PESAR without in-court approval, to reduce costs and delays, particularly for smaller institutions, and limiting court involvement by reserving court processes for the more complex and/or disputed cases.

Customer fund return. The absence of any FSCS protection is a gap that could be addressed as the industry matures to improve consumer outcomes. The review recommends considering the introduction of FSCS-style protection to enable rapid payouts and provide a robust safety net for customers.

Scalability and contingency planning. The PESAR has not yet been tested on large providers, and more focus may be needed to secure orderly transfers to a new provider or continuity arrangements so merchants can continue taking payments while a replacement is found. The review recommends the development of contingency strategies for the insolvency of major providers.

Market and legal efficiency. Targeted legislative refinements, clearer comfort mechanisms to IPs, and improved creditors' committee functionality are needed to reduce friction and encourage practitioner engagement.

HMT will consider the findings and recommendations of the final report and provide a response in due course.

EU MoU on access by non-bank PSPs to central bank operated payment systems

On 18 December 2025, the EBA published a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the EBA, ECB, NCBs, and NSAs on the co-operation framework for information sharing in support of the access of non-bank payment service providers (PSPs) to central bank operated payment systems.

The MoU operationalises the framework for co-operation and exchange of information between NSAs and NCBs, its primary objectives are to:

establish co-operation between NSAs and NCBs in the EEA for the exchange of information to support NCBs in their assessment of the compliance of NB-PSPs with requirements for granting access to central bank-operated payment systems in the EU

establish procedures in a cross-border scenario for the NCB operating the payment system in the host member state to notify the NSA of the home member state about the NB-PSP's application and the NCB's decision regarding its participation

harmonise the processes and procedures across the EEA for the exchange of information between NSAs and NCBs, by specifying the types of information to be shared, the timing and means of exchange.

To facilitate communication and exchange of information, all NSAs and NCBs will designate single points of contact and notify them to the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Central Bank (ECB). A standardised notification form for the exchange of information is set out in Annex 1 to the MoU.

The MoU comes into effect on the day following the date on which it was signed by the representatives of each authority.

AI

FATF horizon scan on AI and deepfakes

On 22 December 2025, the FATF published a horizon scan of current and potential Artificial Intelligence (AI) related risks and trends relevant to AML/CTF/CPF compliance.

Recommendations for best practice for enhancement of deep fake detection include the adoption of technological and support tools capable of identifying inconsistencies in video and audio content, enhancing multi layered verification, training for compliance teams working closely with technological service providers, and integrating AI into CDD, transaction monitoring, and investigative workflows.

Key indicators to monitor to assist in the detection of deepfakes in financial activity include suspicious patterns such as co-ordinated activity, rapid transactions to newly opened accounts, and immediate fund withdrawals following deposits. FIUs also monitor for incoherence, such as mismatches between IP addresses and customer profiles or use of a same device by different counterparts and unusually high transaction volumes.

Part two widens the scan to consider other emerging AI risks and trends, providing an overview of potential future risks for AML compliance presented by generative AI, discriminative/predictive AI, and fully automated laundering pipelines operated by AI agents.

EBA's AI Act mapping exercise outcomes published

On 17 December 2025, the EBA published a letter sent to the European Commission detailing the outcome of its mapping exercise on the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act).

The exercise focused on mapping the requirements involving high-risk AI systems under the AI Act against relevant provisions in EU banking and payments sectoral frameworks. In particular, the mapping exercise aimed at identifying and assessing areas of interaction between the AI Act and the EU sectoral legislation.

The outcomes of the mapping exercise are:

The AI Act recognises overlaps between some requirements on high-risk AI systems and EU financial sector law, with targeted derogations and synergies envisaged for such requirements.

The AI Act does not envisage targeted derogations or synergies for other requirements on high-risk AI systems, including human oversight, data governance and cyber security, for which the EBA has found that the EU financial services law already includes a wide range of requirements. Notable examples of existing sufficient requirements includes the extensive coverage of cyber security and business continuity requirements within the EU Digital Operational Resilience Regulation (DORA) framework as required in the AI Act. Additionally, the EBA noted that CRR/CRD requirements already provide a comprehensive and technology-neutral governance and risk management framework that can be leveraged upon when supervising the use of AI tools.

The EBA concludes that the provisions included in the Annex to the letter provide a comprehensive overview of how EU financial services law already address relevant AI Act requirements.

EFAMA launches new and improved AI assessment tool

On 11 December 2025, The European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA) launched version 2 of its AI System Assessment Tool. The template assists firms in their assessment of AI use cases in line with the EU AI Act.

Updates to the tool include:

The introduction of a 'DORA-lite' version to help document and assess third party provided AI systems.

The introduction of enhanced functionalities and expanded data fields, focused on a more advanced analysis of business risks, technology considerations and internal governance.

A full copy of updated AI System Assessment Tool can be requested here.

EFAMA has published tutorial videos (Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3) to complement the AI-system Assessment Tool.

Operational resilience

ESAs advise on whether statutory auditors should be subject to DORA

On 17 December 2025, the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) published a joint report (dated 4 December 2025) (Report) to the European Commission advising on whether statutory auditors should be subject to the EU Digital Operational Resilience Regulation (DORA).

The implications of bringing statutory auditors and audit firms within the scope of DORA identified in the Report are:

Market perspective. Inclusion of statutory auditors and audit firms in the scope of DORA could raise fixed costs and reinforce concentration, limiting audit choice and conflicting with competition and administrative burden reduction objectives.

Auditees’ perspective. Extending DORA requirements to auditors could increase audit fees, with the added value of higher resilience safeguards unlikely to outweigh the cost impact for the audited entities.

Supervisory perspective. National audit oversight authorities would require significant training to supervise DORA compliance.

Implementation & governance perspective. Extending DORA would require adjustments to ICT-incident reporting flows, TLPT authority designation and the Oversight Framework.

Co-operation between authorities. Extending DORA requirements to auditors would raise questions on how to include the auditors’ supervisory authority within the ESAs decision making process.

Inclusion of service providers in the scope of DORA. Unlike many other essential service providers, auditors would be regulated under DORA while similar non-regulated providers would not, raising consistency concerns.

The Report concludes that the identified implications of the application of DORA to the statutory auditors and audit firms outweighs the potential benefits, and therefore, statutory auditors and audit firms should not be included within the scope of DORA at this stage.

Financial crime

FCA fines Nationwide Building Society for financial crime failings

On 11 December 2025, the FCA published the final notice issued to Nationwide Building Society (Nationwide), imposing a fine totalling £44,078,500 for inadequate financial crime systems and controls.

Between October 2016 and July 2021, a number of deficiencies were identified in Nationwide's AML monitoring systems and controls. In particular:

Weaknesses in Nationwide's AML systems and controls had a material impact on its ability to effectively monitor customer relationships. The systems for refreshing customer due diligence and carrying out customer risk assessment were ineffective for all personal current account customers.

Aside from customers already assessed as high risk, and in breach of its own policies, Nationwide had no process for undertaking either periodic or event-driven reviews of a substantial proportion of its customer relationships.

Nationwide was aware that some customers were using personal accounts for business activity, in breach of its terms and conditions. However, it did not offer business current accounts for SMEs at that time so did not have the right processes in place to manage financial crime risks from business activity.

Receipt of Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (JRS) funds into a personal current account is a strong indicator of business use. In total 33,678 JRS payments totalling £64.6 million were paid into 5,191 personal accounts at Nationwide. In one case, Nationwide failed to identify, despite opportunities, a customer using personal current accounts to receive fraudulent JRS payments. The customer received 24 payments totalling £27.3 million over 13 months, with £26.01 million of this deposited over eight days. HMRC recovered £26.5 million but approximately £800,000 remains unrecovered.

Nationwide progressed or implemented a number of workstreams aimed at remediating or uplifting weaknesses in AML monitoring deficiencies, including through an ongoing project aimed at ensuring compliance with the MLRs 2017. However, these workstreams did not address the weaknesses in a sufficiently effective or timely manner.

The FCA found that Nationwide had breached Principle 3, and SYSC rules 6.1.1R and 6.3.1R.

The fine was subject to a 30% stage 1 discount from £62,969,297, pursuant to the FCA's executive settlement procedures.

HM Treasury Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Supervision Report 2024-25

On 8 December 2025, HM Treasury (HMT) published its annual report on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing supervision.

Key updates in the report include:

Supervisory consolidation. Following analysis of consultation evidence, the government has decided to make the FCA the AML/CTF supervisor for professional services firms. A further consultation on the proposed framework for FCA supervision closed on 24 December 2025 (see our December 2025 and November 2025 updates for further detail).

FATF assessment preparation. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has begun its fifth round of assessments of global efforts to tackle money laundering, and terrorist and proliferation financing. As part of this, the UK will undergo an in-depth evaluation by its peers, culminating in a Mutual Evaluation Report, which will be published in 2028.

Notable supervisory statistics for the 2024/25 period include:

Registration activity. A total of 12,888 applications from businesses for AML/CTF supervision were received with 933 of those rejected.

Risk categorisation. Approximately 9% of the supervised population were categorised as high-risk. This is broadly in line with prior years of 2023-24 (9%) and 2022-23 (10%).

Direct supervision activity. There were a total of 7,991 direct supervision actions (desk-based reviews and onsite visits) conducted across all 25 supervisors. This represents 8% of supervised firms being subject to direct supervision action in 2024-25, compared to 10% in 2023-24.

OpenAI has selected SB Energy to construct and manage its 1.2GW data centre in Milam County, Texas, which was previously announced.
In addition to providing dedicated facilities for OpenAI, SB Energy is developing several multi-gigawatt data centre campuses across the region.
The structure of the partnership involves a non-exclusive preferred agreement among OpenAI, SoftBank Group, and SB Energy to create a new model for data centre construction.
OpenAI co-founder and president Greg Brockman said: “Partnering with SB Energy brings together their strength in data centre infrastructure, and energy development and OpenAI’s deep domain expertise in data centre engineering.","SoftBank Group and OpenAI are making a significant bet on the future of AI infrastructure, committing a combined $1bn investment into SB Energy as they partner to develop next-generation AI data centres in the US.

The move comes as part of the Stargate Project announced in January 2025.

This direct capital infusion is designed to accelerate the expansion of data centre and energy infrastructure to meet surging demand for advanced AI computing power—a sector increasingly seen as foundational to future economic growth.

The investment builds upon a much broader, previously pledged $500bn commitment made public at the White House earlier this year.

OpenAI has selected SB Energy to construct and manage its 1.2GW data centre in Milam County, Texas, which was previously announced.

The site will serve as a central component of OpenAI’s infrastructure expansion plans.

In addition to providing dedicated facilities for OpenAI, SB Energy is developing several multi-gigawatt data centre campuses across the region.

Construction on these initial sites has commenced, with service dates expected from 2026 onwards.

The structure of the partnership involves a non-exclusive preferred agreement among OpenAI, SoftBank Group, and SB Energy to create a new model for data centre construction.

This model integrates OpenAI’s design specifications for first-party data centres with SB Energy’s experience in project execution and integrated energy supply to establish scalable infrastructure capable of supporting large-scale AI operations.

OpenAI co-founder and president Greg Brockman said: “Partnering with SB Energy brings together their strength in data centre infrastructure, and energy development and OpenAI’s deep domain expertise in data centre engineering.

“The result is a fast, reliable way to scale compute through large, highly optimised AI data centres.”

SB Energy’s Milam County project is forecasted to generate significant employment in the area during the construction phase.

The company states that it has designed the facility with measures intended to reduce water usage and plans to add new generating capacity dedicated to powering the site.

This approach seeks to address both operational needs and local grid stability.

To support its growing portfolio of data centres, SB Energy recently completed the acquisition of Studio 151, a company specialising in construction management, procurement, engineering, and operations across more than 20 previous data centre campuses.

The acquisition is intended to strengthen SB Energy’s ability to oversee complex projects internally as demand for data processing continues to rise.

SB Energy co-CEO Rich Hossfeld said: “SB Energy’s strategic partnership with OpenAI accelerates our delivery of advanced AI data centre campuses and associated energy infrastructure at the scale required to advance Stargate and secure America’s AI future.”

Earlier investment rounds have also contributed capital to support SB Energy’s growth trajectory.

In 2025, Ares Infrastructure Opportunities funds invested $800m in redeemable preferred equity, marking their third financing round with SB Energy since 2020.

As part of this expanded relationship, SB Energy will adopt OpenAI products internally by integrating APIs and deploying tools such as ChatGPT for employee use.",https://www.verdict.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/OpenAI.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 06:00:44.141794

The capability creates digital book entries on BNY's private, permissioned blockchain that mirror participating clients' existing demand deposit claims against the bank. Client balances continue to be recorded on the bank's traditional systems to maintain regulatory and reporting integrity.

The launch focuses initially on collateral and margin workflow use cases, with early participants including financial institutions and digital native firms. The bank said it aims to support rules-based, near real-time cash movements in the future to reduce settlement friction and enhance liquidity for institutional clients.

""As institutional markets move toward always on operating models, BNY is committed to innovating and helping define how cash moves across the modern financial system,"" Carolyn Weinberg, chief product and innovation officer at BNY, said in a statement.

The latest KPMG and Recruitment & Employment Confederation UK report on jobs, compiled by S&P Global, showed the permanent placements index slipped to 44.3 points in December from 45.5 in November, signalling a sharper contraction.

Any reading below 50 points indicates a month-on-month decline.

Temporary billings also fell for a second consecutive month, though at a milder pace. The temporary billings index edged down to 47.6 points from 48.8, pointing to a modest reduction in demand for short-term staff.

KPMG said firms continued to exercise caution on recruitment after a prolonged period of elevated cost pressures and global economic uncertainty.

""The jobs market at the end of 2025 was still signalling caution,"" said Jon Holt, group chief executive and UK senior partner at KPMG. He added that many companies were pausing hiring and relying more on temporary staff, with restraint likely to persist into the new year until confidence improves.

The survey showed permanent placements have now declined for 39 consecutive months, with recruiters linking December's sharper fall to weak business confidence and concerns around costs.

All monitored English regions saw declines in permanent hiring except the Midlands, where placements rose slightly for the first time since May.

Demand for staff also softened further. The total vacancies index slipped to 43.4 points in December from 43.9 in November, indicating a slightly quicker fall in vacancies at the end of the year.

KPMG and REC noted official data from the Office for National Statistics, which showed vacancies were broadly stable in the three months to November at 729,000, though still 8.3% below pre-pandemic levels.

The total staff availability index stood at 66.3 points in December, only marginally lower than November's 66.5, marking one of the strongest upturns in labour supply since the pandemic.

The permanent salaries index rose to its highest level in seven months, indicating a faster increase in starting salaries, though still below the long-run average.

Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment & Employment Confederation, said December data can be difficult to interpret but noted some tentative signs of stabilisation in the second half of 2025.

""With placements falling at a slower pace than the 2025 average in December there is some hope that we are seeing a December dip, rather than a change in the trend,"" he said.

The survey data were collected between December 4 and 17, covering responses from around 400 UK recruitment and employment consultancies.

Indonesia and Malaysia temporarily restrict Grok

Indonesia and Malaysia restricted access to the Grok over the weekend, making them the first countries to do so in response to the AI chatbot’s generation of sexual content.

The temporary block intends “to protect women, children, and the public from the risks of fake pornographic content generated using the artificial intelligence technology,"" said Meutya Hafid, Indonesia’s communication and digital affairs minister, in a statement.

Malaysia joined Indonesia in blocking the service, which is available through the social media service X as well as in a standalone app, until proper safeguards are implemented.

Elon Musk’s xAI was roundly denounced last week for allowing Grok users to generate undressed images of women and children.

On Friday, the company restricted image generation and alteration functions to paid subscribers.

The Southeast Asian nations weren’t the only countries to express concern about xAI’s practices. The Brits were unsparing about Grok’s missteps—U.K. tech secretary Liz Kendall called them “an insult and totally unacceptable”—and India wasn’t much kinder, ordering xAI to make changes and submit a report on them within 72 hours.

“Sorry for the inconvenience,” Grok posted on X about the national blocks. “xAI is actively working to address the issue. In the meantime, using a VPN might help bypass the restriction.” —AN

The Instagram breach that wasn’t (or was?)

A whole lot of Instagram users received a suspicious password reset email in recent days, suggesting that the Meta social media service was having cybersecurity issues.

Not true, the company said Saturday.

“We fixed an issue that let an external party request password reset emails for some people,” it wrote in a statement. “There was no breach of our systems and your Instagram accounts are secure.”

Phew, right?

Not so fast, one U.S. cybersecurity company says.

Malwarebytes insists that, in fact, cybercriminals have successfully stolen private data for 17.5 million Instagram accounts—physical addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, etc.—and made them “available for sale on the dark web.”

So what gives?

The word on the cyber street is that they’re both being truthful. Instagram may have indeed had a password reset email oopsie—but that has nothing to do with the very real data scrape (not breach!) in late 2024 that recently exposed users’ private information.

Keep your digital head on a swivel, folks. —AN

Walmart to add Wing to another 150 stores

Alphabet’s drone delivery service is spreading its wings a little wider.

Walmart and Wing said over the weekend that they would bring the latter’s on-demand drone delivery to an additional 150 Walmart stores beginning this year and running through 2027.

For the unfamiliar, Wing will bring many (but not all) items you’d find in a Walmart to your door in “as little as 30 minutes.”

Groceries or over-the-counter medicine, rain or shine—Wing will bring the goods. (Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these drones. OK, maybe a little snow will ground them after all.)

The companies currently operate their service in Atlanta and Dallas-Fort Worth. Seven months ago, they announced that they’d add drone delivery service in Charlotte, Houston, Orlando, and Tampa.

More U.S. metros are reportedly on tap, including Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Miami, and St. Louis. Once the expansion is complete, Wing says it will deliver Walmart goods from some 270 stores and “serve about 10% of the U.S. population.” —AN

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

Health and wellness queries already account for a significant portion of ChatGPT usage. According to OpenAI, more than 230 million people globally ask health-related questions on the platform each week, based on de-identified conversation analysis. ChatGPT Health builds on this usage by enabling users to connect medical records and wellness applications to provide additional context for responses.

The feature allows users to securely link data from medical records and select wellness apps, including Apple Health, Function, and MyFitnessPal. With these connections, ChatGPT Health can assist users in interpreting test results, preparing for medical appointments, reviewing diet and fitness patterns, and understanding insurance options. OpenAI states that the service is intended to support everyday health understanding and is not designed for diagnosis or treatment.

ChatGPT Health operates as a separate space within ChatGPT, with additional privacy and security controls designed for sensitive health data. Health conversations, connected apps, and files are stored independently from other chats, with separate memory systems intended to keep health-related information compartmentalized. While ChatGPT may use limited contextual information from non-health conversations to improve relevance, OpenAI says health information does not flow back into standard chats.

OpenAI adds that conversations within ChatGPT Health are not used to train its foundation models. Users can view or delete health-related memories through the settings interface. If a health-related discussion begins outside the Health environment, users may be prompted to move the conversation into ChatGPT Health to access the additional protections.

The company says the feature was developed in collaboration with physicians across multiple regions. Over a two-year period, more than 260 physicians from 60 countries and a range of specialties reviewed AI-generated responses, providing feedback on more than 600,000 outputs across 30 areas of focus. This input informed how the system communicates health information, including when to recommend follow-up with healthcare professionals.

ChatGPT Health is being rolled out initially to a limited group of users for feedback and refinement. Users on Free, Go, Plus, and Pro plans outside the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom are eligible to join a waitlist. OpenAI says it plans to expand access and make the feature broadly available on web and iOS in the coming weeks. Some medical record integrations and third-party apps are currently available only in the United States, and Apple Health integration requires iOS.",https://cioafrica.co/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/51f176-20250930-a-smartphone-displaying-the-logo-of-the-artificial-intelligence-openai-research-laboratory-2000.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 05:00:56.768006

Trelleborg AB does not ship phones, EVs or cloud subscriptions. Instead, it sits quietly inside the products and infrastructure that define modern industry: electric cars, offshore wind turbines, commercial aircraft, biopharma manufacturing, mining equipment and advanced logistics systems. Whenever something has to be sealed, insulated, damped, protected or made to last under brutal operating conditions, there is a good chance a Trelleborg solution is somewhere in the bill of materials.

This Swedish engineering group has spent decades turning advanced polymers and engineered materials into mission?critical components. Today, Trelleborg AB is effectively a global platform for sealing solutions, engineered systems and industrial protection – a position it has sharpened after divesting its conventional tyre business and aggressively doubling down on higher?margin, knowledge?intensive niches.

The strategic bet: in a world racing to electrify transport, build renewable energy capacity, automate factories and harden infrastructure, demand for reliable, high?performance sealing and polymer solutions will grow faster than the underlying industries. Trelleborg AB wants to own that layer – and monetize it with deep application know?how rather than simply selling commodity rubber parts.

Get all details on Trelleborg AB here

Inside the Flagship: Trelleborg AB

Trelleborg AB today is organized around specialized business areas that translate polymer science into tailored, application?specific systems. The company’s core franchise is no longer tyres but advanced sealing solutions, engineered materials and protective systems that enable demanding customers to hit tougher regulations, safety standards and efficiency targets.

On the product level, Trelleborg AB’s flagship offering is not a single SKU but an ecosystem of high?performance solutions that cluster around three themes: sealing, damping and protection. Within that, several product families stand out as strategic flagships.

1. Trelleborg Sealing Solutions – from EV battery packs to biopharma lines

Trelleborg Sealing Solutions is arguably the crown jewel. It designs and manufactures precision seals, gaskets, O?rings, rotary seals and engineered polymer components that must survive extremes of pressure, temperature, friction and chemical exposure. These are the tiny parts that decide whether a hydraulic system leaks, a wind turbine gearbox lasts, or a drug production line avoids contamination.

Key features across this portfolio include:

Advanced material science: Proprietary elastomers, thermoplastics and composite materials tailored for conditions such as deep?sea pressure, aggressive chemicals, sterilization cycles or ultra?low friction environments.

Application?specific design: Seals and components are not sold as generic catalog items; they are co?designed with OEMs in sectors like aerospace, medical technology, food and beverage, and energy. The IP is as much in the application engineering as in the material recipe.

Digital design tools: Trelleborg offers online calculators, material selectors and design simulators to engineers, embedding itself early in the design cycle. This consultative model raises switching costs and helps the company shape specifications.

Where this becomes especially visible is in fast?growing segments such as electric vehicles and biopharma. In EVs, Trelleborg AB provides seals for battery housings, thermal management systems and drivetrains where reliability and fire safety are non?negotiable. In life sciences and biopharma, its high?purity, regulatory?compliant seals and tubing support sterile processing and clean?in?place systems.

2. Trelleborg Industrial Solutions – infrastructure, offshore and energy

Trelleborg’s industrial and marine solutions bring the same polymer sophistication to large?scale infrastructure and energy projects. Here, the product set ranges from marine fenders and docking systems to tunnel gaskets, offshore oil and gas solutions and vibration isolation systems for heavy equipment.

Typical flagship?grade offerings include:

Marine fender systems: Engineered rubber fenders and docking solutions that protect ports and vessels, optimized for energy absorption, durability and environmental performance.

Tunnel sealing and water management: Gaskets and waterproofing systems for metro, road and water tunnels, designed to last decades under varying pressure and chemical exposure.

Vibration and noise control: Anti?vibration mounts, bearings and isolation systems that protect buildings, machines and vehicles from wear and structural damage.

These products benefit directly from the global push for resilient infrastructure and renewable energy. Offshore wind jacket foundations, for instance, require complex sealing and protection solutions that can endure constant motion, saltwater and high mechanical loads. That is where Trelleborg’s materials lab and field experience converge.

3. New frontiers: electrification, sustainability and lightweighting

What makes Trelleborg AB particularly relevant right now is how deliberately it has pivoted its product roadmap toward electrification, sustainability and lightweighting – three mega?trends that cut across almost every heavy industry.

Across its portfolio, the company is investing in:

Low?friction, energy?efficient seals that cut power losses in hydraulic systems and drivetrains.

Lightweight composite and polymer components that replace metal in aerospace and automotive, improving range and fuel efficiency.

Environmentally improved materials, reducing volatile organic compounds (VOCs), increasing recyclability and achieving compliance with ever?stricter environmental regulation.

Solutions for e?mobility and renewable energy, where sealing and insulation performance determine safety, uptime and warranty risk.

Put simply, Trelleborg AB is transforming from an industrial supplier of rubber parts into a knowledge?heavy technology company built on materials science, application engineering and regulatory expertise. That combination has become its de?facto unique selling proposition – and it is what makes the business much harder to disrupt than its humble components suggest.

Market Rivals: Trelleborg Aktie vs. The Competition

In sealing, vibration control and advanced polymer components, Trelleborg faces a set of highly capable rivals. Unlike in consumer tech, the competition here is fragmented, specialized and heavily influenced by regional strengths and long?term customer relationships.

Three competitor ecosystems stand out: Freudenberg Sealing Technologies, Parker Hannifin’s Engineered Materials and SKF’s sealing and polymer solutions portfolio.

Freudenberg Sealing Technologies vs. Trelleborg Sealing Solutions

Compared directly to Freudenberg Sealing Technologies, Trelleborg Sealing Solutions competes for many of the same OEM and Tier?1 automotive, industrial and energy accounts. Freudenberg brings deep expertise in elastomer technology and a strong presence in automotive powertrain and industrial seals.

Strengths of Freudenberg Sealing Technologies:

Longstanding relationships with global automotive OEMs.

Strong presence in radial shaft seals and powertrain components.

Broad geographic manufacturing base.

Where Trelleborg AB pushes back:

Broader penetration outside classic internal combustion platforms, especially in electric vehicles, aerospace and life sciences.

Stronger emphasis on co?engineering and digital design tools for customers.

A more focused corporate profile after decoupling from the tyre business, making sealing a centerpiece rather than one unit among many.

In non?automotive markets – for example in biopharma processing or offshore wind – Trelleborg often looks less like a direct head?to?head rival and more like a specialist partner that brings specific materials and application expertise.

Parker Hannifin Engineered Materials vs. Trelleborg AB

Parker Hannifin, through its Engineered Materials Group and Parker Seals, is another heavyweight in high?performance sealing and polymer solutions. Its Parker Sealing & Shielding product family competes directly with Trelleborg Sealing Solutions in aerospace, defense, semiconductors and industrial automation.

Compared directly to Parker Seals and Engineered Materials, Trelleborg AB usually operates with a leaner, more focused industrial portfolio. Parker brings system?level breadth: it not only sells seals but also fluid connectors, motion systems and complete subsystems.

Parker’s advantages include:

Deep integration with hydraulic, pneumatic and motion control systems.

Ability to bundle components into larger subsystem contracts.

Strong footprint in North American industrial markets.

Trelleborg AB’s counterpositioning:

A more specialized focus on materials science and sealing, often giving it an edge in extreme environment applications.

Lower apparent complexity for customers who want best?in?class components rather than fully integrated systems.

Fewer internal conflicts when collaborating with third?party system integrators, since Trelleborg is not trying to own the entire system stack.

In practice, large OEMs and infrastructure developers often dual?source between Parker and Trelleborg, but Trelleborg can win on the basis of niche technical performance, lifecycle cost and customization.

SKF Sealing Solutions vs. Trelleborg AB

SKF is best known for bearings, but its SKF Sealing Solutions and engineered polymer offerings directly challenge Trelleborg AB in rotating equipment, industrial machinery and heavy vehicles.

Compared directly to SKF Sealing Solutions, Trelleborg AB diverges sharply in strategy:

SKF uses seals to complement its bearing systems, optimizing performance of the full mechanical assembly.

Trelleborg offers sealing solutions as a standalone, platform?level business that spans many more applications beyond rotating equipment.

In markets such as wind turbines or heavy industrial machinery, SKF might present a highly integrated bearings?plus?seals package, while Trelleborg positions its offer as vendor?neutral, focusing purely on maximizing sealing performance, uptime and maintenance intervals.

The net effect: where competitors often embed sealing inside broader mechanical or motion portfolios, Trelleborg AB is deliberately carving out a specialist identity as a high?end polymer technology partner across multiple industries.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Trelleborg AB’s real product is not any single gasket or fender, but a defensible combination of advanced materials, application expertise, global reach and niche dominance. Several competitive advantages stand out.

1. Deep specialization in demanding niches

While many industrial giants chase volume, Trelleborg AB systematically targets segments where failure is catastrophically expensive and reliability is priced at a premium: offshore energy, aerospace, medical and biopharma equipment, tunneling and high?end industrial automation.

In those spaces, the purchasing logic is not “who is cheapest” but “who understands my application, can co?design with my engineers and will still support this platform ten years from now.” Trelleborg’s long history in sealing and protection, combined with sector?specific teams, gives it an edge in these conversations.

2. Materials science as core IP

Many competitors can mold rubber or machine plastics. The differentiation for Trelleborg AB lies in the chemistry: proprietary elastomer and thermoplastic formulations, composite structures and surface treatments tuned to specific combinations of temperature, pressure, friction and chemical exposure.

This makes the performance of Trelleborg AB’s solutions difficult to replicate. Even if a rival matches the geometry of a seal, it may not be able to match lifetime performance, friction behavior or compatibility with specific process media. Over thousands of operating hours, that difference translates into fewer leaks, less downtime and longer maintenance intervals – a compelling value proposition for operators.

3. Embedded early in the design cycle

By offering design tools, simulation support and co?engineering capabilities, Trelleborg AB gets involved early in customer projects. Once the seal or polymer solution is “designed in,” switching suppliers becomes expensive, risky and time?consuming for the OEM.

This early engagement model is one of the most powerful competitive moats in the B2B components world. It also allows Trelleborg to shape specifications and nudge customers toward higher?value, higher?margin solutions that only a handful of vendors can deliver.

4. Sustainability aligned with customer pressure

Industrial buyers are under intense pressure to decarbonize and reduce environmental impact. Trelleborg AB’s move toward lighter, energy?efficient and more environmentally friendly materials is not simply brand polish; it is becoming a technical requirement to qualify for future projects.

By converting sustainability from a compliance checkbox into a product feature – better lifecycle performance, reduced energy use, fewer leaks and failures – Trelleborg can command premium pricing and win tenders where regulation and ESG metrics matter as much as upfront cost.

5. A cleaner, more focused corporate story

After exiting the traditional tyre business, Trelleborg AB has a tighter strategic narrative: a focused engineered?polymers company built around sealing, damping and protection. Internally, that frees up capital and management attention to invest in the technology and markets that matter most. Externally, it makes it easier for customers and investors to understand what the company is about – and why its margins should look more like a technology?driven industrial than a commodity manufacturer.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

Trelleborg Aktie (ISIN SE0000114837) reflects this shift from broad industrial conglomerate to focused technology?enabled niche leader. As of the latest available market data checked via multiple financial sources (including major real?time quote platforms), Trelleborg AB trades on the Stockholm exchange with a valuation profile that increasingly prices in its higher?margin, specialist positioning.

At the time of the most recent quotes retrieved, the stock was trading around its current range with data consistent across at least two independent financial providers. Where intraday data was not available, pricing referred to the last closing level, clearly marked as such by those sources. That price embeds the market’s view on how successfully Trelleborg AB is transforming its portfolio and executing on growth in areas such as sealing solutions for electrification, offshore energy protection systems and life?science processing equipment.

The relationship between the product strategy and Trelleborg Aktie’s performance runs along three key axes:

Margin mix improvement: As the company exits lower?margin, more commoditized segments and invests in advanced sealing and engineered systems, its product mix tilts toward offerings where materials science and application knowledge justify higher gross margins. That supports a valuation closer to technology?driven industrial peers than to basic materials players.

Exposure to structural growth sectors: By aligning product development with long?term themes – such as electric mobility, renewable energy infrastructure, biopharma and high?spec industrial automation – Trelleborg AB is effectively decoupling part of its growth profile from the classic cyclicality of heavy industry. Investors buying Trelleborg Aktie are paying not just for GDP?linked volume but for structurally expanding end markets.

Resilience via niche dominance: Because its products are deeply embedded and often specified into critical systems, Trelleborg enjoys relatively sticky revenue and strong pricing power. Those dynamics tend to support more stable free cash flow across cycles – a feature that equity markets reward with higher multiples when the strategy is credible and execution consistent.

In analyst commentary and investor materials, Trelleborg AB consistently highlights its focus on “selected segments” where it can achieve leading positions globally. That approach is directly tied to the performance of Trelleborg Aktie: each incremental win in a specialized sealing or protection niche tends to be disproportionately accretive to profitability and perceived quality of earnings.

There is still execution risk. The transition away from traditional tyre and commodity products puts more pressure on R&D, on maintaining talent in materials science and on consistently winning high?specification projects against formidable competitors like Freudenberg, Parker Hannifin and SKF. But if Trelleborg AB continues to convert its polymer science and co?engineering capabilities into sticky, value?added product lines, the stock remains tightly coupled to a story of gradual multiple expansion and disciplined, niche?driven growth.

Crucially, investors are not just buying cyclical exposure to industrial capex. They are buying a high?tech, materials?driven infrastructure layer that quietly sits under electric cars, offshore wind farms, metro tunnels and sterile manufacturing plants. That is the real product Trelleborg AB is building – and the reason its stock has increasingly been viewed through a technology?adjacent, rather than purely commodity?industrial, lens.

In an era where the most important technologies often disappear into the hardware and infrastructure we take for granted, Trelleborg AB is a reminder that the future is not only coded in software. Sometimes it is molded, extruded and vulcanized into silent components that never draw attention – unless they fail. Trelleborg’s business, and the trajectory of Trelleborg Aktie, is built on ensuring they do not.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405018_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 05:01:12.173593

If Rubin and physical AI themes have you thinking beyond a single name, this could be a good moment to scan other that sit across the broader AI story.

So with Rubin in full swing, partnerships across autos, industrials and media, and NVIDIA trading at $184.86 with mixed recent returns but very large 5 year gains, are you looking at an overlooked entry point or a market that has already priced in years of AI growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 46.4% Undervalued

According to RobertoAllende, the narrative fair value for NVIDIA at US$345.07 sits well above the last close of US$184.86, setting up a wide valuation gap.

NVIDIA's latest quarterly earnings report, released this week, showcases a company that has successfully navigated one of the most challenging questions in modern tech investing: How do you justify a multi-trillion dollar valuation in an era of AI hype? The answer, it turns out, lies in execution. Record Performance Driven by Blackwell NVIDIA reported Q3 FY2026 revenue of $57.0 billion, marking a 62% increase year-over-year and a 22% sequential gain from the previous quarter. The company's Data Center segment, which now represents the overwhelming majority of revenue, reached $51.2 billion, up 66% from a year ago.

Want to see what is behind that valuation gap? The narrative leans on heavyweight revenue, thick margins and a future earnings multiple that assumes sustained high growth.

Result: Fair Value of US$345.07 (UNDERVALUED)

However, this hinges on hyperscalers keeping AI spending high, and on competitors and custom chips not eating into NVIDIA’s margins or customer concentration.

Another View: Our DCF Says Overvalued

RobertoAllende’s narrative points to a fair value of US$345.07 and calls NVIDIA undervalued, but our DCF model lands in a very different place. With a fair value estimate of US$162.43 versus the current US$184.86, it flags the shares as overvalued instead.

That gap suggests the market might already be baking in a lot of future AI success. The question for you is simple: do you lean toward the richer narrative assumptions or the more restrained cash flow math?

But here’s the real talk: is Uber just a daily life essential... or a sneaky stock you should’ve bought yesterday?

Because while you were doomscrolling, Uber’s share price has been on a roller coaster that looks like a meme stock – big rallies, brutal dips, and nonstop headlines around profitability, regulation, and AI-powered everything.

You already know the app. But do you actually know what’s happening with the stock behind it – Uber Technologies Aktie, ISIN US90353T1007?

Let’s break it down: hype, numbers, rivals, and whether Uber is a cop or drop for your portfolio.

The Hype is Real: Uber Technologies on TikTok and Beyond

Uber is more than a ride now – it’s a full-on content category. Creators are dropping:

“I drove Uber for a week – here’s how much I actually made.”

“I only ate Uber Eats for 7 days – my wallet cried.”

Hot takes on whether Uber is the next big tech stock or a burnout waiting to happen.

On TikTok and YouTube, Uber content is all over:

Drivers flexing payouts, or exposing how bad peak hours really are.

Riders ranting about surge prices and celebrating cheap off-peak rides.

Finance creators breaking down whether Uber stock is a long-term hold or a red flag.

The clout level? High. This isn’t some quiet boomer stock. It’s a name everyone recognizes, uses, and argues about. Which is exactly why it keeps trending every time the share price pops or drops.

The Business Side: Uber Technologies Aktie

Time for money talk. You know the brand. But what about the stock – Uber Technologies, ISIN US90353T1007?

Stock data status: Real-time quotes require live market access. As of the latest available public data from major finance portals, markets may be closed or prices may be delayed. That means you should always confirm the current price yourself before making a move.

Here’s how to check it in two taps:

Search for “Uber stock” or ticker UBER on Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or your broker app.

Look for the latest quote, the day’s move in %, and the 52-week range to see if you’re buying high or catching a dip.

Why are investors locked in on this name?

Massive scale: Rides, food, grocery, and freight – Uber is basically a logistics layer on your phone.

Profitability push: After years of burning cash, it’s been pivoting hard toward actually making money instead of just chasing growth.

Brand power: It’s a verb. That kind of mindshare is rare – and Wall Street knows it.

The real flex: Uber has shifted its story from “we’ll make money one day” to “we’re working on efficiency and margins now.” That switch is what usually turns a hype stock into a serious long-term play – if they deliver.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

So is Uber a game-changer or overhyped? Let’s hit the three big pillars that actually matter.

1. The Product You Touch Every Week

Uber is no longer just “tap car, get car.” You’ve got:

Uber Rides: Classic car, UberX, Uber Comfort, shared rides where available.

Uber Eats: Food, snacks, grocery, convenience runs when you don’t want to move.

Memberships and passes: Sub-style features with fee cuts and perks for power users.

For you as a user, it’s a must-have app. When your train gets canceled or you’re starving at midnight, you’re not opening a spreadsheet – you’re opening Uber. That kind of dependence is exactly what makes investors look twice.

2. The Money Machine Under the Hood

Is Uber “worth the hype” financially? That depends on what you’re chasing.

If you want instant stability, Uber is still not a sleepy dividend stock. It’s a high-energy, high-sensitivity tech play.

If you’re okay with volatility, Uber is more like a long ride with surge pricing: big moves up, big moves down, and serious reward if you catch the timing.

The company has been leaning hard into profitability and efficiency, cutting losses in some regions and doubling down where it actually wins.

Real talk: this is not a “set it and forget it” utility stock. It’s a story stock that’s aging into something more mature – and that transition is where traders either make bank or panic sell.

3. The Risk Side Nobody Likes to Talk About

Uber is powerful, but not invincible. Big risks:

Regulation drama: Cities and countries keep fighting over how to classify drivers, what benefits they get, and how gig work should be regulated.

Driver supply: If drivers bounce to better-paying gigs, wait times and prices go up – and users complain fast.

Competition pressure: Other apps want the same riders, same restaurants, same drivers – and they’re not shy about discounts.

If regulators go hard, costs go up. If competition gets brutal, promos eat into profits. That tug-of-war is baked into the stock price – and it’s why you see those wild swings on big news days.

Uber Technologies vs. The Competition

Let’s talk rivalry. Ride-hailing and delivery is a clout war, and Uber is in the middle of it.

Uber vs. Lyft (Rides)

Brand: Uber is the global name. Lyft is more US-focused, more niche.

Scale: Uber wins. More cities, more drivers, more use cases.

App usage: In a lot of markets, people only have Uber installed. That’s brutal for rivals.

Clout winner on rides: Uber. Bigger, louder, more embedded in your life.

Uber Eats vs. DoorDash and Others (Food & Grocery)

DoorDash is huge in food delivery in the US, especially in the suburbs.

Uber Eats leans into urban zones, cross-sells users from rides, and adds grocery and convenience.

Both blast out promos, free deliveries, and subs to get you hooked.

Who wins? Depends on where you live, but in pure brand-layer terms, Uber has a secret weapon: one app for move me and feed me. That ecosystem play hits different.

The Real Battle: Super-App Status

Uber is quietly chasing “super-app” energy in the West – rides, food, packages, maybe more over time. While in some regions other platforms dominate, Uber is one of the few US-listed names trying to be your default logistics app.

In the clout war, Uber wins on:

Name recognition

Global reach

Everyday utility

The trade-off? With great clout comes great scrutiny – from regulators, drivers, and investors who now expect real profits, not just vibes.

Real Talk: Price, Performance, and Hype

You’re probably wondering: “Okay, but is it a no-brainer at the current price?”

Here’s how to think about it, without needing a finance degree:

Check the chart: Look at 1-year and 5-year performance of UBER on any finance app. If it’s near the top of its 52-week range, you may be paying up for good news already priced in.

Look for pullbacks: When the stock drops on market-wide selloffs but the business story hasn’t changed much, that’s when long-term believers usually get interested.

Match it to your risk level: If you freak out on every 5% dip, this might not be your comfort stock.

Uber is not some hidden gem no one’s heard of. It’s a giant, visible, over-analyzed name. That means less “secret upside” but more liquidity and attention. News hits fast. Price moves fast. You have to be ready for that.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

So, is Uber Technologies a must-have or an overhyped relic from the first wave of app unicorns?

If you’re a user, Uber is basically a game-changer in daily life. It gives you time back, bails you out when transit fails, and lets you turn hunger into a notification. On pure lifestyle impact? Definitely worth the hype.

If you’re an investor, it’s more nuanced:

Uber has serious brand power and scale.

It is pushing toward better margins and profitability, which is a major unlock for long-term value.

But it comes with real risk: regulation, competition, and those attention-grabbing price swings.

Cop or drop?

Cop (for some): If you’re into big, recognizable tech names, can handle volatility, and think Uber will stay the default app for rides and food for years, it can be a long-term hold candidate.

Drop (or avoid): If you hate watching your portfolio swing or you want boring, predictable stocks, Uber is probably too extra for your taste.

Bottom line: Uber Technologies is still worth the hype as a business, but not a blind no-brainer at any price. Treat it like what it is – a powerful, world-changing platform that still lives in the high-risk, high-drama side of the market.

Obviously brands want the shine of legitimate Hollywood entertainment.
Zac Ryder, cofounder and co-chief creative officer of Modern Arts, says this feature is going to be a game-changer for brand entertainment.
LVMH’s entertainment division, 22 Montaigne, for example, is developing projects with Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine, as well as Ron Howard and Brian Grazer’s Imagine Entertainment.
Many believed brand entertainment was just a glorified long commercial.","We’ve had branded entertainment since Procter & Gamble invented soap operas back in the 1930s. But today, brands are forced to diversify the ways in which they gain and hold our attention. It’s no longer as viable or effective to depend on traditional paid media tools.

Innovative marketers are increasingly investing in content and experiences that attract and engage audiences rather than interrupt and annoy them. And the shift is driving results. Brands of all stripes talk about “brand entertainment,” but it’s the exceptions that truly create actual entertainment.

I’ve spent a lot of time this past year writing and talking on the Brand New World podcast about the variety of ways different brands are doing this right. From WhatsApp working with Modern Arts on a Netflix doc about the Mercedes F1 team, to Dick’s Sporting Goods formally establishing an internal entertainment studio that has already won Sports Emmys for We Could Be King in 2015 and The Turnaround in 2024, to the unprecedented deal struck between AB InBev and Netflix. The latter, signed in November, puts the global brewer’s major beer brands front and center in Netflix’s push into live sports, as well as giving it early access to placement and integration in Netflix shows and movies.

Obviously brands want the shine of legitimate Hollywood entertainment. But production costs and other financial pressures have made working with brands a much more attractive prospect for Hollywood too. So I wanted to check back in with the executives behind some of these projects to find out what they anticipate the biggest developments will be in 2026.

The most significant drivers of these developments stem from the evolving platforms, fueled by audience preferences and behavior, as well as the economic realities driving brands and Hollywood into each other’s arms more often and in more varied ways.

Marketers—and audiences, for that matter—are going to see some big changes coming to screens, both big and small. Read on for what to expect.

Shifting platforms

Meta announced on December 16 that it would begin testing its Instagram for TV app in the U.S. on Amazon Fire TV streaming devices. Zac Ryder, cofounder and co-chief creative officer of Modern Arts, says this feature is going to be a game-changer for brand entertainment. Brands as varied as UPS, Bud Light, and Sephora have been building audiences on Instagram Reels and Stories, while other brands are jumping into the micro-drama trend of serialized, bite-size soap operas in vertical video.

Ryder says this shift means brand content on the platform will continue to look even more like entertainment, getting longer and more ambitious to better align with TV viewing behavior. Ultimately, this will further blur the lines between entertainment and social.

Ryder says that as a result we’ll start to see more big swings featuring A-list storytellers and talent this year. “This will be especially true for brands who are already very invested in IG and have spent years building their followers. And of course, if brands are going to start dropping more ambitious work on IG, they’ll drop it on YouTube as well,” he says. “In order to compete for brand dollars, streamers will need to become even better partners to brands, all of which will create even more energy in this space and raise the bar even higher.”

A growing number of people are watching YouTube (and soon, Instagram Reels) on their TVs. Meanwhile, streamers like Netflix and Disney+ are increasingly utilizing brand partnerships to keep subscriber prices competitive. Many of my sources believe these changing dynamics of how we watch and engage with entertainment will drive where brands can find the best opportunities.

“I suspect we’ll see more next-generation partnerships like those we’ve been involved with this past year, especially as the Warner Bros. thing sorts itself out,” says Jae Goodman, cofounder and CEO of Superconnector Studios. “I bet Skydance/Paramount, Disney, Amazon, Comcast/NBCU will all come to market with brands as true partners in surprising, innovative, mutually beneficial, and I bet very effective ways.”

A new strategy

Goodman helped broker the Netflix-AB InBev deal and has also helped giants like Nike and LVMH set up their entertainment strategies. He says the long-standing trajectory of how brands and Hollywood do business has fundamentally changed.

Typically, it’s TV networks and streamers selling ad space to media agencies, then creative agencies filling the order. Film studios and distributors sell partnerships to brands, then licensing and promotional agencies get creative with the intellectual property.

“Brands are now entering the market with real entertainment strategies,” Goodman says. “And brands are leading the conversation with entertainment entities by asking, ‘What if we wanted to achieve XYZ and then figure out the structure and cost?’ We refer to it as idea flow before deal flow.”

This past year, the Martin Agency worked with Subway Takes creator Kareem Rahma on “UPS Business Trips.” Martin’s chief brand officer, Elizabeth Paul, believes branded entertainment is growing up and moving from bloated bandwagons with hundreds of brand sponsors (see: Wicked) to fewer projects with a more focused audience.

UPS is a major brand that could easily jump on the blockbuster movie bandwagon or make a Super Bowl ad. Instead, “UPS Business Trips” was a relatively small, Subway Takes-inspired series in which Rahma and UPS drivers visit small-business customers. According to the agency, it had more than 100 million views across platforms, and generated 1,000% return on ad spend.

“For those who truly believe in the space, brand entertainment will stop being treated as a campaign format and start being managed as a portfolio,” says Paul, who suggests that the best brands will start thinking like studios, not marketing departments.

We’ve seen this most recently with Dick’s Sporting Goods’s new in-house studio division, Cookie Jar & a Dream Studios. Dick’s CMO Emily Silver told me back in September that this move will see the brand be more aggressive in the number of films and pieces of content it releases, as well as help the brand build more of a name for itself in the entertainment industry to attract different writers and projects.

“It gives us the opportunity to put a little more structure and framework around what content we want to produce and where we want to lean in to help build for the long term,” she said at the time.

New economics

The most significant factor in the pace of brand entertainment’s evolution is the business imperative from both sides to make the economics work. North American box office revenue for 2025 was more than 20% lower than pre-pandemic levels. And in the first half of 2025, major streamers ordered 24% fewer first-run and renewed scripted titles than the same period in 2024.

As production costs have skyrocketed, and the ability to get entertainment projects off the ground more difficult, Hollywood’s typically cool condescension toward marketers has thawed to the point of giddy embrace. Cynically, even if Hollywood sees brands as logo-plastered ATMs, brands see an opportunity to exploit this need for cash to do cool things that are actual entertainment.

“Last year, economic pressure forced marketers to be really choiceful with their media plans, which forced intentionality,” says Paul. “As brands got more selective, the most successful collaborations meant fewer swings with clearer creative intent. The result wasn’t louder brand entertainment, but more considered work—projects that respected fandom, embraced specificity, and trusted audiences to meet brands halfway.”

Paul cites the Martin Agency’s work on Bud Light’s Armchair Quarterback last year, a Netflix partnership starring Peyton Manning that parodies the second season of the streamer’s show Quarterback. Armchair Quarterback attracted more than 100 million social impressions, thanks in no small part to tapping into the fandom of Quarterback by working with the show, its producers—Manning’s Omaha Productions—and Netflix.

However, she reiterates that this can’t be a simple “exchange of relevance for cash. This is about forging true strategic partnerships that delight fans and move markets.”

Talent magnet

The relationship between Hollywood and brands has evolved significantly over the past year. Brand partnerships and content are not embarrassing for studios or streamers anymore, in part because of the aforementioned economics, but also because the quality is higher and the value is clear.

WhatsApp’s film The Seat, for example, cost about as much as it would to make and buy ad time for a 60-second commercial. But it also was high enough quality to stand on its own on Netflix. This is a virtuous cycle: The better the quality, the higher caliber of talent is attracted to subsequent projects, which in turn should continue to boost the caliber of these projects.

Ryder says a growing number of A-list showrunners, writers, directors, and creators have been reaching out to learn more about the brand world in hopes of finding a project to work on together.

LVMH’s entertainment division, 22 Montaigne, for example, is developing projects with Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine, as well as Ron Howard and Brian Grazer’s Imagine Entertainment.

“When we started making these kinds of brand projects 10 years ago, everyone on the talent side was so suspicious,” Ryder says. Many believed brand entertainment was just a glorified long commercial. That has changed as more high-quality films have dropped. “It’s a bit like a Michelin chef trying a killer food truck and realizing that could be a new outlet for their cooking,” he says. “There are just a lot more delicious food trucks out there now.”",https://fastcompanyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Branded-entertainment-will-just--scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 03:59:36.882686

BMO Capital downgraded Adobe from Outperform to Market Perform, citing increased competition in the creative market, particularly impacting smaller businesses, students, and freelancers.
Similarly, Jefferies downgraded Adobe from Buy to Hold due to competitive pressures from AI-enhanced alternatives targeting casual users.
KeyBanc also downgraded Adobe to Underweight, setting a price target of $310, following the company’s recent earnings report.
Additionally, BMO Capital adjusted its price target to $400 while maintaining an Outperform rating, acknowledging Adobe’s better-than-expected revenue performance.","Investing.com - Goldman Sachs has downgraded to a Sell rating from Buy, setting a price target of $290.00, which represents a potential 14% downside. This target stands in contrast to InvestingPro’s Fair Value assessment, which suggests Adobe may be undervalued at its current price of $333.95. The stock has experienced a 17.73% decline over the past year.

The rating change comes as Goldman Sachs analyst Gabriela Borges assumes coverage of the software company, applying a 15x P/E multiple to Adobe’s SNTM (Q5-Q8) earnings, representing approximately a 50% discount to peers with a median P/E multiple of 29x. Adobe currently trades at a P/E ratio of 19.96 with a notably low PEG ratio of 0.56, according to InvestingPro data, which tracks over 1,400 US equities with comprehensive Pro Research Reports.

Goldman Sachs notes that Adobe offers lower revenue growth of 10% NTM compared to peers at 11% and lower EPS growth of 10% NTM versus peers at 18%, justifying the bottom quartile PEG valuation. InvestingPro data confirms Adobe’s revenue growth at 10.53% for the last twelve months, while the company maintains impressive gross profit margins of 89.27%.

The investment bank’s analysis considers a broad comparison group of technology companies with over $100 billion in enterprise value that have similar business models and financial profiles to Adobe and can be valued on GAAP P/E.

Goldman Sachs specifically highlights concerns about potential scenarios where Adobe’s EPS growth could face further pressure if the company increases investments in AI initiatives, or if revenue growth falls below 10% due to reduced pricing leverage amid proliferation of AI tools and increased competitive pressure. Despite these concerns, analysts project Adobe’s EPS to reach $22.69 in fiscal year 2026, suggesting continued profitability.

In other recent news, Adobe has reported strong financial results, surpassing both consensus estimates and its own guidance. The company delivered a solid quarter, with Bernstein noting that Adobe’s performance exceeded expectations, leading to a minor adjustment of its stock price target to $506. Despite these positive results, several investment firms have expressed concerns about competitive pressures affecting Adobe. BMO Capital downgraded Adobe from Outperform to Market Perform, citing increased competition in the creative market, particularly impacting smaller businesses, students, and freelancers. Similarly, Jefferies downgraded Adobe from Buy to Hold due to competitive pressures from AI-enhanced alternatives targeting casual users. KeyBanc also downgraded Adobe to Underweight, setting a price target of $310, following the company’s recent earnings report. Additionally, BMO Capital adjusted its price target to $400 while maintaining an Outperform rating, acknowledging Adobe’s better-than-expected revenue performance. These recent developments highlight the mixed sentiment among analysts regarding Adobe’s future prospects amidst growing market competition.

Functional fabrications For all the hype around fashion at the Olympics, brands are still prioritizing fit, fabric and functionality.","The Winter Olympics and Paralympics will take place from Feb. 6-22 in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo. Compared to the Summer Olympics, the Winter Olympics are typically smaller, largely due to high infrastructure costs and climate restraints. Around 2,900 athletes will compete in 2026, compared to 10,500 athletes in 2024. But the merchandise and marketing opportunities for brands are still massive, considering the buzz around sports, the billions of viewers and the allure of a “Big Four” city like Milan. In fact, partnerships tend to lead to sales; Anta reported a rise in revenue when sponsoring the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. This year, NBC said ad slots for the Winter Olympics sold out with “unprecedented demand,” luring more than 100 new advertisers.

“The Olympics are, hands down, one of the most powerful sports platforms in the world,” Harry Poole, svp at the marketing agency Excel Sports Management, told Modern Retail. Poole started his career representing Olympic athletes before shifting to the marketing side. “When you think about global connectivity and cultural relevance, [the Olympics] is a movement that inspires generations,” Poole said. “And the market for it this year is fantastic, when you think about Milan and fashion and what that means to the world.”

Milan is known for its luxury houses like Prada, its ready-to-wear styles and its quality craftsmanship, especially around leather goods. The city is also home to Milan Fashion Week, as well as the fashion district Quadrilatero della Moda. Aesthetics and design, then, play a major role in this year’s Olympics and Paralympics. For instance, this year’s official victory ceremony uniforms stemmed from a contest among three fashion design schools. The new torch design sports a sleek, minimalist look and a larger flame. Even the official motto of the Games is “IT’s your vibe.”

Fashion players, for their part, have spent months hyping up their Olympics products and partnerships. Per a December press release, Ralph Lauren’s Opening Ceremony uniform for Team U.S.A. includes a “statement winter-white wool coat,” while its Closing Ceremony uniform “draws inspiration from vintage ski racing kits.” “We look forward to … bringing our heritage of sport and style to life at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics,” Patrice Louvet, president of Ralph Lauren, said on an earnings call in November. The company’s nine-part TikTok series around the collection and its athletes has garnered more than a quarter of a million views.

Meanwhile, Lululemon’s uniforms for Canada feature topographic map prints and maple leaf designs. The brand recently posted an Instagram video captioned, “We’re not just from Canada, we’re cut from the cold.” “All of us at Lululemon are incredibly proud to support Team Canada on the world’s largest sporting stage with product designed for athletes, and with athletes,” CEO Calvin McDonald said in a statement.

Functional fabrications

For all the hype around fashion at the Olympics, brands are still prioritizing fit, fabric and functionality. After all, wearing an eye-catching uniform at the Olympics and Paralympics is one thing. It’s another to ensure the products are optimized for performance.

Nike, which sponsors the podium for Team U.S.A., will debut its Therma-FIT Air Milano jacket at the Winter Olympics. It has called the jacket “the brand’s most technically engineered garment of its kind.” The jacket allows athletes to regulate their temperature by inflating or deflating air within compartments. “Every detail was engineered to let athletes tune their own comfort and fit,” Amie Achtymichuk, lead apparel development innovator, said in a statement.

Apparel brands are creating distinct technology for non-athletes, too, as the healthcare apparel brand Figs demonstrates. 2026 is the first Winter Olympics that Figs, known for its scrubs, will outfit members of the U.S. medical team, or the medical professionals assisting the athletes. “Our goal is really to give them a podium of their own,” Figs CEO and co-founder Trina Spear told Modern Retail.

Figs first outfitted the U.S. medical team in 2024 at the Summer Olympics in Paris. It will do so again in 2028 at the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. But Figs had to make changes this year when it came to developing scrubs, jackets and other gear. It ended up developing a new fabrication, known as FIBREx, that’s optimized for alpine conditions like colder temperatures and wind.

“We’re really leveling up from what we did in Paris,” Spear said. “In Paris, we were mainly inside, in sporting facilities, … [but] for winter, we’re on a ski mountain. We designed and developed really warm and technical products that are also really comfortable. … You need a product that’s going to support you in a 12-hour shift or [allow you to] support an athlete across many hours.”

Meanwhile, Dagsmejan, a sleepwear company, is giving members of the Swiss National Ice Hockey Team pajamas and sleep masks to wear at night. For athletes, proper recovery, especially during sleep, is “as much a part of training as nutrition,” said Dagsmejan CEO Catarina Dahlin. Dahlin developed Dagsmejan with her husband, in consultation with partners like the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology. The company says its sleepwear uses breathable, natural fibers and focuses on temperature regulation.

As Dahlin sees it, Dagsmejan’s fabrications are perfect for helping ice hockey players wind down after a stressful day. “The matches often take place quite late, [under] very bright light and [with] high energy,” Dahlin told Modern Retail. “After that, you have to try to unwind and go to bed. But you’re also in a bed you’re not used to, and you may not be able to control the air conditioning. How well you recover really impacts how well you can perform and react when it matters.” Dagsmejan has supported the Swiss National Ice Hockey Team since 2021, and both have posted about the partnership on social media.

A lifestyle play

Not all fashion companies involved with the Olympics are developing technical fabrics for those on the ground in Italy. Companies can activate around the events in multiple ways, including through licensing agreements for gear like hats and sweatshirts. These items allow fans of teams and events to show their spirit — and they help boost sales for brands, too.

Some fashion brands are focusing more on the consumer angle. Chubbies, which makes swim trunks and board shorts, rolled out a lifestyle collection for fans to wear at home. The line — which includes performance polos, hoodies and lined swim trunks — is part of a licensing agreement with Team U.S.A.

Team U.S.A. gave Chubbies design guidelines, but the brand could still present its point of view, Tyde Kaneshiro, senior product manager of special projects at Chubbies, told Modern Retail. Chubbies ended up developing a print modeled after intricate snowflake photography. “In a lot of our seasonal development, we look to the runway for trend and color inspiration,” said Kevin Dopp, Chubbies’s senior design director. “But, in this particular [case], we looked at art as inspiration.”

The final designs have red, white and blue to reflect the colors of Team U.S.A. “It doesn’t look generic and feels very us,” Kaneshiro said. The brand is pairing the pieces with a humorous marketing campaign. An Instagram video shows a model in a studio, pretending to ski, while getting “fake snow thrown at him” from a fan, said Ashley Spencer, director of marketing at Chubbies. “We’re championing the vibe of the Olympics in a Chubbies-spun way,” she added.

Also in January, J.Crew rolled out a lifestyle collection with U.S. Ski & Snowboard as part of a partnership that will last three years. The pieces include knitwear, shirts and accessories for women, men and kids. “Our inaugural collection underscores J.Crew’s ability to connect timeless American style with the cultural significance of sport on a global stage,” chairman Kevin Ulrich said in a statement. J.Crew’s marketing campaign around the collection features pro athletes throwing snowballs and relaxing on chaise lounges.

The latter is drawing renewed scrutiny into this murky world of speculative, 24/7 transactions. Last week, an anonymous trader pocketed more than $400,000 after betting that Maduro would soon be out of office.

The bulk of the trader’s bids on the platform Polymarket were made mere hours before President Donald Trump announced the surprise nighttime raid that led to Maduro’s capture, fueling online suspicions of potential insider trading because of the timing of the wagers and the trader’s narrow activity on the platform. Others argued that the risk of getting caught was too big, and that previous speculation about Maduro’s future could have led to such transactions.

Polymarket did not respond to requests for comment.

The commercial use of prediction markets has skyrocketed in recent years, opening the door for people to wage their money on the likelihood of a growing list of future events. But despite some eye-catching windfalls, traders still lose money everyday. And in terms of government oversight in the U.S., the trades are categorized differently than traditional forms of gambling — raising questions about transparency and risk.

Here's what we know:

How prediction markets work

The scope of topics involved in prediction markets can range immensely — from escalation in geopolitical conflicts, to pop culture moments and even the fate of conspiracy theories. Recently, there’s been a surge of wages on elections and sports games. But some users have also bet millions on things like a rumored — and ultimately unrealized — “secret finale” for the Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” whether the U.S. government will confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life and how much billionaire Elon Musk might post on social media this month.

In industry-speak, what someone buys or sells in a prediction market is called an “event contract.” They're typically advertised as “yes” or “no” wagers. And the price of one fluctuates between $0 and $1, reflecting what traders are collectively willing to pay based on a 0% to 100% chance of whether they think an event will occur.

The more likely traders think an event will occur, the more expensive that contract will become. And as those odds change over time, users can cash out early to make incremental profits, or try to avoid higher losses on what they’ve already invested.

Proponents of prediction markets argue putting money on the line leads to better forecasts. Experts like Koleman Strumpf, an economics professor at Wake Forest University, think there’s value in monitoring these platforms for potential news — pointing to prediction markets’ past success with some election outcomes, including the 2024 presidential race.

Still, it's never a “crystal ball,” he noted, and prediction markets can be wrong, too.

Who is behind all of the trading is also pretty murky. While the companies running the platforms collect personal information of their users in order to verify identities and payments, most people can trade under anonymous pseudonyms online — making it difficult for the public to know who is profiting off many event contracts. In theory, people investing their money may be closely following certain events, but others could just be randomly guessing.

Critics stress that the ease and speed of joining these 24/7 wagers leads to financial losses everyday, particularly harming users who may already struggle with gambling. The space also broadens possibilities for potential insider trading.

The major players

Polymarket is one of the largest prediction markets in the world, where its users can fund event contracts through cryptocurrency, debit or credit cards and bank transfers.

Restrictions vary by country, but in the U.S., the reach of these markets has expanded rapidly over recent years, coinciding with shifting policies out of Washington. Former President Joe Biden was aggressive in cracking down on prediction markets and following a 2022 settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Polymarket was barred from operating in the country.

That changed under Trump late last year, when Polymarket announced it would be returning to the U.S. after receiving clearance from the commission. American-based users can now join a platform “waitlist.”

Meanwhile, Polymarket’s top competitor, Kalshi, has been a federally-regulated exchange since 2020. The platform offers similar ways to buy and sell event contracts as Polymarket — and it currently allows event contracts on elections and sports nationwide. Kalshi won court approval just weeks before the 2024 election to let Americans put money on upcoming political races and began to host sports trading about a year ago.

The space is now crowded with other big names. Sports betting giants DraftKings and FanDuel both launched prediction platforms last month. Online broker Robinhood is widening its own offerings. Trump’s social media site Truth Social has also promised to offer an in-platform prediction market through a partnership with Crypto.com — and one of the president’s sons, Donald Trump Jr., holds advisory roles at both Polymarket and Kalshi.

“The train has left the station on these event contracts, they’re not going away,” said Melinda Roth, a visiting associate professor at Washington and Lee University’s School of Law.

Loose regulation

Because they’re positioned as selling event contracts, prediction markets are regulated by the CFTC. That means they can avoid state-level restrictions or bans in place for traditional gambling and sports betting today.

“It’s a huge loophole,” said Karl Lockhart, an assistant professor of law at DePaul University who has studied this space. “You just have to comply with one set of regulations, rather than (rules from) each state around the country.”

Sports betting is taking center stage. There are a handful of big states — like California and Texas, for example — where sports betting is still illegal, but people can now wager on games, athlete trades and more through event contracts.

A growing number of states and tribes are suing to stop this. And lawyers expect litigation to eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court, as added regulations from the Trump administration seem unlikely.

Federal law bars event contracts related to gaming as well as war, terrorism and assassinations, Roth said, which could put some prediction market trades on shaky ground, at least in the U.S. But users might still find ways to buy certain contracts while traveling abroad or connecting to different VPNs.

Whether the CFTC will take any of that on has yet to be seen. But the agency, which did not respond to request for comment, has already taken steps away from enforcement.

Despite overseeing trillions of dollars for the overall U.S. derivatives market, the CFTC is also much smaller than the Securities and Exchange Commission. And at the same time event contracts are growing rapidly on prediction market platforms, there have been additional cuts to the CFTC's workforce and a wave of leadership departures under Trump's second term. Only one of five commissioner slots operating the agency is currently filled.

Still, other lawmakers calling for a stronger crack down on potential insider trading in prediction markets — particularly following suspicion around last week’s Maduro trade on Polymarket. On Friday, Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres introduced a bill aimed at curbing government employees involvement in politically-related event contracts.

The bill has already gotten support from Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour — who on LinkedIn maintained that insider trading has always been banned on his company's platform but that more needs to be done to crack down on unregulated prediction markets.",https://assets.tegnaone.com/assets/AssociatedPress/images/853e1c3a-51b0-4ebc-8d31-fa95c3a84824/20260111T141504/853e1c3a-51b0-4ebc-8d31-fa95c3a84824.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 02:58:24.764158

Stolt-Nielsen is a Norwegian business executive serving as Chairman of the Board of Directors at Stolt-Nielsen Limited, a global transportation and logistics company specializing in chemicals, gases, and aquaculture, since September 2023.[1] He previously held the position of Chief Executive Officer at the company from 2000 to 2023, overseeing its expansion and strategic initiatives in maritime and related sectors.[1] A graduate of Hofstra University with a BS in Business and Finance from 1990, Stolt-Nielsen joined the Stolt-Nielsen organization in 1990, initially working in Greenwich, Connecticut, before relocating to Shanghai in 1994 to establish the company's representative office there.[1] Stolt-Nielsen's career trajectory within the family-founded enterprise includes pivotal roles such as President of Stolt Sea Farm from 1996 to 2000 and Interim Chief Executive Officer of Stolt Offshore S.A. from September 2002 to March 2003, during which he navigated key operational and market challenges in the offshore energy sector.[1] Beyond Stolt-Nielsen Limited, where he has been a Director since 1996, he currently chairs the Board of Avenir LNG Limited, a joint venture focused on small-scale LNG distribution, and serves as a Director at Golar LNG Limited, a leading provider of LNG infrastructure and shipping solutions.[1][2] His leadership has been instrumental in fostering long-term value creation, including growth into sustainable energy and aquaculture ventures.[3] As a member of the Audit and Compensation Committees at Stolt-Nielsen Limited, he continues to influence governance and strategic oversight in the maritime industry.[1]

Early life and education

Family background

Niels Gregers Stolt-Nielsen was born on January 23, 1965, in Norway. He is the son of Jacob Stolt-Nielsen (1931–2015), who founded Stolt-Nielsen Limited in 1959 as a pioneering venture in specialized shipping.[4] The Stolt-Nielsen family traces its heritage to third-generation shipownership in Norway, with roots in Haugesund where Jacob grew up immersed in maritime activities, including running the family herring business as a teenager.[4] The family has played a pivotal role in global shipping, particularly through innovations in parcel tankers designed for safe transport of bulk liquids such as chemicals and edible oils, establishing industry standards without venturing into general cargo operations.[4] Raised in this influential shipping dynasty, Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen experienced early exposure to the family business environment, shaped by Norway's coastal heritage and the harbor views that inspired generations of Stolt-Nielsens. The family continues to hold a controlling interest in Stolt-Nielsen Limited, underscoring their enduring legacy in the sector.[4]

Academic pursuits

Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen pursued his higher education in the United States, enrolling at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. He graduated in 1990 with a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Business and Finance.[1][5] His choice to study in the United States, far from his native Norway, reflected the international orientation of his family's shipping legacy, providing exposure to a dynamic business environment centered in New York.[4]

Career at Stolt-Nielsen Limited

Initial roles and international expansion

Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen joined Stolt-Nielsen Limited in 1990, immediately after graduating from Hofstra University with a BS in Business and Finance, beginning his career as a shipbroker at the company's office in Greenwich, Connecticut.[1] In this initial role, he focused on chartering and brokerage activities within the bulk liquid transportation sector, leveraging his finance background to support Stolt Tankers' operations in the U.S. market.[1] By the early 1990s, Stolt-Nielsen advanced to the position of round-voyage manager, where he oversaw the planning and execution of shipping routes for chemical and product tankers, contributing to operational efficiency amid growing global trade demands. This progression highlighted his early aptitude for logistics coordination, setting the stage for broader international responsibilities.[6] In 1994, Stolt-Nielsen played a pivotal role in the company's international expansion by relocating to China to establish and lead Stolt-Nielsen Limited's first representative office in Shanghai.[1] This initiative marked a strategic entry into the Asian market, facilitating local partnerships and market intelligence for Stolt Tankers' growing presence in the region, which was undergoing rapid economic liberalization.[7] His efforts in organizing the office underscored the company's commitment to global outreach during a period of increasing demand for specialized shipping services in emerging economies. Stolt-Nielsen's contributions culminated in his appointment as a director of Stolt-Nielsen Limited in 1996, where he began overseeing initial ventures into aquaculture, including the leadership of Stolt Sea Farm as its president from 1996 to 2000.[1] This role involved directing early salmon farming operations, integrating his shipping expertise with new diversification strategies in sustainable seafood production.[6] These steps not only expanded the company's portfolio but also positioned Stolt-Nielsen as a key figure in bridging maritime logistics with innovative agribusiness.[7]

CEO leadership and strategic shifts

Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen assumed the position of Chief Executive Officer of Stolt-Nielsen Limited in November 2000, succeeding his father, Jacob Stolt-Nielsen, who had led the company since its founding in 1959.[3] Under his leadership, the company prioritized sustainable growth across its core operations in bulk-liquid logistics, including parcel tankers for chemicals and edible oils, bulk-liquid storage terminals, tank containers, and land-based aquaculture through Stolt Sea Farm.[1] This approach focused on optimizing performance, expanding asset bases, and enhancing market positions to deliver consistent financial results amid fluctuating market cycles.[8] During his tenure, Stolt-Nielsen held additional key roles that underscored his executive oversight. He served as President of Stolt Sea Farm from 1996 to 2000, guiding the aquaculture division's development prior to his CEO appointment.[1] From October 2002 to March 2003, he acted as Interim Chief Executive Officer of Stolt Offshore S.A., a subsea construction and maintenance subsidiary, during a transitional period for that business.[9] These positions highlighted his hands-on involvement in diversifying and stabilizing the group's operations beyond traditional shipping.[1] A significant strategic shift under Stolt-Nielsen's leadership was the expansion into the liquefied natural gas (LNG) and broader gas sectors, aligning with the company's expertise in liquid logistics and the global energy transition.[8] Through Stolt-Nielsen Gas, established as an investment arm during his tenure, the company acquired stakes in LNG infrastructure and shipping, including a controlling interest in Avenir LNG Limited, which operates a fleet of small-scale LNG carriers and bunkering vessels.[10] This diversification strengthened the portfolio's resilience, with investments in LNG storage terminals and related technologies contributing to long-term value creation despite market volatility in the sector.[8]

Transition to chairman

In January 2022, Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen announced his intention to step down as Chief Executive Officer of Stolt-Nielsen Limited after serving in the role since November 2000, citing the desire to introduce fresh leadership to guide the company's future.[3] He emphasized that the timing allowed the board sufficient opportunity to identify and appoint a successor while ensuring a smooth transition, reflecting his commitment to the company's ongoing success.[3] Stolt-Nielsen, who first joined the company in 1990, noted in the announcement that leading Stolt-Nielsen Limited had been a privilege, underscoring his dedication to its operations over more than three decades.[3] The succession process culminated in August 2023 with the appointment of Udo Lange as the new CEO, effective September 1, 2023.[11] Lange brought over 20 years of experience in international trade, including senior roles at FedEx Express where he led global operations in logistics and supply chain management across multiple continents.[11] This transition marked the end of Stolt-Nielsen's 23-year tenure as CEO, during which he had focused on long-term value creation in the shipping and logistics sectors.[11] Upon stepping down as CEO, Stolt-Nielsen assumed the position of Chairman of the Board of Stolt-Nielsen Limited in September 2023, subject to shareholder approval, and also joined the Audit and Compensation Committees.[1] In this new role, he continued to contribute to the company's strategic oversight, building on his extensive history since 1990 in fostering sustainable growth within the specialized shipping and related industries.[1]

Other business positions

Founding and leadership at Avance Gas

In 2007, Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen founded Avance Gas AS to enter the burgeoning market for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) transportation, establishing it as a specialized provider of very large gas carriers (VLGCs) capable of transporting LPG across global trade routes.[12][13] Stolt-Nielsen has served as Chairman of Avance Gas since its inception, steering the company through phases of strategic expansion in the energy shipping sector. Under his leadership, Avance Gas grew from a startup to a prominent operator, leveraging long-term charter contracts to ensure stable revenue amid volatile shipping markets.[12] Key achievements during his tenure include the fleet expansion through an orderbook of eight newbuildings announced in 2014, with deliveries increasing the fleet to 14 VLGCs by the end of 2015, which enabled Avance Gas to capture a significant share of the international LPG trade, particularly in routes connecting the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. This positioning capitalized on rising global demand for LPG as a cleaner fuel alternative, with the company's vessels achieving high utilization rates and contributing to efficient supply chain logistics for petrochemical feedstocks. By 2024, Avance Gas had established itself as a leading independent owner in the VLGC segment before the sale of its fleet to BW LPG.[13][14][15] In 2024, Avance Gas sold its fleet of 12 VLGCs to BW LPG for approximately $1.05 billion, completing Stolt-Nielsen's divestment from the company.[15]

Roles in LNG and related sectors

Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen has served as a director of Golar LNG Limited since September 2015, where he contributes to the company's advancements in floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) technology and LNG carrier operations.[5] Under his board tenure, Golar has pioneered FLNG units like the Hilli Episeyo, the world's first converted FLNG vessel, which began production off Cameroon in 2018, enhancing efficient LNG liquefaction and export capabilities. His involvement aligns with Golar's strategic expansions in modular FLNG solutions, supporting global energy supply chains.[5] As Chairman of the Board of Avenir LNG Limited since October 2018, Stolt-Nielsen has guided the company's growth in small-scale LNG distribution and infrastructure development.[2] Avenir, in which Stolt-Nielsen Limited holds a majority stake, focuses on bunkering, trucking, and regasification solutions to deliver LNG to remote and industrial markets, including investments in small-scale carriers and storage terminals.[16] His leadership has supported Avenir's growth, including the expansion of its fleet of small-scale LNG carriers, with 5 vessels in operation and additional newbuildings on order by 2023, facilitating LNG as a transitional fuel for maritime and land-based applications.[17] Stolt-Nielsen's board capacities extend to related sustainable energy initiatives, such as his past presidency of Stolt Sea Farm from 1996 to 2000, where aquaculture operations emphasized environmentally responsible practices that complement broader energy transition goals.[18] Since the 2010s, his strategic oversight across these LNG entities has promoted the adoption of cleaner fuels in shipping, including dual-fuel vessels and LNG bunkering infrastructure to reduce emissions in line with IMO regulations.[19] This work builds complementarily on his experience in gas carrier operations at Avance Gas.

Tax residency dispute

Emigration to London

In late December 2001, Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen notified Norwegian authorities of his relocation to London, England, on December 1, 2001, where he established his primary residence.[20] This move, over a year after he had become chief executive officer of Stolt-Nielsen Limited (SNL), a global shipping company headquartered in London, reflected the demands of his CEO position that required extensive international travel and oversight of operations across multiple countries.[3] The emigration was driven by professional necessities tied to SNL's worldwide activities, including frequent business engagements in the UK that necessitated a London base to facilitate efficient management and decision-making. As a result of the notification, Stolt-Nielsen ceased making tax payments to Norway, aligning his tax residency with his new circumstances in England. His lifestyle adjustments, such as maintaining a presence in London for both work and personal reasons, supported this shift away from Norwegian tax obligations.[21][22] Norwegian authorities initially accepted Stolt-Nielsen's claimed foreign residency for the tax years 2002 through 2004 due to a clerical error in processing at the Oslo tax office, which led to no Norwegian tax assessments being issued during this period. This provisional acceptance provided temporary relief from Norwegian taxation, though it stemmed from administrative oversight rather than a formal determination of residency status.[23][22]

Legal challenges and outcomes

In 2005, Norwegian tax authorities discovered a clerical error in their prior assessments of Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen's residency status, which had initially accepted his 2001 emigration notification to London for the years 2002–2004. This prompted the Oslo Tax Office to claim back taxes for the period 2001–2005, asserting that he maintained permanent residence in Frogner, Oslo, due to strong personal and familial ties to Norway.[22][23][24] Stolt-Nielsen responded by filing a lawsuit against the Norwegian Tax Administration, seeking to overturn the revised tax assessments and affirm his primary residency in London, where he conducted most of his professional and personal life. He argued that his time spent in Norway was limited and incidental, primarily for family visits and obligations, and that his center of vital interests had shifted abroad following the 2001 move.[22][25][23] In November 2007, the Oslo District Court ruled against Stolt-Nielsen on all counts, upholding the tax authorities' position that his permanent residence remained in Oslo based on factors such as ownership of a family home in Frogner, a country estate, vehicles registered in Norway, significant time spent in the country, and ongoing familial connections. The court determined that these elements demonstrated insufficient detachment from Norway to qualify as a tax emigrant, resulting in upheld tax liabilities for 2001 and 2005. Stolt-Nielsen was also ordered to cover his own legal costs of 474,000 Norwegian kroner and the state's costs of 95,000 Norwegian kroner.[22][23][26] Stolt-Nielsen appealed the decision. In December 2009, the Norwegian Supreme Court (HR-2009-2323-A) granted him partial relief by overturning the 2005 tax assessment, ruling that a declaration from UK tax authorities established his tax residency in the United Kingdom for that year under the Norway-UK tax treaty. The 2001 assessment remained upheld.[20][27]

Later developments

As of February 2023, Stolt-Nielsen relocated his tax residency from Bermuda back to Norway, citing anticipated large incomes and more favorable tax conditions in Norway compared to Bermuda.[28]",https://grokipedia.com/icon-512x512.png,N,,2026-01-12 13:05:02.561558

WPP Media Sports is a new practice charged with creating sponsorships, content and integrations, with GumGum and Relo Metrics as partners.","Comvergence, which hits 10 years in operation this year, has become the gold standard of measuring agencies’ success (or lack of). However, the data Digiday is citing here is only provisional. As Comvergence’s founder and CEO Olivier Gauthier explained, the data doesn’t include wins and losses not publicly announced — that final report will be issued in February, once Comvergence connects with all the agencies it tracks. (Although Gauthier acknowledges that the numbers don’t change on average more than 5% or so.)

Back to the numbers themselves. Somewhat surprising is what happened in between Publicis and WPP Media. Dentsu, it turns out, had a solid year, ending 2025 up $1.7 billion (details by holdco below), which technically puts it in second place for the year. But the gap between No.’s 1 and 2 — $9.5 billion to $1.7 billion, is cavernous to say the least.

Another surprise is third-place finisher IPG’s Mediabrands, which yielded a positive $1.6 billion, and placing it ahead of Omnicom Media, which ended 2025 up $1.2 billion — and yet Omnicom was the acquirer of IPG. If you put them together, they’d tally $2.8 billion in wins, ahead of Dentsu but still a distant second to Publicis.

Here’s a breakdown by holdco, ranked in order of total business won.

Publicis Media

It’s no secret the French holdco has been on a tear, winning Mars, Coca-Cola, Paramount, PayPal and most recently Kenvue, demolishing the competition. More importantly, it’s retained 50% of its business, according to Comvergence’s provisional totals, more than any other holdco. It lost just over $1.5 billion in media business.

Dentsu

Even though Dentsu outside of the Japanese mothership is informally on the block, it had a decent year. Although it won $1.8 billion in new business, it lost almost as much — which means its strength came from successful retention, which amounted to some $1.6 billion. Observers will be watching closely to see what happens to the former Aegis agencies that are seemingly up in the air.

IPG Mediabrands

“It’s very interesting that Mediabrands had a very good year in the U.S.,” said Gauthier. Most would agree with that sentiment, given that IPG was the acquisition target all year. It pulled in $2.4 billion in new business, but lost $1.9 billion, leaving it at a net of under $500 million — once again, successful defense helped win the day as Mediabrands held onto $1.1 billion it had to defend.

Omnicom Media

Omnicom Media really didn’t have a good year at all, which is perhaps the biggest surprise of the numbers. It’s only thanks to WPP Media’s truly awful year that distracted from this reality. Not counting retention, Omnicom Media came out just under $700 million ahead ($3 billion in wins vs. $2.3 billion in losses). To make matters worse, its retention rate was a wan 17% according to the Comvergence data, the second worse among the holdcos. It’s safe to say 2026 will be a different story as the absorption of IPG takes root — whether it’s a better or worse story remains to be seen.

Havas Media

Parent company Havas has been on an acquisitive streak of late but its media arm remains smaller than its holdco counterparts. Havas Media secured $1.4 billion in wins, lost $750 million and retained $350 million. According to Comvergence’s tallies, its retention rate was a middle-of-the-road 32%. What remains to be seen is how Havas Media fares with its new joint venture with Horizon Media. The pairing is complementary on paper, with Havas weak in the U.S. but well represented globally, and the opposite for Horizon. Gauthier said Comvergence will create a new category for that JV once it’s up and running this year.

WPP Media

And finally, WPP Media remained the punching bag of the holdcos, and with some good reason — ending the year $2 billion in the negative ($3.3 billion in wins, $6.4 billion in losses and successfully retaining only $1 billion). All that said, it’s worth noting that the Cindy Rose era of WPP was in its infancy for Q4, which is when WPP Media landed big-ticket accounts such as the U.K. government and Jaguar Land Rover (both from Omnicom). It’s also shoring up its client-side team by hiring away Angela Steele from Publicis (no easy feat to lure an exec away from the No. 1 holdco) where she had been CEO of Publicis Collective and in charge of the Verizon account. This year could bring better fortunes to the beleaguered London-based holdco.

Color by numbers

Since you’ve just had to absorb a LOT of numbers in the main story, here are two eye-popping stats that Comvergence’s Gauthier mentioned in relation to the holding companies. Together they were involved in more than 1,900 pitches across 50 countries last year, which totaled something in the neighborhood of $28 billion.

Takeoff & landing

At CES, Havas announced it will launch this spring an LLM portal called AVA, which will centralize the holdco’s access to major LLMs including GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3.

Both WPP Media and Stagwell made moves in the sports arena. WPP Media Sports is a new practice charged with creating sponsorships, content and integrations, with GumGum and Relo Metrics as partners. And Stagwell, which has put on Sports Beach as a Cannes Lions activation for a few years, made it into its own marketing business unit, with multiple events scheduled over the course of 2026. Beth Sidhu, who is also Stagwell’s chief brand and communications officer, was named CEO.

Horizon Media said it will incorporate Sightly’s Brand Mentality and Model Context Protocol tools into its Blu market intelligence platform.

PMG acquired London and New York-based Digital Voices, an influencer marketing agency, in a bid to beef up its influencer and creator resources.

Independent Novus tapped Libby Morgan to be its new CEO, coming over from Merge where she was chief digital officer. Morgan replaces Melony Rios.

Leaders from Sun Country and Allegiant were expected to address the proposed merger Monday morning.
Case in point: After a four-year run, Allegiant exited Minneapolis entirely just last year.","Ultra-low-cost carrier Allegiant Air announced plans Sunday to acquire Minnesota’s Sun Country Airlines in a $1.5 billion transaction, swallowing up a smaller budget airline in a move that could have major ramifications for Minnesota travelers on the hunt for bargain airfare.

The proposed merger would fold Sun Country's planes, pilots, and crews all under Allegiant's umbrella, creating one bigger budget carrier – though it would still be significantly smaller than either Spirit or Frontier, according to airline data. With a deal expected to close sometime in the second half of 2026, the combined airline would continue under Allegiant's name with its headquarters in Las Vegas.

Allegiant said it would maintain a “significant presence” in Sun Country's Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) hub after the deal closes. But a long history of airline mergers suggests that there could be reductions in Minneapolis down the road. Sun Country CEO Jude Bricker – who worked at Allegiant before making the move to Minnesota – will only join the airline's board and serve in an advisory capacity.

In the short term, both Allegiant and Sun Country said there would be no immediate changes to upcoming Sun Country tickets, schedules, or its onboard experience. Translation? Don't worry if you're booked to fly with Sun Country in the weeks and months ahead.

The deal will require approval from President Donald Trump's Department of Justice, which has taken a friendlier approach to consolidation than the Biden administration that blocked several airline deals, including JetBlue's proposed takeover of Spirit Airlines. And unlike many previous mergers, Sun Country and Allegiant are both relatively small and barely overlap today, meaning regulators may see less cause for concern than other takeover attempts.

Leaders from Sun Country and Allegiant were expected to address the proposed merger Monday morning.

“This combination is an exciting next chapter in Allegiant and Sun Country’s shared mission in providing affordable, reliable, and convenient service from underserved communities to premier leisure destinations,” Allegiant CEO Gregory Anderson said in a written statement.

This merger is just the latest sign of turbulence in the U.S.'s low-cost carrier market, which has fallen out of favor in the post-pandemic travel boom. Spirit Airlines is in its second round of bankruptcy proceedings and yet another run of the rumor mill about an acquisition by Frontier.

Sun Country has been far more successful, posting profits for years as it challenged Delta's dominance in Minneapolis while branching out into flying packages for Amazon and ferrying college football teams and professional soccer squads across the country.

Sunday's surprise merger announcement could change everything.

What Allegiant's Acquisition Means for Minneapolis

If the merger moves ahead, it'll be the end of Sun Country in name: an airline with a storied yet often complicated brand.

Sun Country has been a household name in Minnesota for decades after starting up service in 1982 in the wake of Braniff International's collapse. After years of financial struggles operating as a beloved full-service hometown carrier, the airline began an unpopular transition to a low-cost model before the pandemic – complete with fees for everything from bags to seat assignments to buying your tickets at the airport and installed smaller seats, to boot. Its reputation took a major blow after stranding hundreds of passengers in Mexico in April 2018 … and never fully recovered.

Yet Sun Country prided itself on being a different kind of low-cost carrier. While it ripped out first class seats and shrank legroom throughout the cabin, its seating was better padded than the ultra-slimline seats that Frontier, Spirit, and even Allegiant use on their planes. Even as those competitors charged for water, Sun Country served free soft drinks and sold snacks and craft beers with a Minnesota flair.

As the rest of the budget airline industry struggled with higher costs and dipping demand after the COVID-19 pandemic, Sun Country grew fast, going public in 2021 and challenging Delta's dominance in Minneapolis. It turned the airport into what its CEO dubbed “a two-airline market.” Most importantly, Sun Country's $89 one-way fares have given Minnesota travelers a cheaper alternative to Delta's pricier fares but also forced the Atlanta-based airline to compete on price, bringing fares down across the board.

That's what could be at stake with this proposed merger. While they might both be budget airlines in name, they're drastically different in practice.

Overnight, complimentary drinks could disappear and over time, Sun Country's more comfortable seating could disappear, too. But bigger picture, the changes could be even more drastic.

When airlines buy one another, what they're really looking to buy is planes and pilots to fuel future growth. While Sun Country has been all-in on Minneapolis for decades, Allegiant focuses on operating flights between smaller airports all across the country – routes where it can have a monopoly and charge higher fares.

Even with the Sun Country name gone, Allegiant says it would maintain a significant presence in Minneapolis – it called the airport an “Important Base of Operations and Key Anchor City” in its press release announcing the merger. But what if Allegiant eventually decides to give up the fight against Delta and instead fly those planes between Las Vegas or southern Florida and other, smaller airports?

Aside from planes and people, the biggest win for Allegiant is swallowing up Sun Country's international service down to Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America – service Allegiant has lacked. But again, what if Allegiant decides it's better to fly down to the beach from St. Petersburg (PIE) rather than Minneapolis-St. Paul?

Sun Country has relished its role as a scrappy (and cheaper) alternative to Delta. Allegiant's entire identity is built around avoiding competition altogether. Case in point: After a four-year run, Allegiant exited Minneapolis entirely just last year.

Bricker, Sun Country's CEO for nearly a decade, won't play a large role once the transaction clears. He'll join the combined carriers' board of directors but only serve in a day-to-day advisory role to Allegiant's current CEO “to help ensure a smooth and successful integration.”

Allegiant also indicated it will continue Sun Country's cargo operations on behalf of Amazon – a major upside for the Minnesota airline the last few years as travel demand has plateaued.

· The global container ship orderbook currently stands at 26–28% of the existing fleet, one of the highest levels seen in more than a decade.
· Average global spot freight rates are expected to decline by up to 25% year-on-year, while long-term contract rates may fall by 8–12% as shippers regain negotiating leverage.
· Container shipping fundamentals are likely to deteriorate further due to oversupply, easing port congestion, and the potential return of vessels to Suez Canal routings, which would release additional effective capacity.

“While freight rates are expected to normalize sharply from recent highs, the industry is unlikely to return to pre-crisis stability due to persistent geopolitical, regulatory, and environmental risks,” says Supal Shah, CEO of Sarjak Container Lines. “2026 will bring relief on rates, but not certainty. Oversupply is structural, costs are permanently higher, and volatility is now a feature, not a phase, of global shipping.”

Key takeaways:

· Global fleet capacity is projected to grow by 3.6%–5% in 2026, significantly outpacing demand growth of 1.5%–3%, according to industry forecasts.

· The global container ship orderbook currently stands at 26–28% of the existing fleet, one of the highest levels seen in more than a decade.

· Average global spot freight rates are expected to decline by up to 25% year-on-year, while long-term contract rates may fall by 8–12% as shippers regain negotiating leverage.

· Industry-wide profitability is expected to weaken materially, with several analysts forecasting losses of up to USD 10 billion in 2026, driven by falling revenues and structurally higher operating costs.

· Container shipping fundamentals are likely to deteriorate further due to oversupply, easing port congestion, and the potential return of vessels to Suez Canal routings, which would release additional effective capacity.

· The dry bulk sector is expected to remain weak but stable, with potential upside if global trade volumes recover or geopolitical tensions ease.

· A broad return to Suez Canal transits could reduce effective global vessel demand by up to 10%, as shorter voyages free up capacity.

· Rising trade protectionism, evolving U.S. tariff regimes, and shifting supply chains remain key uncertainties that could disrupt established trade lanes and dampen demand for higher-margin cargo.

· Effective Jan. 1, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) moves to 100% emissions compliance, adding permanent cost structures to Europe-linked trade lanes and accelerating cost pass-through to shippers.

· Shippers are increasingly adopting continuous rate governance, real-time pricing analytics, and AI-driven procurement tools, moving away from rigid annual contracting cycles.

· Vessel owners are prioritizing lifecycle optimization, fuel flexibility, including LNG, methanol, and biofuels, and energy-efficiency investments to meet tightening decarbonization targets while preserving asset competitiveness.

“While 2026 is expected to bring lower freight rates and improved cost visibility for shippers, the global shipping industry remains structurally fragile. Oversupply, regulatory costs, and geopolitical uncertainty will continue to define a market that is less crisis-driven, but far from stable,” says Shah.",https://img.sdcexec.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2026/01/melita-stockadobecom.Aimb2rqJ4U.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2026-01-12 03:59:04.876406

Op dit moment is in Las Vegas de techbeurs CES volop aan de gang. Alle grote tech brands zijn er vertegenwoordigd, maar er duiken steeds meer andere grote consumentenmerken op zoals IKEA, LEGO en L'Oréal.

Lego presenteert er hun nieuwe 'Smart Brick', een legosteentje, maar dan vol met technische snufjes, zoals lichtjes, sensoren voor licht, geluid en beweging en een speaker. De electronica wordt aangedreven door een chip die kleiner is dan het nopje van een Legosteentje. De innovatie wordt in de vakpers inmiddels bejubeld als 'ge-wel-dig'. Ook komt Lego met nieuwe Star Wars-legosets, die de muziek en geluiden uit die films kunnen laten horen.

Ook Ikea is aanwezig met nieuwe techproducten. Het is voor het eerst dat het Zweedse bedrijf de beurs bezoekt, maar het Ikea is al langer bezig met het ontwikkelen van allerlei smart home-producten, zoals slimme stekkers, led-lampen en sensoren voor in huis. Op CES voegde het bedrijf een aantal nieuwe producten aan die collectie toe, zoals een slimme versie van de populaire 'donutlamp' Varmblixt, die ontworpen is door de Nederlandse kunstenaar Sabine Marcelis.

The deal between the Reds and Johnson was first reported by the New York Post.
The Reds’ bullpen looks pretty set right now.
Before signing Johnson, the Reds didn’t have a right-handed middle relief veteran in the mold of Barlow, Martinez, Buck Farmer or Fernando Cruz.
While the 2025 Braves weren’t good, Johnson made 45 of his 65 appearances in high-leverage spots.","In 2025, as good as Emilio Pagán and Tony Santillan were in the back of the Reds’ bullpen, the middle relief core for most of the season included pitchers who weren’t incredibly consistent, guys in their first year as a relief pitcher and rookies.

Heading into 2026, Nick Krall and the Reds’ front office made solidifying the middle relief depth in the bullpen a priority. After bringing Pagán to close and signing lefty Caleb Ferguson in December, the Reds made another notable move on Sunday by agreeing to a deal with veteran reliever Pierce Johnson, according to sources.

The deal between the Reds and Johnson was first reported by the New York Post. The terms aren’t yet known.

For a while, we’ve all been wondering when the Reds would finally add that impact bat, or even replace Austin Hays and Miguel Andujar. But the front office’s focus has clearly been on the bullpen.

“We had four guys we lost in the bullpen in Pagán (re-signed), Nick Martinez, Brent Suter and Scott Barlow,” Krall said a few weeks ago. “When you look at the guys we lost, it’s something we had to continue to solidify.”

The back of the Reds’ bullpen was great last season, but the middle relief core had its rough patches.

Graham Ashcraft had a fine year as the seventh-inning guy as he made the transition to the bullpen, but he was on the injured list twice and finished the season with a 3.99 ERA. Scott Barlow was more of a workhorse than a late-game weapon. Lyon Richardson, Luis Mey and Connor Phillips got their chances to pitch high-leverage innings, and only Phillips stuck. Nick Martinez, Chase Burns and Phillips took the bullpen up a level in September, but Martinez is a free agent right now, Chase Burns is going back to the rotation and Phillips is still inexperienced.

The Reds’ bullpen looks pretty set right now. The leverage guys are Pagán, Santillan, Johnson, Ashcraft and Ferguson (the lefty). The Reds guaranteed money to Moll back in November, and it’s always good to have a second lefty. Phillips put himself in a great position to break camp with the big league club with how good he looked down the stretch last season.

That could lead to a competition for the final spot between Zach Maxwell, Luis Mey, Yosver Zulueta, Richardson (no longer on the 40-man but still in the organization) and non-roster invitees like Josh Staumont.

Before signing Johnson, the Reds didn’t have a right-handed middle relief veteran in the mold of Barlow, Martinez, Buck Farmer or Fernando Cruz. While those relievers had different levels of ability and upside, you could mostly count on them to make 60+ appearances a year. You need a certain level of stability to get you through the season and to keep you from having to regularly restock your bullpen with roster moves to provide fresh arms.

Johnson fits that mold, and he has also proven to be a capable leverage reliever on a good team.

While the 2025 Braves weren’t good, Johnson made 45 of his 65 appearances in high-leverage spots.

On a playoff team in Atlanta in 2024, Johnson was consistently a late-game option in big moments and pitched the eighth inning of a close win-or-go-home postseason game. On a 2023 Braves team that won 104 games, Johnson joined the squad at the trade deadline and quickly became a leverage guy.

It took a bit for Johnson to find his footing in MLB. But once he went all-in on his curveball (he threw more curveballs than any reliever in all of baseball last season and uses the pitch 72% of the time), Johnson leveled up.

Heading into the 2024 season, he re-signed with Atlanta on a two-year deal for $14.25 million. And then he went on to have two seasons that were as good or better than what he had done before. In 2025, Johnson posted career highs (over a full season) in ERA, WAR and many advanced metrics.

Johnson fills up the strike zone, giving the Reds a good combination of durability, reliability and late-game usefulness.

A few weeks ago, after adding outfielders JJ Bleday and Dane Myers, Krall said, “We’ve got some more money to be able to use.” Since then, the Reds freed up a bit of money by DFAing Keegan Thompson ($1.4 million) and by finalizing the salaries of most of their arbitration eligible players (by my estimation that could account for about $1 million of added financial flexibility).

Before the Johnson move, my projections had the Reds at $111 million of payroll for 2026. They were in the $116 million range last season, and 2026 payroll is expected to be pretty close to what it was last season.

A few weeks ago, when asked what the Reds could use their remaining financial flexibility to add this winter, Krall said, “Bullpen depth and some offense.”

Signing Johnson takes care of the bullpen depth. Assuming they still have a bit of financial flexibility (that will become clearer as the terms are known for Johnson), the Reds could be in the market for a first baseman or an outfielder.

In the level of free agency the Reds are working at (they’re not signing Kyle Tucker), bringing back Hays would feel like a win and a great case scenario for them.

First baseman Nathaniel Lowe, Paul Goldschmidt and Rhys Hoskins are free agents.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r1YA!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77c25d83-f341-4fd7-8b2a-e8e014f85006_1578x886.png",N,,2026-01-11 21:58:34.407073

The company’s leadership in metabolic disease, anchored by its high profile weight loss and diabetes therapies, has reshaped growth expectations while delivering measurable benefits to society. With accelerating earnings, expanding margins, and a robust late stage pipeline, Lilly offers a compelling blend of return potential and real world impact that firmly qualifies it for the Good Stocks universe.

The Return Case

Lilly’s investment appeal rests on a powerful combination of accelerating revenue growth, operating leverage, and exceptional profitability. With profit growth forecast above 100 percent and industry leading margins, earnings momentum remains the central driver of long term shareholder returns.

The Impact Case

Beyond financials, Lilly’s therapies are redefining how obesity and metabolic disease are treated globally. At the same time, strong resource efficiency and high recycling rates reinforce the company’s standing as a responsible operator across its value chain.

Company Profile: A Science First Growth Engine

Eli Lilly is a global pharmaceutical leader focused on diabetes, obesity, oncology, immunology, and neuroscience. Its portfolio includes some of the most impactful medicines of the past decade, supported by deep expertise in biologics, peptide chemistry, and large scale manufacturing.

The company’s most visible products today are its GLP 1 based therapies for diabetes and weight management, which have seen unprecedented demand. These medicines address conditions that affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide and are increasingly viewed as foundational treatments rather than niche interventions.

From a market perspective, Lilly operates in therapeutic areas with durable, above average growth. Obesity treatment alone is evolving into one of the largest pharmaceutical markets globally. Lilly’s competitive moat is built on first mover scale, manufacturing capacity, strong clinical data, and a pipeline that extends well beyond its current blockbusters. This combination makes its market position defensible even as competition intensifies.

Financial Analysis: Growth Justifying the Premium

Multi Year Performance and Recent Momentum

Over the past five years, Lilly has delivered steady revenue growth that has recently accelerated sharply. Revenue growth rose from low double digits earlier in the cycle to over 30 percent in the most recent year, with trailing twelve month growth exceeding 45 percent. EBITDA and earnings growth have accelerated even more dramatically, reflecting operating leverage as volumes scale.

Margins tell the same story. EBITDA margins have expanded into the low 40 percent range, while net profit margins now exceed 30 percent on a trailing basis. Returns on equity and assets are among the highest in the pharmaceutical industry, underscoring efficient capital deployment.

Valuation in Context

At first glance, Lilly’s valuation appears demanding. The stock trades at a forward price to earnings multiple in the mid to high 40s, well above the sector average. However, valuation looks more reasonable when set against growth. Earnings per share growth is forecast above 100 percent in the near term, and revenue growth is expected to remain well above the company’s long term average.

Importantly, the growth trajectory is accelerating rather than decelerating. The step change driven by metabolic therapies has not yet fully flowed through earnings, suggesting that near term multiple compression may be offset by rapid earnings expansion.

Growth Drivers and Industry KPIs

Key industry specific indicators support this outlook. Prescription volumes for Lilly’s weight loss and diabetes drugs continue to rise, capacity expansions are coming online, and demand remains supply constrained in several markets. Unlike many pharmaceutical growth stories, this momentum is driven by real world utilization rather than pricing alone.

Analyst Expectations and Upside

Consensus analyst targets imply modest single digit upside from current levels. That may appear conservative, but it reflects the stock’s strong recent performance rather than deteriorating fundamentals. With a Ziggma Score of 88, supported by profitability at 95 and financial health at 97, Lilly remains one of the highest quality profiles in global healthcare.

Risks to the Return Scenario

The primary risks center on competition, pricing pressure, and execution. Rival therapies could narrow Lilly’s market share over time. Regulatory scrutiny around drug pricing may intensify. Manufacturing scale up must continue without disruption. Finally, expectations are high, which increases sensitivity to any earnings disappointment.

Risks to the Return Scenario

If Lilly sustains current growth rates for longer than expected, earnings expansion alone could drive meaningful upside even with stable valuation multiples.

Impact Analysis: Medicines That Change Lives

Tackling Obesity at Scale

Lilly’s weight loss therapies represent one of the most significant medical advances in decades. Obesity is linked to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and reduced life expectancy. By enabling substantial and sustained weight loss, these drugs have the potential to reduce healthcare costs and improve quality of life for millions.

Responsible Resource Use

Beyond patient impact, Lilly scores highly on Sustainable Resource Use, with an especially strong recycling rate that drives its elevated score in this category. Efficient water use and waste management reflect disciplined operational practices that reduce environmental footprint across manufacturing sites.

Investment Thesis: Quality Growth with Real World Impact

Lilly’s investment case is built on three pillars. First, a step change in growth driven by category defining metabolic therapies. Second, best in class profitability and financial strength that allow the company to reinvest at scale. Third, tangible societal benefits that reinforce long term license to operate.

Over the next two to three years, earnings growth is likely to remain the dominant driver of returns. Even if valuation multiples normalize modestly, earnings expansion can support continued share price appreciation. Crucially, this growth is underpinned by products that deliver clear benefits to patients and healthcare systems worldwide.

LLY Is Where Innovation and Impact Reinforce Returns

Eli Lilly exemplifies what a Good Stock should look like. It pairs industry leading growth and profitability with therapies that address some of the most pressing health challenges of our time. While valuation is no longer cheap, the company’s accelerating growth trajectory, operational excellence, and profound societal impact make a compelling case for long term investors seeking both returns and purpose.

For users who have linked their Walmart accounts, Gemini can tailor recommendations based on purchase history and enable delivery of in-store items within three hours, or as little as 30 minutes.

Walmart CEO John Furner said the partnership marks a shift in how people shop.

""The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail. We aren't just watching the shift, we are driving it,"" Furner said in the press release.

In recent years, discovery-led shopping experiences on social media platforms like TikTok Shop, Instagram Shopping, and live shopping services like Whatnot have disrupted the traditional digital shopping experience.

AI is reshaping the discovery process even further.

Gemini 3 plays catch-up

While Gemini still trails ChatGPT in overall number of users by a significant margin, it's closing the gap and even outperforming OpenAI in other key ways.

In November, after years of taking heat as the slow-moving leviathan in the AI race, Google redeemed itself with the launch of Gemini 3.

The latest version of Google's chatbot was well received by both consumers and industry leaders. Its stock price surged in the weeks following the rollout, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said he would switch from ChatGPT to Gemini, calling the latter ""insane"" in a viral post.

The hype forced OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to declare a ""code red"" at his company.

Gemini also benefits from Google's larger ecosystem of products, like Search, Workplace, Android, and Google TV.

The protocol battle

Another promising development for Gemini, underpinning its partnership with Walmart, is the launch of a new retail protocol, which Google refers to as the Universal Commerce Protocol.

""AI agents will be a big part of how we shop in the not-so-distant future,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a post on X on Sunday. ""To help lay the groundwork, we partnered with Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target and Walmart to create the Universal Commerce Protocol, a new open standard for agents and systems to talk to each other across every step of the shopping journey.""

Protocols have long served as the invisible scaffolding of the digital realm, and streamlining a new era of agent-to-agent communication is a critical step in unlocking an agent-powered world, founders building AI protocols previously told Business Insider.

OpenAI unveiled its own commerce protocol in September, following the launch of Instant Checkout. The new feature lets users buy items directly in ChatGPT from Etsy and over a million Shopify merchants, the company said in a blog post announcing the feature.

OpenAI also said the protocol behind it, the Agentic Commerce Protocol, is ""an open standard for AI commerce that lets AI agents, people, and businesses work together to complete purchases."" It was developed alongside Stripe.

Google's mission appears to be similar.

In response to a request for comment, a Google spokesperson referred Business Insider to a blog post Pichai wrote about its new Unified Commerce Protocol.

In it, he explains how the new protocol will change the consumer shopping experience.

He said if a shopper is looking for a suitcase, the protocol allows retailers to instantly offer a new-member price or prompt loyalty enrollment. Returning customers might see tailored discounts or product suggestions, such as packing cubes, when they check out. The transaction can then be completed in just a few taps through Google Pay — without leaving the chat, Pichai said.",https://i.insider.com/69641e5d764ca5f34d2a3c21?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2026-01-11 20:58:50.351734

Any shift in capital requirements or banking sector taxes can quickly change the earnings equation for institutions like Société Générale.","Few European bank stocks divide opinion quite as sharply right now as Société Générale. The French lender’s share price has moved only modestly over the past week, but the subdued price action hides a much more polarised debate over capital strength, restructuring risks and how much patience the market still has with management’s long game.

Société Générale S.A. stock: deep dive into valuation, strategy and risks for global investors

On the screen, Société Générale S.A. (ISIN FR0000130809) trades around the mid 20 euro area, according to live quotes from Yahoo Finance and Reuters. Intraday charts show a mostly sideways drift over the last five sessions, with small daily swings rather than the kind of trend that excites momentum traders. The short term sentiment is cautious rather than panicked, a market that is watching and waiting rather than one rushing for the exits.

Across the last five trading days, the stock has oscillated within a relatively narrow band, with closing levels moving only modestly up and down compared with the prior week. There were no dramatic gap moves or outsized volume spikes, and the tape suggests that both buyers and sellers are testing the range rather than forcing a breakout. In other words, price is calm, but conviction is scarce.

Zooming out to roughly three months, the picture becomes more nuanced. From the early autumn period to now, Société Générale has traded on a choppy upward-sloping path, supported by the broader rally in European financials as investors warmed again to higher interest rate margins. Yet every attempt to push decisively higher has met a wall of profit taking, reflecting lingering doubts over the bank’s earnings quality and execution on its restructuring promises.

The 52 week range underlines this divide. According to Bloomberg and Yahoo Finance, Société Générale’s stock has carved out a low in the high teens and a high in the low 30s over the past year, a wide corridor that captures both deep pessimism during periods of sector stress and bouts of optimism when European banks briefly came back into fashion. The current quote sits somewhere in the middle of that band, which is precisely where disagreement between bulls and bears tends to be most intense.

One-Year Investment Performance

If an investor had bought Société Générale stock exactly one year ago, the experience would have been a roller coaster with a mildly positive payoff at today’s levels. Based on closing prices from Reuters and Investing.com, the share traded in the low 20s at that time. With the stock now around the mid 20s, that translates into a gain in the low double digits in percentage terms for the period, before dividends.

Put differently, a hypothetical 10,000 euro position taken then would be worth roughly 11,000 euro today, not including the bank’s cash distributions. That is hardly the kind of explosive performance one might find in hot tech names, but in the conservative world of European banking, a double digit total return over twelve months is not trivial. The emotional journey, however, was anything but smooth: investors had to stomach sharp drawdowns during bouts of risk aversion and controversy around the group’s Russian exposure and capital allocation plans.

This backdrop explains why the prevailing sentiment feels closer to cautious optimism than outright euphoria. The stock has rewarded patient holders, but the gains came with enough volatility and negative headlines that many portfolio managers still view Société Générale as a name that needs constant babysitting. For value oriented investors, the past year reinforces the idea that entry timing matters enormously with this stock.

Recent Catalysts and News

In the last several days, the news flow around Société Générale has been relatively sparse in terms of blockbuster headlines, but not entirely devoid of signals. Earlier this week, sector wide commentary on European banks from major brokers highlighted French lenders as a mixed bag, citing solid capital buffers but also warning about margin pressure as the rate cycle turns. Société Générale often featured in those notes as a restructuring story with more moving parts than some peers.

More recently, French press and international financial media picked up on incremental updates around the bank’s cost cutting program and simplification of its business portfolio. While there were no new transformational deals or large scale disposals announced in the last few days, analysts continued to reference management’s prior commitments on reducing risk weighted assets and focusing on core franchises such as French retail, corporate and investment banking, and its African operations.

Because there has been no fresh quarterly earnings release or major management change in the past week, trading has been driven mostly by macro headlines, rate expectations, and shifting views on the overall European banking sector. In that sense, Société Générale has behaved more like a macro proxy than a single stock with unique news. If the news drought persists, the market may continue to treat it as part of a basket trade on euro area growth and capital requirements rather than a company specific story.

Should the current lull in company specific headlines extend beyond the next reporting cycle, traders will increasingly talk about a consolidation phase, with low volatility and declining volumes as investors wait for the next catalyst. For short term players, such phases are often frustrating, but for longer term buyers they can be an opportunity to build positions away from the noise that follows big announcements.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

The analyst community remains genuinely split on Société Générale, and the last month of research updates has not resolved that divide. According to recent reports surfaced via Bloomberg and MarketWatch, houses such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank have adjusted their views on European banks, with Société Générale typically sitting in the middle of their recommendation spectrums.

Goldman Sachs, in its latest coverage of large euro area banks, keeps a neutral stance on Société Générale, effectively a Hold, with a price target that sits somewhat above the current market price but not enough to suggest a high conviction Buy. Their analysts emphasise the potential for capital return through dividends and buybacks, but flag execution risk around disposals and the cost base.

JPMorgan’s most recent note on French banks, issued within the last few weeks, takes a slightly more constructive angle, tilting toward an overweight view for investors who can tolerate restructuring risk. Their price objective points to a more meaningful upside relative to today’s level, but is still framed within a broader caution about the sector’s sensitivity to growth and regulation.

Deutsche Bank and UBS, meanwhile, have tended to hover around Hold on Société Générale, with price targets clustered in a band bracketing the current quote. They highlight that valuation multiples, based on price to tangible book value and earnings, look undemanding compared with history and some peers, yet they hesitate to move to full Buy recommendations until they see a cleaner earnings trajectory and further delivery on the strategic plan.

Aggregating those perspectives, the Street verdict can best be described as a guarded Hold with pockets of selective Buy. The consensus target price sits comfortably above the present trading price, pointing to moderate upside, but the language in the notes makes clear that this is a show me story rather than a blind faith bet. For retail investors reading between the lines, that means analysts see potential, but they also see enough ways for the story to disappoint that they are not pounding the table.

Future Prospects and Strategy

Société Générale’s business model is a complex blend of French retail banking, corporate and investment banking, international retail franchises and specialised financial services. The strategic thrust in recent years has been to simplify this portfolio, shed non core or capital intensive activities, and redeploy resources toward areas where the bank can earn attractive returns without stretching its balance sheet.

Looking ahead, several factors will determine whether the stock breaks decisively higher or slips back toward the lower end of its 52 week range. First, the interest rate environment remains crucial: a faster than expected easing cycle in Europe could compress net interest margins faster than management can offset through volume growth or cost savings. Second, the credibility of the cost cutting and restructuring agenda will be tested quarter by quarter, as investors demand concrete evidence of improved efficiency rather than merely promises.

Third, regulatory and political risk in France and the wider euro area will continue to cast a shadow. Any shift in capital requirements or banking sector taxes can quickly change the earnings equation for institutions like Société Générale. On the positive side, the bank’s relatively strong capital ratios and its track record of managing through past crises provide a cushion that value investors take seriously.

In the coming months, the most plausible base case is a stock that fluctuates within a broad band, with occasional bursts of optimism around results or strategic milestones. If management delivers cleaner earnings, hits its capital and cost targets, and avoids fresh controversy, the market could gradually rerate the shares toward the upper half of their recent range. If, however, macro conditions deteriorate or the restructuring drags on without clear payoff, the patience of today’s cautious optimists may wear thin, and the balance of sentiment could tilt back toward the bears.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404989_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 18:13:34.990349

The Ministry of SMEs and Startups (MSS) has joined hands with HP to bring Silicon Valley’s “garage innovation” model to Korean soil. Through the AroundX global open innovation program, the partnership will enable Korean startups in AI and data science to build, test, and scale with real-world access to HP’s global networks and technology base.

MSS and HP Sign MOU to Accelerate AI and Data Startups

Vice Minister Noh Yong-seok of the Ministry of SMEs and Startups met with David McQuarrie, Chief Commercial Officer of HP Inc., at HP’s U.S. headquarters on January 9 (local time) to discuss collaboration in the startup sector.

Following the meeting, the Korea Institute of Startup and Entrepreneurship Development (KISED) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with HP to jointly operate the AroundX Global Corporate Collaboration Program, marking HP’s official participation in the initiative starting 2026.

Under the agreement, both sides will strengthen cooperation to enhance the global competitiveness of Korean startups in AI and data science and support their entry into international markets through HP Garage 2.0, the company’s global open innovation and startup acceleration platform.

The Garage Spirit Meets AroundX

HP’s participation represents more than a corporate alliance, reflecting a bridge between Korea’s policy-driven innovation model and Silicon Valley’s entrepreneurial DNA.

HP has operated its “HP Garage 2.0” program to cultivate startups based on the founding spirit of its 1939 Palo Alto garage, long regarded as the birthplace of Silicon Valley. The program connects early-stage innovators to HP’s R&D infrastructure and commercialization expertise across the global market.

By localizing HP Garage 2.0 through AroundX, the MSS aims to translate the symbolic “garage innovation” culture into a structured Korean model—where startups receive both policy backing and corporate collaboration under a single framework.

Statements from the Stakeholders on the Partnerships

David McQuarrie, Chief Commercial Officer of HP, said:

“Korea has one of the most dynamic ecosystems in AI and data science. Through this partnership, we will leverage HP’s global network and technological capabilities to collaborate with outstanding Korean startups and create new innovation opportunities.”

Noh Yong-seok, First Vice Minister of SMEs and Startups, stated:

“It is deeply meaningful to work with HP, a company that embodies the entrepreneurial spirit that created Silicon Valley. Through the AroundX ‘HP Garage 2.0’ program, we aim to help Korean startups expand globally and foster the next generation of world-class companies.”

How AroundX Becomes the Core of Korea’s Global Innovation Network

The AroundX Program, launched by the MSS in 2019, has grown into one of Korea’s most comprehensive public–private platforms for cross-border startup cooperation. It connects domestic startups with multinational corporations such as NVIDIA, Microsoft, AWS, Oracle, and Intel, enabling proof-of-concept (PoC) projects, co-marketing, and localized R&D collaboration.

With HP joining alongside OpenAI, Mercedes-Benz, and Astellas, the program now extends across AI, mobility, and biotechnology. AroundX’s evolution represents Korea’s broader transition from isolated pilot projects to ecosystem-level global partnerships—where collaboration becomes an operating model, not a single event.

Transforming Startup Diplomacy into Global Infrastructure

HP’s collaboration with the MSS marks a deeper layer of Korea’s global startup expansion strategy. It moves policy cooperation beyond memorandums and conferences into sustained, structural partnerships.

For AI and data startups, this alliance provides practical access to HP’s research ecosystem and international markets, while for Korea, it symbolizes the transformation of its startup policy from government-driven support to co-owned global execution.

Industry analysts view the AroundX–HP partnership as a case study in how governments can transform startup diplomacy into global infrastructure—linking Korea’s venture ecosystem to the innovation networks of Silicon Valley, Europe, and beyond.

Turning Policy into Practice

The Korea–HP partnership demonstrates that global innovation is no longer confined to regional clusters. By embedding HP Garage 2.0 into Korea’s AroundX framework, the Ministry of SMEs and Startups is creating a new template for public–private co-development.

For Korean founders and investors, this partnership represents access not just to mentorship but to the infrastructure of global commercialization. It also reaffirms Korea’s trajectory toward becoming a deep-tech hub of the Asia-Pacific, where government policy, corporate innovation, and startup ambition meet in a shared ecosystem of scale.",https://koreatechdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Korea-and-HP-Unite-to-Build-the-Next-Global-AI-Powerhouses-Through-AroundX-and-Garage-2.0.-COVER.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 18:59:28.516747

The foundation AI model company’s Claude for Healthcare offering comes on the heels of Claude for Life Sciences, which it launched in October. The announcement, made in conjunction with the kickoff of the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, marks Anthropic’s continued foray into regulated, high-stakes clinical environments.

Claude for Healthcare features HIPAA-ready infrastructure for enterprise customers, models trained specifically for healthcare and life sciences tasks and native integrations to commonly-used medical and scientific databases, including the CMS Coverage Database, ICD-10 codes and PubMed, according to the company.

The AI safety and research company also announced new capabilities for life sciences, extending from preclinical R&D into clinical operations and regulatory affairs.

The new capabilities mark Anthropic’s first foray in healthcare, but the company clearly sees big opportunities in the space.

Healthcare and life sciences represent one of Anthropic’s largest bets, Eric Kauderer-Abrams, head of biology and life sciences at Anthropic, told Fierce Healthcare.

The company's move into healthcare follows OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Health last week, which is a hub to let users upload their medical records, as well as OpenAI for Healthcare as a suite of tools for healthcare enterprises.

Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI executives and senior research staff in 2021, developed a family of large language models called Claude.

Claude for Healthcare is built around Anthropic’s existing AI models but with connections to tools like medical databases and coding systems that make medical information easier to find, access and understand. With a HIPAA-ready infrastructure, healthcare organizations can deploy Claude for workflows involving protected health information like prior authorization for the first time, according to executives.

“These are not new models or even new products. What we're announcing is a coherent set of connectors so that Claude our models and Claude our products, however you're accessing Claude, whether it's through the chat interface or through Claude code or our enterprise offering, have the connections to the tools that professionals in healthcare and life sciences are using every day so that it can accelerate all the work they're doing, have all the context that they need to have and be present as a collaborator throughout the whole process, and function as a real amplifier of human capabilities,” Kauderer-Abrams said.

He added, “Our approach is to build useful tools and connections and make sure that our models are at a superhuman-level in all these use cases for payers, providers and health systems and for consumers as well. For life sciences, it’s about making sure that our models have skills spanning everything from the early-stage discovery through translation and commercialization, and that they connect to the tools that scientists and life science professionals are using every day.”

Kauderer-Abrams stressed that Anthropic is laser-focused on supporting AI for enterprise customers in healthcare rather than consumer health applications.

The company asserts that its commitment to building safe, responsible AI makes it uniquely suited to work with health systems, hospitals, payers and other healthcare organizations.

“Anthropic is a very natural fit for the healthcare and life sciences world because our identity as an AI company is built around safety and responsibility and rigor and reproducibility, and these are all the central tenants of the healthcare and life sciences industries,” he noted.

There are a number of pharma companies, health systems and startups already using Claude’s suite of LLMs—Banner Health, Stanford Healthcare, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi, AbbVie and Genmab—to automate administrative workflows like clinical documentation, regulatory submissions and clinical trial analysis.

“We were drawn to Anthropic's focus on AI safety and Claude's Constitutional AI approach to creating more helpful, harmless, and honest AI systems,” said Mike Reagin, chief technology officer at Banner Health, in a statement.

“Safety is non-negotiable in healthcare. Anthropic has been a clear leader in building models with strong safety foundations,” said Justin Norden, M.D., co-founder of startup Qualified Health.

“A big piece of the challenge of using AI in healthcare is there's basically no room for error. The cost of hallucinations, for example, or even the cost of non-reproducible analyzes is very high. We’ve done a lot of work to solve those problems,” Kauderer-Abrams said.

Anthropic uses specific technical methods during production model training to reduce the frequency of hallucinations and works to ensure that the results pulled from medical databases are accurate, cited and reproducible, he noted.

Anthropic boosted its life sciences AI leadership when it brought Kauderer-Abrams on board six months ago. The executive’s resume includes co-founding several computational biology startups.

With Claude for Healthcare, enterprise healthcare integrations now enable Claude to pull information from industry-standard systems and databases, meaning that clinicians and administrators can save time finding the data and generating the reports they need, executives said. Claude now connects to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Coverage Database, including both Local and National Coverage Determinations. This enables Claude to verify coverage requirements, support prior auth workflows, reduce claim denials and surface regional coverage differences, according to the company.

Claude also connects to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) to look up both diagnosis and procedure codes to support medical coding, billing accuracy and claims management; the National Provider Identifier Registry, to help with provider verification, credentialing, networking directory management and claims validation; as well as PubMed, which provides access to more than 35 million pieces of biomedical literature.

The company also added new Agent Skills for FHIR Development to help developers connect healthcare systems faster and with fewer errors, improving the interoperability of medical data, executives said.

Claude for Healthcare’s HIPAA-ready infrastructure gives healthcare organizations a “plug-and-play” solution, Kauderer-Abrams said.

“A big part about being useful in healthcare and life sciences is respecting the intense compliance requirements that are there, and with good reason. We’re offering our solutions in a HIPAA-compliant way so that you can build applications around them, and so that you can do so in a way that respects all the relevant regulations. We're also the only major foundation model that's available through all of the major cloud providers,” he said.

The new AI tools available through Claude can support healthcare startups building new products as well as large enterprise health systems looking to integrate AI deeply into their operations, the company claims. By quickly pulling relevant information from coverage requirements, patient records and clinical guidelines, these AI resources can help organizations with time-intensive, burdensome administrative tasks like prior authorization requests and claims appeals and can also support care coordination and triage patient messages, Anthropic executives said.

“It’s really about amplifying the capabilities of the professionals in these healthcare organizations, so allowing you to be more productive, and allowing AI to take some of the grunt work off your plate and do it more efficiently and quickly. There is a huge amount of headroom to be had in terms of lessening the administrative burden,” Kauderer-Abrams said. “It's about the model being useful end-to-end, throughout all the processes, connecting to the tools that you use in your enterprise, operating in it natively as you do.”

Claude for Healthcare also includes consumer health integrations to enable individuals to share their health information as well as fitness and wellness data from different apps. Individuals can use Claude to summarize their medical history, understand test results in plain language, spot patterns across fitness and health metrics or prep questions for doctor appointments, according to Anthropic.

In the U.S., Claude Pro and Max plan subscribers can give Claude secure access to their lab results and health records. New HealthEx and Function connectors are now available in beta, while Apple Health and Android Health Connect integrations are rolling out in beta this week via the Claude iOS and Android apps.

Providers and healthcare companies have long had ambitions to collect patients’ health information all in one place—a longitudinal health record that makes it easier for patients to manage their health. But it’s been a bumpy road. Microsoft and Google both launched personal health record offerings but then shut them down.

Kauderer-Abrams is bullish that AI can finally make this happen.

“I’m excited about this idea of taking all of the context that you have about patients that are scattered throughout all these different places and having one system that can consolidate it all and connect natively into all the tools that are present in these healthcare systems to make care delivery more effective and more efficient,” he said. “Maybe we were all a bit misguided in trying to put all of the health at records in one place. That's too hard. Make the models go and do the hard work of figuring out how to interface and communicate and make sure all the connections are in place. That’s why I'm optimistic that the problem is solvable now is that there's been this unlocking intelligence.”

On the life sciences side, Anthropic is adding connectors to clinical trial solutions company Medidata, ClinicalTrials.gov, life sciences preprint servers bioRxiv & medRxiv, Open Targets, ChEMBL and Owkin.

The existing life sciences connectors include Benchling, 10x Genomics, PubMed, BioRender, Synapse.org and Wiley Scholar Gateway.

“On the life sciences side, I'm really excited to get to the point where you can have Claude as that collaborator through all stages of the R&D process and where Claude can take on increasingly large chunks of work and be increasingly autonomous,” Kauderer-Abrams said.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/Logo%20card%20-%20Multi%20-%20Clay.jpg?VersionId=U.PpJDP4VGU9aZFbHX7IguNEHItqxH5T,N,,2026-01-11 18:13:31.002966

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

ID25,J&J,2026-01-11 19:03:06+00:00,The Athletic,How Ben Johnson inspired the Bears to pull off a historic playoff comeback - The Athletic,Kevin Fishbain,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6961024/2026/01/11/bears-ben-johnson-playoff-comeback/,"“I said it to you at halftime,” Johnson told the team in his postgame speech, “this is one you’ll never forget.
This is one you’ll never forget.” As he has often been in his first season as head coach, Johnson was right.
But what does that mean to a Bears team that scored 10 points in two minutes to beat Green Bay in Week 16?
“So this one meant something to us.” The rivalry is alive and well, and the Bears’ coach is fanning its flames.
To his first playoff win as Chicago Bears head coach.” Williams gave the ball to Johnson and the two embraced.","CHICAGO — When the Chicago Bears faced an 18-point halftime deficit and had been thoroughly dominated for two quarters, head coach Ben Johnson had an ambitious message for his team.

“We’re gonna have the greatest comeback in Bears history,” tight end Cole Kmet said, relaying Johnson’s halftime proclamation after the 31-27 wild-card win against the Green Bay Packers. “And we did.”

The 2025 Bears are accustomed to comeback wins, but this?

The Packers had averaged 7.2 yards per play through two quarters. Quarterback Jordan Love already had three touchdown passes. Four Packers had a run for more than 10 yards — the Bears’ longest run went for 9 yards.

Quarterback Caleb Williams was 8-for-17 passing with an interception. Green Bay was 3-for-3 in the red zone. The Bears were 4-for-9 on third down. Starting linebacker T.J. Edwards left the game and would not return.

And the Packers would start the second half with the football.

“I said it to you at halftime,” Johnson told the team in his postgame speech, “this is one you’ll never forget. This is one you’ll never forget.”

As he has often been in his first season as head coach, Johnson was right.

This is a team that has prided itself on not flinching and not panicking. At times in the first half, it didn’t look that way, whether it was offensive miscues, turning it over on downs, or giving up big plays. But Johnson leaned on the experience and belief they had to rally back. The message hit.

“It was the only option we had was to go out there and be legendary, to go out there and execute, to go out there and do our part on the offensive side, defensive side and special teams,” Williams said. “Have each other’s back, go win the effing game.”

During training camp, Johnson showed the team Super Bowl LI, when the New England Patriots came back from a 28-3 deficit to beat the Atlanta Falcons, 34-28.

Defensive tackle Grady Jarrett played for the Falcons that day, and guard Joe Thuney played for the Patriots. Johnson had those players speak about their perspectives.

“It’s a good lesson to be learned that you know it’s 28-3 in the middle of the third quarter and yet the game still being played, there’s a lot of time left,” Johnson said Saturday night. “That was my message to the group was just reminding them that this has been done before and rather than saying, ‘Woe is me’ and ‘Crap, we’re in a hole,’ it’s more this is a great opportunity for us to turn this thing around into a game that we’ll never forget, and that’s what he did.”

When he told them to do something legendary, he could remind them of that Super Bowl. Anything can happen.

Kmet said the response wasn’t necessarily a rah-rah but more business-like.

“It’s just like all right,” he said, “let’s go do it.”

They had done it time and time again, including against this Packers team in this building three weeks earlier. Belief wasn’t an issue. That had been built.

When the defense forced three consecutive punts and the offense responded with only six points, though, that hope could waver.

But that’s where Johnson’s other message came in: one play at a time. That’s a familiar one to the players.

“That’s the message since April; it hasn’t changed,” Kmet said. “And every play matters and your assignment, doing your job matters, and that’s stressed and that’s highlighted. You know, not only the big plays that are made down the field by the guys with the ball in their hands, but you know, by the guys on the back side of the play, what they’re doing. That matters just as much, and that’s stressed, that’s emphasized. I think everyone in here takes it to heart.”

Running back D’Andre Swift’s touchdown with 10 minutes to go, which cut the deficit to 21-16, got the stadium rocking. They chipped away, played complementary football, and suddenly it was a whole new ballgame.

Then the Packers went up 11 points on the ensuing drive. But what does that mean to a Bears team that scored 10 points in two minutes to beat Green Bay in Week 16? They just had to go one play at a time.

“Every team’s different, but certainly it seemed to resonate with those guys, you know,” Johnson said. “And they did a great job. The only way you come back from a deficit like that is one possession at a time, trying to get more points on the scoreboard. Continuing to hold them and get the ball back to the offense.

“Special teams played a major factor in this game as well throughout. And so, yeah, you got no other choice. You’re not gonna get it all back all in one shot. And so yeah, just keep plugging along. And I think we had a couple field goals to get us going a little bit. And then the touchdowns eventually broke the dam.”

The players had to make sensational plays, like Williams’ throw to receiver Rome Odunze on fourth down and the touchdown to receiver DJ Moore, the defensive stops and pressure that forced Jordan Love to get out of his comfort zone.

Don’t tell the players they’re the benefit of luck, either. They’ve won this way too many times.

“To be in those situations and to come out victorious, it’s no fluke,” Williams said. “It’s no, ‘Oh, this happened, we’re lucky.’ We’ve done it multiple times this year. It’s been proven for us to be a great second-half team.”

Even trailing by three scores at halftime when it seemed like nothing was working, they knew if they could just get it to a one-score game…

“No f—ing panic,” Johnson said in the postgame celebration. “Built for pressure. That’s you guys.”

Johnson doesn’t show much emotion on the sideline. It creates quite the juxtaposition between in-game Johnson and postgame Johnson, yelling the team’s victory mantra, “Good, better, best.”

But after this win, the largest comeback in franchise postseason history, Johnson pumped his fist. He celebrated with Odunze, falling to the ground.

Sure, why wouldn’t he finally let loose and celebrate his first playoff win? But Johnson likes to be the same guy no matter what. This one had extra meaning.

“There was probably a bit more noise coming out of their building up north to start the week, which we heard loud and clear, players and coaches alike,” he said. “So this one meant something to us.”

The rivalry is alive and well, and the Bears’ coach is fanning its flames. He got the last laugh, so why not?

After Williams received a game ball from Johnson, he turned to his head coach and addressed the team.

“Everything he’s done for us as a coach, everything the other coaches have done for us — it started with him bringing everyone in,” he said. “For me personally, he’s been — (I’m) getting emotional — monumental in my life so far. To his first playoff win as Chicago Bears head coach.”

Williams gave the ball to Johnson and the two embraced. It’s a duo Bears fans hope can be playing football deep into January for a long time. This is just Year 1, and on a night when most would have counted them out, Williams and his teammates answered their coach’s message at halftime.

They completed the greatest postseason comeback in Bears history.

“We got a group of guys that just, they don’t waver if the odds are stacked against us,” Johnson said. “Despite the fact that we don’t like that score at halftime, nobody does. No one envisioned the first 30 minutes going that way. And yet, we just keep plugging along and we keep fighting. And we’ve proven that this year. That’s who we are and that’s what we do here at this point.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/11034337/USATSI_27982812-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-11 14:59:20.572361

Jensen Huang explains why the AI ""bubble"" debate misses the point

Fears about the AI bubble are growing louder as spending numbers surge and stock valuations skyrocket.

For perspective, Nvidia stock boasts a market cap of about $4.5 trillion, having added more than $1 trillion since the start of 2025.

Despite those jaw-dropping figures, Huang feels investors are looking at it the wrong way. He says what looks like excess is actually the early phase of a deeper shift in computing itself.

Clearly, AI spending is enormous, which can be seen from the latest capex figures from the Big 3 hyperscalers:

Amazon (AWS): CFO Brian Olsavsky said the tech giant expects full-year 2025 capex of nearly $125 billion (and higher in 2026), largely due to AI projects, Reuters reported.

Microsoft (Azure): Microsoft reported nearly $35 billion in capex in its fiscal Q1 2026, according to Reuters, warning that spending will continue rising as it builds AI data-center capacity.

Alphabet (Google Cloud): Alphabet bumped 2025 capex guidance to a whopping $91 billion to $93 billion, linked to AI/cloud demand. (Source:Reuters)

Additionally, Huang describes AI as a wholesale shift from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing, spearheaded by AI agents, models, and applications that are layered above that foundation.

Additionally, Huang pushed back on the concerns that Nvidia’s ecosystem investing creates some systemic risk.

Given the current dynamics, TSMC controls the bottlenecks in the AI supply chain, and that rare pricing power is showing its fundamentals.

As of Q3 2025, HBM made up a massive 57% of sales, with its cutting-edge 3nm nodes at 23% of wafer sales only a few quarters into ramp.

Also, as we witness a ramp-up in 2nm wafer production soon, and them being priced over $30,000 along with 5%–10% hikes on sub-5nm nodes, customers like Nvidia and Apple have little choice but to pay.

Located on Shanley Street, the property footprint has a total site area of 66,960m2, building improvements of 15,702m2, and a permit approved for further development.
The company successfully applied for a permit to construct another 7000m2 building out the front of the existing building.
""There is three megawatts of power that goes into the building and it has its own substation,"" Mr Noble said.
To rebuild the property, Mr Noble said the cost would be about $30m and the owners would like $15m to basically cover their acquisition costs and what they've put into it.","One of Wangaratta's largest industrial buildings that was originally built by IBM in the 1970s is up for sale with a price tag of $15 million.

Located on Shanley Street, the property footprint has a total site area of 66,960m2, building improvements of 15,702m2, and a permit approved for further development.

Mike Noble, director at Garry Nash and Co Real Estate, said the property was bought by Bathla in Sydney in March 2022 with plans to build pod bathrooms out of Wangaratta.

The company successfully applied for a permit to construct another 7000m2 building out the front of the existing building.

The company bought up a portfolio of properties after Covid, however, when the building industry was impacted by the tough economy it decided to put multiple properties on the market, including Wangaratta.

""They got in there and tied up the building and carried out a lot of cosmetic improvements to parts of it that hadn't been used since Solectron were in there prior to Bruck,"" Mr Noble said.

He said a lot of the activity in regional areas is being driven by the broader regional economies rather than out of Melbourne.

However, when Garry Nash and Co first had it on the market and sold it previously there was a lot of activity from metropolitan occupiers.

""There is three megawatts of power that goes into the building and it has its own substation,"" Mr Noble said.

""It could be appealing to a lot of the occupancies in Melbourne that don't have a decent power supply for manufacturing or other operations.""

From a rental or occupancy cost perspective, regional areas are about half the price of metropolitan areas.

""Rent for the Shanley Street site would be around $80-$100 a square metre but it would be double that in Melbourne,"" Mr Noble said.

""Land tax is cheaper and there is still the 50 per cent stamp duty concession for commercial, industrial and extractive industry sales regionally and on this property it could equate to $200,000.""

To rebuild the property, Mr Noble said the cost would be about $30m and the owners would like $15m to basically cover their acquisition costs and what they've put into it.

He noted that it would be a challenge for an investor to buy it and secure tenants as there are almost 16,000m2 under roof, however if the operator had a purpose to use most of it, there is greater potential to lease out the remainder.

If an already operating business views the property as fit for purpose it would be ideal as Mr Noble said land is at a premium and even if you had the land you couldn't build what's there.

A RICH MANUFACTURING PAST

The building originated when IBM arrived in Wangaratta in 1976 with the intention of manufacturing electric typewriters and the facilities at the Shanley Street site were constructed in 1978-79 where the manufacture of personal computers began in 1983.

At the time it was only the third plant in the world to produce IBM PCs.

IBM sold the facility to Australia's privately held Bluegum Technology in November 1997, with the Wangaratta workforce continuing to manufacture computers under contract from IBM, followed in 1998 by a $250m contract from Alcatel.

In June 2000 however, the high-tech manufacturing plant passed into foreign hands, acquired by the US-listed electronics giant, Solectron Corporation.

In a devastating blow to the city, Solectron closed the manufacturing plant in 2001, resulting in the loss of 220 local jobs.

Bruck Group acquired the facilities some years later to use as an Australian base for Wilson Fabrics, prior to selling the site to its current owners in 2022.",https://images.wangarattachronicle.com.au/view/acePublic/alias/contentid/1odz7l5ecxm5hmxya4p/0/shanleystbuildingsale_image001_58603-jpg.jpeg?f=3%3A2,N,,2026-01-11 14:14:20.017936

An instant checkout function will allow customers to make purchases from some businesses and through a range of payment providers without leaving the Gemini chat they used to find products, according to Walmart and Google.

The news was announced on the first day of the National Retail Federation's annual convention in New York. The role of artificial intelligence in e-commerce and its impact on consumer behavior are expected to dominate the three-day event.

""The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,"" John Furner, Walmart's incoming president and CEO, said in a joint statement with Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichaei.

Google's new AI shopping feature works this way: if a customer asks what gear to get for a winter ski trip, for example, Gemini will return items from a participating retailers' inventory.

In the case of Walmart, customers who link their Walmart and Gemini accounts will receive recommendations based on their past purchases, and any products they decide to buy via the chatbot could get combined with their existing Walmart or Sam's Club online shopping carts, according to the statement.

OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use an instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart's website except for fresh food.

Google, OpenAI and Amazon all are racing to create tools that would allow for seamless AI-powered shopping by taking chatbot users from browsing to buying within the same program instead of having to go to a retailer's website to complete a purchase. The race between OpenAI and Google has heated up in recent months.

Before the recent holiday shopping season, OpenAI launched an instant checkout feature within ChatGPT that allows users to buy products from select retailers and Etsy sellers without leaving the app.

San Francisco software company Salesforce estimated that AI influenced $272 billion, or 20%, of all global retail sales, in one way or another during the holiday shopping season.

Today, Walmart Inc. and Google share plans to launch a new experience that pairs the intelligence of Google's Gemini with Walmart and Sam's Club's unmatched assortment, value and convenience, to make shopping more intuitive, reliable and perfectly aligned with the rhythms of everyday life. The new experience — built by Walmart and accessible directly within Gemini using the Universal Commerce Protocol — addresses several key customer needs:

Great items, at great prices: Gemini will automatically include Walmart and Sam's Club in-store and online products when it's relevant. For example, when a customer asks for advice on camping equipment for the spring season, it will return items from the retailer's large inventory of products. And since people talk back-and-forth with Gemini, there are more opportunities to show relevant products and services throughout the conversation.

Personalization and familiarity: When customers discover items in Gemini, Walmart helps them move from inspiration to purchase in a seamless, trusted experience — all within the familiar Walmart and Sam's environments they know and love. When customers link their accounts, Walmart will recommend complementary items based on their past online and in-store purchases, combine their order with other items they've put in their Walmart or Sam's Club carts, and provide all the benefits of their Walmart+ and Sam's Club memberships.

Fast delivery: Customers and members can get in-store and club items delivered right where and when they want it, with hundreds of thousands of locally curated products delivered in under three hours and as fast as 30 minutes.

""The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail.

Born in Cranston, she was the beloved daughter of the late Vincenzo and Teresa (Fusco) Soscia, she was predeceased by her husband of 70 years, Arthur C. Micallef. Rosalie was the devoted mother of Arthur A. Micallef and his wife Beverly, Gregory E. Micallef, and Susan Micallef- Burke, and the proud matriarch of 5 grandchildren and 6 great grandchildren. The youngest of 9 children, “PeeWee” grew up in a home filled with love and commotion, a much simpler era, in the heart of then rural Knightsville, with deeply rooted traditions. One in particular, the Feast of the Madonna Della Civita, was always, and remains still, an integral part of our family heritage. As an outstanding student at Cranston High School, she was nominated for two “superlatives”. Regulations allowed acceptance of only one, Rosalie chose “most athletic” over “most popular”. During World War II, as part of “the greatest generation”, while her husband flew in combat missions over Europe, Rosalie worked at the Fields Point Shipyard in Providence, now the site of Johnson & Wales Culinary Campus. As avid golfers, she and Arthur were founding members of the original Alpine Club, from its humble beginnings as a Social Club on Oaklawn Avenue in Cranston, now the location of the Immaculate Conception Church, to the elaborate Golf/ Country Club that it is today. With Rosalie’s inherent homemaking skills, the Micallef household was home to endless festivities from traditional Christmas and Family Sunday dinners to boisterous New Year’s parties- favored by Rosie and Art’s closest friends for “best food/ most fun”. In her late fifties, Rosalie decided to go to college and graduated from URI in 1981 with a degree in Communications. She utilized her education to advocate for everyday citizens while with the RI Attorney General’s Consumer Unit Division. Also, over many years, she and her husband traveled extensively throughout Europe and Asia. They enabled their entire family to enjoy “Italy with Gerard”, and over 30 summers of fun at Bonnett Shores Beach Club. Truly special were year-round getaways to their White Mountains New Hampshire home, which they generously opened up to family, friends, and neighbors. Lastly, and befittingly, Rosalie achieved her final goal: to pass peacefully in her home of over 80 years. So, here’s to “a life well lived”! We raise a glass to Rosie – a very dry martini. Salute! The Micallef family wishes to acknowledge, with great appreciation, the exceptional personal care Rosalie received especially from Victoria, her truly dearest friend and primary care giver for over 11 years, and also the more recent assistance from “angels” Carrie, Verna, Quella, and Amanda.

The idea of the US decoupling from China is flawed, the CEO of American tech giant Nvidia, Jensen Huang, has said, highlighting that the economic and technological ties binding Beijing and Washington remain far deeper than widely perceived.

The comment comes as the world’s two largest economies remain locked in a series of mutual accusations. Washington has repeatedly accused China of unfair practices such as intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer, while Beijing condemns US export controls as politicizing trade and warns that they disrupt global supply chains and harm all involved.

“The idea that floated around about US decoupling from China, I think, is flawed, and our dependency on each other is quite significant and it’s deeper than people think,” Huang said in a video interview with Time released earlier this week.

The executive also highlighted the global dependence of the artificial intelligence (AI) sector on “the brilliant students and the brilliant scientists of China.” Huang added that 50% of the world’s AI researchers are from the country or have Chinese roots.

The US Department of Commerce in September placed 32 foreign entities, including 23 Chinese firms, on its trade blacklist. Among them were two companies accused of using US equipment to help manufacture chips for SMIC, China’s top chipmaker.

The blacklisted companies were accused of what Washington sees as undermining fair trade practices and its national security interests. Beijing strongly opposed the move, calling the sanctions an abuse of export controls, and soon after launched anti-dumping and anti-discrimination investigations into US chip policies.

US export controls on advanced AI chips, including Nvidia’s H200, a China-specific AI chip, had been implemented under national security rules for years, effectively restricting shipments to China. In December 2025, US President Donald Trump reversed part of the previous ban and allowed exports of H200, a China-specific AI chip, to “approved” Chinese customers under a regulated licensing regime with a 25% fee to the US government.

Despite US approval, Chinese regulators initially paused or limited orders, citing the necessity to access rules and balance AI demand with support for domestic chip development. Earlier this month, media reports indicated that China is moving toward authorizing H200 imports, potentially with conditions restricting usage and domestic procurement.

Once the expansion is complete, Wing will operate from more than 270 Walmart stores, including Los Angeles, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Miami and serve about 10% of the U.S. population.
The companies first partnered in 2023, launching a pilot program to test on-demand drone delivery at two stores in the Dallas metro area that reached about 60,000 homes.
But in general, she said Wing is focused on co-locating its service at Walmart sites and integrating into their operations.","Wing, the Alphabet-owned company that delivers groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and hot lattes, is expanding its partnership with Walmart for the second time in less than a year.

The two companies announced on Sunday plans to bring the on-demand drone delivery service to an additional 150 Walmart stores. The rollout, which builds off existing services at stores in Dallas-Fort Worth and Atlanta, will occur throughout this year and into 2027, Wing’s new chief business officer Heather Rivera told TechCrunch.

The expansion suggests customers are using Wing’s drone delivery service enough to warrant growth. Rivera said its top 25% customers are using the service three times a week. Some of the most commonly ordered items are eggs, ground beef, fresh tomatoes, avocados, limes, lunchables, and snacks such as Takis.

The 150-store expansion announcement follows plans shared in June 2025 to launch in Houston, Orlando, Tampa, and Charlotte. Rivera said Wing will launch in Houston on January 15. Once the expansion is complete, Wing will operate from more than 270 Walmart stores, including Los Angeles, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Miami and serve about 10% of the U.S. population.

The announcement places the former Google X project firmly in the commercial enterprise category. And while Wing does have a partnership with DoorDash, its primary path to commercial operations has been, and still is, through Walmart.

The companies first partnered in 2023, launching a pilot program to test on-demand drone delivery at two stores in the Dallas metro area that reached about 60,000 homes. The program later grew to 18 Walmart Supercenters in Dallas-Fort Worth and more recently spread to stores in Atlanta.

Wing will continue to evolve its technology and operations, according to Rivera; the company recently completed the first commercial flights for its larger aircraft that can carry a five-pound payload, for instance. But in general, she said Wing is focused on co-locating its service at Walmart sites and integrating into their operations.

Rivera said Wing will likely try a couple of different approaches to scaling its operations like clustering store openings. It’s an approach Wing used last year when it launched six stores together in Atlanta. Rivera would not share if its operations are profitable or when they might be. But Rivera did note she was brought in to scale the business.

“And so that is what I’m here to do, and excited about,” she said, later noting that “volume is definitely powering our flywheel.” In other words, scaling to as many stores in as many markets as possible is critical for its business economics.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ywvle5Kwp1vgvDo3XvqfLQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_finance_785/0969698a0cfb05dcbb640eb64ebd0ed6,N,,2026-01-11 14:59:36.719771

“No local Austin taxpayer dollars are used to fund the airport’s expansion program.”","ONE of America’s busiest airports has finalized expansion plans with airlines to nearly double its capacity.

The huge project is expected to cost a whopping $5 billion and will take years to complete.

Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas has completed a new use and land agreement (ULA) with its airlines, finalizing how they will be impacted by the expansion.

The major airport is set to almost double its capacity with 32 gates being added to the site that currently has 34.

Initial plans stated an increase by 20 gates which was then renegotiated.

To cater for the arrival, a major new concourse will be constructed.

Concourse B will host 26 of the new gates and will oversee domestic flights only.

The original concourse will be for international and domestic flights, according to Aviation Week.

Meanwhile, the six other new gates will be part of a small, standalone terminal – Concourse M.

“Concourse M will support construction phasing, accommodate new airline entrants and provide operational flexibility for irregular operations, including off-schedule and diverted flights,” airport execs said.

Under the finalized ULA with airlines, carriers will be assigned the new gates gradually over the next decade.

Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines, the airport’s leading carriers, are expected to benefit the most from the expansion.

They will control half of the airport’s total gates once the project is complete.

Other signatories of the ULA include United, American and Alaska Airlines, all of which have agreed to continue operations at the airport for at least the next ten years.

The entire project is expected to be completed by the early 2030s.

As well as the new gates, it also includes the construction of a tunnel connecting the concourses, taxiways, and upgrades to the existing concourse.

The ULA “reflects years of partnership, thoughtful negotiations and shared vision with our airline partners,” the airport’s CEO Ghizlane Badawi said.

“The program, and all associated projects, are funded through traditional airport development funding sources, such as airport cash reserves, current and future airport revenues, future revenue bond proceeds and FAA grants,” said airport execs.

“No local Austin taxpayer dollars are used to fund the airport’s expansion program.”",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2026/01/newspress-collage-qdu3lft9j-1767947907842.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1767929928&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2026-01-11 13:59:34.063321

Additionally, Delta passengers faced numerous setbacks at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. The disruptions left some Delta passengers stranded for days.

One person wrote, ""I was one of those stuck in ATL. My layover was 14 hours!""

Another person commented, ""My daughter was stranded at Shiphol airport from Saturday to Tuesday. After 3 days of canceled flights Delta refunded her fare and told her there were no flights to rebook her on. Trains were also cancelled due to frozen switches. She had to uber to the port and take a 17-hr ferry to the UK. She had to book a new ticket from Heathrow. This has been unprecedented!""

Passengers fear these disruptions may only continue.

KLM has issued a statement in recent days regarding the fiasco that caused hundreds of flight cancellations.

Here's a closer look at KLM's statement, and how passengers are reacting.

KLM Apologized For The Recent Flight Disruptions At Amsterdam Airport Schiphol

Minister Robert Tieman is calling for a review of the flight disruptions at Schiphol Airport at the start of the year. Severe winter weather disrupted flights across the country. Issues persisted due to de-icing issues caused by KLM at the airport.

​​​​​​​

Marjan Rintel, KLM CEO, addressed the issue, stating that more needs to be done to inform travelers in the future if such disruptions take place.

“I understand that frustration. What we’re seeing is that people at Schiphol also need much more information than what’s in the app, what you get in email, or what you can find on your phone.”

Rintel added, “The problem, of course, is when you have to rebook 300,000 people and 70 percent of your flights are canceled because there is no capacity at the airport to fly, it’s very difficult to say: you’re going tomorrow, because tomorrow your flight might be canceled again. But what we’ve seen is that if you can’t provide that information, you still have to be there for all your passengers, to help them.”

Issues have persisted at AMS, with 245 flight departures delayed on Saturday, according to FlightAware. The delays affected 43% of departing flights from AMS.

Passengers in the United States are concerned that these issues may persist and that prominent carriers to the airport, such as Delta, may experience further setbacks.

The biggest issue for many passengers is that Delta may be powerless in these situations, while KLM has significant control over Delta flights.

Delta Air Lines' Passengers Fear That The Carrier Is Powerless Over Ongoing Disruptions At Amsterdam Airport Schiphol

Delta has seen many setbacks at Schiphol Airport this month.

​​​​​​​Among them includes restrictions on Delta Cargo products.

The cargo restrictions were in place until January 11.

Delta said in a statement, ”The restriction timeframe has been extended and is expected to remain in place through 11 January. This timeframe is subject to change based on operational conditions. “Delta Cargo will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as new information becomes available.”

Along with the cargo restrictions, Delta passengers experienced several setbacks in Amsterdam.

​​​​​​​One passenger reported that delays lasted up to 36 hours before finally finding another flight home.

""The real issue is/was the de-icing process. It takes hours for planes to get a slot in one of the 4 de-icing stations. This caused the pilots on two of the flights that I was on, to timeout and the flights to be cancelled. That happens on Sunday 4-th and Monday 5th. Yesterday I got another flight for the 6th. At 11 PM that flight gets cancelled.""

""So on the phone with Delta I see availability on the premium and delta one cabins which the agent denied to put me in. They give me a flight for the 7th, more then 36 hours,"" a stranded Delta passenger wrote a few days ago.

Other Delta passengers are alarmed by the disruptions, given that the carrier has minimal control and the international hub.

One person wrote, ""KLM handles everything for Delta in AMS. It's not the smoothest arrangement.""

Another user added, ""Everything happening at AMS right now is completely crazy and I think there’s little Delta can do. They rely on KLM for the ground operations there, and KLM is a mess.""

It remains to be seen what the rest of the month will look like, but for now, passengers are eager to see changes made at AMS.

Delta Air Lines Had The Most Flight Delays On Saturday

On Saturday, Delta Air Lines had the most delays, with 791. The carrier also had 12 cancelled flights.

According to FlightAware, there were 4,657 delays within, into or out of the United States on Saturday, along with 70 cancellations.

As for the other major U.S. airlines, American Airlines had 561 delays, while United had 419, impacting 16% of its flights.

On Sunday morning, Delta Air Lines had 76 delays and three cancelled flights.

As for Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, the hub has the most cancelled departing flights, currently at eight, along with 153 flight delays. Arrival cancellations are at seven, along with 133 delays.",https://static0.thetravelimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2268573925.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-11 11:13:05.691194

Incoming Walmart CEO John Furner and Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that the companies have teamed up on stage at the National Retail Federation's Big Show, an annual industry conference held at New York City's Javits Center.

The CEOs did not say when the new feature will launch or share financial terms. The company said the experience will start first in the U.S. and then expand internationally.

With the Google deal, Walmart is boosting its effort to keep up with customers who are using AI chatbots to save time or look for inspiration. Walmart announced a deal with a rival to Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT, in October to allow shoppers to make purchases with ""Instant Checkout,"" a feature that allows them to buy an item without leaving the AI chatbot. OpenAI recently launched that feature with Walmart and it has Instant Checkout deals with other retailers, including Etsy and several Shopify merchants like Skims, Vuori and Spanx.

Walmart also has its own AI chatbot, a yellow smiley-faced assistant on its app called Sparky.

""The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,"" Furner said in a news release. ""We aren't just watching the shift, we are driving it.""

Furner, who will step into Walmart's top role on Feb. 1, described the deal with Google's Gemini as ""another step toward creating seamless shopping experiences for customers and members that are more intuitive and personal than ever before.""

Pichai said in the release that Google is excited to work with Walmart ""on a new open standard to make agentic commerce a reality.""

For Walmart, the evolution of customers' shopping habits — such as searches that start on an AI chatbot instead of its own app or website — is changing the retailer's digital strategy. In a statement, David Guggina, Walmart U.S.'s chief ecommerce officer, said agentic AI ""helps us meet customers earlier in their shopping journey and in more places.""

""Over time, these agents will make it easier for customers to find what they need, want and love,"" he said.

Walmart leaders have also been vocal about the ways that AI will change the workforce and the roles of its employees, comments that carry additional weight as the company is the largest private employer in the U.S.

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who is retiring and will be succeeded by Furner, has spoken about the sweeping impact of the technology, saying that ""it's very clear that AI is going to change literally every job.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108229495-1763673071760-gettyimages-2247687115-jr_12925_4e6vzwin.jpeg?v=1763673473&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2026-01-11 10:14:29.975942

Between the lines, that final drive felt like ""do or die"" for the defense, in the words of veteran Grady Jarrett.
The it Odunze referred to is the largest postseason comeback in franchise history, the Bears' first playoff win since 2010, first postseason win over Green Bay since 1941, and most importantly for this Bears team, a culture-defining moment.
In the Bears' locker room after the game, there was a variety of opinions on the momentum-swinging play.
Santos' third and final field goal cut the deficit to 21-9 less than two minutes into the fourth quarter.","As the seemingly never-ending, 11-play Packers drive unfolded, other members of the Bears offense remained near the benches with coaches, attempting to remain focused in case they had to take the field once again. But with the future of their magical season in limbo, focusing on anything but those final plays felt impossible.

""I was like, 'Man, let's just win this game, defense, let's go do our thing,"" receiver Rome Odunze said. ""We were trying to go over some plays on the sideline, and I was half looking, half like, I'm trying to watch this game. I turned into a fan at that point.""

Between the lines, that final drive felt like ""do or die"" for the defense, in the words of veteran Grady Jarrett. For Montez Sweat, the opportunity to secure the incredible victory was invigorating.

""We understood what was at stake,"" Sweat said. ""We just had to end the game.""

While the Packers offense reached the Chicago 23-yard line, pressure from Sweat, Gervon Dexter Sr. and the relentless noise of the home crowd closed in on Green Bay quarterback Jordan Love in the final 20 seconds of regulation. On the final play of the game, the chaos culminated in a fumbled snap and a last-ditch pass attempt that fell incomplete off the hands of nickel back Kyler Gordon. With zeros on the clock, a flood of navy swarmed the field as Soldier Field shook.

""I ran onto the field and just felt relief,"" Odunze said. ""Like, 'Wow, we really did it.' Definitely a win that will go down in history, and we're not done.""

The it Odunze referred to is the largest postseason comeback in franchise history, the Bears' first playoff win since 2010, first postseason win over Green Bay since 1941, and most importantly for this Bears team, a culture-defining moment.

""It felt great to have my first playoff win with these guys,"" Williams said. ""It felt great being able to fight the way we did and come out victorious.""

The Bears' wild card win wasn't the result of one specific play or player, but rather the team regrouping at halftime while trailing 21-3 and committing to clawing back, one snap at a time. In the Bears' locker room after the game, there was a variety of opinions on the momentum-swinging play.

For safety Kevin Byard III, the game-changing moment actually happened in the locker room at halftime, courtesy of coach Ben Johnson.

""Ben was just talking to the group, talking about, 'Hey, we've got 30 minutes. Let's make this the most memorable game in Chicago Bears history.'

""We all know we're a resilient team. There's no quit in this team. The league knows that the Chicago Bears are gonna play 60 minutes no matter what the scenario is, no matter what the score is.""

Linebacker D'Marco Jackson, who took over play-calling responsibilities after T.J. Edwards left the game with an injury in the second quarter, pointed to the opening drive of the second half.

""That quick three-and-out, it set the tone,"" Jackson said. ""I feel like the atmosphere rose up and the offense fed off that and special teams too, just making plays. It was really just complementary football for everyone.""

Receiver Olamide Zaccheaus believes the game shifted with that possession as well as the 37-yard punt return by Devin Duvernay just before the end of the third quarter.

""Honestly, the energy specifically that the defense brought in the second half,"" Zaccheaus said, ""they went three-and-out on the first drive. The defense sparked it off for us. Them coming out with that energy, getting a stop early. And then we had the big returns by Duv, too. Those were big plays just to create momentum for us.""

Duvernay's return allowed the Bears to start their first drive of the fourth quarter in Green Bay territory, which ultimately led to a 51-yard field goal by kicker Cairo Santos, who, at that point, was responsible for all nine Bears points.

""Even though it didn't seem like field goals were going to help early in the second half, it's chipping away with those three points,"" Santos said. ""We always talk about every point matters. I take pride in executing and putting points on the board when our unit is called because we just know it's going to be important at the end of the game.

""We execute from the first kick to the last like we depend on it.""

Santos' third and final field goal cut the deficit to 21-9 less than two minutes into the fourth quarter. For the veteran kicker, seeing the scoreboard reset to ""15:00"" for the final time was the only momentum-changing moment that he needed to see.

""When we shift into the fourth quarter, that's always a momentum shift for this team,"" Santos said. ""When it's time to have everyone's best, the game clock turns into the fourth quarter, that's when the fire ignites in all of us. Would love to start the game better as a team, but if that's what it takes, we'll be there every game.""

Right tackle Darnell Wright identified three plays on the next Bears possession, which followed another three-and-out by the Packers, that changed the course of the game. First, the 22-yard and 21-yard receptions by Loveland down the left sideline that moved the Bears to the Packers' 12-yard line, followed by D'Andre Swift's 6-yard touchdown run.

""I'd say the biggest one was probably when Swift scored,"" Wright said. ""I feel like we just needed one, needed one score, six points, get on the board. And then big catches by Colston. Those right there created a little spark we needed. It let us see the end goal.

""When you're down two or three scores, you can't really see how it's going to turn out. But when you close that gap, you can see, 'Okay, one stop, touchdown. One stop, touchdown.'""

The Bears didn't reach the end zone until 10:12 remained in the game, but by that point, the tide had already turned. While they trailed 21-16, the scoreboard didn't matter. The home sideline had absorbed all the momentum and sustained it by using the crowd's energy to their advantage. No additional motivational words needed to be exchanged. The assignment was clear.

""I think we just keep giving each other opportunities,"" Santos said. ""Nothing needs to be said. It's just understood that we've got the talent, the coaching to put us in position to execute what we need to do to win the game. It's just understood.""

Not to be downplayed is Williams proceeding to lead back-to-back touchdown drives to put the Bears on top, despite the momentum shift having already been completed. First came an 8-yard dart to Zaccheaus and a subsequent two-point pass to Loveland, capping off a quick 10-play, 76-yard scoring drive. Then, following a missed field goal by Packers kicker Brandon McManus, Williams took the Bears 66 yards on six plays, ending the go-ahead drive with a 25-yard touchdown pass to receiver DJ Moore.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/bears/z7abkb4dlculjf4ioclx,N,,2026-01-11 11:59:58.766795

Translated by: Saoirse, Foresight News

Under the GENIUS Act, stablecoin issuers are prohibited from paying interest to stablecoin holders.

Currently, Coinbase Exchange is offering users a 3.35% reward for holding USDC on the platform. This is possible because the GENIUS Act only prohibits issuers from offering interest, but does not impose restrictions on distributors.

However, before the U.S. Senate's relevant committee reviewed the ""Crypto Market Structure Act"" on January 15 (aimed at systematizing cryptocurrency regulation), a full-scale debate had already erupted over whether the ""ban on stablecoin interest should be extended to the distribution stage.""

Strong opposition from the banking industry

The American Bankers Association (ABA) is the leading group advocating for a comprehensive ban on interest payments on stablecoins. In an open letter released on January 5, the association argued that the interest payment ban in the GENIUS Act should not apply only to issuers, but should be interpreted broadly and extended to affiliates. They are pushing to have this interpretation explicitly included in the ""Crypto Market Structure Act.""

The Underlying Reasons Behind the Banking Sector's Strong Opposition

The reason the banking industry is so eager to completely ban interest payments on stablecoins is actually very simple:

Concerned about outflow of bank deposits;

A decrease in deposits means a reduction in the ability to lend;

Stablecoins are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

Ultimately, stablecoins are threatening the stable and highly profitable business model that has sustained banking for decades.

The Comeback of the Cryptocurrency Industry

In the eyes of the cryptocurrency industry, this move by the banking sector is a major issue. If the restrictions of the GENIUS Act are expanded through the proposed ""Cryptocurrency Market Structure Act"" due to banking sector lobbying, it would effectively rewrite and narrow the scope of the already-passed legislation. As expected, this action has sparked strong opposition from the crypto industry.

Coinbase's Position

Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase's Chief Policy Officer, refuted this by citing relevant research indicating that stablecoins have not caused significant outflows from bank deposits. He also added a new argument to the debate by referencing news about the digital yuan offering interest on payments.

Paradigm's Viewpoint

Alexander Grieve, Vice President of Government Affairs at crypto investment firm Paradigm, offered another perspective. He argued that even if interest were allowed only on stablecoins used for payment purposes, this would effectively amount to an indirect ""holding tax"" on consumers.

How about the situation in China and South Korea?

Although China and South Korea are not as fast as some other Asian countries in advancing policies related to cryptocurrencies, both have recently introduced a series of new initiatives regarding central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and stablecoin regulations. The differences in their policies regarding interest payments are particularly noteworthy:

China's central bank has decided to offer interest on digital yuan payments, treating it on par with regular bank deposits, in an effort to promote the adoption of the digital currency.

South Korea's policy direction is closer to that of the United States: it prohibits the issuer from paying interest, but does not explicitly prohibit distributors from doing so.

From a macro perspective, China's aggressive policy stance becomes easier to understand. The digital yuan is not a private stablecoin, but a legal digital currency directly issued by the central bank. Promoting the digital yuan can not only counterbalance the dominant positions of private platforms like Alipay and WeChat Pay, but also strengthen a financial system centered around the central bank.

Conclusion

New technologies give rise to new industries, and the emergence of these new industries often poses a threat to traditional ones.

Traditional financial institutions, represented by banks, are facing an irreversible trend toward the era of stablecoins. At this pivotal moment, resisting change brings more harm than good; embracing transformation and exploring new opportunities is a wiser choice.

In fact, the stablecoin industry presents significant opportunities even for existing market participants. Many banks have already begun to proactively position themselves:

BNY Mellon in New York, USA, is making moves to position itself in the custody of stablecoin reserves business;

Cross River Bank acts as an intermediary for Circle's USDC fiat on-ramp channel through application programming interfaces (APIs);

JPMorgan is also testing a tokenized deposit business.

Major card organizations also have a vested interest in this matter. As the scale of on-chain payments continues to expand, the business of traditional card organizations may face a decline. However, companies like Visa and Mastercard have not chosen to resist this trend; instead, they actively support stablecoin payment settlements, seeking new opportunities for development in line with the trend.

Asset management institutions are also entering the field. Funds such as BlackRock are actively promoting the tokenization of various investment funds.

If the banking industry's lobbying efforts ultimately succeed and a provision banning stablecoin interest payments is included in the ""Crypto Market Structure Act,"" the cryptocurrency industry will suffer a major setback.

As a professional in the cryptocurrency industry, I can only hope that the ""Crypto Market Structure Act"" will not include provisions that effectively undermine the ""GENIUS Act.""",https://assets.staticimg.com/cms/media/7feiEEHmJE61RECXMyp8rTcA5Qcsl0zSv6rz9NVjg.png,N,,2026-01-11 10:14:10.829928

“Nous vivons une époque d’anomie, les grands changements sociétaux, une politique incertaine et l’angoisse de l’avenir sont écrasants... Quelle musique exprime mieux cela que le grunge, dont les codes résonnent de façon intuitive chez la jeunesse, pour qui l’adhésion à une minorité identifiable signifie l’appartenance à une communauté et donc à une solidarité partagée?”, analyse Donna Gaines, sociologue, journaliste et travailleuse sociale, auteure de Teenage Wasteland et A Misfit’s Manifesto (non traduits).

Cet été, Poppy King, créatrice de Lipstick Queen, rouges à lèvres cultes des 90’s, a relancé quelques formules de l’époque, sold out en un éclair, sans pub. “Je les ai produits en Australie, comme à mes débuts alors que je n’avais que 19 ans. C’était une période si singulière, ultracréative, non conformiste”, sourit-elle. Grunge boots The Row aux pieds, pixie cut, bouche brique façon Dr. Martens, sashay de pigments sur une peau nue faussement vulnérable... La saison réinvente cette esthétique de la désinvolture, née sous les traits d’une très jeune Kate Moss immortalisée par la photographe Corinne Day dans les pages de The Face et i-D. Présents sur les sets, le hairstylist Eugene Souleiman et le make-up artist Dick Page avaient alors posé les jalons de la beauté grunge. Ils expliquent comment la réinventer aujourd’hui.

Retour aux racines

Statement anticonsumériste, réponse aux excès de glamour des 80’s, le grunge est une fulgurance de débrouillardise. “À l’époque, on partait en minibus avec Corinne Day et Naomi Campbell, sandwichs à la main, pour The Face. Je portais un petit sac à dos contenant quelques produits et des épingles à cheveux. On devait se montrer ingénieux”, se remémore Eugene Souleiman. Pour l’expert, c’est cet esprit qu’il faut conserver, car le grunge est un anti-style, “mais qui nécessite beaucoup de style pour être réussi”, précise-t-il. Une structure plus souple comme si la coupe avait repoussé naturellement, quelques racines qui rendent un blond plus nonchalant... L’allure doit être undone mais pas forcément anti-glamour.

Si l’entretien de la chevelure (coupe et couleur) s’allège un peu, tout réside dans le styling. La recette secrète du pro? “Mélangez un peu de conditioner sans rinçage à de l’eau et massez la mixture sur les racines. La chevelure gagne en volume et en texture, comme si vous aviez dansé toute la nuit”, dévoile-t-il. Aux plus pressées, le pro recommande le soin texturisant Hair Resort de Kevin Murphy à l’effet similaire.

Another week with just one game for the Charge, and oh boy was it a fun one! Ottawa just keeps on racking up wins despite their very poor start to the season.

The winning streak has been so good, in fact, that the Charge are now fifth in the league, tied with the Toronto Sceptres in points. A regulation win today would have them jump all the way up to third. I love the three point system.

Last Week: Ottawa Charge 4, Vancouver Goldeneyes 2

The Charge looked fantastic in the first period. They did a much better job of getting to the net than they usually do, and made shockingly few defensive mistakes.

The game had barely started when the Charge found themselves on the penalty kill. Thankfully, they killed it off without any problems and soon looked very much like the better team.

There was a scary moment early on where Kadirova threw a high hit on Abby Boreen, and Boreen was lying on the ice for a while. Thankfully, it looked like she just got the wind knocked out of her, and didn't miss a shift. That's not the first time Kadirova has thrown a dangerous hit, unfortunately. It feels like she's been having trouble adjusting to the physicality of the league all season, and after getting hit a few times early in the season it almost feels like she's overcorrected and is now throwing dangerous hits of her own. Hopefully she can figure things out soon.

The Charge got the first goal of the game - a tap-in by Savolainen off a great rush to the net.

That would do it for the first period. Ottawa looked like the better team but only had a 1 goal lead.

The second was still pretty good, but the game did start to look a bit more even. Kadirova had an absolutely ridiculous shift in the second period where she almost scored multiple times, but other than that the team didn't look particularly dangerous.

The Goldeneyes got another powerplay toward the end of the second, and it was absolutely wild. Manon McMahon almost got a shorthanded goal, and then Philips pulled off some unbelievable saves to keep the Goldeneyes off the scoresheet.

That ended up being a bit of a turning point. Vancouver really picked up the pace late in the second, but of course Philips turned them away.

There was another injury right at the end of the second, when Karvinen took a shot to the chest and was slow to get up. Thankfully she was also fine. We're getting close enough to the Olympics now that I'm sure fans of the national teams are worried about injuries, so I'm sure team Finland is glad she's alright.

The Charge got a powerplay right at the end of the second period that carried over into the third, but they didn't score on it despite some good pressure around the net.

It took about five minutes for Anna Meixner to bury a rebound to double Ottawa's lead. This is what happens when you actually get to the net.

Of course, the Goldeneyes couldn't make it easy on us. About halfway through the second period, Sophie Jaques, who should have been a Charge for life (yes I'm still hung up on the decision to pass her over in the inaugural draft), beat Philips to break the shutout and pull her team within one.

Things got weird at the very end of the game. First, Vancouver pulled their goaltender, obviously, but Brianne Jenner scored an empty netter to put the Charge up 3-1 with about a minute and a half left in the game (she had an opportunity to do a slap shot but unfortunately didn't take it). Then, pretty much as soon as the puck dropped again, Karvinen scored for Vancouver, so the Goldeneyes were back within one with just over a minute left. Finally, Rebecca Leslie scored for the Charge with the net empty, so we were back to leading by two, and the 4-2 score held.

Watching a team pull their goaltender in a one-goal game only to end up giving up two empty net goals gave me flashbacks to the DJ Smith era Sens. It's nice to be on the other end of one of those games.

Notable Performances

Savolainen had a fantastic game, especially offensively. It felt like she had the puck every time she was on the ice. Definitely her best game of the season, and that's saying something.

I really liked what I saw from Wozniewicz too. She was causing problems in the offensive zone all night.

Of course, I also need to mention Payton Hemp, who had two assists.

The Week Ahead

The Charge play their next game today at noon, and we'll have a full preview going up shortly, so I won't repeat things here.

After that, they head to Laval on Tuesday to take on la Victoire de Montréal. As someone who has attended every single game these two teams have played in Montreal, I can tell you right now that the Charge don't usually win these ones. Let's all hope they can turn things around, for my sanity if for no other reason.

The Victoire actually haven't been playing particularly well recently, with their top line being the main thing keeping them afloat. They're actually two points below the Charge in the standings, but they have two games in hand so it doesn't mean that much.

That one will be an Amazon Prime broadcast, with puck drop at 7pm EST.

ID7,Best Buy,2026-01-11 11:49:23+00:00,Yahoo Finance,AI is no 'business killer': Why Wall Street is buying software stocks in 2026 - Yahoo Finance,Francisco Velasquez,,,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-is-no-business-killer-why-wall-street-is-buying-software-stocks-in-2026-150016555.html,"Davidson analyst Gil Luria said in a research note, observing the industry is now in its third year of the AI shift.
The biggest impact on the software industry thus far has been ""narrative and scared customers unwilling to commit,"" he added.
Luria's pick for 2026 is Commvault (CVLT), where he sees a massive 50%+ upside and a $220 price target driven by sustained momentum and a rebound in margins.
The business is a ""subscription acceleration story"" with an ROIC north of 100% and price target of $250.
He highlights ServiceNow (NOW), with a price target of $781, as a giant in the early stages of this transition; JFrog (FROG), in a mid-transition, with a price target of $65; and Snowflake (SNOW) as the gold standard for the fully consumption-driven model, with a price target of $220.","The death of software has been greatly exaggerated.

""If AI is going to kill a business, the signs would already be there,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said in a research note, observing the industry is now in its third year of the AI shift.

The biggest impact on the software industry thus far has been ""narrative and scared customers unwilling to commit,"" he added. The latter may be a factor that's starting to change, as companies come to realize ""neither they nor their software vendors have been run over"" by AI.

As this ""scared"" money returns to the market, analysts from DA Davidson, Piper Sandler, and Truist Securities identified names likely to lead the recovery. A common thread runs throughout the trio's picks: These companies provide the infrastructure upon which AI is built.

D.A. Davidson's top picks focus on specialized growth and infrastructure resilience. Luria's pick for 2026 is Commvault (CVLT), where he sees a massive 50%+ upside and a $220 price target driven by sustained momentum and a rebound in margins.

Other stocks to watch include Manhattan Associates (MANH), a supply chain and retail software company. The business is a ""subscription acceleration story"" with an ROIC north of 100% and price target of $250. Up next is marketing platform Zeta Global (ZETA), which is benefitting from the ""replacement of legacy marketing tech"" and carries a $29 target.

Rounding out the list are Box (BOX), which is gaining ground via ""Enterprise Advanced"" upgrades with a $45 target, and Datadog (DDOG), labeled the ""complete Observability platform"" for complex AI-driven environments with a $225 price target.

Parallel to Luria's list, Piper Sandler analyst James Fish is looking toward the ""Gen Z"" winners and infrastructure plays. Fish highlights Rubrik (RBRK) with a $75 price target for its completed SaaS transition; Nutanix (NTNX), priced at $50, as it gains share from VMware; and Axon (AXON), with a $563 price target, for its recurring model in public safety and drone integration.

Meanwhile, Truist Securities analyst Terry Tillman writes that software skepticism often centers on ""seat and license-based pricing"" — the idea that if AI makes humans more efficient, companies will buy fewer software licenses. However, he argues that the industry is simply evolving, as the rise of agentic AI — autonomous bots performing tasks 24/7 — encourages a shift toward consumption-based pricing.

""As workflows move from human-initiated tasks to autonomous agents executing at scale, billing tied to usage becomes the most logical way to capture value,"" Tillman wrote, citing examples such as compute, data processing, and transactions. Unlike humans, AI agents don't sleep, meaning billable events can compound around the clock.

That shift favors vendors that can demonstrate daily ROI, invest heavily in R&D to expand use cases, and build transparent metering and governance tools, per Tillman.

He highlights ServiceNow (NOW), with a price target of $781, as a giant in the early stages of this transition; JFrog (FROG), in a mid-transition, with a price target of $65; and Snowflake (SNOW) as the gold standard for the fully consumption-driven model, with a price target of $220.

These companies are betting that as AI adoption ramps up, the volume of data processed and transactions executed will more than offset any decline in human seats.

In 2026, Wall Street isn't buying software because the hype is back in vogue; they're buying because the valuations are finally rational, customers are less paralyzed, and the ""business killers"" have yet to show up at the gate.

One of the main reasons Brooklyn has performed better than expected this season and its young players have looked more mature than their ages is due to the presence of the oldest player on the roster, Terance Mann.
The Nets' most recent matchup was a 121-105 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, moving them to 11-24 in this campaign.
Mann would have been the ninth-oldest player on the Clippers roster to put in perspective how young this team is and how young Mann is while being considered the primary veteran.
""I think he's learning how to be a young old man,"" Fernandez said after the loss to the Clippers.","A cardiac monitor measures a person's electrical activity in the heart and displays it as a waveform. Flatlining often spells the worst, while a jagged line signifies being alive.

In the world of the NBA, where the stakes aren't life or death, this illustration takes on a different meaning. If the Brooklyn Nets were hooked up to one of these monitors, they would most likely see the jagged line, showing signs of life and growth.

This season has had more peaks than expected thus far for the Nets, and while some fans may be disgruntled by the franchise's current ""no man's land"" positioning in the league standings, it's the proper way to tank. The youth are being developed, and they are being instilled with a competitive identity rather than one that focuses on a future draft pick.

One of the main reasons Brooklyn has performed better than expected this season and its young players have looked more mature than their ages is due to the presence of the oldest player on the roster, Terance Mann.

The Nets' most recent matchup was a 121-105 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, moving them to 11-24 in this campaign. Mann would have been the ninth-oldest player on the Clippers roster to put in perspective how young this team is and how young Mann is while being considered the primary veteran.

He is on the young side of 29 years old, and yet he has elevated the youngest team in the NBA in his eighth season in the league. Mann's veteran presence has mixed well with both players and coaches –– head coach Jordi Fernandez has noticed his skills.

""I think he's learning how to be a young old man,"" Fernandez said after the loss to the Clippers. ""We've put him in situations to be the vet, you know, in his late 20s, which is sometimes not extremely fair.""

Mann probably didn't expect so much of his role with Brooklyn to be centered around mentorship and leadership. He called his own number in the offseason, signaling for a breakout season, but he hasn't been in the most convenient situations to do so.

Oftentimes, when players get thrown into a vocal leadership role like Mann has been, it takes them time to adapt, but he's quickly adjusted to a new environment and found his way to help the team.

""Showing these guys the way to do things, communicating with them, holding them accountable and putting an arm around their shoulders if they need it,"" Fernandez said about the ways Mann's been a good vet.

While his season averages of eight points, 3.8 assists and 3.5 rebounds per game haven't lived up to personal expectations, he's put himself aside to help the Nets in many unseen ways.","https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,x_395,y_41,w_3621,h_2036/c_fill,w_1440,ar_1440:810,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_nets/01kemhjm3j0hz66m0ajj.jpg",N,,2026-01-11 11:03:15.875794

Real world Diabetes Care analysis on MiniMed 780G, where users with recommended optimal settings recorded 76.3% time in range on missed bolus days, and more than 61% met three American Diabetes Association glycemic targets compared with 36.6% for other settings, based on Medtronic data.

How This Changes the Fair Value For Medtronic

The fair value estimate is now US$111.05 per share, up slightly from about US$110.97, reflecting a very small upward tweak in the model.

The discount rate is now 8.78%, described as edging slightly lower from 8.78%, signaling a minimal adjustment in the required return used in the analysis.

Revenue growth is now 5.73%, trimmed slightly from 5.79% in the updated assumptions, which modestly reins in the top-line outlook in the model.

The future P/E is now 28.31x, nudging slightly above the prior 28.29x assumption used in the comparative work, suggesting a very small shift in how the shares are being benchmarked against peers.

For millions living with diabetes, the biggest constraint isn’t just blood sugar levels. It’s hardware. Traditional insulin pumps tether users to tubes, bulky devices, and workflows that feel more like medical procedure than everyday life. Insulet, through its Omnipod platform, is trying to turn that paradigm on its head by making insulin delivery as invisible and automated as possible.

Instead of a belt clip and plastic tubing, Insulet offers a discreet, wearable insulin ""pod"" that sticks to the skin and talks wirelessly to a controller or smartphone. In an era where GLP-1 drugs are grabbing headlines and big tech is flirting with health hardware, Insulet is quietly building one of the most defensible ecosystems in diabetes technology: a patch-based, tubeless alternative to conventional pumps that has already pulled hundreds of thousands of patients away from syringes and tubes.

Insulet is not just another medtech supplier; it is a pure play on the future of automated insulin delivery and connected care. As payers and regulators push for better outcomes at lower cost, the company’s flagship Omnipod platform is becoming a strategic node linking patients, endocrinologists, and data-driven care models.

Get all details on Insulet here

Inside the Flagship: Insulet

When people say ""Insulet"" in the diabetes world, they almost always mean the company’s flagship product line: the Omnipod family of tubeless insulin pumps, today led by Omnipod 5. This is a wearable, patch-like pump designed for people with type 1 diabetes and some with insulin-requiring type 2. The core idea is simple but powerful: eliminate tubing, automate as much dosing as possible, and integrate tightly with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).

The Omnipod system has three key components:

1. The Pod: A small, disposable, waterproof pod worn on the body for up to 72 hours. It holds insulin and houses a tiny cannula that automatically inserts under the skin when activated. There is no dangling tubing. Users can wear pods on the arm, abdomen, thigh, or lower back, making it easier to dress, exercise, and sleep without constantly negotiating around hardware.

2. The Brain (Controller or App): Earlier generations used a dedicated handheld Personal Diabetes Manager (PDM). With Omnipod 5, Insulet moves further into app-driven control. The system can be managed using a compatible smartphone or Insulet-supplied controller, allowing dose adjustments, bolus delivery, and system monitoring directly from a familiar interface. That shift not only modernizes the experience but embeds Omnipod into the broader mobile health ecosystem.

3. Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) Algorithm: The most transformative layer is software. Omnipod 5 connects to the Dexcom G6 and now G7 CGM systems (in approved markets) and uses a predictive algorithm to modulate basal insulin delivery automatically. Every five minutes, the system looks at current glucose, trend data, and the user’s personalized targets to increase, decrease, or suspend insulin. The goal: flatten the highs and prevent the dangerous lows, with minimal user micromanagement.

This combination of disposable pod, connected controller, and adaptive algorithm gives Insulet a unique proposition. The company has positioned Omnipod 5 as the first and, for now, leading tubeless, fully integrated AID system commercialized at scale. For parents managing type 1 diabetes in children, that means fewer nighttime alarms and more time in range. For adults juggling work, exercise, and diet, it turns the pump from a visible medical device into a nearly invisible companion.

Insulet’s roadmap is also increasingly platform-centric. The company is building deeper integration with CGM partners like Dexcom, exploring more smartphone-native control, and pushing cloud connectivity to feed clinicians and care teams with granular, real-world data. As virtual clinics and remote endocrinology scale up, Omnipod’s always-on, always-connected profile becomes part of an emerging standard of care.

Market Rivals: Insulet Aktie vs. The Competition

In insulin delivery, Insulet competes primarily against two dominant categories: traditional tubed insulin pumps and multiple daily injections (MDI) augmented by smart pens or connected caps. On the pump side, the two most relevant rivals are Medtronic and Tandem Diabetes Care.

Medtronic MiniMed 780G: Medtronic’s MiniMed 780G is a traditional, tubed insulin pump integrated with the company’s Guardian 4 CGM. Like Omnipod 5, it offers closed-loop or ""advanced hybrid closed-loop"" functionality: an algorithm automatically adjusts basal insulin and can give automatic correction boluses. The 780G’s strengths are depth of algorithm experience, strong clinical validation, and Medtronic’s longstanding presence in hospital and endocrinology networks.

However, compared directly to Omnipod 5, the MiniMed 780G still depends on tubing and a belt- or pocket-worn pump. That introduces friction points: snagging on clothing, discomfort during sleep, and a more visible medical profile. Setup and maintenance can also feel more complex for newly diagnosed users. Medtronic has been working to close the usability gap, but Insulet’s tubeless design remains a differentiated experience that many patients prefer, especially children and active adults.

Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ: Tandem’s t:slim X2 is a sleek, touchscreen insulin pump paired with Dexcom CGMs and powered by its Control-IQ algorithm. Control-IQ dynamically adjusts basal insulin and can deliver automatic correction boluses, competing head-on with Omnipod 5 on time-in-range outcomes. Tandem is strong on user interface design and has built a loyal following through software updates that can be pushed to in-market pumps, extending device life.

Compared directly to Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ, Insulet’s Omnipod 5 trades the polished rechargeable pump hardware for disposable pods that are entirely off-body except for the adhesive site. That shift changes everything from wardrobe choices to exercise routines. While some users appreciate having a reusable, durable pump body with Tandem, others see Omnipod’s patch format as freeing them from visible medical hardware.

New Front: MDI and Smart Insulin Delivery

On another flank, Insulet is competing with the accelerating sophistication of MDI plus smart devices. Products like Novo Nordisk’s smart pens and companies offering dose-tracking caps aim to keep patients on injections while layering in data and coaching. These tools are often cheaper and less infrastructure-heavy than a pump, making them attractive to payers and some adults with type 2 diabetes.

But they stop short of what Insulet offers: real closed-loop automation. Smart pens can track and optimize, but they can’t adjust basal insulin every five minutes based on CGM data. For users who need intensive insulin therapy and want fewer manual decisions, the Omnipod model still offers a qualitatively different experience.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Insulet’s edge comes from a combination of hardware design, human-centered UX, and software-driven automation, rather than a single breakthrough component.

Tubeless as a True Lifestyle Feature

The most obvious differentiator is the lack of tubing. For many patients, this isn’t cosmetic; it’s behavioral. A tubeless pod is easier to wear while playing sports, sleeping, showering, or managing small children. It reduces the constant visual reminder of illness. Adoption data and patient communities consistently highlight this as the main reason users move from tubed pumps or injections to Omnipod and then stay.

Disposable Platform, Recurring Revenue

Insulet’s model is built around recurring pod use, not just one-time hardware sales. Each pod is worn for up to 72 hours and then replaced, creating a high-margin consumables stream. That recurring structure incentivizes Insulet to continuously improve algorithms and app experience, because stickiness drives lifetime value. For users, the benefit is always receiving fresh, sealed hardware, lowering maintenance overhead and worry about mechanical wear.

Algorithm and CGM Partnerships

Omnipod 5’s integration with the Dexcom CGM ecosystem gives it instant credibility among clinicians and tech-forward patients. Dexcom is widely regarded as a gold standard in CGM accuracy and reliability. By choosing to partner instead of building everything in-house, Insulet can move faster on software innovation and expand compatibility as new CGM generations roll out.

Expanding Addressable Market

Insulet is not limiting itself to type 1 diabetes. Its platform is increasingly positioned for insulin-requiring type 2 patients and for markets outside North America, especially as reimbursement frameworks for AID systems evolve. As payers see better time-in-range and lower complication rates, the case for funding pod-based systems strengthens, particularly for patients who struggle with regimen adherence on MDI.

Ecosystem Lock-In Without Feeling Trapped

What Insulet is quietly building is an ecosystem where the pod, the app, the CGM partnership, and the cloud analytics reinforce each other. Once a patient is trained, data is flowing to clinicians, and families are monitoring remotely, switching systems becomes painful. The key is that this lock-in is largely experience-driven: users stay because the system works, not because they are technically unable to leave.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

Insulet Aktie, trading under ISIN US45784P1012 and ticker PODD on the Nasdaq, is effectively a direct levered bet on the success and expansion of the Omnipod platform.

According to live market data checked across multiple sources (including Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch), Insulet Aktie was recently trading around the low-to-mid USD 190s range per share, with a market capitalization in the mid– to upper–single digit billions of dollars. As of the latest available quote on the research day, Insulet Aktie was changing hands at approximately USD 194–196 per share, with the figure reflecting intraday trading rather than a stale historical reference. Where real-time quotes were briefly unavailable or delayed, the most recent ""Last Close"" was used and explicitly marked by the data providers.

That valuation embeds several expectations: continued Omnipod 5 adoption in the existing type 1 base, expansion into insulin-requiring type 2 populations, geographic growth, and resilience against competition from both pump rivals and GLP-1 therapies that may delay or reduce progression to insulin. Investors have been watching three product-linked metrics particularly closely:

1. Pod Volume Growth: Rising pod shipments directly signal adherence and user growth. Strong pod volume typically translates into recurring revenue visibility and margin leverage, as manufacturing scales and logistics are optimized.

2. Algorithm & CGM Integration Progress: Regulatory approvals and rollouts of new Omnipod 5 features, additional smartphone compatibility, and deeper Dexcom integration tend to act as catalysts. Each software and ecosystem milestone strengthens Insulet’s differentiation versus Medtronic MiniMed 780G and Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ.

3. Reimbursement and Access: Positive reimbursement decisions from public and private payers are crucial, especially as Omnipod pushes further into type 2 diabetes. Better coverage unlocks new cohorts of patients, which in turn supports higher pod volumes and ultimately flows through to Insulet Aktie’s revenue and earnings trajectory.

While macro conditions, GLP-1 enthusiasm, and medtech sector rotations can create volatility in Insulet Aktie’s share price, the underlying story remains tightly tied to product execution. If Omnipod can continue to deliver superior time-in-range, lower hypoglycemia risk, and a meaningfully better user experience than tubed pumps or smart-pen MDI regimens, the company retains a credible path to long-term double-digit revenue growth. In that scenario, Insulet Aktie functions less like a cyclical device stock and more like a platform subscription play anchored in consumables and data.

Ultimately, Insulet’s investment case and its product story are the same narrative told through different lenses. On the user side, it is about fewer needles, fewer alarms, and less visible hardware. On the market side, it is about recurring pods, connected algorithms, and a defensible place at the center of next-generation diabetes care. If the company keeps executing, Omnipod will not just compete in the pump market; it will help redefine what an insulin ""device"" looks like at all.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405005_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 09:58:50.352155

Mr Bessent said in an interview late on Jan 9 that almost US$5 billion (S$6.4 billion) worth of Venezuela’s currently frozen IMF special drawing rights (SDRs) monetary assets could be deployed to help rebuild the country’s economy.

“We’re de-sanctioning the oil that’s going to be sold,” he said during a visit to a Winnebago Industries engineering facility. The Treasury is examining changes that would facilitate the repatriation of sale proceeds from oil stored largely on ships back to Venezuela.

“How can we help that get back into Venezuela, to run the government, run the security services and get it to the Venezuelan people?” he said of the Treasury’s sanctions analysis.

When asked when more sanctions could be removed from Venezuela, Mr Bessent said, “It could be as soon as next week,” but did not identify which ones.

The moves are part of the Trump administration’s effort to stabilise Venezuela and encourage the return of US oil producers to the country, a week after

US forces captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro

in Caracas and brought him to New York to face drug trafficking charges.

US sanctions have banned international banks and other creditors from engaging with the Venezuelan government without a license. The institutions have cited this as an impediment to a complex US$150 billion debt restructuring widely viewed as a key to the return of private capital to Venezuela.

On Jan 9 , US President Donald Trump signed an executive order blocking courts or creditors from impounding Venezuelan oil revenue held in US Treasury accounts, declaring that these funds should be safeguarded to help Venezuela create “peace, prosperity and stability”.

IMF, World Bank re-engagement

Mr Bessent, who controls the dominant US shareholding in the IMF and World Bank, said the two institutions had already reached out to him about Venezuela.

He said that the US Treasury would be willing to convert Venezuela’s IMF special drawing rights held at the fund to dollars for use in rebuilding Venezuela.

Venezuela currently has about 3.59 billion SDRs, worth around US$4.9 billion at the J an 9 exchange rate, but cannot currently access them. SDRs are made up of dollars, euros, yen, sterling and the Chinese yuan.

The Treasury in 2025 agreed to back a US$20 billion swap line for Argentina, partly with that South American country’s SDRs, in an effort to stabilise the peso and help Argentine President Javier Milei’s party win in the parliamentary election.

An IMF spokesperson said the fund was closely monitoring developments in Venezuela and declined to comment on Mr Bessent’s mention of a meeting next week.

The IMF has not engaged with Venezuela for more than two decades, with the last formal IMF assessment of Venezuela’s economy completed in 2004. Venezuela paid off its last World Bank loan in 2007, when Maduro’s predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, declared that Venezuela “will no longer have to go to Washington” for funding.

A source familiar with the World Bank’s internal discussions on Venezuela said that the development lender was in the early stages of exploring how it could be helpful to Venezuela, noting that the bank moved in quickly with assistance to Afghanistan and Syria after regime changes and provided early support to Gaza and Ukraine.

Fast movers

Mr Bessent said he believed that smaller, privately held companies would move swiftly back into Venezuela’s oil sector, despite reluctance voiced by some oil majors, including Exxon Mobil, whose past Venezuelan assets were nationalised twice.

“I think it’s going to be the typical progression where the private companies can move quickly and will come in very quickly. They haven’t talked about financing at all,” he said.

“Chevron has been there a long time and will continue to be there, so I believe that their commitment will greatly increase.”

Mr Bessent added that he believed there was a role for the US Export-Import Bank in guaranteeing financing for Venezuela’s oil sector, echoing previous comments from US Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

To date in this AI Tech Wave, Apple has been the most visible on stressing Health applications and services across its many platforms, from watches to iphones and other wearables.

And leaning in with its evolving Apple Intelligence to enhance healthcare AI features from hearing tests to body vitals monitoring and measurement.

Other tech companies like Google have also been focused on AI Healthcare Science, in particular with the Alphafold initiatives at Deepmind in particular. I’ve written about AI and Healthcare for a while now in these pages as well..

Now OpenAI is leaning into AI driven healthcare via ChatGPT as well. It’s something that has been building for a couple of years at least. And that is a Bigger Picture worth a discussion this Sunday.

Axios has a number of pieces on this OpenAI initiative in recent days. Including some broader concerns around AI in Healthcare. Axios notes in “OpenAI’s ChatGPT Health tools spark safety debate”:

“Mixed reactions to OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health feature highlight demand for more personalized medical help tempered by chatbot safety and privacy concerns.”

“Why it matters: Health has become a go-to topic for chatbot queries, with more than 40 million people consulting ChatGPT daily for health advice and hundreds of millions doing so each week.”

“Catch up quick: OpenAI is adding a new health tab within ChatGPT that includes the ability to upload electronic medical records and connect with Apple Health, MyFitnessPal and other fitness apps.”

“The new features formalize how many people already use the chatbot: uploading test results, asking questions about symptoms and trying to navigate the complex health care ecosystem.”

“OpenAI says it will keep the new health information separate from other types of chats and not train its models on this data.”

As I’ve outined before, both Trust and Privacy in AI solutions is a fundamental input at scale, which has given companies like Apple a bit of a headstart vs tech companies like Meta, Elon’s xAI/Grok, and others. It’s particularly a big one in healthcare of course.

“Yes, but: Health information shared with ChatGPT doesn’t have the same protections as medical data shared with a health provider, and even those protections vary by country.”

“The U.S. doesn’t have a general-purpose privacy law, and HIPAA only protects data held by certain people like healthcare providers and insurance companies,” Andrew Crawford, senior counsel for privacy and data at the Center for Democracy and Technology, told Axios in a statement.”

“And since it’s up to each company to set the rules for how health data is collected, used, shared, and stored, inadequate data protections and policies can put sensitive health information in real danger,” he says.”

“OpenAI is starting with a small group of early testers, notably not those in the European Economic Area, Switzerland and the United Kingdom where local regulations require additional compliance measures.”

The market of course will give OpenAI a chance here, given the global popularity of ChatGPT:

“The big picture: Many AI enthusiasts on social media welcomed the tools, pointing to how ChatGPT already helps them.”

“Yana Welinder, head of AI for Amplitude has been using ChatGPT “constantly” for health queries in recent months, both for herself and family members. “The only downside was that all of this lived alongside my very heavy other usage of ChatGPT,” she wrote on X. “Projects helped a bit, but I really wanted a dedicated space …So excited about this.”

“Chatbots aren’t a replacement for doctors, OpenAI says, at the same time highlighting what the chatbot can provide.”

“It’s great at synthesizing large amounts of information,” Fidji Simo, CEO of applications at OpenAI, said Wednesday on a call with reporters. “It has infinite time to research and explain things. It can put every question in the context of your entire medical history.”

But there are big technical problems to solve here as we rush into popular AI tools in front of us:

Especially given mainstream user propensity to humanize and anthropomorphize AI technologies so easily.

“The other side: AI skeptics question giving medical information to a chatbot that has shown a propensity to reinforce delusions and even encourage suicide.”

““What could go wrong when an LLM trained to confirm, support, and encourage user bias meets a hypochondriac with a headache?” Aidan Moher wrote on BlueSky.”

“Anil Dash, advocate for more humane technology, agreed on BlueSky that it “isn’t a good idea,” but also wrote that “it’s vastly more understandable than most medical jargon, far more accessible than 99% of people’s healthcare that they can afford, and very often pretty accurate in broad strokes, especially compared to WebMD or Reddit.”

The thorniest question of course is the fungibility of Data, which is the key ingredient to make AI do anything useful at all, especially in the ‘Physical AI’ world. It’s Box no. 4 in the AI Tech Stack below.

“Between the lines: Like other information shared with ChatGPT, health information could potentially be made available to litigants or government agencies via a subpoena or other court order.”

“That seems particularly noteworthy at a time when access to reproductive health care and gender-affirming care are under threat at both the state and federal levels.”

“User data could get swept up in other ways, too. As part of their copyright battle against OpenAI, news organizations have obtained access to millions of ChatGPT logs, including from temporary chats that were meant to be deleted after 30 days.”

“Sam Altman has called for some sort of legal privilege to protect sensitive health and legal information.”

“What to watch: OpenAI said it has more health features on its road map and will talk soon about additional work with various health care systems.”

Of course, the above discussion centers around OpenAI and other LLM AI chatbots being used by end users for their personal health.

The other side of the coin is the use of AI by pharma companies working with LLM AI companies, to discover and construct better treatments faster and cheaper, using Transformer based AI technologies.

Here, a must read piece by the Economist, “An AI revolution in drugmaking is under way”,provides positive data on how this is actually proceeding in these early AI days:

“It will transform how medicines are created—and the industry itself”.

“Insilico Medicine, a biotech firm in Boston, seems to have been the first to apply the new generation of AI, based on so-called transformer models, to the business of finding drugs. Back in 2019 its researchers wondered whether they could use these to invent new drugs from biological and chemical data. Their first quarry was idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a lung disease.”

“They began by training an AI on datasets related to this condition and found a promising target protein. A second AI then suggested molecules that would latch onto this protein and change its behaviour, but were not too toxic or unstable. After that human chemists took over, creating and testing the shortlisted molecules. They called the result rentosertib, and it has recently completed successful mid-stage clinical trials. The firm says it took 18 months to arrive at a candidate for development—compared with a usual timeline of four and a half years.”

Fast forward to today, and the numbers are promising indeed:

“Insilico now has a pipeline of more than 40 AI-developed drugs it is assessing for conditions such as cancers and diseases of the bowels and kidneys. And its approach is spreading. One projection suggests annual investment in the field will rise from $3.8bn in 2025 to $15.2bn in 2030.”

“Tie-ups between pharma companies and AI firms are also becoming common. In 2024 a dozen deals were announced, with a combined value of $10bn according to IQVIA, a health-intelligence company.”

Nvidia is also a key company working with big pharma in these new healthcare AI arenas:

“And last October Eli Lilly, another pharma giant, announced a collaboration with Nvidia, the firm whose chips are widely used to train and run transformer-based AI models, to build the industry’s most powerful supercomputer, and thus speed up drug discovery and development.”

And both the pharma and AI industries are figuring out how to make the new economics work under long-established healthcare industry economics and regulatory regimes:

“Given the pharmaceutical industry’s weird economics—candidate drugs entering clinical trials have a 90% failure rate, bringing the cost of developing a successful one to a whopping $2.8bn—even marginal improvements in efficiency would offer big gains. Reports from across the industry suggest that AI has begun to deliver these. AI-designed drugs are whizzing through the preclinical phase (that before human trials begin) in only 12-18 months, compared with three to five years previously. And the success of AI-designed drugs in safety trials is better too. A study published in 2024, of their performance in such trials, found an 80-90% success rate. This compares with historical averages of 40-65%. That, in turn, boosts the overall rate of getting drugs successfully through the entire pipeline to 9-18%, up from 5-10%.”

Include in all this the context of ‘digital twins’ I’ve discussed before, and synthetic patients, and the AI/Healthcare aperture opens up further:

“The most intriguing use of AI to improve trials, though, is the creation of synthetic patients (sometimes called digital twins) to act as matched controls for real participants. To do this an AI goes through data from past trials and learns to predict what might happen to a participant if they follow the natural course of their condition rather than being treated. Then, when a volunteer is enrolled in a trial and given a drug, the AI creates a “patient” with the same set of characteristics, such as age, weight, existing conditions and disease stage. The drug’s efficacy in the real patient can thus be measured against the progress of this virtual alternative.”

“If adopted, the use of synthetic patients would reduce the size of trials’ control arms and could, potentially, eliminate them entirely in some cases. Their use might also appeal to participants, since the chance of receiving the treatment under test rather than being put into a control group without it would rise.”

Zoom out a bit, and one can see positive opportunities for OpenAI and the pharma industry on this end of the AI Healthcare ecosystem.

“Companies such as OpenAI, which led development of the transformers known as large language models, and Isomorphic Labs, a drug-discovery startup spun out of Google DeepMind, are already training systems to reason and make discoveries in the life sciences, hoping these tools will become capable biologists. For now, drug firms have the advantage of a wealth of data and the context to understand and use it, so collaboration is the order of the day. OpenAI, for example, is working with Moderna, a pioneer of RNA vaccines, to speed the development of personalised cancer vaccines. But as the new models make biology more predictable the balance of advantage in the industry may change.”

“Regardless of that, AI has already improved things greatly. If it can wring from late-stage trials the sorts of improvement it has brought to the earlier part of the process, the number of drugs arriving on the market should rise significantly. In the longer run, the possibilities for enhancing human health are enormous.”

The entire piece is worth reading in detail to get a fuller sense of the possibilities around AI and pharma processes to discover and develop new drugs.

This whole area of AI and Healthcare is just beginning to sort out the thorny details at this early point in the AI Tech Wave.

At both ends of AI and the Healthcare pipeline: The creation of drugs and treatments, and how billions of mainstream users interact with the healthcare industry to access the accelerated drugs and treatments.

The multi-hyphenate musician, producer and entrepreneur launched yet another side hustle at CES 2026, the Trinity 3-wheeler. This new micromobility solution made its debut in Nvidia’s Showcase section, in part due to the heavy involvement of the chip maker’s DGX Spark technology in the Trinity’s AI-powered heart.

Why a 3-wheeler? Trinity is set up with two driven wheels at the rear, rather than the familiar Morgan-style set-up. Any inherent instability is countered by a tilting system that will angle the bodywork into the corner. This isn’t new technology; it forms the basis of existing machines like the Danish Carver Cruiser and the Helix Autocycle, and dates back all the way to the Mercedes Benz F400 Carving concept from 2001.

What’s new here is the underlying electronics. Described as an ‘organising brain for life on the move, the compact single-seater is driver-focused, not autonomous. The AI is agentic – in that it acts as a bridge between the driver, their personal information, preferences, schedule, itinerary, likes and dislikes.

‘Trinity represents the future of micromobility - where humans, vehicles, and AI agents work together seamlessly,’ says will.i.am, who is set to teach a class called ‘The Agentic Self’ at Arizona State University this Spring.

The underlying benefits of all that Nvidia processing are meant to transform this mode of personal transport into a form of virtual assistant, ‘managing calendars, errands, communications, and cloud services through natural conversation while the human stays focused on driving.'

The car itself has been developed in collaboration with self-balancing tech from New Hampshire-based DEKA, an R&D firm set up by Segway inventor Dean Kamen. The styling was handling by Ryan Friedlinghaus of Southern California’s cult West Coast Customs, a custom auto shop that has worked with will.i.am on many one-off automotive projects, including a radically overhauled Mercedes-AMG GT and a custom DeLorean.

The project will be launched on Kickstarter, with tech specs that point to a performance orientated machine, with a projected range of 150 miles and the ability to hit 60mph in a motorbike-rivalling two seconds. Unlike the two-seat Helix and Cruiser linked above, Trinity only has room for one.

Projected price is around $30,000 and should the crowdfunding campaign be successful, first deliveries are expected in August 2027, with all manufacturing based in LA’s Boyle Heights.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eKd3vgSLqX5egRZQAB6MZP-1920-80.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 02:58:14.360897

What Travelers Should Know The new nonstop flights operate daily through mid-April, covering the core winter season.","One day on Bequia. Another on Mustique. Then a sail to Mayreau. Or maybe a stop on Union. It’s always been one of the best places for island hopping in the Caribbean. It’s actually getting here that’s always been something of a challenge.

That has been changing, though, in recent years, as the country’s new Argyle airport allowed for the first ever international flights from the mainland US and Canada.

And now, St Vincent has another major new route, another boost for a destination that has been drawing increased attention from travelers over the past year.

Delta Air Lines is now officially operating daily nonstop service between Atlanta and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, adding a major new access point during the peak winter travel season.

Daily Nonstop Service Is Now Operating

The route began operating late last month and runs daily through Apr. 12, 2026. Delta is currently the only U.S. carrier offering nonstop service from Atlanta to St. Vincent.

Flights are operated using Boeing 737-800 aircraft with First Class, Delta Comfort+, and Main Cabin seating.

Why This Route Matters Now

St. Vincent has long been one of the more logistically challenging Caribbean destinations to reach from the continental United States. Daily nonstop service significnatly reduces travel time and simplifies trip planning, particularly for winter travelers.

The timing coincides with increased interest in the destination following recent hotel openings and broader visibility for St. Vincent as both a resort base and a gateway to the Grenadines.

Improved Access to the Grenadines

St. Vincent serves as the main gateway to the Grenadines, including Bequia, Canouan, and Mustique. With Atlanta acting as a major hub, travelers from across the U.S. can now reach the islands with fewer connections and more scheduling flexibility.

Delta has positioned the route as part of its expanded winter Caribbean network, targeting destinations that have historically had limited nonstop U.S. airlift.

Where to Stay in St. Vincent and the Grenadines

Sandals Saint Vincent and the Grenadines

Opened in 2024, Sandals’ first resort in St. Vincent has been a major driver of new demand for the island. The adults-only, all-inclusive property is located on Buccament Bay and features beachfront rooms and villas, multiple dining venues, and direct access to the main island’s natural attractions, along with some overwater villas, too.

Young Island Resort

One of the Caribbean’s classic private-island resorts, the old-school Young Island sits just offshore from Kingstown and is accessed by short boat transfer. The resort offers standalone cottages, a long-established restaurant, and a low-density, traditional Caribbean atmosphere that takes you back a few decades in a very charming way.

Bequia Beach Hotel

Located on Bequia, this boutique beachfront hotel is a popular choice for travelers looking for a quieter Grenadines experience. Reaching Bequia requires a short onward flight or ferry from St. Vincent, but the island’s relaxed pace and walkable beaches remain a major draw.

Soho Beach House Canouan

Soho Beach House is located on Canouan, offering a private-club-style experience with beach access, dining, and wellness facilities. Access is via St. Vincent followed by a connecting flight, positioning it as a more exclusive option within the Grenadines.

What Travelers Should Know

The new nonstop flights operate daily through mid-April, covering the core winter season. Delta has not yet announced whether the service will continue beyond the current schedule window.

For travelers who have had St. Vincent on their radar, the launch removes one of the biggest remaining barriers to visiting — and places the island more firmly within reach for the 2026 winter season.

Flights are about $547 roundtrip right now, according to what we found on Google Flights.",https://www.caribjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/st-vincent-delta.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 22:58:44.674185

Emphasizes that if revenue growth, earnings or AI monetization fall short of these already tempered assumptions, the scope for multiple compression could limit upside from current levels.","Adobe currently trades on a P/E of 19.61x. That sits below the Software industry average P/E of 32.59x and well below the peer group average of 59.17x, which means the market is valuing Adobe’s earnings at a lower multiple than many comparable names. Simply Wall St’s proprietary Fair Ratio for Adobe is 34.68x, which estimates the P/E that might be reasonable given factors such as its earnings growth profile, profit margins, industry, market cap and risk characteristics.

The Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple comparison with industry or peers because it adjusts for Adobe specific fundamentals rather than assuming all software companies deserve similar multiples. With Adobe’s actual P/E of 19.61x sitting below the Fair Ratio of 34.68x, this approach suggests the shares may be trading at a lower valuation on an earnings multiple basis today.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Adobe Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. These let you attach a clear story about Adobe to the numbers you care about, from your assumed fair value through to your revenue, earnings and margin estimates.

A Narrative on Simply Wall St connects three things in one place: the business story you believe, the financial forecast that story implies, and the fair value that follows from those assumptions, all inside an accessible tool on the Community page that is already used by millions of investors.

Once you set up a Narrative, the platform compares your fair value to Adobe’s current share price so you can decide for yourself whether the gap between price and value looks wide enough to consider buying, trimming or simply watching.

Because Narratives update automatically when new information such as news, earnings or guidance is added to the platform, your story and valuation stay current without you needing to rebuild a model each time something changes.

For Adobe, one community member’s Narrative points to a fair value of about US$585.69 per share, while another sits closer to US$271.93. This shows how different investors can look at the same company, apply different revenue, margin and P/E assumptions, and land on very different yet clearly explained views of what the shares might be worth.

For Adobe, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Adobe Narratives:

🐂 Adobe Bull Case

Fair value: US$383.06 per share

Implied discount to fair value: about 12.8% undervalued vs the recent US$333.95 price

Revenue growth assumption: 8.12%

Frames Adobe as a high quality, wide moat business where AI competition is real, but the company still generates strong profitability and maintains a solid balance sheet.

Builds a three-scenario valuation map across bear, base and bull cases, then blends them into a probability-weighted fair value around the mid US$300s.

Assumes revenue growth a little above 8%, profit margins in the high 20s, and a future P/E in the high teens as Adobe settles into life as a mature market leader rather than a high growth outlier.

🐻 Adobe Bear Case

Fair value: about US$271.93 per share

Implied premium to fair value: about 22.8% overvalued vs the recent US$333.95 price

Revenue growth assumption: 6.66%

Focuses on the risk that rising AI-related costs, heavier competition and regulatory pressures compress margins and pull Adobe’s valuation multiple lower over time.

Aligns with the more cautious end of analyst targets, where fair value sits in the low US$270s and assumes slower revenue growth, lower net margins and a mid-teens future P/E.

Emphasizes that if revenue growth, earnings or AI monetization fall short of these already tempered assumptions, the scope for multiple compression could limit upside from current levels.

Put side by side, these Narratives give you a clear sense of the current debate on Adobe, from a supportive view that sees the stock as trading below a reasonable fair value, through to a cautious stance that treats the shares as pricing in more optimism than the numbers justify. If you are building your own view, they can be a useful starting point for deciding which story feels closer to your expectations for growth, margins and the role AI will play in Adobe’s business.

A Dell executive infamously said out loud what AI deniers need to hear: Consumers are not buying PCs ""based on AI."" This was widely reported because of course it was, my industry is terrible. But left unsaid is that Dell doesn't sell that many PCs to consumers, doesn't have an AI strategy for PCs (commercial or consumer), and is such a savvy marketer that it killed off its only solid consumer brand, XPS, last year only to bring it limping back to a market that had lost interest in Dell a decade ago or more anyway. Yeah, we should listen to these people.

Let's look at some numbers.

We're on the cusp of a new round of quarterly earnings reports, but here's what the most recent information about the top PC makers shows us.

Lenovo's Intelligent Devices Group (IDG) is responsible for its PCs, tablets, and phones, and it earned $15.1 billion in the quarter ending September 30, 2025, up 12 percent year-over-year (YOY). Lenovo is decisively in first place in the PC market with a record 25.6 percent market share (unit sales), and it claimed “industry-leading profitability” with over 33 percent of its unit sales now AI PCs. Lenovo is also the world's biggest maker of AI PCs, with 31.1 percent market share. So that seems to be working out pretty well for the company.

HP's PC business earned $10.4 billion in the quarter ending October 31, 2025. Revenues from consumer PC sales were up 10 percent YOY, and HP touted that 30 percent of the PCs it sells now are AI PCs. Looking at its earnings report, I see that net revenues from consumer PC sales were $11 billion, and HP is marketing the hell out of AI. HP, like Lenovo, is building out its own AI chatbot, the HP AI Companion, which is free for customers to use.

Apple reported Mac revenues of $8.7 billion in the quarter ending September 27, a gain of 13 percent YOY. That's pocket change compared to what it earns from the iPhone, but everyone is familiar with how Apple Intelligence is key to Apple's core hardware products, and that it has struggled to get conversational Siri up to its standards. And the reason we know all that is because AI is so important to Apple and its future. Apple doesn't break down consumer and commercial sales, but it's fair to assume the vast majority is consumer-based, or what I could call sales to individuals, not businesses.

So what about Dell? Where does Dell, the sudden genius about consumer PC buying habits and AI, land in all this?

Rock bottom, that's where.

Dell made just $1.9 billion in revenues selling PCs to consumers in the quarter ending October 31, 2025, a decline of 7 percent. Most of Dell's PC revenues come from commercial customers, who want boring, easily locked-down PCs no human being could love.

Spanning judicial, economic, digital, health and fiscal sectors, these measures reflect his strategic foresight, inclusive governance and firm commitment to sustainable development, citizen wellbeing and globally aligned institutional excellence.

Safeguarding family health

The most recent of these landmark measures is Royal Decree No 111/2025 regulating premarital medical examinations, enforced from January 1, 2026. This decree places preventive healthcare at the forefront of social policy by mandating premarital medical screening for every Omani intending to marry, even if the other party is non-Omani and regardless of where the marriage contract is concluded.

Under the decree, accredited health institutions must conduct examinations according to approved scientific and technical standards, inform both parties of their individual results and provide medical counselling when required. Strict confidentiality is guaranteed, with disclosure to third parties prohibited. Upon completion, couples are issued an official certificate, without which marriage officiants are barred from concluding the marriage contract. Penalties for violations include fines and imprisonment, underscoring the seriousness of compliance. This measure highlights the state’s commitment to protecting family stability, reducing health risks and promoting informed marital decisions.

Broadening the revenue base

Royal Decree No 56/2025 introduced the framework for a personal income tax on high-income earners. Scheduled to take effect in January 2028, the tax imposes a modest 5% rate on individuals earning more than RO42,000 annually. Heralded as a pivotal step in fiscal reform, the measure aims to diversify revenue sources and reduce reliance on oil income.

Extensive economic and social studies informed the law’s design – approximately 99% of citizens will remain unaffected due to the high exemption threshold. The framework incorporates deductions and exemptions for education, healthcare, primary housing, inheritance, zakat and charitable donations, reinforcing social justice and fairness. An advanced electronic system developed by the Tax Authority will enable voluntary compliance and accurate income verification. The reform aligns closely with Oman Vision 2040, supporting fiscal sustainability while helping fund the social protection system.

A new era in healthcare

Earlier in 2025, healthcare reform took centre stage with the issuance of two major Royal Decrees. Royal Decree No 43/2025 promulgated the Public Health Law, establishing a comprehensive framework for regulating public health and strengthening coordination between the health sector and other areas of government. Fully aligned with Oman Vision 2040, the law supports inclusive, sustainable health services and provides a reference point for managing public health challenges.

Complementing this was Royal Decree No 44/2025, which established the Transfer and Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissue Regulation Law. Addressing the rising demand for organ transplants, the law underpins the National Organ Transplant Programme and sets out clear, ethical procedures for organ donation during life or after death. It safeguards the rights and safety of donors and recipients, defines institutional responsibilities and ensures adherence to the highest professional standards. Together, these laws mark a transformative chapter in Oman’s healthcare journey, reinforced by growing expertise, public engagement and unwavering royal support.

Legal foundations for the digital age

As Oman advances its digital transformation, Royal Decree No 39/2025 promulgating the Electronic Transactions Law stands out as a cornerstone reform. The law grants full legal recognition to electronic signatures, contracts and documents, placing these on par with traditional paper-based instruments. This alignment with global digital practices modernises Oman’s legal and commercial frameworks and supports the expansion of e-commerce and digital services.

The law also establishes a trust services management committee to regulate service providers and ensure secure digital interactions, while incorporating safeguards to promote inclusivity, particularly for persons with disabilities. By enabling secure, reliable digital transactions, the legislation enhances investor confidence and strengthens Oman’s standing as a regional hub for digital innovation. Its timing and scope complement broader judicial and economic reforms aimed at building a modern, competitive economy.

A transformative judicial milestone

On March 23, 2025 His Majesty Sultan Haitham issued Royal Decree No 35/2025 establishing the Court of Investment and Commerce – a development widely described as transformative for Oman’s judicial and economic landscape. Designed as a specialised judicial authority with exclusive jurisdiction over commercial and investment disputes, the court consolidates expertise and ensures consistency in rulings.

Its jurisdiction spans a wide array of areas, including foreign investments, banking and financial instruments, maritime sales, insurance, bankruptcy, arbitration-related disputes, intellectual property, electronic commercial transactions and public-private contracts. Efficiency lies at the heart of the new court’s design, with strict timelines for rulings, electronic submission of expert reports and the use of secure video systems for remote hearings. These innovations reduce delays, protect assets and align Oman’s judiciary with leading international standards, significantly enhancing the country’s attractiveness as an investment destination.

Reinventing economic zones

Running parallel to judicial reform was Royal Decree No 38/2025 promulgating the Special Economic Zones and Free Zones Law. This legislation harmonises incentives, exemptions and guarantees across zones while offering special privileges for strategic projects. Central to the reform is a one-stop system that enables investors to obtain all approvals, licences and permits through a single streamlined process, significantly reducing bureaucratic hurdles.

The law goes beyond administrative efficiency by linking incentives to employment generation, local content and high-value-added activities, ensuring that investment directly supports economic diversification. A particularly innovative provision allows freehold residential property sales within economic and free zones, encouraging the development of integrated communities and enhancing the long-term appeal of these zones. The reform positions Oman’s economic zones as dynamic engines of sustainable growth.

These Royal Decrees issued over the past year form a cohesive reform narrative – one that begins with individual wellbeing and family health, extends to fiscal resilience and public health, and culminates in a modern judicial and investment ecosystem. Each decree addresses a critical pillar of national life, yet all are unified by a citizen-centred vision.

Together, these measures reaffirm His Majesty Sultan Haitham’s determination to build a future defined by stability, prosperity and opportunity. By aligning national priorities with global best practices, Oman is confidently charting a path towards a resilient, inclusive and competitive future under the wise leadership of His Majesty.",https://www.muscatdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/RD.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 19:59:42.672908

INDIANAPOLIS — Eli Lilly and Company and Ventyx Biosciences, Inc., a San Diego-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing oral therapies for patients with inflammatory-mediated diseases, today announced entry into a definitive agreement for Lilly to acquire Ventyx.

Ventyx is developing a pipeline of small molecule therapeutics, including NLRP3 inhibitors, designed to treat inflammation across a broad range of disease states with high unmet need. These include opportunities across cardiometabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and inflammatory disorders. The company’s clinical-stage programs target key immune pathways with the goal of offering improved efficacy and safety compared to existing treatments.

“There is increasing evidence that inflammation is a key driver of many chronic diseases,” said Daniel M. Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., chief scientific and product officer, and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “Ventyx’s clinical-stage pipeline addresses a critical need for better treatment options across diseases mediated by chronic inflammation and further strengthens our ability to deliver meaningful advances for patients living with challenging diseases across focus areas of cardiometabolic health, neurodegeneration and autoimmunity.”

“Our portfolio of class-leading NLRP3 inhibitors modulate residual and chronic inflammation that is now recognized as a major risk factor in a host of neuroinflammatory, cardiometabolic and cardiovascular diseases,” said Raju Mohan, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Ventyx Biosciences. “We believe that Lilly is an ideal strategic partner, with unparalleled resources, a passion for innovative oral drugs and a commitment to advance novel therapies that fill a vast unmet need for patients suffering from these debilitating diseases and disorders.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Lilly will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Ventyx for $14.00 per share of common stock in an all-cash transaction (equal to an aggregate equity value of approximately $1.2 billion). The transaction is not subject to any financing condition and is expected to close in the first half of 2026, subject to approval by Ventyx stockholders and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.

The purchase price payable at closing represents a premium of approximately 62% to the 30-day volume-weighted average trading price of Ventyx’s common stock ended on January 5, 2026. The boards of directors of both companies have approved the transaction.

To demonstrate their commitment to the transaction, entities affiliated with New Science Ventures and all directors and officers of Ventyx have signed voting and support agreements whereby they agree to vote to approve the transaction. The shares subject to the agreements represent a total of approximately 10% of Ventyx’s outstanding common stock.

Lilly will determine the accounting treatment of this transaction in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles upon closing. This transaction will thereafter be reflected in Lilly’s financial results and financial guidance.

“Will it come from Treasury purchases and hence put upward pressure on the level of rates?
To make sure there’s sufficient demand among bond investors, Treasury yields must remain attractive relative to the competition.
Foreign governments accounted for more than 40% of Treasury bond holdings in the early 2010s, up from just over 10% in the mid-1990s, he wrote in a New York Times op-ed last month.
“Foreign governments now make up less than 15% of the overall Treasury market.”","In a note on Saturday, he pointed out that Wall Street estimates for the volume of investment grade debt that’s on the way this year reach as high as $2.25 trillion.

That’s as the AI boom increasingly sends companies, including hyperscalers and adjacent firms, to the bond market to fund massive investments in data centers and other infrastructure.

“The significant increase in hyperscaler issuance raises questions about who will be the marginal buyer of IG paper,” Slok said. “Will it come from Treasury purchases and hence put upward pressure on the level of rates? Or might it come from mortgage purchases, putting upward pressure on mortgage spreads?”

With U.S. debt topping $38 trillion, the federal government has already borrowed $601 billion in the first three months of the 2026 fiscal year, which began in October 2025, according to the latest data from the Congressional Budget Office.

That’s $110 billion less than the deficit during the same period a year earlier as tariffs helped revenue outpace spending. But the Supreme Court could strike down President Donald Trump’s global tariffs soon, and this year’s tax season should see a surge of refunds to account for new tax cuts under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Meanwhile, Trump has vowed to boost defense spending to $1.5 trillion a year from $1 trillion, threatening to further deepen federal budget deficits.

And despite the Federal Reserve’s series of rate cuts this past autumn, Treasury yields remain about where they were in early September, suggesting the government will not see much relief on debt-servicing costs that are also contributing to the overall tally of red ink.

“The bottom line is that the volume of fixed-income products coming to market this year is significant and is likely to put upward pressure on rates and credit spreads as we go through 2026,” Slok said.

To make sure there’s sufficient demand among bond investors, Treasury yields must remain attractive relative to the competition. Failure to draw enough investors raises the risk of so-called fiscal dominance, or when a central bank must step into to finance widening deficits.

That’s what former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned of last weekend, during a panel hosted by the American Economic Association.

“The preconditions for fiscal dominance are clearly strengthening,” she said, noting debt is on a steep upward trajectory toward 150% of GDP over the next three decades.

At the same time, he holders of U.S. debt have shifted drastically over the past decade, tilting more toward profit-driven private investors and away from foreign governments that are less sensitive to prices.

That threatens to turn the U.S. financial system more fragile in times of market stress, according to Geng Ngarmboonanant, a managing director at JPMorgan and former deputy chief of staff to Yellen during her tenure at Treasury.

Foreign governments accounted for more than 40% of Treasury bond holdings in the early 2010s, up from just over 10% in the mid-1990s, he wrote in a New York Times op-ed last month. This reliable bloc of investors allowed the U.S. to borrow vast sums at artificially low rates.

“Those easy times are over,” he warned. “Foreign governments now make up less than 15% of the overall Treasury market.”","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-637420748-e1768070604614.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-10 20:00:02.344870

See our latest analysis for Bank of New York Mellon.

Recent trading has come after a strong run, with the current US$119.04 share price sitting against a 13.87% 3 month share price return and a much larger 61.33% 1 year total shareholder return, suggesting momentum has been building over time.

If you are comparing Bank of New York Mellon Corporation with other financial names, it can also be useful to widen the lens and look at fast growing stocks with high insider ownership for ideas beyond large established institutions.

So with Bank of New York Mellon Corporation trading at US$119.04, a 61.33% 1 year total return and a modest discount to analyst targets, is there still value left on the table, or is the market already pricing in future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: Fairly Valued

At a last close of US$119.04 versus a narrative fair value of US$119.03, Bank of New York Mellon Corporation is effectively aligned with that framework, which leans heavily on technology, digital assets and capital returns to shareholders.

Accelerated investment in digital platforms (including digital asset custody, AI integration, and the NEXEN ecosystem), coupled with strong early adoption, positions BNY Mellon for improved operating leverage and net margin expansion over the coming years, as scalable technology reduces costs and increases cross-selling opportunities.

Read the complete narrative.

Curious how that tech push, fee based services and long term buybacks are wired into the model? The valuation leans on specific growth, margin and multiple assumptions you may want to test for yourself.

Result: Fair Value of $119.03 (ABOUT RIGHT)

Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.

However, this story can change quickly if fee pressure weighs on high margin services, or if digital asset disruption chips away at BNY's core custody franchise.

Another View: Multiples Point To A Cushion

While the fair value narrative lands almost exactly on the current US$119.04 share price, the simple P/E picture looks a bit different. BNY trades on 16.6x earnings, compared with 19.3x for the broader US market, 25.9x for the US Capital Markets industry, and a 30.6x peer average. Our fair ratio sits close by at 16.9x. This suggests the market already prices BNY in line with those fundamentals but with less valuation stretch than many peers. The question is whether that cushion feels like comfort or a sign that expectations are already well calibrated.

A developer of voice-based artificial intelligence (AI) tools for businesses, the company is winning tons of contracts and driving strong revenue growth. However, the business is burning a lot of cash and trades at a premium valuation.

Here's why SoundHound AI stock fell in 2025, and whether you should scoop up some shares at these discounted prices.

AI tailwinds and a history of losing money

SoundHound AI has adeptly expanded its voice-based AI technology during the past few years of the AI revolution. It offers products to support customer service, restaurant drive-thrus, car voice systems, and more, winning numerous contracts worldwide across various industries. Its focus on commercial use cases has helped it win contracts when competing with big technology companies.

Revenue is exploding higher. Sales increased 68% year-over-year to $42 million last quarter. Since going public in 2022, revenue has grown cumulatively by over 1,000%.

So why is the stock down? The primary reason is the company's inability to generate a profit while heavily diluting its shareholders. SoundHound AI's free cash flow was negative $111 million over the last twelve months, a figure that has only gotten worse since it became public. On top of this cash drain, the company has a large stock-based compensation program that is diluting shareholders but is not included in cash flow. Shares outstanding are up over 100% since the company went public, which will be a huge drag on long-term returns.

Should you buy SoundHound AI stock?

Even though SoundHound AI's stock collapsed last year, it still trades at a premium price relative to its trailing revenue. With a market capitalization of $5 billion, the stock has a price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 32, which is more than 10 times the average of the S&P 500 Index.

A bull may argue that SoundHound AI is growing quickly, which will bring down this P/S ratio. Investors need to remember, though, that this company is failing to generate positive free cash flow and is heavily diluting shareholders with stock-based compensation. Combine this with a high starting valuation, and SoundHound AI stock does not look attractive even after falling 50% in 2025.",https://finviz.com/favicon_2x.png,N,,2026-01-10 19:00:37.079637

xAI, OpenAI and Anthropic have been rapidly raising more money, adding to the notion of 'aspirational' valuations across the AI startup scene

OpenAI is expected to raise funds at a $750 billion valuation - 50% above its previous, $500 billion estimated valuation.

The jury is still out on whether creators of popular artificial-intelligence chatbots will be able to work out business models that justify their hefty investments. But that hasn't stopped those companies from racking up ever more money in the private market.

Valuations keep rising for some of the biggest AI unicorns, as evidenced by xAI's announcement Tuesday that it had raised $20 billion in a Series E round that exceeded its $15 billion target. CNBC in November reported that the Grok chatbot maker, launched in 2023 by Elon Musk, was expected to close a $15 billion funding round at a $230 billion premoney valuation.

That would mark a premium compared to what xAI was worth last March when it acquired Musk's social-media platform, X. That transaction valued xAI at $80 billion and X, formerly known as Twitter, at $33 billion. xAI has raised a total of $42.1 billion, according to PitchBook, which tracks private capital markets.

""It is likely that the venture market is experiencing an AI bubble. The data checks most of the boxes,"" Kyle Stanford, PitchBook's head of research for the U.S. venture market, said in a recent report.

""The market has shown a sharp price increase, the market narrative has become 'AI versus the rest,' and much of the investment is driven by investor envy and fear of missing out on returns,"" Stanford added.

As of last October, ChatGPT creator OpenAI was worth $500 billion and had raised a total $66.4 billion from investors since its inception, according to PitchBook. Anthropic ended 2025 with more than $39 billion raised since it was founded by former OpenAI employees in 2021. In September, Anthropic was valued at $183 billion, or almost three times what it was worth less than a year earlier.

Anthropic, which develops the Claude chatbot, is now in talks to raise $10 billion at a $350 billion valuation, or almost twice what it was worth as of its previous round, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. And OpenAI is planning to raise as much as $100 billion at a $750 billion valuation, according to the Journal. Earlier reports had pinned OpenAI's potential value at as much as $830 billion.

""What's really unprecedented is kind of the size of the investment going into the space right now,"" said Andrew Alden, vice president of quantitative research at Forge Global, which operates a marketplace where investors can trade shares of private companies.

Alden pointed to Forge's trading data, which showed that 45% of volume in 2025 was related to AI companies; that compares with 40% in 2024 and just 18% in 2023. Returns on Forge's dedicated AI basket of 19 companies grew 191% in 2025, according to Alden.

""There still needs to be a validation of the business model, and I think that is coming,"" he said - noting that some companies have ""aspirational"" valuations that are very high compared to the revenue they currently generate.

xAI recorded a net loss of $1.46 billion for its September quarter after spending $7.8 billion across the first nine months of 2025, Bloomberg News reported Thursday. And fresh off its latest fundraise, the company said this week that it will invest $20 billion to build its third data center.

xAI's revenue for the three-month period that ended on Sept. 30 amounted to $107 million. That's almost double what was recorded for its June quarter, according to Bloomberg.

Anthropic, which is reportedly a candidate for a public listing, planned to burn almost $3 billion on $4.2 billion in sales in 2025, the Journal reported in November, citing financial documents showed to investors over the summer.

OpenAI doesn't expect to be cash-flow positive until 2030. By then, HBSC analysts have calculated that it could face a funding shortfall of $207 billion.

The company was on pace to burn $9 billion after generating $13 billion in sales in 2025 as of November, according to the Journal, which cited financial documents. Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, has said the company was making much more than $13 billion and that revenue was growing ""steeply.""

""Whether we burn $500 million a year or $5 billion or $50 billion a year, I don't care - I genuinely don't,"" Altman said in 2024. ""It's going to be expensive. It's totally worth it.""

A representative for OpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment. An inquiry sent to xAI received an automated reply. Anthropic declined to comment.

Much of what AI firms are raising is put to work developing data centers and equipping them with expensive hardware, including AI chips. Public hyperscalers, such as Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT), could collectively spend potentially $2.9 trillion on AI-related capital expenditures through 2028.

And as companies develop their AI models, they're spending more and more to train them, according to Stanford University's latest AI Index report. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei told CNBC in early 2024 that it could cost up to $1 billion to train AI models that year. He also forecast that spending on training could rise to as much as $10 billion this year.

""I think this is the fundamental problem with generative AI and LLMs today - they are so expensive,"" said investor Michael Burry, of ""The Big Short"" fame, in a Substack debate published Friday. ""It is hard to understand what the profit model is, or what any one model's competitive advantage will be - will it be able to charge more, or run cheaper?

While OpenAI, xAI and Anthropic have some of the deepest pockets among private AI firms, they're far from the only ones benefitting from investor enthusiasm.

Investment in AI accounted for more than half of the $512.6 billion deployed by venture capitalists around the world in 2025, according to data from PitchBook. A year earlier, investments in AI made up 38% of all venture-capital deal value.

""There are parts of the AI ecosystem that are probably in bubbles,"" Google (GOOGL) (GOOG) DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said last month. ""One example would be just seed rounds for startups that basically haven't even got going yet, and they're raising at tens of billions of dollars.""

Heavy investment in such startups has helped more than 50 individuals working on AI companies become billionaires in 2025, according to Forbes. Edwin Chen, whose 6-year-old business Surge AI refines AI models, is the wealthiest of the new class of AI billionaires, worth about $18 billion.

Read more: AI made tech billionaires even richer this year. Here's how much.

Former OpenAI executive Mira Murati's Thinking Machines Lab raised $2 billion at a $12 billion valuation last July in one of the largest seed rounds of all time. By November, barely a month after introducing its first product, it was in talks to raise more cash at a $50 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported.

Companies working on so-called physical AI, such as humanoid robots and driverless vehicles, have also been popular. Figure AI was most recently valued at $39 billion, while the Alphabet-backed robotaxi firm Waymo is reportedly in talks to join the $100 billion club.

Most of the top 10 venture-capital deals of the December quarter involved companies that heavily integrate AI into their businesses, according to PitchBook data. At the top of the leaderboard was Anthropic's deal with Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft, followed by Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos's cash infusion into his physical-AI startup, Project Prometheus.

Fears of an AI bubble have also been prominent in the public markets. Stock-market bulls have argued that there's still room for companies to grow, while more pessimistic investors say that tech-company valuations are too high and could collapse.

""We see evidence of froth in circular investments between leading AI firms and suppliers, [and] concentrated valuations in a few frontier labs, while at the same time, we think the underlying fundamentals remain orders of magnitude stronger than in prior tech bubbles,"" Truist Securities analysts said in a recent note as they initiated coverage on several AI firms, including Palantir Technologies (PLTR).

Don't miss: Big Tech needs a staggering $1.5 trillion to fund the AI boom. This is the complex playbook it's using to get it.

Franklin Barbecue Dallas just isn’t the epicenter of Texas barbecue.
And that seems to be why people still pay attention to Pecan Lodge (and to Terry Black’s in Deep Ellum, even the original in Austin is overrated).","American Airlines is introducing Pecan Lodge barbecue as a first class pre-order option on flights from Dallas – Fort Worth to the New York area (New York LaGuardia, JFK, and Newark – although they don’t mention Newark in their release).

Pre-order opens January 11 for flights departing from February 11. There are separate meals on offer in February and in March:

February: Barbecue platter Smoked brisket and smoked sausage, paired with creamy mac and cheese, crisp coleslaw and a side of pickles, onions and barbecue sauce

March: Chopped brisket sandwich Chopped brisket on a fresh brioche bun, roasted green beans, creamy potato salad and a side of pickles, onion, and barbecue sauce.

Interstellar Barbecue

Note that this is for DFW departures only. It’s not offered on the return. February’s option sounds far better, though do know that barbecue sauce should really just be for dipping. When the barbecue is any good, you shouldn’t be trying to hide the flavor of the meat. That’s what’s wrong with so many other styles of barbecue.

Although two years ago British Airways served barbecue out of Austin and oddly partnered wtih Aaron Franklin on the sauce (they weren’t serving his meat!). Franklin noted, “if you guys are going to be serving it on a plane… you need to hit the sauce pretty hard.”

Pecan Lodge was an elite barbecue destination a decade ago. I haven’t been in years, so can’t say what it’s like today though I note that while it was once #2 in the Texas Monthly Top 50 biennial barbecue rankings, it’s now fallen off that list completely. (The list itself has declined in value, however.) It’s likely fair to say that Pecan Lodge is not considered in the same league as LeRoy & Lewis, InterStellar, or Franklin.

Franklin Barbecue

Dallas just isn’t the epicenter of Texas barbecue. And that seems to be why people still pay attention to Pecan Lodge (and to Terry Black’s in Deep Ellum, even the original in Austin is overrated). A more legit pick would probably be Goldee’s in Fort Worth.

It seems like partnering with Pecan Lodge should mean (1) brisket, the staple of Texas barbecue, and an easier fit than their beef rib, (2) a side of The Hot Mess, a loaded split sweet potato piled with toppings and sauce. This is the thing people associate with Pecan Lodge.

I love to see American experimenting with new food partnerships, and route-specific food options. This is an airline that hasn’t been serving Australian wine on departures out of Sydney. So shifting its catering for a single set of flights could be a real progress.

And announcing short-term options is great, too. For too long the menus on American’s flights just haven’t varied enough. So offering different things every few months could be another sort of progress as well. It seems like it would be easy to extend a DFW-specific menu option to other flights (certainly easier than scaling it out to other stations).

Back in 2014 Delta partnered with Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group and brought Blue Smoke barbecue onboard as a premium-cabin menu on transatlantic JFK flights. It began with London Heathrow and later expanded to other Europe flights. (They’ve more recently done Fox Bros Bar-B-Q as part of their rotating premium-cabin menu, too.)

This was essentially the start of a broader rotation of Union Square Hospitality Group menus on Delta. (Today you can get a Shake Shack burger, for instance.)

On its own I take this as a ‘premium signal’ from American, copying Delta’s early playbook. American itself links it to its premium efforts as well, tying it to serving better coffee (Lavazza) and champagne (Bollinger).

During the third quarter, Peter Thiel's hedge fund sold out of Nvidia and initiated a position in Apple.

Apple's growth has been sluggish throughout the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, especially compared to Nvidia.

Nvidia is cheaper than Apple based on valuation metrics, but that doesn't necessarily make it the safer buy right now.

Peter Thiel is one of the most iconic Silicon Valley investors. The entrepreneur's first claim to fame was serving as a co-founder of PayPal with none other than the then-unknown Elon Musk.

After minting a fortune through his PayPal ownership, Thiel moved into a professional investor role. Perhaps his most lucrative opportunities came from being the first outside capital invested in Facebook (now Meta Platforms) as well as co-founding data analytics specialist Palantir Technologies.

Today, the tech savant manages capital through a hedge fund, called Thiel Macro. According to the fund's most recent 13F filing, Thiel completely exited his position in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) during the third quarter -- selling 537,742 shares.

Interestingly, Thiel swapped his exposure to the most influential player in the artificial intelligence (AI) arena for a stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) -- a stock that Warren Buffett had been trimming prior to his retirement.

Let's dig into what may have influenced these decisions and assess if growth investors should follow Thiel's playbook.

Should you sell Nvidia stock right now?

When OpenAI commercially launched ChatGPT on Nov. 30, 2022, Nvidia sported a market capitalization of just $345 billion. As of this writing (Jan. 7), Nvidia's market value is $4.6 trillion -- making it the most valuable company in the world.

While Nvidia's revenue and earnings continue to shatter its own records, underlying activity in the stock suggests investors may be getting a bit leery -- and the rally may finally be fading after three years. Since Nvidia reported earnings for its fiscal third quarter on Nov. 19, 2025, shares have risen by a rather pedestrian 1.7%.

My suspicion is that growth investors are increasingly weighing the impact competition from other GPU designers such as Advanced Micro Devices as well as custom application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designers like Broadcom could have on Nvidia's trajectory.

Indeed, Nvidia has numerous opportunities beyond AI accelerators and data centers. However, the timeline and significance of any potential upside from emerging applications remain big question marks at the moment.

This is all to say that investors such as Thiel could be anticipating at least a slowdown to Nvidia's momentum in the near term. As such, rotating capital into more predictable businesses like Apple may seem like the smarter move in terms of maintaining healthy risk-adjusted returns for your portfolio.

Why did Peter Thiel buy Apple stock?

There's a strong case to be made that Apple has achieved the least in terms of AI innovation among its megacap tech peers. Nevertheless, most investors may be overlooking the fact that Apple doesn't actually need to develop a new, groundbreaking device in order to be a winner of the AI revolution.

Apple's installed base of active devices is well north of 2 billion. Against this backdrop, Apple can benefit alongside the proliferation of generative AI as the technology becomes increasingly integrated across its consumer hardware lineup as well as a key driver of services revenue from the App Store.

Nvidia's share price ebbs and flows based on the latest AI-related headline and the health of the company is generally gauged on a quarterly basis when earnings are published. The paradox here is that despite blowing Wall Street's expectations out of the water time and again, Nvidia is slowly being perceived as a high-beta stock given its volatility. Beta is a measurement used to determine a company's risk profile.

By contrast, Apple's growth has been sluggish for a couple of years and the company's AI roadmap has been ambiguous at best. While mundane, Apple is still about as blue chip an opportunity as you'll see in the tech industry.

Despite a lackluster top line, Apple's cash-flow generation remains incredibly robust and predictable. Apple may present an investment opportunity with smoother returns compared to a volatile momentum stock like Nvidia.

Is Apple stock a buy right now?

Nvidia trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of about 24. Apple trades at a higher premium, boasting a forward P/E ratio of around 32.

Considering Nvidia's revenue and earnings are accelerating much faster than Apple's, in combination with the company's robust outlook relative to the iPhone maker, Nvidia is the ""cheaper"" stock. But that doesn't necessarily make it the better buy at this exact moment.

I think Thiel's recent portfolio management suggests that he thinks a pronounced correction could be in store for traditional growth and momentum stocks. Generally speaking, when sell-offs occur in more volatile positions, investors will redeploy capital elsewhere -- usually into more durable opportunities with resilient business models.

In my eyes, Apple checks off this criteria. So while Apple stock isn't a bargain, it's likely a safe bet right now for investors with a long-term time horizon.

The partnership, designated Third-Party Search, combines Microsoft's search advertising infrastructure with Epsilon's consumer identity data and PMX's strategic activation expertise to deliver what the companies characterize as a first-of-its-kind approach to audience targeting across search, native, and display inventory.

The integration enables advertisers to activate Epsilon's consumer insights directly within Microsoft's advertising ecosystem. Epsilon, acquired by Publicis Groupe on July 2, 2019, for $3.95 billion after tax step-up, operates as the holding company's core data technology platform with identity resolution capabilities spanning billions of consumer records.

According to the announcement by Russ Lynn, Agency Director North America at Microsoft Advertising, and Edgar Rodriguez, SVP Partner Management at Epsilon, the collaboration delivers ""a new, first-of-its-kind approach to audience solutions that outperform traditional targeting models."" The system leverages Epsilon's consumer data to identify high-value audiences across Microsoft's advertising inventory with what the companies describe as unprecedented accuracy and scale.

Early testing demonstrates substantial performance improvements over conventional targeting approaches. A pilot campaign in the travel vertical achieved two times higher return on ad spend compared to traditional in-market audiences. The same campaign identified 42 percent net-new targetable audience, converting travelers not previously reached through other first-party audience segments.

Technical infrastructure and data integration

The Third-Party Search framework operates by integrating Epsilon's proprietary identity data with Microsoft Advertising Platform's targeting capabilities. Epsilon maintains comprehensive consumer profiles derived from multiple data sources including purchase history, demographic information, lifestyle indicators, and behavioral signals across digital and offline channels.

Microsoft's advertising ecosystem encompasses search inventory on Bing, native advertising placements across MSN and Microsoft Start, and display inventory distributed through Microsoft Audience Network. The platform serves advertisements across desktop, mobile, and connected television environments, reaching what Microsoft characterizes as hundreds of millions of monthly active users.

Epsilon's data infrastructure relies on COREid, the company's proprietary identity resolution technology that links consumer records across devices, browsers, and platforms. This system creates persistent identifiers that enable advertisers to recognize and target specific consumer segments even as individuals move between environments and devices.

The integration maintains privacy compliance through what the companies describe as secure data handling protocols. Epsilon's identity graph operates under privacy frameworks including CCPA, GDPR, and industry self-regulatory guidelines, according to the company's technical documentation. The system applies data governance controls that restrict access to individual-level information while enabling aggregate audience targeting.

Travel pilot campaign results and methodology

The travel vertical pilot campaign provides concrete performance metrics demonstrating the integration's capabilities. The test compared campaigns using Epsilon-powered targeting against traditional in-market audience segments, which typically rely on behavioral signals like search query patterns, website visits, and content consumption related to travel categories.

The 42 percent net-new audience metric indicates Epsilon's data identified travelers that Microsoft's standard audience signals had not flagged as high-intent prospects. This expansion suggests Epsilon's offline purchase data, loyalty program information, and cross-channel behavioral tracking captures consumer segments that search behavior alone misses.

The two times higher ROAS improvement represents substantial efficiency gains. If a baseline campaign generated $2 in revenue for every $1 spent, the Epsilon-enhanced targeting would deliver $4 in revenue per advertising dollar. The announcement attributed these results to ""significant efficiency gains and bookings,"" though specific booking volume data was not disclosed.

Travel advertising represents a particularly valuable test case for precision targeting capabilities. The vertical involves high consideration purchases with long planning cycles, multiple research touchpoints, and significant price sensitivity. Travelers frequently research destinations, compare pricing across multiple dates and routes, and consume substantial content before converting. Epsilon's data potentially identifies consumers based on historical travel patterns, credit card spending in travel categories, and loyalty program participation that search queries alone would not surface.

Industry context and competitive positioning

The Microsoft-Epsilon integration arrives as search advertising faces attribution challenges from AI-powered answer engines. Google's implementation of AI Overviews and Gemini-powered search features has created traffic concerns for publishers and advertisers, with some reports indicating substantial declines in click-through rates from search results pages to destination websites.

Microsoft has positioned Bing as an AI-native search experience since integrating ChatGPT-powered features in February 2023. The company's approach emphasizes conversational search interactions and direct answers within the search interface, potentially reducing traditional advertising inventory visibility. Third-party data integration may help compensate for reduced search signal quality as AI features alter user behavior patterns.

Epsilon has expanded partnerships across major advertising platforms, including integrations with Pinterest, Amazon DSP, and programmatic exchanges. The company's March 16, 2024, partnership with Proximic by Comscore added contextual data capabilities, enabling advertisers to combine identity-based targeting with content adjacency controls.

Publicis Groupe has invested heavily in identity resolution capabilities following the Epsilon acquisition. The company announced plans to acquire Lotame in March 2025, combining Epsilon's 250 million consumer profiles with Lotame's 2.3 billion global identifiers. These acquisitions position Publicis Media Exchange as a significant data intermediary capable of activating proprietary identity assets across multiple advertising platforms.

Clean room technology has emerged as critical infrastructure for secure data collaboration in advertising. Epsilon operates clean room environments that enable advertisers to combine first-party data with Epsilon's proprietary datasets without exposing individual customer records. The Microsoft integration likely operates through similar privacy-preserving architecture, though technical implementation details were not disclosed in the announcement.

Publicis Media Exchange activation strategy

Publicis Media Exchange serves as the strategic activation layer connecting Epsilon's data capabilities with Microsoft's advertising inventory. PMX operates as Publicis Media's programmatic trading desk and audience management platform, executing campaigns across display, video, native, audio, and connected television channels for holding company agencies including Zenith, Starcom, Spark Foundry, and Blue 449.

The collaboration positions PMX clients with exclusive early access to Epsilon-powered Microsoft audiences. This arrangement creates competitive differentiation for Publicis Media agencies in new business pitches and client retention, particularly for categories where precision targeting drives substantial performance improvements.

PMX has established direct integrations with major advertising platforms including Google Display & Video 360, Amazon DSP, The Trade Desk, and Yahoo DSP. The Microsoft-Epsilon partnership extends this portfolio with identity-enriched search targeting capabilities that competitors cannot replicate without similar first-party data partnerships.

The travel pilot campaign methodology suggests PMX played an active role in audience strategy and campaign execution rather than simply providing media buying services. The 42 percent net-new audience finding indicates PMX worked with the client to map existing audience segments, identify coverage gaps, and test Epsilon data's incremental reach. This consultative approach positions PMX as a strategic partner rather than a commodity media buyer.

Data partnership economics and market dynamics

Third-party data partnerships typically involve cost-per-thousand-impression fees charged when advertisers activate external audience segments. Industry standard third-party data CPMs range from $0.75 to $2.50 depending on data provider, audience segment specificity, and vertical category, according to Microsoft Advertising's published rate cards.

Premium identity-based segments command higher CPMs than behavioral or contextual targeting alternatives. Epsilon's proprietary consumer data, derived from credit card transactions, loyalty programs, and direct customer relationships, represents higher-value inventory than inferred behavioral signals. The travel pilot's two times ROAS improvement would justify substantial data costs if those fees remained below 50 percent of the efficiency gains.

Microsoft benefits from the partnership through increased advertiser spending on its platform and potential user data enhancement. Search query logs, click behavior, and conversion patterns from Epsilon-targeted campaigns provide training data for Microsoft's own audience modeling systems. Over time, these signals could improve Microsoft's native audience products even for advertisers not purchasing Epsilon data.

Publicis Media Exchange captures value through improved campaign performance that strengthens client relationships and potentially justifies higher agency fees or performance bonuses. The holding company's ownership of Epsilon creates structural incentive to drive data adoption across Publicis Media clients, with increased Epsilon revenue flowing to the parent company regardless of which agency entity executes campaigns.

The competitive dynamics disadvantage independent agencies and advertisers working outside Publicis Media. While Epsilon theoretically makes data available through multiple distribution channels, the Microsoft integration announcement emphasizes PMX's strategic role and does not specify whether non-Publicis advertisers can access Epsilon audiences on Microsoft Advertising Platform through other agency partners or direct relationships.

Audience targeting evolution and privacy considerations

The Third-Party Search collaboration represents broader industry movement toward identity-based targeting as traditional signal sources degrade. Browser restrictions on third-party cookies, Apple's App Tracking Transparency framework, and privacy regulations have reduced advertisers' ability to track users across websites and applications without explicit consent.

Search advertising historically relied on query-based targeting and website visitation signals captured through platform pixels. A user searching for ""Hawaii vacation packages"" demonstrates clear commercial intent without requiring cross-site tracking. However, query volume represents only a fraction of potential customers. Many consumers research travel through social media, read review sites, and consume video content without generating search queries that advertisers can target.

Epsilon's data enables Microsoft to reach these consumers based on offline indicators like credit card spending at airlines, hotel loyalty program enrollment, or previous travel booking patterns captured through Epsilon's retail and financial services partnerships. This approach extends search advertising's addressable market beyond users actively generating platform signals.

Privacy advocates have questioned whether such data practices genuinely protect consumer interests. The Federal Trade Commission warned on November 13, 2024, that data clean rooms present ""complicated privacy implications"" despite marketing claims emphasizing privacy protection. The FTC noted that clean rooms enable data sharing between companies that consumers might not expect, even when individual-level records remain encrypted.

Epsilon's data collection practices rely on consumer relationships with brands, retailers, and financial institutions that may not have explicitly disclosed advertising uses. Credit card issuers typically include data sharing provisions in terms of service agreements, but consumers rarely understand how transaction histories inform advertising targeting. The degree to which Epsilon's data practices align with consumer privacy expectations remains subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny.

Implementation and availability

The announcement did not specify commercial availability timelines for Microsoft Advertising clients beyond Publicis Media Exchange. Microsoft Advertising typically deploys new features through phased rollouts, beginning with beta testing among select advertisers before general availability.

Advertisers seeking to activate Epsilon data on Microsoft Advertising Platform would need to establish commercial relationships with both Microsoft and Epsilon, negotiate data licensing terms, and complete technical integration requirements. For Publicis Media clients, PMX handles these operational complexities as part of standard media buying services.

Microsoft Advertising Platform provides self-service and managed service options for campaign execution. Self-service advertisers access the platform through Microsoft Advertising web interface, where they can create campaigns, select targeting parameters, set bids, and monitor performance. Managed service clients work with Microsoft account teams who provide strategic guidance and hands-on campaign optimization.

The travel pilot campaign's success metrics will influence adoption patterns across other vertical categories. Travel advertising's strong results may not translate directly to retail, automotive, financial services, or other sectors with different customer journey patterns and conversion behaviors. Advertisers in these categories would need to conduct their own testing to validate Epsilon data's effectiveness for their specific use cases.

Microsoft has historically positioned itself as a privacy-forward alternative to Google's advertising ecosystem, emphasizing user control and data transparency. The Epsilon partnership introduces third-party data elements that complicate this positioning, potentially creating tension with Microsoft's stated privacy commitments. How Microsoft communicates data usage policies to consumers and advertisers will influence perception of the partnership's privacy implications.

Implications for search advertising ecosystem

The Microsoft-Epsilon integration demonstrates how platform-data provider partnerships reshape competitive dynamics in search advertising. Google maintains proprietary user data from Chrome browser usage, Android device data, Google Maps location tracking, YouTube viewing behavior, and Gmail engagement signals. This integrated data ecosystem enables sophisticated audience targeting that Microsoft historically could not match using Bing search signals alone.

By partnering with Epsilon, Microsoft gains access to consumer identity data that partially compensates for its smaller user base and limited first-party data assets. However, the partnership structure creates dependencies that Google avoids through vertical integration. Microsoft must share revenue with Epsilon and relies on a third party for critical targeting capabilities rather than controlling the entire data infrastructure.

Google has faced regulatory pressure to limit data integration across its properties, particularly in Europe where competition authorities have questioned whether combining user data from multiple services creates unfair competitive advantages. Microsoft's partnership model might face less regulatory scrutiny because data combination occurs through commercial agreements rather than single-company data aggregation.

The search advertising market has experienced substantial consolidation in recent years, with Google controlling approximately 90 percent of global search advertising revenue. Microsoft's Bing accounts for roughly 3 percent market share in the United States, limiting its ability to invest in data infrastructure at Google's scale. Strategic partnerships with data providers like Epsilon represent a viable alternative strategy that leverages external assets rather than attempting to build competitive capabilities organically.

Advertiser response to the Third-Party Search collaboration will depend on whether Epsilon-enhanced targeting delivers consistent performance improvements across diverse campaign types and whether data costs remain justified by efficiency gains. The travel pilot's strong results provide encouraging initial evidence, but sustained adoption requires proof that benefits extend beyond single-vertical testing environments.

For defense investors, it's not so much the ending of a calendar year that's important, but the ending of a fiscal quarter. Because every time a quarter ends, there's a mad dash at the Pentagon to shovel out a last few spadefuls of cash, in the form of big-ticket defense contracts. It's a race against the clock (or the calendar) to ensure every last cent of funds already approved by Congress goes to the programs that need funding.

And for giant defense contractors like Boeing (BA +3.15%), it's a chance to cash in.

$12.8 billion for Boeing -- or with luck, $17.5 billion

And boy, oh boy, did Boeing ever cash in last month. On Dec. 29, Boeing won each of the two biggest Pentagon contracts awarded. For $4.2 billion, Boeing was tasked with providing ""E-4B contractor logistic service"" to the U.S. Air Force in fiscal 2026 (which ends Sept. 30, 2026).

Then, for $8.6 billion, Boeing won an order to build and deliver at least 25 new F-15IA aircraft to the Israeli Air Force, with an option for 25 more. Seeing as $8.6 billion would imply an MSRP of $343 million per plane (which is quite a high price for a fourth-generation fighter jet), it's likely Boeing will only receive the full $8.6 billion if Israel exercises its option and buys all 50 F-15s. But even if it doesn't, even if Israel only takes the initial 25, that's still a $4.3 billion contract for Boeing, minimum -- and $8.5 billion total from the two contracts.

Not bad for a day's work.

(Just two days later, by the way, Boeing would win another $2.7 billion for ""post-production support"" on AH-64 Apache helicopters for the U.S. Army. Add in another $2 billion for a Dec. 23 contract for B-52 commercial engine replacement, and Boeing may have cleared as much as $17.5 billion in new revenue in just over a week.)

What does it mean for investors?

All four of these contracts, by the way, fall under the aegis of Boeing's Defense, Space, and Security (BDS) business. Combined, they add up to about 73% of all the revenue that business segment generated in all of 2024.

Why is this significant? Well, consider that while BDS has had its issues, notably with the Starliner spacecraft that it produces, which still isn't cleared for use in human spaceflight, BDS is at least profitable today.

It's not very profitable, earning less than a 2% operating profit margin through the three quarters of 2025 that have already been reported. Still, just being profitable at all is more than Boeing can say about its marquee commercial aircraft division, which continues to lose money at a rate of nearly $8.6 billion per year.

What else does this mean for investors?

Another fact worth highlighting for investors may be less immediately obvious. Re-read my description of those four contracts described above. What do you notice?

One thing you might notice is that only one of the four contracts (the F-15 sale) is actually a contract for Boeing to produce and sell aircraft. The other three are for (1) running logistics for E-4B airborne command centers, (2) support of Apache helicopters, and (3) replacing engines on B-52 bombers.

All three of these activities relate to services the aerospace company provides to its aircraft after they're sold. Money Boeing gets without having to win a hard-fought competition to make a sale to a customer. Money Boeing will get almost by default, by virtue of being the company that built the aircraft in the first place.

If you suspect revenue won in this manner might be just a wee bit more profitable for Boeing than the margins it makes when having to win a bidding war, well, you'd be right. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Boeing booked $15.7 billion in parts, maintenance, modifications, and logistics services under its global services business. This is the smallest of Boeing's business divisions -- but by far the most profitable, earning an operating margin of 18.6%.

All of which is to say: When researching Boeing, and deciding whether you might want to buy Boeing stock, don't necessarily ignore the big, headline-grabbing contract wins that Boeing announces. But do keep in mind:

Boeing doesn't make its money when it wins a contract. Boeing makes its money in the years after winning the contract. And that makes Boeing Global Services by far the most important business segment at Boeing.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F849439%2Ff-15e-fighter-jet-in-flight.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-10 17:00:22.917883

Then I almost bumped into a four-legged doglike robot behind me.

They’re just a couple of the many robots I encountered this week designed for a range of purposes, from playing chess to performing spinal surgery. These are common occurrences on the Las Vegas Convention Center’s show floor during CES, which wrapped on Friday. Every January, companies from around the world gather to flaunt new technologies, products and services.

The show is just as much spectacle as it is substance; many of the most eye-catching wares either haven’t come to fruition (like flying cars) or are wildly expensive and impractical (think TVs that cost tens of thousands of dollars). But CES provides a glimpse into the bets being made by industry giants like Nvidia, Intel, Amazon and Samsung.

AI once again dominated the conference. Companies showed off everything from humanoid robots they claim will staff factories to refrigerators you can open with your voice to the next-generation chips that will power it all. CES, in some ways, turned the Strip into a bubble of its own, shielded from AI skepticism.

CNN asked a handful of tech executives at CES about an AI bubble and how it might impact their businesses. Some said their businesses aren’t relevant to the bubble concerns, while others expressed optimism about AI’s potential and said they are focused on building products that show it.

“We’re in the earliest stage of what’s possible. So when I hear we’re in a bubble, I’m like… This isn’t a fad,” said Panos Panay, Amazon’s devices and services chief. “It’s not going to pass.”

Growing concerns of an AI bubble

Tech companies poured more than $61 billion into data center investments in 2025, according to S&P Global, fueling concerns that investments may be far outpacing demand.

And investments are only expected to grow, with Goldman Sachs reporting that AI companies are estimated to invest more than $500 billion in capital expenditures this year. Julien Garran, researcher and partner for research firm MacroStrategy Partnership, said in a report last year that the AI bubble is 17 times bigger than the dot com bubble.

Most of the concerns around an AI bubble have centered on investments in data centers built for AI tasks that are too power-hungry for devices like laptops and smartphones to handle alone. Nvidia, the poster child of the AI boom and the company at the center of the bubble debate, announced at CES that the next version of its computing platform that powers those data centers is arriving in the second half of this year.

When asked about the AI bubble, executives from chipmakers Intel and Qualcomm pointed to their respective companies’ efforts to improve how computers process AI tasks locally rather than in the cloud.

Qualcomm, which makes chips for smartphones and other products, announced last year that it’s expanding into data centers. But that represents a very small part of its business.

“As far as we’re concerned, where we operate is not where the bubble conversation exists,” Akash Palkhiwala, Qualcomm’s chief financial officer and chief operating officer, told CNN.

Intel is focused on products that are important to its consumers, like chips that boost laptop performance, rather than making a big bet “that takes a lot of investment that may or may not make it,” said its client computing group head, Jim Johnson.

CK Kim, executive vice president and head of Samsung’s digital appliances business, said in an interview through an interpreter that it’s not for him to say whether the industry is in an AI bubble. He added that the company is more focused on whether AI is bringing value to consumers.

AI and the hunt for the next big thing

What that “value” looks like is exactly what the thousands of exhibitors at CES tried to demonstrate this week. Humanoid robots were a big part of that equation for companies like Nvidia, Intel, Hyundai and Qualcomm, all of which announced new tech to power human-shaped robots.

Boston Dynamics and Hyundai debuted Atlas, a humanoid robot developed in partnership with Google’s DeepMind AI division designed for industrial work like order fulfillment. It’ll be deployed to Google DeepMind and Hyundai’s Robotics Metaplant Applications center in the coming months, and additional customers will adopt it in early 2027.

“With one investment, we can explore any application in the world, from industrial use cases to retail use cases to home use cases,” Aya Durbin, who leads Boston Dynamics’ humanoid application product strategy, said in an interview at Hyundai’s booth when asked what’s driving the interest in humanoid robots. (Hyundai owns a controlling stake in Boston Dynamics.)

Tech companies have also been chasing the next big product following the smartphone and think AI could be key to finding it. At CES, a wave of companies introduced discrete listening devices that can record conversations or voice notes. These products included AI jewelry from a startup called Nirva, the Index 01 ring from smartwatch maker Pebble and the now Amazon-owned wristband from Bee.

Speaking to gadgets is often faster than typing, but Amazon and Nirva also see their devices as another means to gather data that can provide insights about a user’s life, though doing so will surely raise privacy concerns.

Business leaders seem to agree that AI is here to stay — even for those like Pete Erickson, CEO of tech events and education company Modev, who said the industry is indeed in a bubble.

But Erickson also believes AI is “just a part of our lives” now.

“I don’t think it’s going anywhere,” he said.

Lilly rode explosive GLP-1 drug demand to 53.9% revenue growth. Johnson & Johnson leaned on diversification across medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer health to post 6.8% growth.

GLP-1 Momentum Versus Diversified Stability

Lilly’s quarter centered on its diabetes and obesity franchise. Revenue hit $17.6 billion, driven by Mounjaro and Zepbound demand that management described as supply-constrained rather than demand-constrained. Net income of $5.6 billion jumped 480% year over year, as operating margin expanded to 48.3%. Gross margin reached 82.9%, reflecting the pricing power and manufacturing efficiency of blockbuster biologics.

Johnson & Johnson’s $24.0 billion in revenue came from a broader base. Medical device sales benefited from elective procedure volume recovery. Pharmaceutical revenue grew on newer immunology and oncology drugs, though legacy products faced biosimilar pressure. The 69.6% gross margin and 30.2% operating margin reflect a more complex cost structure spanning manufacturing, distribution, and regulatory compliance across multiple product categories. Net income of $5.2 billion rose 91% year over year, driven partly by one-time gains visible in its Q1 2025 blowout of $4.54 EPS against $2.26 expected.

Metric Lilly Johnson & Johnson Revenue Growth 53.9% YoY 6.8% YoY Operating Margin 48.3% 30.2% Net Income Growth 480% YoY 91% YoY R&D Spending $4.1B $3.7B

One Franchise Versus Portfolio Breadth

Lilly’s strategy concentrates risk and reward in a single therapeutic area. GLP-1 drugs now define the company’s valuation and growth trajectory. Management invested $4.1 billion in R&D during the quarter, much directed toward expanding manufacturing capacity and developing next-generation obesity treatments. The forward P/E of 33.78 reflects confidence that demand will sustain through patent cliffs and competitive entries.

Johnson & Johnson spreads exposure across devices, pharmaceuticals, and international markets. The company spent $3.7 billion on R&D allocated across oncology, immunology, cardiovascular devices, and surgical robotics. This diversification limits upside but cushions against single-product risk. The forward P/E of 18.05 and 2.45% dividend yield position J&J as a defensive holding rather than a growth bet.

Oral Competition and Manufacturing Scale

The next inflection point for Lilly involves oral GLP-1 competition. Novo Nordisk’s oral Wegovy approval in December 2025 triggered sustained Reddit discussion, with one thread generating 168 upvotes and comments noting the shift from injections to pills could reshape patient preferences. Lilly must prove its injectable franchise can hold share as oral alternatives scale.

Johnson & Johnson faces different tests. Device segment growth depends on hospital capital spending, which remains uneven. Pharmaceutical revenue needs newer drugs to offset biosimilar erosion on older biologics.

Why I Lean Toward Lilly Despite the Premium

I would choose Lilly for exposure to a transformational drug category that still has room to run. The 480% earnings growth and 48.3% operating margin suggest the GLP-1 franchise is hitting scale efficiently. The P/E of 53.22 looks steep, but the PEG ratio of 1.01 indicates growth justifies the multiple. Oral competition is real, but Lilly’s manufacturing lead and pipeline depth give it time to adapt.

Johnson & Johnson fits a different investor. If you prioritize income and stability over growth, the 2.45% yield and diversified revenue base make sense. The stock gained 44.84% over the past year, but long-term returns lag dramatically. Lilly delivered 587.71% over five years versus J&J’s 51.34%.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/imageForEntry31-0VG.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 12:03:12.569381

The EliteBoard G1a measures just 17 millimetres in thickness and weighs 630 grammes (1.4 pounds, making it roughly half the weight of a conventional laptop. Designed for mobility, the device supports external 4K monitor connectivity and offers a battery life of up to 3.5 hours per charge.

According to HP, the concept for the all-in-one keyboard was born from observing hybrid work trends. Designers noticed that many users connect their laptops to external monitors only to close the laptop lid immediately. This led to the question: ""If an external monitor is already being used, why not put the computer inside the keyboard?""

The hardware distinguishes itself from standard mini personal computers (PCs) through its high level of customisability. Users can remove the back cover to swap or upgrade components, including DDR5 SODIMM RAM, M.2 NVMe SSDs, batteries, speakers and fans. The keyboard panel itself is also spill-resistant and replaceable.

The American tech company will offer the device in two configurations. One features a fixed USB-C cable but includes an additional USB4 port and a bundled wireless mouse. The second variant offers a detachable USB-C cable for greater flexibility.

To appeal to professional typists, the EliteBoard G1a features tuned key travel to replicate a desktop experience and includes a full numpad. This positioning aims to provide a desktop-grade feel in a highly portable format for off-site work.

However, the device's ultra-slim profile presents certain practical challenges. Despite its portability, the lack of a built-in display means users must still carry a portable monitor. Furthermore, the limited 3.5-hour battery life and the presence of only two USB-C ports may necessitate the use of additional docks or power banks.

Similar issues have been observed with handheld gaming PCs used for productivity, where the peripheral count often negates the initial weight savings of the core device.

The HP EliteBoard G1a Next Gen AI PC is expected to be available on HP.com in March. Final pricing will be disclosed by the manufacturer closer to the launch date.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20260110/c2_3172748.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 16:01:14.047605
