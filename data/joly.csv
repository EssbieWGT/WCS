The company, a health technology firm, is focused on improving health outcomes across the health continuum. Philips is a leader in diagnostic imaging, image-guided therapy, patient monitoring, and health informatics, as well as consumer health and home care.

Dive Brief:

Kroger will fuel modernization with AI as it deploys use cases to operate more efficiently, improve customer experience and boost sales, executives said during the grocer’s Q2 2025 earnings call Thursday.

“Accelerating our AI efforts is a natural step for Kroger, given our long history of leadership in data and machine learning,” Chairman and interim CEO Ron Sargent said Thursday. “Where we’ve implemented AI in different parts of the organization, we’re seeing results with more competitive pricing, shrink improvements and faster fulfillment.”

Cost optimization and operational efficiencies are top priorities for the grocer as it looks to move forward from its failed merger with Albertsons. Same-store sales excluding fuel rose 3.4%during the second quarter, the sixth consecutive quarter of increase for this metric. The company also raised its identical sales growth forecast for the 2025 fiscal year.

Dive Insight:

Grocers, like other retailers, have increased their appetite for emerging technologies as leaders look to alleviate the effects of economic headwinds and add a competitive edge.

In April, Albertsons executives said the company was strengthening its data capabilities in pursuit of AI adoption. Walmart and Instacart have also worked to scale AI capabilities.

Kroger credits its “couple decades worth” of loyalty program data, a “deep bench of data science capability” and its 84.51° division for laying the foundation for its AI efforts, EVP and CFO David Kennerley said during the call Thursday.

Despite the focus on modernization, Kroger has reduced staff in related departments. In August, workers in Kroger’s Technology and Digital division were impacted. The company also laid off employees in 84.51°, the grocer’s retail analytics subsidiary, in March. The reduction in staff was an effort to “focus on the key priorities that power our go-to-market strategy,” a spokesperson told Grocery Dive.

Looking forward, Kroger plans to examine “all aspects” of its business to drive efficiencies, including a site-by-site analysis of its automated fulfillment network, Sargent said during the latest earnings call.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/DPPUFEmJwyzXrW2tAT8kv6PfEIptANymLaTNFlzmgCo/g:nowe:0:0/c:2027:1145/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUdfMzQ0My5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-09-12 16:09:19.858098

Zacks Investment Research","Colgate-Palmolive Company’s CL newly announced productivity program reflects its commitment to building a “future-fit” organization as part of its 2030 strategic plan. Even amid a challenging operating environment characterized by high raw material and packaging costs, tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainty, Colgate has continued to deliver solid growth in net sales, organic sales and earnings per share. The program targets $300–$400 million in incremental savings by 2025, designed to complement ongoing revenue growth management (RGM) and funding-the-growth initiatives, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently while maintaining focus on long-term brand and category development.

The core strategy of the productivity program revolves around cost-saving and efficiency initiatives that strengthen Colgate’s operational foundation. These include optimizing the global supply chain for greater agility and resilience, leveraging AI and data analytics to enhance portfolio and promotional decisions, and prioritizing investments in high-return areas. By streamlining processes, improving pricing and mix strategies, and reducing overhead, Colgate aims to generate incremental savings that can either be reinvested in innovation and brand-building or applied directly to the bottom line. The program also emphasizes strategic use of price pack architecture, such as multipacks and smaller sizes, to meet evolving consumer needs while enhancing profitability.

Colgate’s productivity initiative is expected to drive long-term growth and efficiency by enabling it to navigate volatile markets while sustaining organic sales momentum. By combining cost discipline with strategic investment in core innovation, AI-driven RGM and digital capabilities, Colgate can enhance household penetration, maintain brand health and support consistent compounded earnings per share growth. If executed effectively, this program positions Colgate not only to weather near-term challenges but also to strengthen its competitive advantage and long-term profitability.

GIS is likely to register a decline in its top and bottom lines when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Sept. 17.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has remained unchanged in the past 30 days at 81 cents per share, indicating a decrease of 24.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. GIS has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.5%, on average.

The consensus estimate for General Mills’ quarterly revenues is pegged at $4.50 billion, which indicates a 7.1% decrease from the year-ago quarter.

Things to Know About GIS’ Q1 Earnings

General Mills operates in a highly competitive and price-sensitive food industry, where grocery inflation is weighing heavily on consumer spending. Reduced discretionary food spending by budget-conscious consumers remains a major obstacle to volume recovery. The company is also grappling with macroeconomic and operational headwinds across international markets, especially in China, where consumer demand remains subdued.

Additionally, sluggish trends in the U.S. snacking categories and softer demand in the away-from-home foodservice channel have further added to the company’s challenges. Persistence of such trends remains a concern for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. We expect price/mix to drop 1.8% and volume to decline 1.2% in the fiscal first quarter.

However, General Mills is leveraging brand strength, innovation, cost savings and portfolio reshaping to enhance market share. The company has unveiled a multi-year global transformation initiative, part of its Accelerate strategy, to fuel growth. While General Mills has implemented cost-saving initiatives under its Holistic Margin Management strategy, persistent inflationary pressures continue to impact its performance. These broad-based cost challenges, combined with weakening consumer demand and tariff woes, underscore the tough landscape facing General Mills in the near term.

Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE: BDX) is a heavyweight in the global medical technology game. The business is split into three key segments: BD Medical (think syringes, needles, and devices that keep hospitals humming), BD Life Sciences (diagnostics and biosciences kits), and BD Interventional (surgical and critical care gadgets). BD gets its products into the hands of hospitals, clinical labs, pharma companies, and more, using a mix of direct sales teams in big markets and distributors everywhere else. Revenue comes from items you buy often (like disposable needles), big-ticket machines (such as infusion pumps and diagnostic analyzers), and extra services (analytics, consulting). The medtech and diagnostics space is built on steady demand from aging populations, rising chronic illness, and constant innovation. BD’s main rivals include Medtronic, Abbott, Baxter, Boston Scientific, Cardinal Health, Stryker, and Edwards Lifesciences. Thanks to its diverse lineup and global reach, BD has a solid competitive moat—recurring sales, close ties with customers, and enough scale to hold onto pricing power in a lot of product lines.

From September 2024 to September 11, 2025, BD's shares fell by 17.89%, while the S&P 500 rose 14.92%. This slump mainly comes down to shrinking valuation multiples and worries about near-term growth, especially in BD’s Life Sciences unit (with rumors of a possible divestiture swirling around). Tech stocks and growth names have been in vogue, widening the gap even further.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

BD’s revenue isn’t exactly sprinting—it’s grown a modest 4.8% over the past year, lagging behind the broader market’s 8.7%. The Medical segment is the bright spot, riding a rebound in elective procedures, with third quarter sales up 5.1% year-over-year. BD’s poised to boost its intensive care unit presence with the $900 million-a-year Critical Care business from Edwards Lifesciences (deal expected to close by end-2024). Meanwhile, BD’s looking to offload its $21 billion biosciences and diagnostics business—a move that could free up capital for faster-growing areas, with a deal targeted for late 2025.

Quality & Moat

BD’s operating margin stands at 11.3%—a bit higher than its five-year average (10.5%) but trailing the market’s 18.2%. Returns are modest: return on invested capital (ROIC) is 4.8%, just above BD’s past five-year average but well below the market’s 11.1%. The consumables franchise keeps recurring cash flowing, but free cash flow yield has dipped to –4.1% (historic average is +1.4%), mainly due to inventory build-up and working capital needs. CEO Tom Polen has kept a tight rein, returning around $1.1 billion through dividends and $0.5 billion via buybacks in 2024, while still investing in research and strategic deals.

Valuation

BD trades at a forward P/E of 31.1×—a premium over the market’s 26.0×—thanks to its defensive business model and reliable cash flow, though there’s not much room for near-term upside. The EV/Sales ratio is 3.2×, below both BD’s five-year average (4.1×) and the market’s (4.6×), hinting at some valuation cushion if growth picks up. The high earnings multiple is partly justified by BD’s low beta (0.55) and steady revenues, but negative free cash flow puts a question mark on margins and capital efficiency.

Market Sentiment

Analyst opinion is split: most stick to ‘Hold,’ with average price targets about 5% above the current share price. Short interest is tame at 2% of float, so there’s not much bearish betting. Big institutions own around 85% of the shares, and insider buying has been quiet. News about the potential Life Sciences divestiture has kept the stock in check, though if management executes cleanly, investors see the move as adding value.

Key Risks

High leverage and working capital strain: BDX’s net debt sits at 3.8× EBITDA—much higher than the market average of 1.4×. That eats into financial flexibility and ups the refinancing risk if interest rates stay high.

Moderate profitability metrics: ROIC of 4.8% and operating margins of about 11.3% don’t stack up well next to medtech peers (averaging around 18%), so free cash flow will probably stay muted until margins improve.

Execution risk on divestitures: Spinning off the Life Sciences business won’t be easy. Tax-friendly structures like a reverse Morris trust could complicate things, dragging out timelines and drawing management’s eye from the core business.

Competitive pressures and pricing: Fierce competition from heavyweights like Medtronic, Abbott, Thermo Fisher—and upstarts too—could put pressure on prices for BD’s bread-and-butter products.

Regulatory and litigation exposure: BD is in a tightly regulated industry. Product recalls, legal battles, or new healthcare rules could inflate costs and ding the company’s reputation.

Bull Case

Defensive, recurring revenue base: A big chunk of sales comes from consumables and disposables—which keeps cash coming in, even when the economy wobbles.

Strategic M&A and portfolio optimization: Adding Edwards’ Critical Care business should strengthen growth. Shedding slower-growing assets could unlock value and sharpen BD’s focus on its core medtech strengths.

Operational improvement initiatives: Management’s ‘grow, simplify, empower’ strategy is underway, aiming to fatten up margins by streamlining manufacturing and tightening up the supply chain.

Shareholder returns: BD keeps shareholders sweet with dividends and buybacks. If it pockets extra cash from asset sales, expect more buybacks.

Valuation support: With the EV/Sales ratio below its own history and the broader market average, there’s a potential cushion if growth stabilizes.

Bear Case

Valuation premium: A forward P/E of 31× is steep — even if EV/Sales looks cheap by comparison. Unless the multiple expands, there’s a ceiling on upside.

Negative free cash flow: Building up working capital and snapping up new businesses has pushed cash flow into the red, raising doubts about how sustainable BD’s cash generation really is.

Execution risks on divestitures: If spinning off the Life Sciences unit drags on or gets muddled, BD could stay stuck in the slow lane with too much complexity.

Margin pressure: Underwhelming profits from diagnostics and biosciences may need a restructuring—and that could mean spending cuts that crimp future growth.

High debt burden: At roughly 4× EBITDA, BD’s leverage magnifies risks from higher interest rates and ties its hands on new investments.

On Our Radar

Q4 FY 2025 earnings release: Expected in late November 2025. Investors will be keen to see how organic growth and margin guidance are shaping up during BD’s ongoing portfolio shakeup.

Life Sciences divestiture decision: Due by the end of 2025. How BD chooses to spin off, sell, or structure its Life Sciences business will play a huge role in shaping capital allocation and valuation.

Waters Corporation merger close: Watch for the sale of BD’s biosciences division to Waters for $17.5 billion—expected by the first quarter of 2026. Keep an eye on deal progress and how the proceeds get used.

FDA approvals for new devices: Clearances for new infusion pumps and diagnostics, expected late in 2025, could give BD some extra sales momentum.

Investment Conclusion

BDX stands out as a defensive medtech player, anchored by steady consumables revenue and a history of disciplined capital returns. But growth has cooled off, and the balance sheet carries a heavy load—negative free cash flow and profitability that trails the peer group. Long-term investors might see potential for value if management nails its next round of acquisitions in critical care and successfully sheds slower-growing assets. Near-term, though, there’s no escaping the risks tied to portfolio moves and premium price tags. Patient, risk-aware investors might want to wait for a clearer path—possibly accumulating shares on dips, once BD’s portfolio puzzle pieces have locked into place, balancing the company’s steady income stream against its debt and slimmer margins.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-09-12 12:26:18.613126

Takeaway:

(ECL) shows signs of technical neutrality with a wait-and-see stance, and recent price action has fallen by -4.03%. While bullish and bearish indicators are nearly balanced, investors are advised to monitor market changes closely.

News Highlights

Recent global and economic developments could influence Ecolab’s performance. Here are a few highlights:

U.S. vaccine policy changes are expected to impact public health and healthcare sectors. While not directly related to Ecolab, these shifts may influence overall market sentiment.

Trump’s fast-tracking of a Utah uranium mine signals a potential shift in energy policy and resource development, which may indirectly affect Ecolab’s industrial and environmental clients.

China’s factory activity contracted in May, but signs of recovery are emerging. A slowdown in global manufacturing could affect Ecolab’s international business operations.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Ecolab’s recent analyst ratings are mixed, with three institutions offering differing perspectives:

Simple average rating: 3.67 (indicating a cautiously bullish bias)

Performance-weighted rating: 3.26 (showing analysts with stronger historical performance have slightly more bearish expectations)

Rating consistency: Analysts are not aligned—two “Buy” ratings and one “Neutral” rating are currently active.

This mixed analyst sentiment contrasts with the recent 4.03% price decline, suggesting a misalignment between market expectations and current price movements.

Key fundamental values and scores:

Return on Assets (ROA): 2.23% (internal diagnostic score: 3.0)

Cash flow from operations (CFOA): 2.96% (score: 3.0)

Net income-to-revenue ratio: 31.89% (score: 2.0)

Current assets turnover ratio: 1.18x (score: 3.0)

Non-current liabilities / Total liabilities: 65.88% (score: 2.0)

Ecolab’s fundamentals are mixed, with stronger performance in operating cash flow and turnover, but moderate profitability and heavy long-term liabilities.

Money-Flow Trends

Ecolab has experienced negative fund-flow trends across all investor categories, with retail investors (small) contributing the least inflow at 48.57% and large and extra-large investors contributing 47.46% and 46.25% respectively. The overall inflow ratio stands at 46.91%, suggesting a cautious stance among big players. The negative trend in all categories reinforces the idea that investors are taking a wait-and-see approach, especially with mixed technical and fundamental signals.

Key Technical Signals

Technical analysis reveals a complex and neutral setup for Ecolab:

WR Oversold: Shows an internal diagnostic score of 3.94—a moderate strength signal with a 55.0% win rate and an average return of 0.38% over historical signals.

Bearish Engulfing: This pattern shows a stronger bullish bias with a 7.82 score—a 71.43% win rate and an average return of 1.17% when activated.

Looking at recent patterns, the Bearish Engulfing candlestick pattern was activated on 2025-09-05, alongside a recurring WR Oversold signal. These signals have appeared frequently in the past five days, indicating a volatile but indecisive market.

Key insight: Technical indicators are showing a balanced mix of long and short signals, with no clear trend emerging. Investors are advised to monitor developments closely and be ready for sudden swings.

Companies (EL) has embarked on a bold transformation under its newly appointed leadership team, with innovation at the core of its ""Beauty Reimagined"" strategy. This strategic pivot, introduced in February 2025, aims to restore sustainable sales growth and rebuild stakeholder confidence after years of declining performance. For investors, the question is whether this leadership evolution—marked by a focus on disruptive technologies, agile execution, and consumer-centric innovation—can translate into long-term shareholder value.

Leadership Realignment: A Foundation for Change

The appointment of Stéphane de La Faverie as CEO in January 2025 signaled a decisive shift in EL's corporate direction. De La Faverie, a veteran of LVMH and L'Oréal, brings a track record of scaling luxury beauty brands. His leadership has been paired with the hiring of René Lammers, Ph.D., as Executive Vice President and Chief Research & Innovation Officer, a role critical to advancing EL's innovation agendaRené Lammers Appointed Chief Research & Innovation Officer[ 3 ]. Lammers' expertise in science-based platforms and global R&D partnerships aligns with the company's goal of accelerating product development cycles and capturing emerging trendsRené Lammers Appointed Chief Research & Innovation Officer[ 3 ].

This leadership realignment has already yielded tangible results. For fiscal 2025, equity awards tied to performance metrics were earned at 70.1% of the target, reflecting progress toward strategic goals despite a challenging operating environment[PRE 14A] The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Preliminary Proxy Statement[ 2 ]. While this fell short of the initial 100% target, it underscores the performance-based nature of leadership incentives and the company's commitment to accountability.

Innovation-Driven Growth: From Lab to Market

EL's innovation strategy under ""Beauty Reimagined"" is not just about product launches—it's about redefining the beauty industry's relationship with consumers. In fiscal 2025, the company rolled out breakthrough products such as La Mer's Night Recovery Concentrate and the M·A·C Nudes Collection, both designed to address evolving consumer preferences for personalized, science-backed solutionsThe Estée Lauder Companies Reports Fiscal 2025 Results[ 1 ]. These initiatives are part of a broader effort to expand ""consumer coverage"" through digital platforms like TikTok Shop and Amazon's U.S. and Canadian Premium Beauty storesThe Estée Lauder Companies Reports Fiscal 2025 Results[ 1 ].

Strategic Risks and Rewards

The path to restoring growth is fraught with challenges. EL's fiscal 2025 results highlight the difficulty of competing in a saturated beauty market, where consumer spending remains fragmented across categories. Yet the company's focus on ""disruptive technologies"" and collaborations with academic institutionsRené Lammers Appointed Chief Research & Innovation Officer[ 3 ] suggests a willingness to invest in high-impact R&D. This approach mirrors successful models in tech and pharma, where breakthrough innovation drives decades of value.

A critical test will be the execution of ""Beauty Reimagined"" in fiscal 2026. The company has signaled optimism about returning to positive sales growth after three years of declinesThe Estée Lauder Companies Reports Fiscal 2025 Results[ 1 ], but this will require not only compelling products but also disciplined cost management.

The Bottom Line for Investors

For long-term investors, Estee Lauder's leadership evolution presents a compelling case study in balancing innovation with accountability. While fiscal 2025 results were lackluster, the company's strategic pivot—led by a seasoned CEO and a visionary R&D leader—positions it to capitalize on the $500 billion global beauty market's next wave of disruption.

However, this breakneck expansion is creating significant challenges, including a pervasive trust deficit, rising operational costs, and critical governance gaps that organizations are struggling to address.

“As organizations scale Agentic AI, they need to focus on priorities that deliver meaningful value with non-regrettable risk. This requires a unified enterprise framework that ensures consistent standards for ethics, access, orchestration, and observability,” said Craig Suckling, Chief AI Officer of Capgemini Europe.

Generative AI adoption reaches global scale

Generative AI has transitioned from experimental pilots to core business operations at a remarkable pace. Adoption has surged from a mere 6% of organizations in 2023 to 30% in 2025, representing a fivefold increase in just two years.

Currently, a significant percentage, which is 93% of companies, are actively investigating, experimenting with, or deploying GenAI capabilities in their operations. Industries such as telecommunications, consumer goods, and aerospace and defense are leaders in customer operations, marketing, and IT.

This is being driven by substantial and increasing investment, and most organizations report tangible benefits. Eighty-eight percent of organizations are spending more on GenAI, on average, 9% more investments in the last year, with 12% of the total IT budget allocated to the technology.

The returns are also evident, with 79% of organizations expressing satisfaction with their Gen AI results, citing increased innovation and productivity benefits.

Trust and governance gaps threaten AI scaling

Despite rapid adoption, a significant trust barrier prevents the full-scale deployment of autonomous AI systems.

Only 71% of organizations claim to be able to trust autonomous AI agents to be used in the enterprise to the full extent. It is due to security worries of 65%, the risk of privacy of 62%, and the threat of biased results of 51% that this skepticism is based on the deeper fear of relinquishing control without any verifiable assurances.

The lack of trust is complicated by a general inability to introduce efficient governance structures. Although almost half, which is 46% of organizations, have developed AI governance policies, nearly half of them, which is 47% are concerned that their employees rarely adhere to them.

Furthermore, governance is inconsistently applied across business functions in 47% of organizations, and dedicated oversight bodies, like a Chief AI Officer or an ethics committee, are found in only a minority of firms, leaving AI systems without adequate guardrails or accountability.

The company also raised the lower-end of its annual profit forecast to $4.70 from $4.60, while retaining the upper-end at $4.80.

Quarterly identical sales, without fuel, increased 3.4%, compared with analysts' estimates of 2.84%, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Kroger, which is in the middle of a legal battle with Albertsons ACI.N after their $25 billion deal collapsed, posted an adjusted profit of $1.04 per share for the quarter, topping estimates of 99 cents.",https://img.resized.co/esmmagazine/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLm1hZGlzb25wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMuZXVcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDIxXFxcLzEwXFxcLzEzMTA0NTE4XFxcL0tyb2dlcl9PY2Fkby5qcGVnXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjEyMDAsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjo2MjcsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltZy5yZXNpemVkLmNvXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiI3MWQ3ODMxZDg2Nzg3NDA4NWRiN2Q2MjMzZDk2ZThlZTVjN2RjOGUyIn0=/kroger-raises-annual-sales-forecast-as-grocery-demand-stays-strong.jpeg,N,,2025-09-11 18:07:19.402455

For the first time, it is expanding its franchise operations into Asia, in partnership with SPC Group, a South Korea-based food company. Through this accretive partnership, CMG plans to open the first Chipotle restaurants in South Korea and Singapore in 2026.

The collaboration is strategically important because it provides Chipotle with an existing supply chain, operational support and knowledge of the local market — all of which will help mitigate the execution risks that accompany global expansion. Besides, the growing brand awareness among consumers for the company — thanks to Korean band artists — has bolstered this strategic move.

This project lays the foundation for further growth throughout Asia, which could prove to be a significant long-term growth engine and revenue diversification opportunity for Chipotle.

Chipotle’s Footprint Expansion Initiatives

Chipotle continues to execute on its long-term growth strategy by delivering exceptional food and hospitality as well as minimizing its expenses. It remains committed to improving the guest experience, emphasizing value and strengthening brand relevance in a challenging consumer environment. Looking ahead, the company plans to further highlight its value proposition by introducing new menu innovations, expanding its loyalty program and rolling out targeted marketing campaigns.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, Chipotle advanced its expansion strategy by opening 61 new restaurants across the United States and Canada, including 47 Chipotlanes, and reaffirmed its target of 315 to 345 new openings for the year. The company is also deepening its international presence through strategic partnerships. In Mexico, Chipotle is collaborating with Alsea, a leading restaurant operator in Latin America and Europe, with the debut location expected to open in early 2026. In the Middle East, its partnership with Alshaya Group is set to accelerate development in the back half of 2025. Together, these initiatives provide a gateway into high-potential growth markets and strengthen Chipotle’s ability to extend its brand globally.

Shares of CMG have declined 22.7% in the past six months against the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry’s 12.7% rise. Also, weakening consumer confidence, tariff pressures and high expenses are a concern. Going forward, Chipotle intends to leverage digital programs to expand access and customer convenience.

So maybe it should not have been a surprise that just over two weeks after she wore a black-and-white striped Ralph Lauren sundress for her flower-festooned engagement shoot — one that sold out almost immediately — Ralph Lauren himself opened New York Fashion Week with a collection almost entirely black and white. And red.

After more than 50 years in business, he understands how to up the ante. And so he did, with volume and celebrities and some very, very wide-brimmed straw hats.

The show was held in the Lauren headquarters on Madison Avenue, in a room transformed for the day into a summery lounge with cushioned white couches, black wicker chandeliers and a curvy staircase at one end. The intimacy of the site only served to highlight the big picture view.

Nick Jonas sat with a hand on his wife Priyanka Chopra’s knee, each in matching shades of Ralph Lauren brown. Mindy Kaling, in a bronze suit, Naomi Watts, in a frilly shell, and Jessica Chastain, in black lace, whispered into one another’s ears and giggled. At the last minute, Oprah made her entrance with Gayle King. And all of them applauded the acres of material in Mr. Lauren’s generous trousers, sweeping skirts and halter tent gowns.

The palette may have been limited, but there was nothing constricting about the clothes — a relief at a time when the corset has been making a comeback, body-con is a trend and skinny trousers abound. There was even a very fancy pair of satiny white overalls, worn over a crystal-bedecked white tank, in case someone wanted to go straight from the garden to the gala.

Rather than looking blousey, or even bombastic, the effect was easy. Especially because all the swishiness at the bottom was balanced by bandeau tops, neatly tailored jackets and the occasional pair of shorts. Also, statement silver jewelry in organic shapes and some floppy bows.

These were pared-down pieces for someone who believes that harmony can be found in oppositions and is confident enough not to try too hard. That’s the essence of sportswear, which is itself part of the essence of American fashion, and Mr. Lauren understands it as well as anyone.

In any case, if Mr. Lauren was channeling a growth mind-set, it made sense. The only thing bigger than his pants and hats was his last few weeks, between Ms. Swift’s surprise announcement and the U.S. Open, where he celebrated 20 years as official outfitter and dressed a plethora of high-profile attendees.

Meantime, he introduced a new A.I. tool that can help customers style their Polo looks (the company had reportedly been working on it for a year, in conjunction with Microsoft), and on the day of his show news came that he was nominated for a Council of Fashion Designers of America award as women’s wear designer of the year. This after already winning in the category nine times.

As to whether he was also looking forward to creating Ms. Swift’s wedding dress, a spokeswoman smiled, shrugged and remained mum.

No matter.

Kroger Co. raised its full-year sales forecast, illustrating that the grocer is attracting value-seeking consumers who are opting to eat at home.

The company said it now expects comparable sales, excluding fuel, to gain as much as 3.4%, versus its previous guidance calling for a high of 3.25% increase.

Kroger’s shares rose as much as 4.4% in premarket trading.

Kroger ranks No. 31 on the Transport Topics Top 100 list of the largest private carriers in North America, and No. 3 on the TT grocery list.

Food retailers have posted steady sales in recent years, benefiting from shoppers prioritizing necessities even as they cut spending elsewhere. People are staying cautious overall, buying things on sale or purchasing cheaper items.

The grocery chain’s comparable sales and adjusted earnings beat expectations during the latest quarter, driven by higher sales of fresh food, e-commerce and pharmacy.

Kroger is seeking to establish a new chapter of growth after calling off a $24.6 billion deal with rival Albertsons Cos., a fight that’s now unfolding in court. Kroger’s former chief executive abruptly resigned earlier this year, replaced by industry veteran Ron Sargent until a permanent CEO is named.

Albertsons ranks No. 5 on the grocery carriers list.

Under Sargent, the Cincinnati company has been sharpening focus on the core retail business. It’s accelerating new store openings while closing underperforming ones. Improving e-commerce profitability is another priority, as Kroger works to reduce wait times and move online orders faster. Kroger said in August that it would lay off nearly 1,000 corporate employees to cut costs.

While Kroger has less exposure to tariffs than competitors selling clothes and other general merchandise, the retailer is diversifying sourcing and discontinuing some items in response. The grocer is also emphasizing value, offering promotions, lowering prices and expanding store brands that continue to grow faster than national names. Still, competition has been growing as Walmart Inc. offers more food discounts and Amazon.com Inc. plans to expand grocery delivery offerings.

Browne, an early beta tester of the new Digital Landscapes experience, was able to do.
Insights Designed to Drive Business Results Suppliers can view aggregate metrics on their full Walmart product slate or drill down to the single UPC level.
What’s not available are competitors’ metrics, for obvious reasons, but Lomelino said that with the new search insights, brands will be able to learn a lot about category-level behavior.
“They can allocate their digital spend more effectively, because they understand the digital journey much better with the insights that we provide,” said Lomelino.","There’s been talk for some time about the collapse of the traditional “funnel.” Consumers no longer move along a linear path from awareness to consideration to purchase, and they haven’t for years. Now, with the rise of AI-powered search and discovery, that path to purchase is becoming even more fragmented and variable. But regardless of how ecommerce evolves from here, core hubs of commerce activity and intel will remain — and one of those hubs is the app and website of the world’s largest retailer, Walmart.

Walmart’s digital platforms feature 20 million first-party items that are shopped by millions of consumers every week. That’s a lot of insight into what consumers are looking for and ultimately buying. For years now, Walmart has been working to coalesce that data and make it accessible to its suppliers through the Scintilla suite of insights tools, to help improve not only sales performance but also the customer experience.

“The customer journey is really not linear, and with that level of assortment and all the different entry points into our site and our app, we wanted to provide a product that delivers really robust insights around the digital shopping journey,” said Linda Lomelino, Group Director at Walmart Data Ventures in an interview with Retail TouchPoints. That way, “both suppliers and internal users alike can understand how customers are shopping our site and app, as well as [determining] what these pre-purchase behaviors are so that we can make the customer experience even better going forward.”

Now that data is getting an upgrade with a series of enhancements to Scintilla’s Digital Landscapes tool, including the addition of 15 new metrics and a revamped user experience.

“We see the priorities in the [Walmart] business, and we hear from our suppliers all day,” Lomelino said. “As a product person, you want to make sure that you’re delivering exactly the value that you hope to deliver, and a lot of that [right now] is driven by an increased importance of the PDP [product detail page], but also making sure that we can cater to things like viral moments. And the piece that is really critical is being able to see the metric and then pivot strategy quickly.”

That’s exactly what skin and haircare brand E.T. Browne, an early beta tester of the new Digital Landscapes experience, was able to do. The company noticed a massive surge in transactions for its Palmer’s Cocoa Butter Firming Formula lotion, and using insights from Walmart shopping sessions was able to track the upswing back to a viral moment on TikTok.

“Once they understood what was actually happening, they capitalized on that moment and adjusted their forecasting and replenishment strategy to accommodate the increased traffic coming to that product,” said Lomelino. “They took what could have been a pretty large supply chain challenge and used it to really drive sustained growth going forward.”

What’s New in Digital Landscapes

The Digital Landscapes product launched last June and has been available to Charter members of Scintilla — who pay a subscription fee for enhanced data access and tools — for over a year now. E.T. Browne isn’t alone in finding the enhanced tool useful, with Lomelino saying that the response from beta testers has been “overwhelmingly positive.” Now the experience is live for all Charter members.

Enhancements include a complete redesign of the user experience aimed at making the insights “super consumable,” so that both data experts and non-experts can “visualize the insights in a more effective way and understand what a metric means and how it drives the business,” said Lomelino. “You’ll see things like a Sankey chart [a type of flow diagram] that really beautifully describes how traffic is both coming in and exiting our site and our app, to help [suppliers] understand if there are improvements they can make to drive traffic to their product page or drive conversion.”

The update also includes the addition of 15 incremental metrics, including:

Enhanced traffic insights to show where customers started their journey, whether it be from a social media platform, a search engine, coming directly to the Walmart site or app or any other online channel;

Enhanced conversion insights to visualize how many visitors are actually converting;

The new Digital Basket metric, which shows what customers are adding to their cart and what they are they leaving behind, informing abandonment rates and insights to drive conversion;

New metrics around search, including the keywords customers are using to search a particular category or product, so suppliers can better understand what’s trending, but also what the customer’s frame of mind is as they’re searching; and

The new Content Quality Score metric, which helps suppliers understand the quality of their product content. “As you can imagine, this one is very tactical in terms of places where content can be improved — replace the hero image, add better descriptions, etc.,” said Lomelino.

Insights Designed to Drive Business Results

Suppliers can view aggregate metrics on their full Walmart product slate or drill down to the single UPC level. What’s not available are competitors’ metrics, for obvious reasons, but Lomelino said that with the new search insights, brands will be able to learn a lot about category-level behavior.

“These enhancements can really drive improved digital strategies, whether it’s advertising or supply chain or just a better understanding of how customers search for the category,” Lomelino added. “What we’re trying to drive on our side is improved discoverability, improved product conversion, increased purchases and loyalty over time, which fits in really nicely with the larger mission of becoming America’s favorite place to shop.”

Data Helps Refine Advertising Campaigns

Of course, one of the most important ways suppliers will use this data is to inform their advertising strategies, which at Walmart means the Connect retail media business.

“They can allocate their digital spend more effectively, because they understand the digital journey much better with the insights that we provide,” said Lomelino. “Not only that, but then in real time they can optimize campaigns that are in flight by understanding if the campaign is driving the behaviors they expect it to be driving.”

And of course, given that one of Walmart’s biggest strengths is its physical store network, other Scintilla modules offer omnichannel insights into shopper behavior and product sales performance.

“What we have heard from our suppliers very broadly is that they’re triangulating the Digital Landscapes data with all of the other transactional data so they can optimize for broader messaging,” said Lomelino. “So if you see keyword searches that point to something very specific or something viral, suppliers are obviously going to be able to capitalize on some of those signals and then leverage them, whether it’s in-store or online, through Walmart Connect or their traditional marketing assets.",https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AdobeStock_285824992-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-11 13:16:16.847921

(NYSE: HPSE) is poised for accelerated growth in 2025 as it integrates Juniper Networks and taps rising demand for AI-powered and hybrid cloud solutions. In its recent third quarter earnings, the company reported net revenue of $9.1 billion, up 18% year-on-year, fueled by strong momentum in AI systems and resilient server demand.

According to Visible Alpha consensus estimates, HPE’s net revenue is forecast to climb 15% year-on-year to $34.5 billion in 2025, followed by a further 17% increase to $40.2 billion in 2026. This compares with a modest 3% rise in 2024.

Hewlett Packard’s acquisition of Juniper Networks, completed in July, is a key driver of this growth as the company repositions itself for the AI and hybrid-cloud era. Analysts expect Juniper to contribute $2 billion in sales in 2025, almost tripling to $5.9 billion in 2026.

Hewlett Packard’s hybrid-cloud business is also gaining traction, buoyed by demand for its GreenLake platform, Alletra MP storage systems, and private-cloud AI deployments. The segment expanded 14% in the third quarter and is forecast to grow 7% to $5.8 billion in 2025, a turnaround from a 1% contraction last year.

Headline Takeaway:

(KHC.O) is in a weak technical position with a internal diagnostic score (0-10) of 2.61, suggesting investors should exercise caution. Meanwhile, fundamentals show strong signs with a score of 8.72.

News Highlights

Here’s what’s shaping the broader market and industry landscape:

DoorDash CEO Tony Xu’s Aggressive Expansion: DoorDash’s recent $3.9 billion acquisition of Deliveroo highlights the competitive nature of food delivery. While this doesn’t directly affect , it underscores shifting consumer behaviors and growing delivery infrastructure that may impact food brands.

India’s Food Labeling Push: The Indian Supreme Court’s directive to finalize food labeling regulations could influence global food safety expectations, potentially affecting how products like KHC are marketed and perceived.

Food Inflation and Tariffs: The ongoing U.S. tariff debates and food inflation trends suggest potential cost pressures for food producers, which could affect KHC's margins and pricing strategy in the long term.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Five institutions have weighed in recently, with a simple average rating of 3.00 and a performance-weighted rating of 2.64. The ratings show mixed consistency — all five analysts issued a Neutral rating, which aligns with the stock's recent price decline of -3.72%.

Internal diagnostic scores (0-10) for key fundamental metrics and values include:

EV/EBIT: 2.62 — Value: -3.53 times

Net Profit Margin (%): 1.00 — Value: -57.56%

Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (YoY %): 8.72 — Value: 12.61%

Net Profit / Total Operating Revenue (%): 1.00 — Value: -57.56%

CFOA (Cash Flow from Operating Activities): 8.08 — Value: 1.48

Annualized Return on Total Assets (%): 1.00 — Value: -15.73%

These metrics reflect a mixed fundamental outlook — strong cash flow and revenue performance clash with weak profit margins and return on assets. Investors should closely watch KHC’s ability to manage costs and maintain profitability amid rising food inflation.

Money-Flow Trends

Fund flows suggest positive movement overall, with a internal diagnostic score (0-10) of 7.71 and a rating of “good”. Large and extra-large investors are showing positive trends, with inflow ratios of 48.86% and 52.50%, respectively. In contrast, small investors remain bearish, with a 48.37% inflow ratio but a negative trend.

This divergence highlights that institutional money is flowing in while retail traders are cautious. It suggests a potential setup for a long-term trade if fundamentals and sentiment continue to align.

Key Technical Signals

Technically, The Kraft Heinz is in a weak position, with a internal diagnostic score (0-10) of 2.61 and a clear avoid recommendation. Of the seven indicators analyzed:

Bullish Engulfing (8.08) — A strong bullish candlestick pattern.

MACD Golden Cross (1.00) — A bearish divergence signal.

WR Overbought (1.00) — Suggests overbought conditions, typically a sell signal.

Dividend Record Date (1.00) — History shows a drop of -3.03% after such dates.

MACD Death Cross (2.62) — Suggests a bearish trend.

Recent patterns include a bullish engulfing on 2025-08-29 and a MACD golden cross on 2025-08-27, but these were quickly overwhelmed by bearish signals like the WR overbought and dividend record date.

Overall, the key insights show 6 bearish vs 1 bullish signals. Momentum is weak, and the trend quality is poor — a clear warning sign for technical traders.

Conclusion

While The Kraft Heinz shows strong fundamental performance and positive fund flows, the technical outlook remains bearish with a weak trend and a score of 2.61. Analyst sentiment is neutral, and recent price action supports caution.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd23363a0bc001.png,N,,2025-09-11 04:00:36.840669

HP has guided for fourth-quarter earnings of 87 to 97 cents a share, in line with consensus estimates, and maintained its annual free cash flow outlook of $2.6 billion to $3 billion for fiscal 2025. Management also expects PC margins to remain within the 5% to 7% range, supported by a shift toward AI-enabled PCs that could represent half of shipments within the next two years.

Evercore ISI left its price target unchanged at $29, reflecting its view that the stock is trading around its price target and that further upside is unlikely in the near term. The firm noted that it sees a host of cross currents that could cloud the path to higher EPS/FCF numbers.

This downgrade reflects Evercore ISI’s cautious stance on HP Inc’s earnings prospects, given the potential impact of tariffs on PC demand and the offsetting weakness in the printing segment.

While the company's leadership touts this as a bold step toward long-term value creation, the market has responded with skepticism, slashing KDP's stock price by over 18% in early trading and erasing $8 billion in market valueKeurig Dr Pepper stock downgraded by HSBC on JDE Peet's acquisition[ 3 ]. This divergence between strategic ambition and investor sentiment raises critical questions: Can KDP's high-leverage bet on the global coffee market deliver sustainable growth, or is the company overreaching in a bid to replicate past successes?

Strategic Moves for Long-Term Growth

KDP's 2025 strategy is anchored in three pillars: innovation, diversification, and scale. The company reported robust Q1 2025 results, with net sales rising 4.8% to $3.6 billion and operating income up 4.7% to $801 millionKeurig Dr Pepper Reports Q1 2025 Results and Reaffirms Guidance for 2025[ 1 ]. These figures underscore KDP's ability to execute disciplined cost management and capitalize on high-growth categories like energy drinks, which now generate over $1 billion in annual salesKeurig Dr Pepper stock downgraded by HSBC on JDE Peet's acquisition[ 3 ]. However, the acquisition of JDE Peet's represents a quantum leap in ambition. By merging KDP's single-serve coffee dominance with JDE's global portfolio (including brands like

and Lavazza), the company aims to create a $16 billion annual revenue stream under a new Global Coffee Co. spin-offKeurig Dr Pepper to acquire JDE Peet's[ 4 ].

The rationale for this move is compelling. Coffee consumption is projected to grow at a 4% CAGR through 2030, driven by premiumization and convenience trendsKeurig Dr Pepper (KDP) — $18.4B JDE Peet's Deal[ 2 ]. KDP's CEO, Tim Cofer, has emphasized that the acquisition will unlock $400 million in annual cost synergies and drive EPS accretion, while the separation of the coffee and North American beverage businesses is expected to enhance operational clarityKeurig Dr Pepper to acquire JDE Peet's[ 4 ].

Market Skepticism and Risks

Despite these strategic justifications, investors remain wary. The acquisition's all-cash structure and $18.4 billion price tag have pushed KDP's pro-forma net-debt/EBITDA ratio into the mid-to-high-5x range—a level that raises red flags for leveraged buyout specialists and value investors alikeKeurig Dr Pepper (KDP) — $18.4B JDE Peet's Deal[ 2 ].

Reconciling the Two Sides

The key to evaluating KDP's strategy lies in reconciling its long-term vision with short-term execution risks. On one hand, the company's free cash flow generation—$1.2 billion in 2024—provides a buffer for debt servicingKeurig Dr Pepper Reports Q1 2025 Results and Reaffirms Guidance for 2025[ 1 ].

Conclusion

Keurig Dr Pepper's JDE Peet's acquisition is a high-stakes gamble that could redefine its trajectory. While the company's Q1 2025 results and energy drink growth demonstrate operational strength, the market's skepticism is warranted given the leverage and integration risks. For long-term value creation to materialize, KDP must execute flawlessly: delivering synergies, separating the businesses cleanly, and navigating the debt burden without sacrificing innovation.

Dive Brief:

Boston Scientific has agreed to buy Elutia’s two bioenvelope products for $88 million, the companies said Tuesday.

The agreement will give Boston Scientific control of Elupro and Cangaroo, devices designed to promote wound healing to prevent complications after pacemaker or defibrillator implantation.

Elupro and Cangaroo compete with Medtronic’s TYRX. BTIG analysts said in a note to investors that they believe “the Elupro bioenvelope may offer clinical and handling advantages over TYRX.”

Dive Insight:

Elutia received clearance for Elupro in June 2024 and began a full commercial launch at the start of 2025. The device has an extracellular matrix to support wound healing and potentially facilitate re-operative procedures by reducing scar formation and fibrosis. Elupro gradually releases the antibiotics rifampin and minocycline into the surrounding tissue to provide antimicrobial protection after the procedure.

Cangaroo is a first-generation version of the product that lacks antibiotics. Elutia made Elupro the focus of its business after securing clearance to sell the bioenvelope in the U.S., telling investors last month that its success is highly dependent on the commercialization, marketing and sale of the device.

Elutia enlisted Boston Scientific to support the launch. Boston Scientific acts as a sales agent for Elutia, giving the company access to around 900 sales representatives and clinical specialists to complement its own direct sales force. The deal is scheduled to close in the fourth quarter. When that happens, Boston Scientific will take over commercialization of the bioenvelopes.

BTIG analysts said they expect the bioenvelopes to be “a relatively low-effort product sale” for Boston Scientific’s sales reps. The technology can be used with many of Boston Scientific’s implantable devices, the analysts said, and will compete with Medtronic’s TYRX. Medtronic’s device is synthetic and lacks the antibiotic-eluting feature of Elupro. The Elutia devices are biomatrices.

The analysts estimate Elupro and TYRX are competing for a $600 million opportunity in the U.S. cardiac rhythm management sector. Bioenvelope revenue was $3.5 million in the second quarter, the analysts said. Elupro, months into its launch, contributed around two-thirds of the sales.

Boston Scientific is paying a valuation multiple that is roughly in line with the historical average for sales of fast-growing businesses, the analysts said. While the bioenvelopes could be of interest to any company that sells pacemakers or defibrillators, the analysts do not expect additional bidders for the assets because Boston Scientific and Elutia already have a close partnership.

“If CVS bought Bartell and Rite Aid stores, they now are owned by CVS,” said Dima Mazen Qato, an associate professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California.
That’s what happened recently to Nicole J., a Shoreline resident whose prescription file moved from Rite Aid to CVS.
She believes the pharmacy counted CVS’ acquisition of her file from Rite Aid as a transfer.
CVS acquired 49 Rite Aid and Bartell Drugs locations in Washington this year, as well as the prescription files from 61 others.","After pharmacy chain Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy in May, CVS bought some of its stores, including the Bartell Drugs locations it owned, and patient records across the Pacific Northwest.

For some, the switch has been messy.

Many insurance plans classify pharmacies as either in-network or out-of-network, the same way they do for doctors and medical facilities.

That means some people who have been picking up their medications from their neighborhood pharmacy for years may no longer be able to do so.

“If CVS bought Bartell and Rite Aid stores, they now are owned by CVS,” said Dima Mazen Qato, an associate professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California. “CVS is probably not the preferred pharmacy for the same plans for which Rite Aid and Bartell were preferred or in-network.”

Whether a pharmacy falls within an individual’s insurance network varies by plan. At out-of-network pharmacies, people generally must pay full price for their medication, meaning they could face bills in the hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

That’s what happened recently to Nicole J., a Shoreline resident whose prescription file moved from Rite Aid to CVS. Nicole asked to be identified by her first name and middle initial to protect her sensitive medical details.

Nicole is on Medicaid, commonly known in Washington as Apple Health, and gets health coverage through the Community Health Plan of Washington. Late last month, she called her new CVS pharmacy for a medication refill. It wasn’t until the prescription was ready for pickup that she learned that CVS isn’t among her plan’s network pharmacies. Out of pocket, she would have had to pay $800 for a month’s supply — a sum she would not have been able to afford.

Her experience is not uncommon. In fact, it happens regularly when pharmacies get bought out or shut down, said Qato.

On social media, Washington residents have complained about long wait times and dead ends when calling to get their records sent from CVS to an in-network pharmacy.

To address potential delays, the state Department of Health in July urged former Rite Aid customers to request refills early so that pharmacies have “ample time” to process them.

CVS acknowledged this week that people might run into issues getting their prescriptions as the pharmacy continues to integrate prescription files from former Rite Aid and Bartell Drugs locations.

“CVS Pharmacy may be excluded from some payer networks in Washington,” wrote Amy Thibault, executive director of corporate communications. “If that’s the case, the pharmacy team will work with the patient to transfer their prescriptions to an in-network pharmacy, if requested.”

Delays in prescription refills can be problematic.

“Patients that are dealing with disruptions of pharmacy access — whether it’s a closure or basically not being able to go to a pharmacy because it doesn’t cover the cost of your drugs — they’re less likely to fill or adhere to their medication regimens, which has health implications,” said Qato, who is a senior scholar at the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at USC.

Nicole’s issue was compounded by difficulties she had in transferring a controlled drug prescription out of CVS.

Her medication is a Schedule III controlled substance. Under federal drug regulations, patients can only transfer prescriptions for such medications between pharmacies once before they need a new prescription.

Nicole said the pharmacy team at CVS refused to transfer her prescription on the basis that she’d already reached her transfer limit. She believes the pharmacy counted CVS’ acquisition of her file from Rite Aid as a transfer. (A CVS spokesperson wrote in an email that acquisitions of patient files do not count as transfers.)

Ultimately, Nicole reached out to her doctor, who wrote her a new prescription. By the time she finally received her medication, almost a week had lapsed.

“It was just really frustrating,” she said. “You don’t want to have interruptions in medication that you’re trying to take regularly.”

CVS’ takeover comes during a prolonged stretch of difficulty for the pharmacy business. Washington is among the states that has been hardest hit by industrywide closures, which make pharmacies more scarce and difficult for residents to access.

The new offering is kicking off during the fourth quarter with a limited beta test in the Americas, but Criteo plans to extend it to any of its more than 200 retail partners globally that show interest, said Sherry Smith, president of retail media at the company.

“Retailers can opt in to receive this demand,” Smith explained. “Every single retailer that we work with, they all want more demand.”

These efforts to funnel new ad dollars into retail media networks through Google could sweeten the pot for Criteo’s retailer clients at a moment when Criteo is facing increasingly fierce competition from a group of smaller competitors vying for market share.

At the same time, the Google and Criteo deal has the potential to further commoditize sponsored product ads, especially if Google extends its retail media demand partnership to Criteo’s competitors, said one retail media source. That could push ad serving prices down across the board, forcing adtech players including Criteo to settle for a smaller share of revenue for each retail media ad sold.

Overall, though, it’s likely beneficial for Criteo as well as the retailers selling ads and the brands buying them, the source said.

“We’re helping advertisers connect with customers at a critical moment in their shopping journey: onsite, through sponsored product ads,” Bill Reardon, general manager of enterprise platform at Google, said in a statement. “Coupled with our existing suite of offsite solutions in Performance Max and Shopping Ads, our goal is to empower advertisers and agencies with a more complete view of their advertising performance, enabling smarter decisions and more effective campaigns.”

By opening up retailer inventory to ad buyers already using Google’s ad management platform, Criteo is effectively lowering the logistical barrier to buying retail ads. Smaller brands and agencies that lack resources might not have the bandwidth to develop relationships with individual retailers—or even with retail media-specific adtech companies like Criteo. Connecting those ad slots to Google makes it possible.

The move builds upon Criteo’s partnership with Mirakl, announced in July, which makes it easier for third-party sellers to buy ads on retail marketplaces.

For retailers aiming to strike a delicate balance between preserving customers’ experience while attracting high-quality ads and cashing in on their high-margin revenue, more demand means more ways to fill ad space left over after whatever gets allotted to major partners during joint-business planning negotiations.

“It is a very big step in unlocking scale for our retail partners to be more efficient—to bring better and more unified measurement,” Smith said. “The intent is to make sure it’s very efficient, it’s very transparent, and that it’s incredibly flexible.”

After the beta test with sponsored product ads, Smith said the goal is to make additional ad formats like onsite display and video available through Google as well.",https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/large-Criteo-Google_Webart.png?w=600&h=315&crop=1,N,,2025-09-10 10:13:04.809916

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., September 10, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In an innovative initiative to improve disaster preparedness and response, Philips, Philips Foundation, and nonprofit MedShare International are collaborating to tackle the healthcare challenges caused by natural disasters.

Unlike traditional reactive disaster response programs, this initiative prioritizes disaster preparedness as a strategy to save lives and create continuity of care. MedShare will have Philips medical equipment and other essential products on hand, ensuring these resources are available for rapid deployment when natural disasters disrupt access to healthcare. Prompted by the critical need highlighted during Hurricane Helene in 2024 [1], this strategic partnership has been designed to supply essential medical equipment and supplies to enable continuity of care to people and communities in need during times of crisis.

""By working hand-in-hand with Philips and the Philips Foundation, we’re not only staging life-saving medical equipment for rapid deployment following disasters, but we’re also reimagining sustainability in emergency response,"" said Stacey Koehnke, CEO and Executive Director of MedShare International. ""Together, we’re building an innovative, resilient, forward-looking system that saves lives today and strengthens response capacity for the challenges of tomorrow.""

The need for a proactive and sustainable approach to disaster response has never been more urgent. Natural disasters are increasingly compromising access to healthcare across the United States, with nearly 400 climate disasters causing over $1 billion in damages each in the past 45 years [2], causing severe damage to so many families and communities.

Philips North America is contributing ultrasound systems capable of cardiac, vascular, obstetric and gynecological imaging. These technologies, to be staged and deployed by MedShare, are supported by field service engineers for installation, maintenance and de-installation to ensure effective deployment in challenging environments. Additionally, the donation of essential mother-and-child care products such as feeding bottles and pacifiers will help to address urgent needs in disaster-affected areas.

""Every human life holds immeasurable value, and that belief drives everything we do,"" said Jeff DiLullo, Chief Region Leader, Philips North America. ""In times of crisis, access to quality healthcare becomes even more critical. Our partnership with MedShare and the Philips Foundation reflects our deep commitment to using innovation and collaboration to protect and uplift vulnerable communities when they need us most.""

Philips Foundation will provide financial aid and strategic guidance, drawing on over a decade of experience in disaster relief. In 2024 alone, the Foundation helped respond to major crises across the world, including the Noto Peninsula Earthquake in Japan and the devastating floods in Brazil, Poland, and Spain, by ensuring the rapid delivery of critical medical equipment and services.

Eddine Sarroukh, Head of the Philips Foundation, stated: ""By combining Philips’ healthcare expertise with MedShare’s extensive network, we are responding to disasters and building a resilient system that supports continuity of care for the most vulnerable communities. It's great that we are teaming up with a like-minded partner to establish a disaster-preparedness model for rapid response and continuity during emergencies, we hope to see scaled.""

This two-year pilot program will serve as a model for future expansion, with a focus on durability and scalability. A key component of the program is the reusability of the donated medical equipment, which will be shipped back to MedShare for reprocessing and redeployment after each emergency. This approach not only maximizes the impact of each device but also sets a new standard, supporting reuse and encouraging environmentally practices in disaster response.

The arrangement also allowed the Japanese pharma giant and Taiwan-based TWi to avoid competition from other generic drug makers even after Takeda’s patent protection for Dexilant had expired, according to the lawsuit.

Like the other retailers, CVS called the deal a “reverse payment"" agreement in which Takeda paid TWi to keep its generic off the market. Such settlements are often referred to as ""pay-for-delay"" agreements.

CVS alleges that the companies’ collusion increased its expenses in purchasing Dexilant for sales to its customers. In the March lawsuit, Walgreens made the same argument, joined by other retailers Kroger, Albertsons and H-E-B.

The CVS lawsuit also names TWi's new parent company, Bora Pharmaceuticals, and Upsher-Smith Laboratories, another Bora subsidiary that merged with and succeeded TWi. Bora acquired TWi in 2022 and Upsher-Smith Laboratories in 2024.

(ARMK) has sparked a critical debate among investors: Is the company's Q3 2023 revenue miss a harbinger of deeper structural issues, or merely a temporary stumble in an otherwise resilient business model? To answer this, one must dissect the interplay between macroeconomic pressures, operational execution, and strategic adaptability. The evidence suggests that while the revenue shortfall in Q3 2023 raised legitimate concerns, the subsequent Q3 2024 results and management's strategic responses indicate a company capable of navigating turbulence and sustaining growth.

The Q3 2023 Revenue Miss: A Symptom of Broader Challenges

In August 2023, Aramark reported quarterly revenue of $4.75 billion, a 15.1% year-over-year increase, yet fell short of market expectationsWhat You Need to Know About Aramark's Q3 Earnings[ 3 ]. This discrepancy, coupled with a 5.6% stock declineAramark Q3 2023 Earnings Report[ 2 ], underscored investor skepticism. The miss was attributed to inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and the difficulty of maintaining pricing power in a competitive marketAramark Q3 2023 Earnings Report[ 2 ]. However, earnings per share of $0.36 exceeded forecastsWhat You Need to Know About Aramark's Q3 Earnings[ 3 ], highlighting the company's ability to manage costs and protect margins.

Management at the time emphasized resilience, noting that organic revenue growth of over 14% was driven by its Global Food & Support Services and Uniform Services segmentsAramark Q3 2023 Earnings Report[ 2 ]. The latter, in particular, showed promise, with a planned spin-off by year-end signaling a strategic pivot to focus on core competenciesAramark Q3 2023 Earnings Report[ 2 ]. Yet, the revenue shortfall raised questions about the sustainability of growth in a macroeconomic environment marked by rising tariffs and inflationAramark (ARMK) Stock Price, Market Cap, Segmented ...[ 4 ].

Q3 2024: A Turnaround Driven by Strategic Execution

By Q3 2024, Aramark had not only recovered but exceeded expectations. The company reported record revenue of $4.4 billion, with organic growth of 11% year-over-year across all business lines and geographiesWhat You Need to Know About Aramark's Q3 Earnings[ 3 ]. This performance was underpinned by three key factors:

Cost Management and Supply Chain Efficiency: Aramark's global supply chain team optimized spend, contributing to a 22% year-over-year increase in operating incomeARAMARK Earnings Call Transcript FY24 Q3[ 1 ]. The company also anticipates surpassing $20 billion in global supply chain and GPO network spend by fiscal year-endARAMARK Earnings Call Transcript FY24 Q3[ 1 ], a testament to its ability to scale efficiencies.

New Client Acquisition: A robust sales pipeline and strategic client wins, particularly in corporate catering and institutional food services, drove volume growthARAMARK Earnings Call Transcript FY24 Q3[ 1 ].

Innovation and Partnerships: The collaboration with Michelin-starred chef Daniel Boulud to enhance culinary offerings exemplifies Aramark's focus on differentiationAramark (ARMK) Stock Price, Market Cap, Segmented ...[ 4 ]. This move targets high-margin segments like special events and premium corporate catering, aligning with broader trends in experiential dining.

Navigating Macroeconomic Headwinds: Pricing and Domestic Sourcing

Despite these successes, macroeconomic challenges persist. Inflation and potential tariffs remain risks, yet management has adopted a proactive stance. By leveraging pricing strategies and increasing domestic sourcingAramark (ARMK) Stock Price, Market Cap, Segmented ...[ 4 ], Aramark aims to mitigate input cost volatility. This approach mirrors broader industry trends, where companies are reconfiguring supply chains to reduce reliance on globalized networks.

The Uniform Services spin-off, now largely completed, further insulates the core business from cyclical fluctuations in uniform demandAramark Q3 2023 Earnings Report[ 2 ]. This structural change enhances focus on higher-growth areas, such as food services, which are less susceptible to macroeconomic shocks.

Assessing Sustainability: A Balancing Act

The sustainability of Aramark's growth hinges on its ability to maintain operational discipline while scaling innovation. The Q3 2024 results demonstrate that the company can execute under pressure, but long-term success will depend on:

- Continued Cost Optimization: Sustaining supply chain efficiencies in a volatile environment.

- Strategic Partnerships: Leveraging collaborations like the one with Boulud to capture premium pricing.

- Geographic Diversification: The international segment's 16% organic growth in Q3 2023ARAMARK Earnings Call Transcript FY24 Q3[ 1 ] suggests that expanding into emerging markets could buffer against U.S.-centric risks.

Conclusion: A Transient Setback, Not a Structural Crisis

Aramark's Q3 2023 revenue miss was a transient setback, not a sign of systemic weakness. The company's subsequent performance, coupled with strategic initiatives to address macroeconomic risks, reinforces its capacity to sustain growth. While challenges remain, the combination of operational agility, innovation, and disciplined cost management positions Aramark to thrive in a complex environment. For investors, the key takeaway is that the revenue miss was a symptom of broader economic turbulence, not a flaw in the business model itself.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-10 13:14:37.918201

The project named U DESERVE 5G will demonstrate the feasibility of direct communications between satellites and mobile devices or fixed terminals (5G direct to device, or D2D). A demonstrator satellite will be placed in low-Earth orbit to test interoperability between terrestrial and nonterrestrial 5G networks. The project will use a set of scenarios to evaluate how smoothly devices can switch between satellite and terrestrial 5G coverage, which is a crucial step toward truly global, seamless and uninterrupted connectivity.

At a time when anytime, anywhere connectivity has become a strategic priority — both to meet market demand and ensure infrastructure resilience in crisis situations — satellite technology is emerging as a crucial and complementary solution alongside terrestrial networks.

At the heart of the project is an innovative 5G satellite payload with an active antenna. It will enable voice calls and data transmission directly between the satellite and a test mobile device, without routing via a ground station. The demonstrator will include all components of the chain: test satellite, payload, NTN ground segment and test mobile devices. It will be compatible with Release 17 of the 3GPP 5G standard and will provide an end-to-end test platform to evaluate the performance of the 5G NTN/TN system and trial use cases, especially involving the Internet of Things (IoT).

Thales, which will assess the feasibility of a 5G D2D terminal with a directional antenna operating in the future C band.

Orange, which will contribute its operator expertise and host the demonstration at its Bercenay facility in France.

SES, in charge of studying the implementation of D2D services.

Qualcomm, which will supply a 5G NTN-compatible test mobile terminal.

Loft Orbital, responsible for the platform, AIT (assembly, integration, testing), launch reservation and satellite operations for the demonstration phase.

“This new 5G D2D project paves the way for Thales Alenia Space to provide high-speed coverage in areas not served by terrestrial networks, as well as emergency or continuity services in crisis situations,” said Stéphane Anjuère, 5G Venture Leader for Thales Alenia Space. “By leveraging its expertise in geostationary telecommunications and medium- and low-Earth orbit constellations, our company has played a key role in the standardisation of 5G by satellite and is ideally positioned to support future large-scale 5G D2D projects.”

“This pioneering 5G-by-satellite project represents a major breakthrough for Thales and the telecommunications industry,” said Alexandre Bottero, VP Networks and Infrastructure Systems for Thales. “By developing 5G NTN D2D modem solutions enabling high-speed connectivity, even in the most remote areas, we’re laying the groundwork for the future of global communications and stepping up our commitment to a more connected and resilient world.”

“This project perfectly emphasises Capgemini’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of connectivity. Thanks to our unique expertise in integrating terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks, in addition to our mastery of radio access solutions and 4G/5G core networks, Capgemini is playing a key role in demonstrating 5G via satellite,” added Angélique Lallouet, Executive Director of Capgemini Engineering in France. “We are particularly proud to be contributing to this strategic initiative alongside Thales Alenia Space, Thales, and all of our partners, and to be collaborating once again with CNES to advance French and European technological sovereignty.”",https://www.advanced-television.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/France-e1632927980564.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 09:11:23.932922

“The surge of On-Demand technologies – such as Public Cloud, SaaS, and Gen AI – has reshaped how leading businesses operate.
These include: Soaring costs and complexity: 82% of executives report significant increases in cloud, SaaS, and Gen AI costs.","As digital transformation accelerates across industries, organizations are embracing On-Demand technologies — such as public cloud, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and Generative AI (Gen AI) — to scale innovation, improve agility, and support competitiveness. But while the benefits are clear, a new global study from the Capgemini Research Institute published today, ‘The On-Demand tech paradox: balancing speed and spend’, reveals that rising costs, complexity, and governance gaps are putting returns at risk. With growing demand for digital infrastructure, organizations are struggling to contain technology costs due to lack of cost visibility, underutilized resources, as well as a legacy mindset.

Organizations are pivoting from capital-intensive IT investments to flexible, consumption-based models and On-Demand technologies. According to the report, IT and technology spend is projected to rise and the share of On-Demand tech in IT budgets is expected to grow from 29% to 41% over the next year. The majority (77%) of executives view cloud scalability and performance as critical to business growth and differentiation, as it allows their organizations to scale innovation, accelerate time-to-market and stay competitive. Despite these benefits, many organizations are struggling to harness these On-Demand technologies while maintaining costs.

“The surge of On-Demand technologies – such as Public Cloud, SaaS, and Gen AI – has reshaped how leading businesses operate. These tools offer unparalleled convenience, but they come with a financial implication,” said Karine Brunet, CEO of Cloud Infrastructure Services at Capgemini and member of the Group Executive Committee. “While On-Demand technology expenses are projected to double over the next three to four years, organizations must find a way to gain transparency and control over costs while elevating value. Those that align their cloud strategy with their overall business goals are well positioned to harness this opportunity. By designing scalable, modular, cloud-native and frugal architecture, they are set-up to drive sustainable value through smarter FinOps, integrated governance, and AI-driven automation.”

On-Demand technologies are driving tech and IT spending, but not without challenges

While the more advanced adopters of On-Demand tech are already reaping rewards — from cost savings and faster product innovation to improved service quality and operational productivity, less mature adopters are finding that the road ahead is not without its challenges. These include:

Soaring costs and complexity: 82% of executives report significant increases in cloud, SaaS, and Gen AI costs. Inflation, AI adoption, and digital infrastructure demands are key drivers.

Budget overruns: 76% of organizations exceeded their public cloud budgets (by an average of 10%), while 68% overspent on Gen AI and 52% on SaaS. Underutilized resources and decentralized procurement are major culprits.

Shadow IT and security risks: Business units now drive 59% of Gen AI and 48% of SaaS spending. 12% of all SaaS spending is unmanaged. Nearly all executives (98%) admit to bypassing IT for tech purchases, creating inefficiencies and security vulnerabilities.

Limited ROI realization: Despite heavy investments, only 29% achieved expected SaaS cost savings, 33% saw desired cloud service quality, and 38% realized faster innovation with Gen AI.

FinOps, a critical yet underdeveloped discipline to optimize costs and elevate On-Demand tech value

According to the survey, 60% of organizations use cloud cost management tools, but only 37% evaluate their effectiveness or act on insights. While three quarters of the organizations surveyed (76%) have or plan to establish FinOps teams, most remain narrowly focused and operational in nature. Only 2% who have a dedicated FinOps function cover cloud, SaaS, and Gen AI holistically, and just 42% influence business decisions.

In addition, more than half (53%) of the organizations agree that suboptimal On-Demand tech usage leads to excessive energy consumption and increased carbon emissions. Despite this, only 36% of organizations have a strategy for integrating sustainability into FinOps. Integrating practices such as developing energy-efficient architectures, optimizing computing and storage, switching off idle resources and scheduling workloads can reduce costs as well as carbon.

Report Methodology

The Capgemini Research Institute conducted a survey of 1,000 executives from global organizations with annual revenue of at least $1 billion who are consuming On-Demand technologies (Cloud, SaaS, and Gen AI on Cloud) in 12 sectors and 14 countries across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The global survey was carried out in May 2025. To supplement the findings, Capgemini also conducted in-depth discussions with 10 executives from global organizations.

""If I can use big words, it's a facile and fallacious logic,"" the Barclays chief told CNBC's Sarah Eisen in a wide-ranging interview Tuesday.
Pressed on the direct consequences of an increased levy, the Barclays chief laid out a stark scenario.
""We would have to find ways to get greater productivity, pull back on hiring, and actually issue less credit into the U.K. economy,"" he said.
As an alternative to raising taxes on banks, Venkatakrishnan urged the government to focus its spending on long-term investments designed to reverse a national decline in productivity.","Barclays Chief Executive C.S. Venkatakrishnan criticized a proposal to raise taxes on British banks, warning the ""facile and fallacious logic"" behind such a move would compel the lender to cut back on hiring and reduce lending to the British economy. Venkatakrishnan said that further burdening a sector already facing one of the highest tax rates globally is not a viable solution to the U.K.'s difficult fiscal situation. ""If I can use big words, it's a facile and fallacious logic,"" the Barclays chief told CNBC's Sarah Eisen in a wide-ranging interview Tuesday. ""Take the banking sector [in the U.K.], which is already paying a tax rate of 48%, higher than almost any other banking sector."" Contrasting the figure with rates in other major financial hubs, Venkatakrishnan continued, ""New York is like 26%, and even the highest in Europe is like 39%, so adding to that is not a path towards economic growth."" In the U.K., banks pay a 3% surcharge on the standard corporate tax rate, which stands at 25%. The Barclays chief executive, however, was referring to a much broader measure known as the ""total tax rate,"" which aims to capture the entire tax burden that falls on a company as a direct cost, representing a percentage of its commercial profits. The figures were compiled by the consultancy PwC for the trade lobby UK Finance. The U.K. government is reportedly considering raising the bank surcharge by up to 2% in November to help offset part of an estimated £20 billion deficit in its annual budget. London finds itself needing to raise taxes or cut spending drastically after a rise in inflation expectations drove up U.K. bond yields. The U.K. government has also had to reverse its policy on cuts to welfare after political backlash. Robert Woods, chief U.K. economist at Panthen Macroeconomics, said ""we estimate that in its forthcoming Budget forecast, the OBR will raise forecast debt-interest costs at the five-year forecast horizon by only [£3 billion]"" in a note to clients on September 8. The U.K. Treasury did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Pressed on the direct consequences of an increased levy, the Barclays chief laid out a stark scenario. ""We would have to find ways to get greater productivity, pull back on hiring, and actually issue less credit into the U.K. economy,"" he said. The reason, he explained, is that the bank ""wouldn't have as much capital to reinvest back into the system."" The warning carries significant weight, as Venkatakrishnan noted that the financial services industry accounts for 10% of the U.K. economy and serves as a major source of export earnings for the country. London-listed Barclays shares have risen 40% in 2025, and the lender reported a near-record net profit of about £6 billion ($8.1 billion) in the latest 12-month period ending June 2025, according to FactSet. Barclays also trades in New York. BARC-GB YTD line A 'pro-business government' Despite his critique of the specific tax proposal, Venkatakrishnan also expressed broad confidence in the current government's handling of the economy. He acknowledged that officials have to make difficult choices regarding taxation and spending, but described the administration as supportive of companies. ""It is a pro-business government. It is absolutely pro-business. I have felt it since the day they walked in,"" he said, adding that the government understands the importance of the financial sector to the nation's economy. As an alternative to raising taxes on banks, Venkatakrishnan urged the government to focus its spending on long-term investments designed to reverse a national decline in productivity. ""That spending has to be investment: investment in housing, investment in infrastructure, investment in long-term productivity,"" he said.

In the Americas, including the US, its second biggest market, Inditex saw sales fall 3.8 in the first half, citing a 'complex' market.

The company's investor relations director, Gorka Garcia-Tapia, told analysts the 'complex' comment referred to US tariffs and trade wars, as well as foreign exchange swings.

Donald Trump has implemented a 15 per cent levy on goods imported from the EU.

Inditex, which is the world's largest fashion retailer, said second quarter sales rose to €10.08billion in the three months to the end of July.

While an improvement on the previous quarter, analysts had been expecting growth of around 3.4 per cent.

But Inditex said sales accelerated in recent weeks after the successful launch of its latest autumn and winter clothing lines. The business said its new collections had been 'very well received' by shoppers.

The group reported a 9 per cent rise in sales across its stores and online between 1 August and 7 September

The Spanish retail firm, which also owns the Pull & Bear and Bershka brands, revealed total sales grew by 1.6 per cent to £15.9billion in the first half, with sales rising 5.1 per cent after adjusting for currency rates.

Sales for the group’s Zara business grew slightly to £11.4billion, but represented a slowdown in growth amid pressure on consumer finances.

Oscar García Maceiras, chief executive of Inditex, said: 'We have again achieved a solid performance in this first half of 2025, with satisfactory sales in a complex market environment and keeping strong levels of profitability.

'The efficient execution accomplished by our teams demonstrates the strength of Inditex’s business model.'

Separately on Wednesday Primark owner Associated British Foods said the retail chain saw trading improve in recent months despite 'consumer caution', as its UK and stores recovered ground.

Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Inditex was 'navigating a challenging path.'

He added: 'Its products are more expensive [than Primark's], which means the goods must sparkle to convince cautious shoppers to part with their cash.

'The difference between Inditex and Primark is that the former is more upbeat about current trading, explaining why its shares jumped on its update.

'Both Inditex and Primark have US operations and they’re having to contend with tariffs and unfavourable foreign exchange rates.

'Life is never easy as a retailer as there are so many things out of their control – be it the wrong type of weather, economic weakness or taxes. It currently feels like a perfect storm for the retail sector and management must be adept at spinning multiple plates.'",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/10/10/102001789-0-image-m-16_1757498338408.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 10:12:44.449785

The entities said their signing of what is claimed to be a UK-first Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) agreement will streamline collaboration on ‘mutually beneficial’ research and innovation projects across cardiovascular, neuroscience, medical surgery, and diabetes.

The latest agreement builds on an existing partnership that has resulted in improved care and clinical outcomes for patients over the past decade through piloting medtech solutions in MFT-operated hospitals, according to a joint statement by Medtronic and the MFT. These include the remote monitoring pathway TriageHP Plus, which has reduced the number of hospitalisations due to heart failure.

In October 2024, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended the NHS use the pathway for heart failure patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices.

Medtronic UK and Ireland senior director Dr Matthew Williams-Gray commented: “By co-developing novel solutions in cardiovascular, neuroscience, medical surgery, and diabetes, we aim to accelerate the transformation of healthcare and improve patient outcomes.”

A key role for MFT under the RDI will be in facilitating the use of anonymised clinical data for public and private benefit through its Clinical Data Science Unit.

The pair-up will also involve the use of Medtronic’s product portfolio to increase remote patient monitoring and community care-based provisions on the NHS. MFT’s hosted infrastructure, including the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) HealthTech Research Centre (HRC) in Emergency and Acute Care, will support this aspect of the initiative.

More broadly, the RDI agreement resonates with technological strategies outlined under the UK Labour Government’s 10-year plan for the NHS, which outlines shifts from hospital to more community-centred care and the transition from an analogue to a more digital health service.

To support these ambitions, the government announced a £29bn ($39.1bn) funding boost to the NHS in June, reflecting a 3% annual rise on current levels over the next three years to reach £226bn by 2029.

Dr Katherine Boylan, deputy managing director of research and innovation at MFT, commented: “This collaboration provides a huge opportunity to pioneer breakthroughs in healthcare and accelerate our joint projects to design and deliver innovative research that will really make a difference in the NHS.”",https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2025/09/shutterstock_2472349537.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 08:06:36.294035

Speaking at a Barclays conference earlier this week, CS Venkatakrishnan said any more taxation on banks would harm the government’s aims of growing the economy, as he recommitted to the bank’s investment in its UK operations.

“Additional bank taxes in the UK . . . are not a good idea in any way, shape, or form, and if I can be clear . . . that is not a path to higher growth in the UK and most economists would agree,” Venkatakrishnan said.

UK banks’ share prices dived last week after the Institute for Public Policy Research — a think-tank — recommended various taxes on lenders’ profits as a way to fill the current government budget deficit. NatWest, Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group all saw their shares drop between 2 per cent and 5 per cent on the fears that a levy might be introduced, focusing on the profits gained from deposits held at the Bank of England as a result of quantitative easing.

The think-tank predicted this could prevent between £35bn and £40bn of taxpayer losses over the course of this parliament, and boost the government’s fiscal headroom by between £5bn and £7bn.

Banks currently pay around 45 per cent in tax in the UK — among the highest across global financial centres — which includes 25 per cent in corporation tax (a tax on profits), the banking surcharge, which is 3 per cent of profits, and the bank levy which is 0.1 per cent of UK balance sheets. Increasing these tax rates, or adding further taxes, could dent the attractiveness of the UK for investment.

However, analysts dismissed the market’s reaction to the proposed levy, highlighting it would be antithetical to the government’s pro-growth aims, comments echoed by Venkatakrishnan this week.

In his comments to the conference earlier this week, Venkatakrishnan said Barclays remained committed to the UK, highlighting its target to deploy £30bn of risk-weighted assets in the UK by 2026.

“[W]e are extremely confident in the UK we are committed to that extra £30bn . . . and we expect that as our home market to be a growing central part of the bank.”

He expressed support in the current government, despite concerns over its ability to tackle low growth, and dismissed concerns over rising gilt yields, saying that UK yields — which reached their highest level since 1998 last week — have moved with global yields, which is largely technical and is not a fundamental issue.

“The fundamental issue in the UK at the moment is growth, [and] the government has this absolutely front of mind and I am confident that they are up to the challenge,” he said.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/b7e13e93-c06a-43cf-9f37-89fa5b8527a9.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 09:11:13.083282

Most automotive organizations anticipate that software will be the single biggest source of competitive advantage over the next five years, but so far only a few have fully scaled their efforts

The automotive industry is undergoing a transformation as software becomes increasingly central to its business strategy and operations. According to a new report from the Capgemini Research Institute, 'The software-driven mobility era: Beyond vehicles', nearly all automotive organizations (92%) now anticipate that every automotive company will transition to a software company to support Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs) and software-driven mobility (SDM)[1] services. Over eight in ten believe that software-defined products and services, not just the physical vehicle, will become their core value proposition.

According to the report, while ambitions are strong, less than half of automotive organizations have scaled their SDM initiatives in 2025: 34% have partially scaled at least one SDM use case, and just 14% have achieved full-scale deployment.

While decoupling hardware and software has emerged as crucial to enable faster innovation, drive improved scalability, and unlock new revenue streams, the survey shows that only one in ten original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) has made progress in this journey, with just over a quarter actively piloting new approaches.

'For decades, automotive leadership was driven by hardware but today consumers demand connected, digitally enhanced experiences. This calls for adoption of a software first approach across the value chain to enable holistic mobility solutions,' said Laurence Noel, Global Head of Automotive at Capgemini. 'Forward-looking automotive organizations are already treating software as their core product and leveraging key partnerships to expand their ecosystem. While the ambition is high, it requires a complete organizational overhaul. Those that align their talent, platforms, and partnerships, while fostering trust and delivering an elevated customer experience, will stay ahead of the curve.'

Strategic partnerships and ecosystem collaboration are accelerating the shift to SDM

According to the report, automotive organizations are increasingly recognizing the value of broader collaboration, with nearly two in five partnering with big tech and hyperscalers for critical software, cloud, and data capabilities. While only a few have established joint ventures so far, a third plan to do so within three years. Up to 84% are exploring new supplier markets to build resilience, and nearly 70% are doubling down on in-house development of key components to retain control over brand-defining technologies. Organizations are also restructuring their supply chains for geopolitical resilience, by exploring new sourcing markets including India, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe.

Software-defined products and mobility services are also expected to become significant revenue contributors for OEMs. According to the report, their share of OEMs' total revenue is projected to double, contributing to over 50% by 2035.

AI is driving a new era of innovation in the auto industry

The report highlights that a vast majority (85%) agree that AI is increasingly becoming an integral part of automotive software, embedded directly into software features and functions, from improving in-vehicle experiences to powering advanced safety features and cybersecurity.

Over three-quarters (77%) see AI integration into software development, in-vehicle functions, and mobility services as a critical competitive advantage that will reshape the automotive value chain. By reducing costs, boosting productivity and efficiency, and enhancing product quality, AI is propelling the industry into a new era of innovation. Notably, most surveyed organizations view AI integration for ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) and autonomous driving capabilities as extremely significant in their organization's software-driven strategy.

Software-driven mobility demands an organizational overhaul to reap its full potential

According to the survey, most organizations (86%) believe SDM strategy demands an overhaul of the organizational model, leading to significant changes in processes, and the need to build new skill sets. In addition to structural changes, organizations face a range of challenges in software engineering, compliance, safety, cybersecurity, leadership, and talent acquisition. Over eight in ten (83%) organizations identify the creation of a unified software platform[2] as a key component of their software-driven mobility strategy.

Report Methodology

In June 2025, the Capgemini Research Institute conducted a survey of 600 executives from 200 long-established automotive organizations, with no more than four respondents from each organization. These executives represented organizations across four segments: OEMs, suppliers, mobility service providers, and digital natives from countries across North America, Europe, and APAC. The surveys were complemented by interviews with more than fifteen industry experts.

The industrial sector is a major contributor to this environmental challenge.

According to Capgemini, the sector is responsible for more than 35% of greenhouse gas emissions, with Scope 3 emissions accounting for 70% of this figure.

Capgemini’s 'Building Sustainable Value Chains' report states that without intervention, rising emissions could lead to a global temperature increase of 4.1–4.8°C by 2100, which far surpasses the 1.5–2°C target set by the Paris Agreement.

However, this push for sustainable transformation also offers a considerable opportunity for businesses to improve cost efficiency, resilience and long-term competitiveness.

The complexities of corporate decarbonisation

While sustainability is a priority for many corporations, executing a successful strategy remains a substantial challenge.

Half of all companies acknowledge they are not on schedule with their Scope 3 decarbonisation targets and 67% report having low confidence in their ability to create and implement mature roadmaps for change.

Several barriers contribute to this difficulty, including:

difficulty in making a strong business case for long-term sustainability investments.

complexity in tracking and accurately reporting carbon emissions.

obstacles in decarbonising supply chains.

limited scalability of low-carbon technologies.

The challenge is further complicated by variations between sectors. In industries such as cement, steel and mining, Scope 1 emissions are the primary concern.

In contrast, for sectors like chemicals, electronics and food, the main issue lies with Scope 3 emissions, necessitating deep collaboration with suppliers, manufacturers and consumer brands.

“Building a sustainable value chain is an iterative process,” explain Cyril Garcia, Group Executive Board Member and Head of Sustainability at Capgemini and Charlotte Pierron-Perlès, Global Head of Intelligent Industry at Capgemini Invent, in the report.

“It requires a balanced approach between short-term quick wins, such as energy efficiency and sustainable product design improvements and long-term action, such as strategising on the product portfolio, sustainable asset investment and supply chain redesign.”

The business case for sustainability

Despite these obstacles, there is strong evidence supporting the advantages of developing sustainable value chains.

Sustainable practices can directly improve cost efficiency by lowering energy consumption, reducing carbon taxes and optimising operational processes.

For instance, a packaging redesign guided by a life-cycle assessment cut a product's carbon footprint from 10 to three kgCO₂e while also reducing costs.

In another case, an automotive project successfully lowered Scope 1 emissions by 27% and Scope 2 emissions by 13% across 17 different sites.

Circular business models have also shown impressive results, with the water and automotive sectors demonstrating material savings of up to 50% and cost reductions of 70%.

Furthermore, the use of digital twins and AI models enabled one heavy industry client to decrease its kiln energy consumption by 15% and shorten development cycles by 70%.

A framework for successful transformation

Capgemini has outlined three core pillars that underpin a successful value chain transformation.

The first is sustainable product design, which involves integrating eco-friendly materials, energy efficiency and circularity from the initial design phase to lower costs, extend product life and enhance competitiveness.

The second pillar, sustainable manufacturing, focuses on moving to low-carbon energy sources, improving water and waste efficiency and adopting circular production models to reduce both emissions and operational expenses.

The final pillar, sustainable supply chains, involves responsible sourcing, logistics optimisation and ESG transparency to minimise reliance on vulnerable resources and bolster resilience against market volatility.

Data, digitalisation and AI are crucial in expediting this sustainable transformation.

These technologies facilitate predictive modelling, improved decision-making and traceability throughout the value chain.

For example, one manufacturer with 8,000 suppliers and 350,000 product references used an automated product carbon footprint system to develop a thorough decarbonisation roadmap. “Digital transformation and AI are a formidable opportunity to get faster and improve decision-making throughout this transformation as they help achieve better designs, more productive assets and more flexible supply chains,” say Cyril and Charlotte in the report.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/390a472582df92980380e0c739298e65:d348d3787c6624b7085c581ca8de0bac/cap-energy.webp.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 07:09:39.551698

Every year, nearly 1.5 million hernia repair surgeries are performed in the United States, making hernia repair one of the most common surgeries for adult men and women. Hernia repair addresses conditions where part of the intestine bulges through weakened abdominal muscles. Left untreated, hernias can lead to pain, digestive troubles, swelling, or infection. Surgical repair is currently the leading effective treatment, with innovation in minimally invasive approaches including mesh technology helping advance patient care.

In the Enable Hernia Repair clinical study, the mean length of hospital stay was 4.7 hours for inguinal patients and 6.7 hours for ventral.

“We’re grateful for the opportunity to partner with clinical teams to treat this common and often painful condition for millions of patients around the world,” said Rajit Kamal, vice president and general manager of Robotic Surgical Technologies within the Surgical business of Medtronic. “Adding a digitally-powered robotic-assisted surgery system to our laparoscopic and open surgery solutions for hernia repair gives surgeons more choice and patients greater access to the care they need — and we believe that’s a win for everyone.”

The study builds on the growing body of evidence for Hugo including the Expand URO U.S. clinical study, which also met safety and effectiveness endpoints, and nearly 300 independent publications by surgeons using the Hugo RAS system.

Born out of Medtronic’s 75-year commitment to expanding access to minimally invasive surgical options worldwide in partnership with clinicians, the Hugo RAS system is clinically used in 30+ countries on five continents.

In the U.S., the company’s submission for a urology indication is under review by the Food and Drug Administration, with a U.S. urology indication expected later in the company’s current fiscal year, followed by planned indication expansions into hernia repair and gynecology.

The Medtronic Hugo RAS system is commercially available in certain geographies. Regulatory requirements of individual countries and regions will determine approval, clearance, or market availability. In the EU, the Hugo RAS system is CE marked. In the U.S., the Hugo RAS system is an investigational device not for sale.",https://med-techinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Medtronic.png,N,,2025-09-10 08:06:40.498850

How is Bharti AXA Life using digital marketing, social media, or influencer-led campaigns to educate and build trust with first-time insurance buyers?","Winning the trust of first-time insurance buyers in India is a challenge that goes far beyond offering a competitive premium. Today’s early-career professionals expect simplicity, speed, and transparency at every step from choosing a plan to renewing a policy or filing a claim. They are digital-first, budget-conscious, and accustomed to the seamless experiences offered by fintech apps and e-commerce platforms.

Nitin Mehta, Chief Distribution Officer – Partnership Distribution at Bharti AXA Life Insurance, shares how the company is reimagining insurance for this new generation. Through strategic partnerships with fintech players and online aggregators, a robust digital servicing platform, and AI-driven underwriting, Bharti AXA Life is making insurance products more accessible and affordable than ever. Add to this modular plan designs, instant policy loans, and influencer-led awareness campaigns, and it’s clear that the company’s approach is as much about building trust as it is about selling policies.

Digital platforms have significantly transformed how young families discover and purchase insurance. How has Bharti AXA Life Insurance leveraged mobile apps and online aggregators to enhance accessibility and engagement for early-career professionals?

We at Bharti AXA Life have embraced digital platforms to make insurance more accessible for early-career professionals and everyone. We have strategically leveraged mobile apps and online aggregators to enhance accessibility and engagement for this cohort by focusing on convenience, transparency, and a user-centric experience. We partnered with aggregators like Policy Bazaar fintechs like Airtel Payment Bank and also consumer digital platforms like Tata Digital to offer our products and services on their platforms extending our reach. We also have our own customer digital platform that gives the customer a 360-degree view of their portfolio with us along with 18 digital servicing options. Features like in-app notifications and alerts prevent policyholders from missing renewal dates, reminding them of fund values in their ULIP policies etc.

Micro-insurance products are gaining traction among price-sensitive segments. How is technology helping Bharti AXA Life design and deliver affordable, personalised plans that align with the needs of young professionals just starting their financial journeys?

Technology enables insurers to offer modular and “pick-and-choose” insurance products. Instead of a rigid, one-size-fits-all policy, young professionals can select specific riders and benefits that align with their current needs and financial constraints. For example, they can start with a basic term life plan and add riders for critical illness or disability as their income and responsibilities grow. Our product offerings enable such flexible choices for customers and our technology platforms enable the customer to add such riders at any point in their policy term digitally as per their need and convenience.

Could you share how Bharti AXA Life is utilising AI to assess risk more accurately and reduce costs, thereby making insurance more attractive to budget-conscious customers?

We use AI enabled self-learning models to assess risk at the time of on-boarding which curates customer provided data as well as data from other sources like IIB, Crisil and many more. This helps us detect anomalies, fraud, early claim and/or renewal propensity enabling us to take more informed and efficient underwriting decisions. On-boarding reduced risky business reduces claim rate as well as early claims thereby improving reserve ratios and enabling us to do competitive pricing. This helps in offering attractive premium rates to today’s budget conscious customers.

How is Bharti AXA Life using digital marketing, social media, or influencer-led campaigns to educate and build trust with first-time insurance buyers?

We are leveraging social media and PR in building awareness and establishing the importance of life insurance. In the past, we have leveraged a key influencer and done a series of videos which provides step-by-step guidance on why one should consider investing in life insurance and demystifying the myths around it

With the growth of fintech and insurtech ecosystems, how is Bharti AXA collaborating with digital payment platforms or fintech players to offer flexible, seamless insurance experiences tailored to the financial behavior of young Indian families?

We have partnered with multiple insurtech and fintech firms to offer very unique products and services offerings. We work with digital marketplaces like policy bazaar, fintech platforms like Airtel Payments Bank to offer our products and services through their platforms. We are also working with other digital platforms like Tata Digital to offer our products to all customers on their platform. Apart from this we continue to work on providing unique offerings on our own mobile platform – DigiServe. One of the most recent offerings rolled out on this platform is disbursal of loan against policy to customer’s bank account in less than 60 seconds for our policy holders with ZERO documentation.

In what ways has Bharti AXA Life responded to the post-COVID shift in customer expectations, especially in terms of digital onboarding, quick policy issuance, and claims processing?

COVID has been a great catalyst for our digital transformation. Currently our digital presence and service capabilities have gone far beyond fulfilling just customer expectations. We have achieved 100% digital on-boarding in FY-24 with our straight through processing clocking ~60%. We deliver 93% of our customer servicing digitally and maintain a stellar claim settlement ratio of 99.18% with 48 hours fund value guarantee and one day settlement for eligible claims through our Claim Express Service. However, our digital footprint extends further and impacts other stakeholders like we are doing 100% digital seller on-boarding, faster digital weekly commission payout, on-boarding new partners in two weeks.

Looking ahead, what role do you see emerging technologies like blockchain or embedded insurance playing in further improving access and affordability for the next generation of insurance buyers in India?

Technologies like blockchain and embedded insurance are poised to play a transformative role in making insurance more accessible and affordable for India’s next generation of buyers. Blockchain brings in transparency that can help reduce fraudulent claims, which will contribute to better pricing thereby bringing down the premiums. It can gain greater confidence in the claims process, a significant concern for young consumers who distrust traditional financial institutions. However, the application has yet to pick up speed in India.

Embedded Insurance by offering a small, contextual policy at the moment of truth is a game-changer for a generation that values convenience and is often underinsured. This model removes the traditional need for a separate insurance agent or a lengthy application process. The insurance purchase is a frictionless, opt-in option that takes seconds, aligning perfectly with the digital-first habits of young buyers. It has the potential to really derive the value of insurance in India reaching the vast, underserved population in India’s tier-2 and tier-3 cities. By partnering with popular local platforms, from fintech apps to e-commerce sites, insurers can reach a wider audience and introduce them to the concept of insurance in a familiar and trusted environment.",,N,,2025-09-10 09:10:59.925807

-- ArcelorMittalâs Phase II Expansion Marks a New Chapter

Liberia witnessed a milestone as President Joseph Nyuma Boakai joined ArcelorMittal Executive Chairman Lakshmi N. Mittal to inaugurate West Africaâs largest and most technologically advanced iron ore concentrator in Tokadeh, Nimba County.

The $1.8 billion project represents the centerpiece of ArcelorMittal Liberiaâs Phase II expansion, which quadruples annual production capacity from 5 million tonnes to 20 million tonnes. The state-of-the-art concentrator upgrades lower-grade ore into premium magnetite concentrate, boosting both output and efficiency.

âThis achievement is a testament to our long-term commitment to Liberia,â said Mr. Mittal during the ceremony. âBy increasing production fourfold, we reaffirm our belief in Liberiaâs growth, its people, and its promise.â

The expansion includes the rehabilitation of the 243-kilometer railway linking Tokadeh to the Port of Buchanan and the construction of a deep-water pier equipped with advanced ore-handling systems. These upgrades modernize Liberiaâs logistics backbone, opening new opportunities for both domestic and regional trade.

President Boakai highlighted the national impact: âThis expansion tells the world that Liberia is ready for investment, ready for jobs, ready for prosperity. Thousands of jobs have been created, and more than 1,000 permanent positions are emerging. This project proves that our economy is rising, and our people are rising with it.â

ArcelorMittal Liberia employs nearly 9,000 people, 81 percent of whom are Liberians. With Phase II operations, that figure is expected to grow further. The companyâs Advanced Vocational Training Center in Yekepa continues to produce skilled technicians and mining professionals, equipping young Liberians with the expertise needed for leadership roles in the sector.

Beyond mining operations, ArcelorMittal Liberia contributes to education, healthcare, and small-business development in host communities across Nimba, Bong, and Grand Bassa counties. Renovated schools, upgraded clinics, and support for entrepreneurs form part of a long-term strategy to ensure that growth reaches everyday citizens.

âInvesting in infrastructure and communities is just as important as our mining operations,â noted the companyâs CEO. âOur mission is to help build a stronger Liberia, creating jobs, improving public services, and leaving a legacy of sustainable growth for generations to come.â

ArcelorMittal Liberia received the award for Best Mining Company in Liberia of 2025 from Best of Best Review. The recognition highlights the companyâs leadership, sustainability efforts, and transformative role in national development.

Elias Shoniyin, CEO of ADMA, emphasized the significance of this recognition: âThe award reflects ArcelorMittal Liberiaâs contribution to job creation, infrastructure development, and economic recovery. It acknowledges the companyâs role in shaping Liberia into a competitive player in the global mining industry.â

Looking ahead, ArcelorMittal is exploring options to expand annual capacity to 30 million tonnes and develop Direct Reduction Iron (DRI)-grade concentrate, a critical input for low-carbon steelmaking. This aligns Liberia with global decarbonization efforts, positioning the country as a future supplier for green steel production.

The concentratorâs commissioning has not only reinforced Liberiaâs place in global mining but also marked a turning point in the countryâs post-conflict recovery. With billions in investment, thousands of jobs, and modernized infrastructure, Liberia is moving from being resource-rich to opportunity-rich.

ArcelorMittal Liberia, a subsidiary of ArcelorMittal, the worldâs leading steel and mining company, has operated in Liberia since 2006. As the nationâs largest private-sector employer and a leading taxpayer, the company is committed to responsible mining, workforce development, and sustainable community investment.

L'Oréal, alineado con Europa Con más de 4.000 investigadores y 6.400 expertos tecnológicos y digitales en el mundo, L’Oréal Groupe quiere situarse a la vanguardia de la sostenibilidad en la industria.","L’Oréal Groupe encara la recta final de su convocatoria para captar proyectos con su Aceleradora de Innovación Sostenible. La multinacional, que ha destinado 100 millones de euros al programa durante cinco años, mantiene hasta el 30 de septiembre el plazo para que startups, pymes y empresas consolidadas presenten soluciones.

La compañía busca impulsar la transición de la industria de la cosmética hacia un modelo más sostenible, bajo en carbono y respetuoso con la biodiversidad, al tiempo que fomenta la colaboración con el ecosistema emprendedor.

""Buscamos acelerar nuestra transformación para cumplir con nuestros ambiciosos objetivos de 2030; reinventar la experiencia de belleza a través de la Beauty Tech; y mantenernos a la vanguardia, con tecnologías que nos permitan seguir siendo líderes y definir el futuro del sector"", explica Juan Alonso de Lomas, CEO de L’Oréal España, a Invertia.

La Aceleradora de Innovación Sostenible se desarrolla en colaboración con el Instituto de Liderazgo en Sostenibilidad de la Universidad de Cambridge (CISL), que aportará su red internacional de expertos y su experiencia en desarrollo empresarial sostenible para acelerar la llegada al mercado de las soluciones más prometedoras.

El ecosistema nacional, con potencial

Juan Alonso de Lomas subraya que España cuenta con los ingredientes para convertirse en un actor clave: “Un talento científico y técnico de primer nivel, excelentes universidades y centros de investigación, y una creciente especialización en áreas como biotecnología, energías renovables, circularidad y digitalización"".

En este sentido, el grupo asegura que a lo largo de esta convocatoria espera encontrar proyectos y talento que ayuden a liderar el cambio en ámbitos como el desarrollo de nuevos ingredientes, soluciones para la gestión del agua o las denominadas green sciences (ciencias verdes).

Este último término resume un cambio radical en la investigación cosmética: implica reemplazar o complementar los procesos químicos tradicionales con fórmulas inspiradas en la naturaleza, con bajo impacto ambiental y alta eficiencia.

""España puede tener un papel protagonista en esta aceleradora”, añade el directivo. El objetivo de la misma no es solo económico, sino estratégico: ""El retorno que buscamos es la capacidad de cocrear el futuro de la belleza para que L'Oréal Groupe siga siendo tan relevante y pionero en los próximos cien años como lo ha sido hasta ahora"".

Entre los casos de éxito previos, L’Oréal ya ha colaborado con startups como Gjosa, creadora de un cabezal de ducha capaz de reducir hasta un 69% el consumo de agua, o ModiFace, especializada en herramientas de prueba virtual de maquillaje y coloración capilar.

Ambas iniciativas combinan sostenibilidad y tecnología para reinventar la experiencia del consumidor y reducir el impacto ambiental del sector.

Tecnologías para la belleza del futuro

La aceleradora forma parte del plan L’Oréal for the Future, que persigue integrar la sostenibilidad en toda la cadena de valor: desde los ingredientes hasta el packaging, desde la producción hasta las formas de consumo.

El grupo ya está trabajando en soluciones disruptivas que combinan ciencia, tecnología y naturaleza.

El titán del beauty galo colabora con empresas biotecnológicas como Debut, con sede en Estados Unidos, para desarrollar ingredientes bioidénticos esenciales que permitirán crear productos con menor impacto.

A nivel local, con la española Presto Ibérica ha creado un sensor que permite graduar la temperatura del agua para promover un uso más inteligente y eficiente de la misma.

Paralelamente, L'Oréal está volcada en innovaciones como los BioPods, jardines verticales controlados por inteligencia artificial que permiten cultivar ingredientes durante todo el año.

Estos replican las condiciones climáticas óptimas para cada especie vegetal, maximizando la producción de principios activos y reduciendo la presión sobre los ecosistemas naturales.

Otro proyecto expuesto en Le Visionnaire —sede ubicada en París en la que el grupo dio a conocer sus últimos avances en materia de sostenibilidad este verano— es Osmobloom.

Creado con Cosmo International Fragrances, el sistema permite capturar las moléculas aromáticas de las flores sin dañarlas, abriendo la puerta a fragancias más auténticas, éticas y sostenibles.

Un ecosistema en transformación

La aceleradora de L’Oréal Groupe no solo busca financiar proyectos, sino también crear un ecosistema global de innovación sostenible.

El programa incluye un acompañamiento de hasta 12 meses con expertos del CISL y de L’Oréal para que las startups puedan validar sus soluciones, medir su impacto y escalar su modelo de negocio a nivel internacional. Las áreas en las que pueden inscribirse los interesados son amplias:

Soluciones con bajo impacto de carbono y adaptadas al cambio climático

Resiliencia hídrica

Propuestas basadas en la naturaleza, ingredientes y materiales alternativos

Eliminación del uso de plásticos fósiles y de residuos plásticos

Circularidad y gestión de recursos

Modelos de negocio sostenibles e inclusivos

Este enfoque es paralelo a una demanda creciente de los consumidores. Según datos internos de L’Oréal, el 78% de los usuarios quiere productos más sostenibles, pero muchos no saben cómo integrarlos en su rutina.

La compañía ve en la tecnología a una vía para cerrar esa brecha y ofrecer soluciones que combinen eficacia, transparencia y respeto por el medioambiente. Y, en esta hoja de ruta, las startups son un pilar fundamental.

En palabras del director ejecutivo para España y Portugal, ""tenemos un fuerte compromiso con el modelo de investigación y la innovación 'abierta', y las vemos como socias estratégicas que nos aportan agilidad, disrupción y perspectivas frescas, elementos cruciales en el dinámico sector de la belleza"".

L'Oréal, alineado con Europa

Con más de 4.000 investigadores y 6.400 expertos tecnológicos y digitales en el mundo, L’Oréal Groupe quiere situarse a la vanguardia de la sostenibilidad en la industria.

Sus objetivos se alinean con el Pacto Verde Europeo, con metas concretas como reducir en un 57% las emisiones directas para 2030 y lograr que todos sus centros en Europa funcionen con energía 100% renovable.

Además, la multinacional ha lanzado iniciativas para reducir la huella digital de su publicidad y fomentar modelos de negocio circulares, como el #JoinTheRefillMovement, que promueve la recarga de perfumes, cremas y champús para reducir el uso de envases de un solo uso.

Ante la urgencia climática actual, ""nos estamos quedando sin tiempo, necesitamos acelerar"", subrayan desde la compañía, convencidos de que la colaboración con el ecosistema emprendedor será clave para alcanzar estos ambiciosos objetivos.

La primera convocatoria de la aceleradora se cierra en pocas semanas, pero L'Oréal Groupe espera que sea solo el comienzo de una nueva etapa de alianzas entre la gran industria y las startups.",https://s2.elespanol.com/2025/09/07/actualidad/1003743915064_258516684_1706x960.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 08:06:30.931546

For H&M Group, the Fall/Winter 2025 rebranding represents both a defensive maneuver and an offensive strategy to reclaim relevance in a fragmented market. By blending cutting-edge product innovation with a recalibrated sustainability narrative, the Swedish retailer is attempting to redefine its value proposition in an era where ethical consumption and design excellence are no longer optional but expected.

Product Innovation and Rebranding: Bridging Fast Fashion and High-End Appeal

H&M's Fall/Winter 2025 collection introduces technologies such as HEATTECH, PUFFTECH, and AIRism, which aim to merge functionality with style. These innovations—designed to regulate temperature, enhance insulation, and improve breathability—signal a departure from the brand's traditional fast-fashion identity, positioning it as a purveyor of value-driven technical apparelH&M's Big Bet on Fashion's Elusive Middle[ 1 ]. Complementing this is the appointment of Glenn Martens as creative collaborator for AW25, a move that injects high-fashion credibility into the brand's offerings. Martens' collaboration, coupled with the launch of an elevated ""Atelier"" collection for men and the phasing out of virgin down by 2025, underscores H&M's ambition to attract consumers seeking both quality and sustainabilityH&M - FashionNetwork.com Worldwide[ 5 ].

The rebranding also includes a physical and digital overhaul. Plans to renovate 250 stores and deploy pop-up activations in key markets aim to create immersive shopping experiences, while RFID technology and a redesigned website will streamline inventory management and customer engagementH&M's Big Bet on Fashion's Elusive Middle[ 1 ]. These efforts align with broader industry trends emphasizing omnichannel integration, as highlighted in Fast Fashion Trends 2025Fast Fashion Trends 2025: Key Shifts & Insights[ 2 ].

Sustainability Strategies: Progress, Paradoxes, and Public Skepticism

H&M's sustainability roadmap for 2025 includes a 56% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2040H&M Group Reports Sustainability Progress in Retail Operations 2024[ 3 ]. The company has also increased the share of recycled materials in its products to 29.5% in 2024, nearing its 30% targetH&M Group Reports Sustainability Progress in Retail Operations 2024[ 6 ]. Initiatives like agrivoltaics in Bangladesh and AI-powered garment sorting systems further demonstrate its commitment to circularityH&M Group Reports Sustainability Progress in Retail Operations 2024[ 3 ]. However, these efforts are shadowed by persistent allegations of greenwashing. Critics argue that H&M's ""Conscious"" collections and environmental scorecards have historically overstated sustainability benefits while failing to address systemic issues like labor rights and the environmental toll of its fast-fashion modelFast Fashion Trends 2025: Key Shifts & Insights[ 2 ].

The tension between H&M's aspirational goals and its operational reality is stark. While the brand has localized production to reduce emissions and improve responsivenessH&M Group Reports Sustainability Progress in Retail Operations 2024[ 3 ], its reliance on low-cost, high-volume manufacturing remains at odds with long-term sustainability. As noted in How Ethical Is H&M?, the company has yet to ensure living wages across its supply chainFast Fashion Trends 2025: Key Shifts & Insights[ 2 ]. This duality risks eroding consumer trust, particularly among Gen Z and Millennial shoppers who prioritize authenticityH&M - FashionNetwork.com Worldwide[ 5 ].

Financial Performance and Market Position: A Delicate Balancing Act

H&M's financials reflect both resilience and vulnerability. For FY24, the company reported a 10% sales growth and a 12% increase in operating profitH&M Group Reports Sustainability Progress in Retail Operations 2024[ 3 ]. However, Q1 2025 results revealed a 37% year-over-year decline in operating profit to SEK 1.2 billion, attributed to markdowns and supply chain disruptionsH&M Trend Dresses: Balancing Fast Fashion & ...[ 7 ]. Inventory levels rose by 9%, signaling overstocking challengesH&M Trend Dresses: Balancing Fast Fashion & ...[ 7 ]. These figures highlight the difficulty of transitioning from a volume-driven model to one prioritizing profitability and sustainability.

The Fall/Winter 2025 rebranding is positioned as a solution to this dilemma. By emphasizing premium price points (e.g., $200 faux-fur coats alongside $15 basics) and reducing reliance on discounts, H&M aims to stabilize margins while appealing to a broader demographicH&M's Big Bet on Fashion's Elusive Middle[ 1 ]. Yet, analysts caution that the ""middle market"" strategy—sandwiched between luxury aspirants and ultra-fast fashion—is inherently precarious. As Business of Fashion notes, H&M must convince consumers that its offerings are both aspirational and affordable, a tightrope walk in an era of polarized spending habitsH&M's Big Bet on Fashion's Elusive Middle[ 1 ].

Expert Analysis: Risks and Opportunities in a Transformed Sector

Third-party evaluations of H&M's rebranding efforts underscore a mix of optimism and skepticism. On one hand, the brand's investment in circularity—such as its Pre-Loved secondhand platform and Lab innovation hub—aligns with growing demand for sustainable consumptionFast Fashion Trends 2025: Key Shifts & Insights[ 2 ]. On the other, the Business of Fashion's 2022 Sustainability Index gave H&M a score of 28/100, citing insufficient transparency in addressing environmental and social challenges2nd Edition of Business of Fashion's Sustainability Index[ 8 ]. This gap between ambition and execution could hinder long-term growth.

Moreover, H&M's new CEO, Daniel Ervér, faces the daunting task of reconciling profitability with sustainability. His focus on a 10% operating margin target and store network optimizationPREVIEW H&M's new boss Erver faces battle to reboot sales[ 4 ] suggests a pragmatic approach, but the success of these strategies will depend on execution.

Conclusion: A Catalyst for Growth or a Fleeting Revival?

H&M's Fall/Winter 2025 rebranding encapsulates the broader challenges facing the retail sector: how to innovate without compromising ethics, how to compete in a polarized market, and how to align with consumer values without falling into performative sustainability. While the company's technological advancements and design collaborations offer a compelling value proposition, its ability to sustain growth will hinge on addressing systemic issues in its supply chain and business model.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-10 10:12:54.708717

The $46 billion union that once represented a grand vision for the food industry is now being dismantled, leaving investors to question whether this represents a strategic masterstroke or an admission of fundamental failure.

Market Reaction and Historical Context

The announcement sent Kraft Heinz shares tumbling 6.4% in Tuesday's trading session, marking the most significant single-day decline since May 2022. This unanimous board decision effectively dismantles the original vision championed by Warren Buffett and 3G Capital, proposing a tax-free separation of the business into distinct entities.

The move comes against a troubling backdrop: Kraft Heinz stock has lost approximately 60% of its value since the 2015 merger, with the company continuing to struggle against declining sales and substantial debt burdens. The separation now appears designed to salvage value where consolidation ultimately failed to deliver.

The New Corporate Structure

Under the proposed split, two distinct companies will emerge with clearly defined portfolios. The first entity, temporarily designated ""Global Taste Elevation Co.,"" will incorporate the faster-growing international brands including Heinz Ketchup, Philadelphia cream cheese, and Kraft Mac & Cheese. This division generated $15.4 billion in 2024 revenue, with emerging markets contributing 20% of its sales, positioning it as the growth engine of the separation.

The second company, ""North American Grocery Co.,"" will focus on traditional U.S. household brands including Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles, and Lunchables. Despite generating $10.4 billion in annual revenue, this segment is viewed as having limited growth potential—a primary source of investor skepticism regarding the separation.

Divergent Analyst Perspectives

Wall Street analysts have expressed conflicting views on the strategic move. Morgan Stanley surprisingly upgraded Kraft Heinz from ""underweight"" to ""equal weight"" while raising its price target to $29. Analyst Megan Alexander suggested the negative thesis had ""largely played out"" and that current estimates appeared ""more realistic.""

In contrast, Mizuho analyst John Baumgartner maintained a cautious stance, noting that while the separation might establish a ""floor under the stock,"" fundamental growth concerns would likely constrain significant upside potential.

Execution Challenges and Timeline

The corporate divorce carries substantial financial implications, including approximately $300 million in annual additional costs resulting from lost synergies. The separation also represents one of the most significant corporate splits in recent memory, introducing considerable execution risk during the transition period.

The transaction is scheduled for completion in the second half of 2026, providing ample time for further market volatility as details emerge. Whether this radical move will ultimately create two stronger competitors or simply formalize the breakdown of a failed vision remains uncertain.

Price rollbacks have helped Walmart maintain its shopper value proposition, with the number of rollbacks in grocery, for example, up 30% versus a year earlier.
“Hopefully, things get settled sooner rather than later and at lower rates than what’s being discussed right now.
And we have to be thoughtful about things like higher price points.
If you pass on the entire impact of a tariff at a higher price point, it can put it out a range, and you really see a unit decline.","NEW YORK — Expect consumers to feel pressured through the rest of this year – and maybe into next year – as tariffs fuel an inflationary environment and stir shopper uncertainty, Doug McMillon, president and chief executive officer of Walmart, told the investment community at the Goldman Sachs Global Retailing Conference.

“If you look at the middle to upper income levels, we’re seeing strong demand, and if you look at middle to lower, there has been a little bit of stress,” McMillon said in a fireside chat at the investor event in New York. “We’ve seen behavioral change on items that have gone up in cost because of tariffs, where they’re switching from one item to the other – some of the behavioral stuff that you always see during times of pressure.”

When reporting fiscal 2026 second-quarter results two weeks ago, Walmart executives described consumers as hard-pressed but exhibiting consistent shopping behavior, with no pronounced shifts thus far in response to tariffs.

“Generally speaking, people have held up really well, and we expect the same thing to happen for the balance of the year,” McMillon said at the conference. “This quarter started off in the same strong fashion on the top line, so we’re continuing to see what happened in the second quarter spill into the third quarter.”

Walmart US second-quarter net sales climbed 4.8% year over year, reflecting strong growth in the grocery and health-and-wellness categories plus a 26% jump in e-commerce sales. Comparable sales excluding fuel gained 4.6%, aided by upticks in average ticket size and transaction count. Price rollbacks have helped Walmart maintain its shopper value proposition, with the number of rollbacks in grocery, for example, up 30% versus a year earlier.

“US inflation is low single digits; that doesn’t tell the whole story,” McMillon explained to investors. “If you look at what’s happened in the food categories, particularly prepared foods, processed foods, dry grocery, stuff like that, we’ve seen prices go up for multiple years now. So absolute pricing levels in food are higher than we want them to be and higher than what American families would want it to be.

“And then on the general merchandise side, we saw prices go up as supply chains got stretched after the pandemic, and then GM (general merchandise) prices came down. What’s happened more recently – because of what’s happening with tariffs – is we’ve seen a steady march up, kind of a gradual increase, as it relates to our cost levels in general merchandise, which has created the single-digit inflation that we find ourselves dealing with now.”

Price elasticity has been “better than I thought” in the current consumer environment, according to McMillon.

“When items go up, we see units go down in some corresponding fashion as people switch to other items,” he said. “Customers are really smart and rational, and they move from one item to another from one category to another as they see prices change.”

Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2026, Walmart lifted its adjusted earnings-per-share estimates at the bottom and top ends by 2¢, to between $2.52 and $2.62. Its net sales growth forecast was raised by three-quarters of a percentage point at both ends, to between 3.75% and 4.75%.

“For the balance of the year, we would say it’s the same, and I think next year we’ll see this cost pressure that’s flowing through the system play out over time,” McMillon said. “So far, it has been gradual and, therefore, the impact has been somewhat muted. So, it’s not a situation where I can tell you when things are going to be different. And in fact, if they are, I think consistency is the answer.”

Tariffs will tell much of the tale in terms of the elasticity response to pricing actions, McMillon said. Less than a third of what Walmart sells in the United States is imported, with China, Mexico, Vietnam, India and Canada being the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer’s biggest markets.

“It depends on the tariff level, of course, and what happens with countries like India,” he said. “Hopefully, things get settled sooner rather than later and at lower rates than what’s being discussed right now. We’d like a quick resolution and overall lower rates. Customers are going to be rational. And we have to be thoughtful about things like higher price points. If you pass on the entire impact of a tariff at a higher price point, it can put it out a range, and you really see a unit decline. So, we do things like spread within categories and across categories within GM to help manage that, trying to protect food prices and keep some separation there.”",https://www.meatpoultry.com/ext/resources/2025/09/09/Walmart-Lead_adst_Sundry-Photography.jpg?height=635&t=1757436288&width=1200,N,,2025-09-10 09:12:05.262880

There are 113 Game stores in Africa, 100 of which are in South Africa.
There are 37 Cash & Carry stores in the country, 27 in South Africa with other locations in Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia and Zambia.
There are 7 Jumbo stores in South Africa that sell clothing, food and consumer goods.","Walmart, the sole owner of South African retailer Massmart, plans to open Walmart branded stores in South Africa later this year. The retailer noted the action at its first Growth Summit in Sub-Saharan Africa in April.

The event featured suppliers from 12 African countries with innovations and products that are made, grown, or assembled in Africa. Walmart said the event resulted in the recruitment of small- to medium-sized African-based suppliers.

“Walmart’s South African stores will offer a wide range of merchandise, including fresh groceries, household essentials, apparel and technology,” said Kath McLay, CEO of Walmart International. “Walmart will also offer a variety of locally sourced products. By partnering with South African suppliers and entrepreneurs, Walmart will bring its signature Every Day Low Prices and global standards to the market, while celebrating the country’s rich culture.”

With sites already in development, Walmart said the new stores are set to open before the end of the year. The official opening dates and location details will be released in October. Walmart said its business in South Africa will include online commerce.

Walmart acquired a 51% interest in Massmart in 2011 for $2.3 billion. But in August 2023, Walmart purchased the outstanding shares for $377.6 million, giving it full ownership over the business. Civil unrest throughout areas of Africa and a volatile economic climate over the years had Walmart re-evaluate its business interests on the continent in 2019. Several management changes and a slow build-out for stores in underserved countries ensued.

Walmart brought in new Massmart management in March, with Miles Van Rensburg becoming CEO, the fourth CEO in six years. Massmart announced in June three more executive changes for its Makro, Game, and Cash & Carry businesses.

Walmart/Massmart owns and operates 302 retail units in Africa under the Builders, Cambridge, Cash & Carry, Jumbo, Makro and Rhino store banners. Builders is based in South Africa and is a home improvement and materials company that operates warehouses, express and superstore formats at 120 locations.

Game is a discount retailer that focuses on appliances, electronics, lifestyle merchandise, groceries, liquor and some services. There are 113 Game stores in Africa, 100 of which are in South Africa. The Makro stores are similar to a Sam’s Club format, selling food, liquor and general merchandise to retail and wholesale customers. There are 23 Makro locations, all of which are in South Africa.

There are 37 Cash & Carry stores in the country, 27 in South Africa with other locations in Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia and Zambia. Like Makro, the Cash & Carry format sells food and general merchandise for commercial and wholesale customers. There are 7 Jumbo stores in South Africa that sell clothing, food and consumer goods.",https://talkbusiness.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/massmart-builders.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 22:11:26.683810

Fifth Third Bank said Tuesday that the Treasury Department's Bureau of Fiscal Service has designated the Cincinnati-based lender as the next financial agent for the U.S. government's Direct Express prepaid debit card program.

The decision marks a reversal from last November, when the Fiscal Service Bureau said that it had selected The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. as the program's financial agent.

A BNY spokesperson said in an email late Tuesday that the New York-based bank was selected in November 2024 ""along with a group of additional new service providers,"" and that the Fiscal Service Bureau ""made the decision to discontinue the agreement"" as a result of ""readiness challenges involving one of the providers.""

Fifth Third and the Treasury Department did not provide additional comment on the demise of the BNY agreement.

Fifth Third said in a press release that it has reached a five-year agreement with the Fiscal Service Bureau, and that the agreement started on Tuesday. The bureau's earlier agreement with BNY was also for five years, according to a November 2024 press release, and had been scheduled to start on Jan. 3, 2025.

As of Tuesday evening, the Fiscal Service Bureau had not posted a new press release to its website. But Fifth Third's own release included a quote from the bureau's commissioner, Tim Gribben.

""Direct Express plays a critical role in delivering federal benefits payments electronically, especially lifeline payments such as Social Security and Veterans benefits,"" Gribben said in Fifth Third's release.

Gribben, who previously worked at the U.S. Postal Service and the U.S. Small Business Administration, was appointed commissioner of the Fiscal Service Bureau in May 2019, according to the bureau's website.

Fifth Third said in its release that the Fiscal Service Bureau ""determined that Fifth Third has the vision and capability to expand the Direct Express program over the five-year term to deliver compelling mobile applications and digital options designed to provide frictionless value for millions of debit card recipients.""

""This transition marks a step forward in the Fiscal Service's mission to provide a modern, seamless and secure payment experience for federal benefit recipients,"" Fifth Third said.

The Direct Express program provides prepaid debit cards that enable roughly 3.4 million Americans, most of whom do not have a bank account, to receive monthly federal benefits, according to Fifth Third.

The banking unit of the $210 billion-asset Fifth Third Bancorp said in its release that it plans to ""offer recipients more freedom and convenience to access federal benefits with new or enhanced solutions such as virtual cards, cardless ATM access, rent and other bill payment services, digital wallet integration and more.""

""We're focused on delivering secure, high-quality financial services that make banking more accessible for millions of Americans,"" said Bridgit Chayt, head of commercial payments at Fifth Third, in the release.

Fifth Third also said that Money Network Financial, LLC, will serve as Direct Express' program manager, and that the program will continue to run on Mastercard's network, as it has since 2008.

The Direct Express program faced problems under its previous financial agent, Comerica Bank. Dallas-based Comerica faced allegations that it shared sensitive consumer data with vendors and failed to reimburse government beneficiaries who claimed their benefits had been stolen due to fraud.

Also on Tuesday, Fifth Third disclosed that it recently discovered what it characterized as ""alleged fraudulent activity"" in connection with a commercial borrower's asset-backed finance loan, saying that it expects to take a non-cash impairment charge of $170 million-$200 million in the third quarter.

The loan in question has an unpaid principal balance of roughly $200 million, Fifth Third said in a securities filing. The bank added that it ""is working with the appropriate law enforcement authorities in connection with this matter.""",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/624cda0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+284/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fa4%2Fd0%2F75d1facf42e1bdcb31ef56282a80%2F397528604.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 22:11:18.480294

Zipline, a San Francisco-based robotics company that designs, manufactures, and operates what it says is the world’s largest autonomous delivery system, has launched service for customers who live near the Walmart Supercenter at 7401 Samuell Blvd., just south of U.S. Highway 80. Shoppers in the area can now get up to 5.5 pounds of goods delivered in minutes by drone.

More than 65,000 items from the store are eligible for delivery in under 20 minutes, the company said. That includes fresh and frozen food, pantry staples, and essentials like baby formula.

Zipline said its all-electric, autonomous aircraft have flown more than 100 million commercial miles across four continents and delivered more than 18 million products.

The Samuell Boulevard location is the seventh Walmart Supercenter in North Texas that now offers Zipline delivery. Other participating stores are in Mesquite, Waxahachie, Kaufman, Greenville, Bedford, and Weatherford.

The company said it has made more than 1.4 million commercial deliveries to date and has safely flown the equivalent of every road in America 24 times without incident.

UnitedHealth expects to have roughly 78% of its Medicare Advantage enrollees in plans rated four stars or above next year, the healthcare behemoth disclosed Tuesday in a securities filing.

The percentage of members in the high-performing plans — which yield valuable bonuses — has stayed largely flat compared to 2025, according to analysts. But it’s still a positive development for UnitedHealth, and a good sign for other managed care companies in MA, many of which have struggled to reach stricter star ratings thresholds.

UnitedHealth’s stock rose roughly 9% over Tuesday’s trade following the disclosure, which also shared that the company plans to reaffirm its 2025 financial guidance in upcoming investor meetings.

Dive Insight:

The CMS rates MA plans from one to five stars based on a complex calculation of metrics that, overall, are meant to represent plan quality. Insurers jockey fiercely for higher ratings, which help their plans stand out for seniors shopping for privatized Medicare coverage — and translate directly to higher revenue from the government.

As such, insurers were generally unhappy with tweaks to star ratings methodology that tamped down on average scores for 2025, including by making it harder to reach the vaunted four-star cutoff. (Plans that receive an overall rating of four or higher receive higher bonus payments, and higher scores also result in larger rebates if plans submit bids below the CMS’ benchmark for the coming year.)

With billions of dollars in payments at stake, multiple insurers sued the government to get their ratings recalculated, with mixed results. And executives and investors in the industry have been waiting anxiously for signs of how the quality scores could come down for 2026. The CMS officially releases stars for the upcoming plan year in October, but allows plans to take a first look at their data. Payers’ second window to check out their preliminary results opened on Tuesday, and UnitedHealth is electing to share its early results with investors.

Having more than three-fourths of its more than 8 million MA members in plans with at least four stars is “consistent with our expectations and in line with historical performance,” UnitedHealth wrote in its securities filing.

Still, the results are better than some investors feared, especially amid concerns that thresholds to reach four stars could increase further for 2026.

“Our biggest takeaway is that we aren’t seeing a material upward shift in stars similar to last year,” J.P. Morgan analyst Lisa Gill wrote in a note Tuesday.

Major health insurers are currently hustling to boost margins in their MA businesses, as higher medical utilization among seniors and unfavorable policy changes cut into once-comfortable profits.

With an eye toward improving margins, payers — including UnitedHealth’s insurance division UnitedHealthcare — are culling unprofitable plans for next year. UnitedHealthcare expects to lose some 600,000 enrollees as a result of the plan exits.

Despite higher MA rates coming down the pike, where star ratings land is another major swing factor for insurers’ margin recovery plans — especially for insurers that have room for improvement in their scores.

Humana, the second-largest MA insurer after UnitedHealthcare, said during a second-quarter call with investors that it expects its star ratings to improve for 2026, though the company doesn’t plan to discuss its results until stars are officially released in October.

Elevance also said it wouldn’t explicitly comment on stars during an investor conference last week, though CFO Mark Kaye said the company was encouraged by its progress. Centene has also said it expects its stars to improve next year.

UnitedHealth, Humana, Elevance, Centene and CVS, the parent company of insurer Aetna, did not respond to a request for comment for this story by time of publication.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/gp7-9yDSiCZQoGHBzNxfophsasMnSZtZnJ8p0ayp8-U/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS91bml0ZWRfaGVhbHRoX2dyb3VwLmpwZWc=.webp,N,,2025-09-09 21:07:23.776192

Which is what Ralph Lauren has done with its latest AI element, with Microsoft’s AI tools powering a new product matching tool that can help users style their looks, based on Ralph Lauren items.
But then again, depending on exactly how it determines product matches, maybe you’ll just end up looking more like a Ralph Lauren model, as opposed to having any individual style.
In terms of specifics, Microsoft doesn’t provide a heap of insight into how the system determines relevant matches, only noting that: “Ask Ralph delivers tailored responses to a user’s prompts, curating outfits and looks from across the Polo Ralph Lauren brand, with all items suggested from available inventory.

Which is what Ralph Lauren has done with its latest AI element, with Microsoft’s AI tools powering a new product matching tool that can help users style their looks, based on Ralph Lauren items.

As explained by Microsoft:

“Ask Ralph is a conversational AI shopping experience built on Azure OpenAI, and available in the Ralph Lauren app in the U.S. You can interact with Ask Ralph just like you would a stylist in a Ralph Lauren store by asking simple, conversational questions or using prompts to find the perfect look for any occasion.”

So if you want to know what goes best with a pair of shoes that you like, or a specific color of shirt, “Ask Ralph” will be able to give you styling notes, based on commonly purchased items, curated looks, what other people have searched for in relation to each item, etc.

Which is kind of personalized, I guess, in that it’s an open prompt, and you can direct how it finds related products. But then again, depending on exactly how it determines product matches, maybe you’ll just end up looking more like a Ralph Lauren model, as opposed to having any individual style.

Though the market demand for that would be high either way, as a lot of people simply want to look their best, and are seeking guidance on how to do that.

In terms of specifics, Microsoft doesn’t provide a heap of insight into how the system determines relevant matches, only noting that:

“Ask Ralph delivers tailored responses to a user’s prompts, curating outfits and looks from across the Polo Ralph Lauren brand, with all items suggested from available inventory. Ask Ralph can also interpret tone, satisfaction, and intent to refine recommendations dynamically. It also adapts to contextual cues like location-based insights or event-driven needs.”

So there’s not a lot of info on how, exactly, the tool decides what fits best with each other item, but presumably, it’s being guided by the factors noted above.

And again, this is what AI is good for, cross-matching large datasets to find commonalities and correlations that are beyond the capacity of other systems. The capacity to translate natural language searches into complex queries for such purpose is a huge benefit, and there are a range of ways that this could help to streamline and improve various actions that relate to such functions.

The stores that remain open will be part of a “focus on growth.”

The Alamosa Safeway store was on a list of stores to be sold under an earlier merger effort between Kroger Co. and Albertsons. That deal, however, fell apart after Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and other attorneys general sued to block the sale and Kroger decided to halt its effort to acquire Albertsons.

Albertsons now has restructured itself in Colorado, leaving the Alamosa and Monte Vista Safeway stores with new life.

“Together, these changes position us to operate in new and innovative ways that foster customer loyalty and drive long-term success,” said Halpape.

Typically, CVS Caremark passes the money from medication discounts and rebates to HealthChoice.
However, according to the State of Oklahoma, CVS was accused of having kept millions of dollars from January 2020 through December 2024.
The settlement agreement reached between the state and CVS Caremark requires the company to pay $32.1 million to the State of Oklahoma.
Roughly $27 million will go to the HealthChoice plan within 30 days.","OKLAHOMA CITY — A $32 million settlement has been reached with CVS Caremark following accusations that the company kept money that belonged to Oklahoma’s state employee health plan.

Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond shared on Tuesday that a settlement had been reached.

“When a company keeps money that belongs to Oklahoma taxpayers, we’re going to fight to get it back,” said Attorney General Drummond. “This settlement ensures that millions of dollars go where they should have gone all along — to benefit our state employees’ healthcare.”

CVS Caremark is a pharmacy benefit manager that handles prescription drug benefits for health plans, such as Oklahoma’s state employee plan HealthChoice.

Typically, CVS Caremark passes the money from medication discounts and rebates to HealthChoice. However, according to the State of Oklahoma, CVS was accused of having kept millions of dollars from January 2020 through December 2024. The company denied those claims.

The settlement agreement reached between the state and CVS Caremark requires the company to pay $32.1 million to the State of Oklahoma. Roughly $27 million will go to the HealthChoice plan within 30 days.

“This settlement ensures millions of dollars will be directed back to the HealthChoice plan, benefitting Oklahoma’s state employees and their families,” said Ellen Buettner, CEO of the Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA). “This recovery underscores OHCA’s commitment to maximizing the value of healthcare benefits for those who serve our state.”

CVS Caremark will also be required to pay any additional rebate amounts from the 2020-2024 period within 90 days, pass all future rebate payments directly to the HealthChoice plan within 90 days of collection, and agree to a broader definition of ‘rebate’ in the state contract.

None of the money collected for the HealthChoice plan will stay with the Attorney General’s Office. All the funds will go back to the state plan.

“These funds should be used to help keep premiums lower for HealthChoice members,” said Drummond. “This recovery reflects our commitment to maximizing benefits for the state employees who serve all Oklahomans and protecting taxpayer dollars that fund these healthcare benefits.”

CVS Caremark denied all accusations but has agreed to the settlement agreement to avoid any further uncertainties in litigation.",https://cmg-cmg-rd-20111-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com%2Fcmg%2FXIQMXHL7D5FMTFHRSGECUUFZT4.jpg?auth=433dd850ae69ec7722e11855859ba13ab37e8f306a427910958c634ffc7bce5c&width=1200&height=630&smart=true,N,,2025-09-10 08:06:14.104432

Residents complained about increased traffic on main and side roads, increased noise and light pollution. In June, the planning commission of Edmond, Oklahoma, denied plans for a 44,000-square-foot Walmart Neighborhood Market grocery store — nearly 100 residents had attended a public meeting to voice concerns.

Still, a Walmart spokesperson told Modern Retail its three newest stores that opened over the last few months in Cypress, Texas; Tuscaloosa, Alabama; and Eagle Mountain, Utah have been celebrated by their respective communities and have attracted crowds of people.

“We are always looking for opportunities to grow and better serve local communities, and we will continue to explore ways to meet the needs of our customers,” the spokesperson said.

In the past, criticism against Walmart has largely centered around how the company treats its employees. From 2012 to 2014, OUR Walmart (Organization United for Respect at Walmart) and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union organized employee walkouts throughout the country, seeking better wages and working conditions for Walmart workers. In 2015, workers in dozens of cities joined the “Fight for $15” movement, walking out and protesting to raise the federal minimum wage.

However, many of the more recent concerns are those often expressed by residents in rural communities or exurbs opposing any new construction near their homes — not anything specific to how Walmart conducts its business.

“I think it applies to any kind of development or project in the community. Even if you’re in a big city or a small town, I think the issues are the same; the neighbors take an interest in what’s going to happen,” said Alice Jump, a partner for law firm Reavis Page Jump LLP in New York City. “I find that most people don’t want change. If they’re happy with their neighborhood, they don’t want something that’s going to change it.”

Mixed reception from neighbors

Comments from neighbors can often range from legitimate concerns to those that are far-flung from reality, Jump said, adding that some will even try to promote conspiracy theories or simply get attention. It’s just part of meeting the public, she noted.

Some in the Iowa town said building a Walmart Supercenter would harm their community’s residential character. Others claimed the store could hurt home values, though a 2012 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research instead found new Walmart stores actually would increase housing prices by up to 3%. In May, the city said the zoning application was still on hold to conduct a traffic survey, according to the NBC affiliate, and the current status remains unclear. Walmart has not broken ground on this project, according to a spokesperson.

“Our community is a peaceful residential area, crafted through years of planning and love. We consciously chose to build and buy in this bedroom community, cherishing the quiet and safe environment,” one nearby resident Clint Rocker wrote in a Change.org petition signed by almost 1,800 people. “The recent proposal to rezone our neighborhood for commercial purposes … threatens our cherished tranquility.”

Another Ankeny resident, Trevor Meeks, said, “If you introduce a big-box retailer right in the middle of a residential area like this, it’s going to create new noise pollution, new light pollution,” per WHO 13. “It’s going to be a lot of trash blowing around. It’s going to create a very large new traffic load.”

In Oklahoma, similar to those in Iowa, Edmond residents wanted to preserve property values, prevent an increase in traffic, and protect the plants and animals on the site. Members of the planning commission raised issues of the architectural compatibility of the proposed Walmart with surrounding structures, according to nonprofit news outlet NonDoc.

During the meeting, NonDoc reported, an attorney for the developers argued that the project met all code requirements and that his client would work with city staff to meet or exceed all city codes related to preservation of nature and lighting.

“What more can a property owner or developer do, other than comply with the rules as prescribed by the city?” the attorney, David Box, asked. “There’s nothing more they can do. To put additional requirements would be absolutely subjective and violate every principle of development and every principle of legal authority that exists for the State of Oklahoma.”

In St. Johns County, Florida, near Jacksonville, some residents in December expressed concerns about adding more development — including a Walmart Supercenter — near a Buc-ee’s travel center and Interstate 95 due to traffic, NBC affiliate First Coast News reported.

“There’s people that don’t even live in this area that already talk bad about how bad it is driving here,” one resident, Cindy Chong, told the broadcaster.

According to First Coast News, entitlements had already been granted in 2003, and the county attorney said nothing could be done to stop the development, though the store itself had yet to be approved. Walmart has not broken ground in St. Johns Country, per a spokesperson.

Jump said that for retailers or developers, bringing in senior executives can help corporations not come off as corporate behemoths and diffuse these sorts of situations. She added that developers may also include public parks or playgrounds to give communities a benefit for approving big projects.

“What developers have to do is prepare the groundwork: Go in with knowledge of the players, in terms of who the people are on the zoning board, or whatever structure there is in the particular area, who have to review or approve it, and maybe engage with with community leaders before there’s any kind of official legal action to be taken,” Jump said. “It’s almost a PR process as much as a legal process. Explain the benefits, maybe diffuse the criticism by being empathetic to what the community is concerned about and addressing that.”

Not all communities have been combative toward Walmart.

For example, the planning commission in Columbia, Tennessee approved construction of a 45,000-square-foot Walmart store. Columbia Vice Mayor Randy McBroom praised the design in a public meeting, according to the Columbia Daily Herald.

“I appreciate the way it looks, because it doesn’t look like a Walmart, but more like a medical building,” McBroom said.

Changing perceptions

Still, Walmart is seeking local approvals in a different environment than it operated in 10 or 15 years ago. The big-box giant has worked to improve its image, both in terms of how it pays employees and the aesthetic of its stores, as well as its brand equity among higher-income shoppers.

“A lot of more affluent shoppers relied on Walmart for e-commerce grocery delivery during the pandemic and have since discovered that Walmart’s not a terrible place to shop,” said Bryan Gildenberg, founder and CEO of Confluencer Commerce, adding that it helps that the company has made its stores — as he describes — more aesthetically pleasing. “As a result, you don’t have the visceral reaction to a Walmart coming that you might if you walked into a Walmart store 30 years ago and found it to be a little bare-bones and underkept for your taste.”

Anne Mezzenga, co-CEO of Omni Talk and a former marketing leader at Target, added that the investments Walmart has made in supply chain infrastructure, store redesigns and marketing … continue to change consumer sentiment around the brand.

“Their deep push into fashion right now — providing consumers really the only place to go right now for reliable low prices and the convenience of a mass retailer, [and] having everything that they would need to purchase in one trip — [have] changed the perception is of Walmart, and I think will continue to change it in the coming years,” Mezzenga said.

The company has also worked on its perception on pay and salaries, promoting opportunities for career advancement and higher salaries, especially in management roles. In 2015, Walmart raised entry-level wages to $9 per hour, and again in 2016 to $10 per hour. By 2021, Walmart increased its average pay to more than $15 an hour, though it kept its minimum starting wage at $11 an hour.

“Walmart, in particular, has worked very hard to reposition themselves as investing in the communities where they are building their stores and the people in those communities,” Mezzenga said. “I think that’s paying off for them now.”

This year, Walmart expanded its 10% employee discount to include most grocery products. The company last year implemented a new bonus for hourly store associates based on how they drive sales and profit. It said earlier this year that market managers can make up to $620,000 after stock grants and bonuses, and in 2024, it raised the average salary for store managers to $128,000 a year.

“In general, retail is no longer the low platform on the toting pole, in terms of pay in a given geography,” Gildenberg said, adding that there are other sectors that wage-related activism now centers on. “If you’re worried about deflating wage costs, which was one of the big pressure points that Walmart got for years, … you’re going to worry about what gig workers are paid.”

Additionally, Gartner retail analyst Brad Jashinsky said that, after the last few years of high inflation, value-focused retailers especially resonate with people in a positive way. “They can accurately say that they’re able to bring in more options, more affordability into these communities,” Jashinsky said.

Another change over the last few decades is the number of companies that are active in small towns, including e-commerce businesses, that now also get a share of negative attention. Even retailers like Target that once stuck closer to big cities have expanded into very rural areas.

“There are a lot more retailers that are coming in, whereas 20, 30 years ago, Walmart would be the big story for a year or two while it was [being] developed and coming into a small town,” Jashinsky said. “The landscape has changed significantly.”",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/03/2025_5-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 22:12:10.747161

HP saw AI PC shipments increase faster than anticipated during the three months ending July 31, despite tariff-related supply chain concerns, CFO Karen Parkhill said Monday at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference.

The premium units accounted for one-quarter of the company’s Q3 2025 shipments, a threshold HP hadn’t expected to surpass until the end of the year, according to Parkhill. HP anticipates AI-optimized PCs will comprise half of its PC business within the next two years.

“AI PCs are a little bit about future-proofing right now,” said Parkhill, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript. “We see CIOs making that decision to refresh their installed base with AI PCs because they don’t want to be outdated in a year or two.”

Dive Insight:

The PC market has been in recovery mode for more than two years, with shipments inching up quarter by quarter after a prolonged, post-pandemic tumble.

Enterprises that invested heavily in hardware to support remote workers in 2020 waited out a looming recession, the arrival of AI PCs and, most recently, the potential effects of a tariff-triggered trade war before embarking on a full refresh.

In the US, shipments were flat during the second quarter, despite a 6.5% year-over-year global increase, according to IDC, as vendors raced to avoid heavy levies.

Adoption of AI PCs slowed during the first half of the year, according to Gartner. Last month, the analyst firm said that AI units will account for less than one-third of global PC sales by the end of the year, down from a prior forecast of 43%.

Prospects for AI PC adoption have been buoyed by a proliferation of portable generative AI apps, modestly sized large language models and task-specific assistants. The broader PC market is being driven by aging enterprise devices and Microsoft’s imminent end-of-support deadline for Windows 10.

“We’re about to move into a COVID-like refresh cycle,” BCG Managing Director and Partner Clark O’Niell told CIO Dive. While O’Niell has yet see a pressing need for PCs with AI processing power, the units are gaining enterprise traction.

“It’s more of a hedge bet right now,” O’Niell said. “You don’t want to be the procurement guy that didn’t invest ahead of the curve for AI.”

HP reduced its exposure to U.S. tariffs by shifting manufacturing locations after President Donald Trump announced the initial regime in April and is bullish on its line of AI PCs and demand for workstations compatible with Windows 11, according to Parkhill.

“We’ve been moving quite rapidly to move our manufacturing and our supply chain outside of China and, by this past quarter, nearly all of the demand that we’ve been fulfilling in the United States has been manufactured outside of China,” said Parkhill. “We’ve moved it to Thailand, Vietnam, Mexico and, the federal business that we have, we produced in the U.S.”

HP saw its revenues increase 3% year over year to $13.9 billion, fueled largely by the ongoing Windows 11 refresh, AI PC adoption and services growth, President and CEO Enrique Lores said during an earnings call last month.

“The key thing behind AI PCs is the fact that over the next quarters, more and more software applications are going to take advantage of the capabilities that the AI PCs have,” Lores said, pointing to Adobe and Zoom apps running AI on PCs.

HP expects AI capabilities to raise the average price of its PCs by 5% to 10% over the next few years.

“AI PCs are premium products,” Parkhill said. “They do carry a higher price and higher margin with them.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/0f_1rFjkjuR8785DBnmfQuJLlxiQFeS1DPHfUpaw5UM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMTc5MDUzMzMyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-09 18:16:42.319412

The scale of geopolitical risk is reshaping strategies, but businesses have demonstrated resilience and adaptability.
As they continue to navigate these turbulent conditions, creativity and foresight will be essential in charting a course through the evolving global M&A landscape.","M&A activity has faced significant challenges over the past five years. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, which caused deal values and volumes to plummet to their lowest levels in decades, companies worldwide have endured a prolonged period of disruption. As the global economy began to recover, soaring interest rates in 2021 prompted many executives to reassess deal economics, slowing activity to near-pandemic lows. Geopolitical uncertainty – particularly the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East – further compounded these challenges by increasing volatility, impacting valuations and tightening financing conditions. The cumulative effect of these pressures has led to a recalibration of corporate ambition. Where bold expansion plans once dominated boardroom agendas, caution and contingency now prevail.

The war in Ukraine, which began in 2022, has disrupted European security and strained global supply chains, leading to higher costs and operational uncertainty for businesses worldwide. Similarly, conflicts in the Middle East have heightened geopolitical risk, contributing to energy market volatility and broader economic instability. These conflicts have not only reshaped regional alliances but have also forced multinational corporations to reconsider their exposure to politically sensitive jurisdictions.

In response to these dynamics – alongside the enduring lessons of the pandemic and mounting climate risks – many businesses are reassessing their M&A strategies. Boards and investment committees are increasingly scrutinising geopolitical risks in acquisitions, joint ventures and supply chains. Across industry surveys and reports, geopolitical risk is now cited as one of the most influential factors shaping investment strategies. This marks a significant shift in corporate governance, where geopolitical literacy is becoming as essential as financial acumen. The boardroom is no longer a sanctuary from global turbulence – it is a frontline for strategic adaptation.

The shift from growth to risk management

Uneven growth forecasts and abundant dry powder are creating both opportunities and challenges. As of December 2024, global dry powder stood at $2.5 trillion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. US funds lead the way, with firms such as KKR and Apollo Global Management each reportedly holding over $40bn. Political and economic turbulence in the US and Europe throughout 2024 – including widespread elections – prompted many dealmakers to pause and reassess. The sheer volume of undeployed capital is both a source of optimism and anxiety: optimism for potential dealmaking, anxiety due to the pressure to deploy it wisely amid uncertainty. Capital is abundant, but confidence is elusive.

Further complicating the landscape, the impact of US tariffs on various countries and trading blocs has undermined market confidence. Financial markets reacted sharply to tariff announcements, introducing volatility that dampened M&A activity. The most notable concern remains the US-China relationship. Tensions escalated during President Trump’s first term and have continued into his second, with the administration supporting intensified protectionist policies. These include higher tariffs on Chinese imports, stricter enforcement of foreign investment regulations under the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, and increased scrutiny of Chinese technology investments. This regulatory tightening has led to a chilling effect on cross-border dealmaking, particularly in sectors deemed strategically sensitive.

From January 2025, US persons and their controlled foreign entities became subject to restrictions when engaging in transactions with foreign persons in “countries of concern” – currently limited to China, including the Hong Kong and Macau special administrative regions – in sensitive sectors such as semiconductors, microelectronics, quantum information technologies and artificial intelligence (AI). The European Commission has expressed interest in implementing a similar regime. If adopted, such measures could signal a new era of transatlantic alignment on investment controls, further fragmenting the global M&A landscape.

Despite these headwinds, deals are still being completed. According to PwC, global M&A volumes declined by 9 percent in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period in 2024, yet deal values rose by 15 percent. Mergermarket data shows that US deal volumes at the start of 2025 fell to their lowest level in over two decades, with only 1100 transactions signed by 18 February – the slowest start since 2003. This divergence between volume and value suggests that while fewer deals are being done, those that proceed are larger, more strategic and more thoroughly vetted. Quality is overtaking quantity as the new metric of deal success.

PwC observed continued activity in companies with a domestic focus and in sectors less exposed to tariffs, such as services. Larger firms with strong cash flow and healthy prospects remain attractive targets. However, companies outside these parameters have struggled. In the US, a PwC Pulse Survey from May 2025 revealed that 30 percent of companies had paused or revisited deals due to tariff uncertainty. Nevertheless, 51 percent of US companies still plan to pursue deals, reflecting a persistent drive to transform and reinvent business models. This resilience underscores the enduring appeal of M&A as a lever for strategic transformation, even in turbulent times.

Boston Consulting Group reported that total global M&A deal value in the first half of 2025 reached $1.1 trillion – a 2 percent decline from the previous six months and below historical averages. Regional disparities were significant. Transactions involving targets in the Americas totalled $724bn, up 23 percent from the second half of 2024. North America, particularly the US, accounted for $685bn, or 62 percent of global deal value. European deal value fell to $201bn, a 14 percent decrease, while Asia-Pacific activity dropped 43 percent to $155bn, reflecting ongoing geopolitical tensions and local challenges. The steep decline in Asia-Pacific activity highlights the vulnerability of emerging markets to geopolitical shocks and regulatory unpredictability.

Sector performance varied. The industrials sector saw the strongest rebound, with a 62 percent increase in aggregate deal value, followed by energy (54 percent) and healthcare (23 percent). In contrast, the materials and consumer sectors experienced sharp declines of 49 and 50 percent respectively, due to fewer large transactions. This uneven sectoral performance reflects shifting investor priorities, with capital flowing toward resilience and away from discretionary exposure. Investors are chasing certainty, not just returns.

Megadeal activity – defined as transactions exceeding $10bn – remained steady, with 24 deals announced in the first half of 2025, matching the previous six months. However, the number of large deals (valued at over $500m) fell below the long-term average of 60 to 80 per month, indicating continued caution among dealmakers. The persistence of megadeals amid broader caution suggests that strategic imperatives are still driving bold moves, albeit selectively.

Private equity (PE) activity increased during the first half of 2025, as financial sponsors faced mounting pressure to deploy their substantial dry powder. In contrast, early and late stage funding for start-ups remained subdued, despite strong interest in AI ventures. Bifurcation between PE and venture capital reflects differing risk appetites and time horizons in the current climate.

Protectionism and policy: the new barriers to M&A

While the US has led the charge on protectionist policies, it is not alone. Other jurisdictions are also adopting measures that complicate dealmaking. The European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, set to take effect in 2026, will impose tariffs on carbon-intensive imports to protect domestic industries. In the UK, the government has expanded its powers to scrutinise and potentially block foreign M&A on national security grounds. The scope of reviewable transactions has widened, particularly in critical sectors such as defence, dual-use technologies and advanced tech. These developments have hindered M&A and deterred foreign direct investment (FDI). According to the Department for Business and Trade, the number of FDI projects in the UK fell to 1375 in the financial year ending March 2025 – a 12 percent decline from the previous year and the lowest level since records began in 2007-08. This decline in FDI is a sobering reminder that national security concerns, while legitimate, can carry unintended economic consequences.

In this climate, dealmakers are increasingly turning to innovative structuring techniques to navigate regulatory scrutiny and geopolitical headwinds. Dual-track processes – where companies simultaneously pursue a sale and an initial public offering – are gaining popularity as a way to hedge against market volatility. Meanwhile, reverse mergers and special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) transactions, though less dominant than in previous years, are still being considered in niche scenarios where traditional exits are constrained. Creativity in deal structuring has become a strategic necessity.

Legal and compliance teams are playing a more central role in deal execution, often involved from the earliest stages of due diligence. Their input is critical in assessing exposure to sanctions regimes, export controls and foreign ownership restrictions. This shift reflects a broader trend toward embedding geopolitical intelligence into the core of corporate strategy, rather than treating it as a peripheral concern. The rise of legal foresight as a strategic asset is transforming how deals are conceived, negotiated and closed.

Technology is also reshaping how deals are sourced, evaluated and executed. Advanced analytics and AI-driven platforms are helping firms model complex risk scenarios and simulate post-merger integration outcomes. These tools are particularly valuable in cross-border transactions, where regulatory landscapes can shift rapidly and unpredictably. Digital tools are no longer confined to streamlining operations – they are reshaping how organisations perceive, interpret and act on strategic intelligence.

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are becoming more prominent in M&A decision making. Investors and boards are increasingly demanding that acquisitions align with sustainability goals and ethical standards. This has led to heightened scrutiny of targets’ supply chains, labour practices and carbon footprints. In some cases, ESG considerations have been decisive in deal approval or rejection – a compass guiding strategic direction.

The talent dimension of M&A is also evolving. With remote work and digital collaboration now entrenched, integration planning must account for cultural alignment across dispersed teams. Human capital assessments – once a secondary concern – are now central to value creation strategies, especially in knowledge-intensive sectors such as technology and professional services. People strategy is emerging as a critical determinant of post-deal success.

Creativity, compliance and culture

Looking ahead, dealmakers will need to balance agility with discipline. The ability to pivot quickly in response to geopolitical shocks must be matched by rigorous planning and execution. Those who succeed will likely be firms that combine strategic clarity with operational flexibility, supported by robust governance frameworks and a deep understanding of global dynamics. In this new era, adaptability is a competitive advantage.

M&A leaders are refining their strategies in several ways. Risk analysis is being intensified, with robust scenario planning to anticipate disruptions – although the unpredictability of the Trump administration’s tariff policy presents a particular challenge. Firms are also exploring earn-outs and contingent payments to mitigate economic volatility. Many are pivoting toward domestic transactions to reduce cross-border risk. Moreover, dealmakers are prioritising long-term value creation over short-term gains, adopting a more cautious and strategic approach. This recalibration signals a maturing of the M&A mindset – one that favours resilience over rapid returns.

Despite persistent uncertainty, companies remain committed to pursuing M&A. The scale of geopolitical risk is reshaping strategies, but businesses have demonstrated resilience and adaptability. As they continue to navigate these turbulent conditions, creativity and foresight will be essential in charting a course through the evolving global M&A landscape.

The report reveals SFI received contributions from insurer AIG under SFI’s Employment Practices Insurance Policy of €200,000 towards the severance payments and €292,000 in respect of its own legal costs.

The payouts draw the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Seamus McCarthy and in his report accompanying the financial statements, Mr McCarthy states that ""the net cost to Science Foundation Ireland arising from the termination of the former Director General’s employment was €409,000"".

Professor Nolan took up the prestigious post of Director General at SFI in January 2022 on secondment from Maynooth University and the annual basic salary for the post in 2022 was €222,000.

In the statement read in the Court of Appeal, the State-funded research agency said the litigation with its former chief has been ""damaging to the reputations of all parties"" and it is pleased that they have agreed to bring the case to a conclusion.

Professor Nolan sued the foundation in May 2024 seeking to prevent his dismissal.

The High Court granted him a short injunction halting his dismissal from his director general post for five weeks while various court applications were pending. The same judge, Mr Justice Rory Mulcahy, in June refused to substantially extend the injunction.

The intravesical gemcitabine-releasing system, previously known as TAR-200, treats patients with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-unresponsive high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (HR-NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (CIS), with or without papillary tumors.

A healthcare professional places TAR-200 into the bladder using a co-packaged urinary placement catheter. The procedure takes place in an outpatient setting in less than five minutes and requires no general anesthesia or further monitoring. Inlexzo remains in the bladder for three weeks per treatment cycle for up to 14 cycles.

According to J&J, it’s the first and only intravesical drug-releasing system (iDRS) to provide extended local delivery of a cancer medication into the bladder.

J&J calls Inlexzo a potentially practice-changing approach for treating certain types of bladder cancer. The FDA granted priority review to a new drug application (NDA) for the system earlier this year.

The Phase 2b SunRISe-1 study, which demonstrated an 82.4% complete response rate, supported the FDA approval. More than half (52.9%) of patients remained cancer-free at least one year or more after achieving a complete response. J&J noted that the majority of adverse reactions proved mild and moderate.

Just as Gemini is known to make up facts for its AI summaries, AI agents can also be prone to hallucinations.
Leading AI agents will be easier in some regards, but some complexities must not be overlooked.
Effectively leading AI teams requires a division of responsibility between AI agents and human workers who use AI to ensure that their skills are best optimized.","Stepping into leadership roles has never been easy, considering the overarching tasks of managing a diverse cast of people, but in the era of AI, matters are growing increasingly more complex. In 2025, we have witnessed the arrival of digital AI employees and colleagues, along with an increasing number of AI tools being introduced to the workplace. These changes demand an altered approach to leadership.

From the supervision of such tools to the management of workers around this technology, the leadership of AI teams requires nuance and consideration. Leading AI agents haven’t become a central responsibility for many managers, leaders, and HR teams just yet, but we see a growing need for a transformation in the management of the AI-empowered workforce.

It’s Time for Manager and HR Teams to Start Leading AI Teams with Greater Care

From financial institutions like BNY Mellon to retailers like Walmart, many organizations have deployed AI agents to bolster their workforce. While some of these agents take the shape of individual employees who are required to report to their own managers, others are mere chatbots that handle some degree of the dissemination of information but perform no other functions independently.

Employees who work alongside these tools are also being instructed to use AI in their own work, with the ability to adapt to these tools, even becoming a part of their performance reviews. Having to grapple with the arrival of AI has already been difficult for those who have lost their jobs as a result, but the impact has been equally severe on workers who are doing their best to adapt to the changing times while worrying about the future of their careers.

Ensuring the right tone of leadership for AI teams requires much of the same traditional skillsets that have been prioritized over the years, but there is also a growing need for a more informed approach to tackling the overlap of tech and humanity.

The Modern Frontier: Leading the AI Transformation and Managing AI Agents

AI is still a new and novel concept for the large majority of businesses, but most are keen on adopting the technology in the near future. The deployment of AI agents is not the first application of this technology for most organizations, but nonetheless, it requires preparation. Unlike their human counterparts, AI agents don’t require empathy and sensitivity, but they do require understanding.

While these AI agents won’t make a demand for better benefits or workplace culture, they likely will require detailed instructions on how to get a job done and the exact parameters that need to be met. AI agents are not designed to make voluntary observations or draw from team learnings unless explicitly taught to do so, making leading AI teams less about collaboration and more about clarity. There is no degree of charisma and competency that will impress the AI to improve its performance.

Unlike what some believe, AI agents are not infallible either. Just as Gemini is known to make up facts for its AI summaries, AI agents can also be prone to hallucinations. A word of caution and correction that may be enough to correct human error may not be sufficient with technology. These fluctuations between human capability and AI potential may appear minor at first glance, but they can have lasting effects on the company’s performance. Leading AI agents will be easier in some regards, but some complexities must not be overlooked.

Leadership for AI Teams Requires an Exploration of the Human Experience

Leading the AI transformation with AI agents is just one part of the challenge that awaits leaders. For the most part, human labor will continue to remain essential to any workforce, even if the nature of their roles and job descriptions evolves. Employees who are asked to utilize AI have concerns of their own, many of which they are likely to be afraid to share for fear of being marked as regressive.

Still, asking questions and understanding these concerns can mean the difference between effective and ineffective adoption of AI. Putting employee fears to rest and training them to use and interact with this technology is a big part of the responsibility of the leaders. Introducing new tech is not enough when employees are not sure how to make the most of it.

Effectively leading AI teams requires a division of responsibility between AI agents and human workers who use AI to ensure that their skills are best optimized. Apart from the delegation of work, there is also the question of ethics that often comes up when using AI. Navigating these challenges falls to leaders, and it’s up to these management teams to choose a course of action that benefits both the organization and its employees and customers.

Growing Calls for AI-Powered Leadership Also Threaten Leadership Roles

Just as organizations have grown comfortable with the conversation of AI employees, many employees have started opening themselves up to the idea of AI leaders. Many believe that AI leaders may be fairer and apolitical about making decisions regarding their careers, but there are also some reservations about allowing AI to handle matters that require empathy. We haven’t yet reached a point where AI CEOs run organizations instead of actual leaders, but that future may not be a distant one.

Even with such changes on the horizon, it’s hard to believe that real leaders are going anywhere. AI-supported leadership is certainly on the cards; however, it requires leaders to familiarize themselves with the technology as much as possible to understand its effects on the workforce. Leading AI teams and being aware of the needs based on their human-tech makeup is a growing challenge for leaders to face head-on.

The technological revolution goes beyond acquiring and investing in AI, and lands on how efficiently leaders are able to prepare for its real effect on the organization as a whole.",https://www.thehrdigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/leading-AI-teams.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 17:19:03.381602

The company has been promoting access without a prescription in the state as recently as last week, when the democratic governors of Oregon, Washington and California announced a “West Coast Health Alliance” aimed at safeguarding access to vaccines.

The state Board of Pharmacy on Friday said it would have more clarity for vaccine access rules after the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meets on Sept. 18-19. That’s the first meeting since the FDA issued more restrictive annual guidance in August which limited the vaccine to people aged 65 or older or those with an underlying health condition that would risk severe illness.

Thibault did not respond to follow-up questions about the restrictions Friday, when the Capital Chronicle reported Gov. Tina Kotek is weighing a variety of options to safeguard COVID vaccine access at pharmacies. One option could be a standing order guaranteeing the vaccine to individuals age 6 months or older, similar to one issued in Washington.

But in a statement Tuesday morning, Thibault said the company was shifting course.

“After reviewing clarifying guidance issued last week, we’re only offering updated COVID-19 vaccinations to patients who present a prescription from an authorized prescriber,” she said in a statement. “As a result, appointments cannot currently be scheduled online in Oregon. Patients can walk in to any CVS Pharmacy location, present a prescription and receive the vaccination.”

The new regulations from CVS bring it in line with guidance that has frustrated patients across the state. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy stressed Friday that it would require prescriptions for approval and await more information from the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, of which U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy removed all members in June. Kennedy is considering appointing critics of COVID-19 vaccines to the panel, the Washington Post reported Monday.

Pediatrician and state Sen. Lisa Reynolds, D-Portland, urged the state to adopt a standing order and questioned the value of waiting till mid-September for the federal government.

“Waiting until the ACIP meeting (Sept 18-19) will cause unnecessary delays,” she wrote in a statement. “And don’t we expect the ACIP recommendations to mirror the FDA approval?”",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1254511513-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 17:19:22.307587

Investment Conclusion LQR House (YHC) gives investors a shot at the fast-growing alcohol e-commerce and digital marketing scene, but the ride is bumpy.","Overview

LQR House Inc. (NASDAQ: YHC) is a specialized e-commerce and marketing outfit in the U.S. alcohol world. It runs CWSpirits.com—a tech-focused online shop spotlighting emerging, premium, and luxury spirits, wines, and bubbly. Through its CWS Platform, LQR House creates its own limited-batch spirit brands (like SWOL Tequila) and offers digital marketing plus brand-building for smaller alcohol makers, wholesalers, and retailers. The company earns its keep through direct sales on CWSpirits.com and fees tied to marketing results on the platform. The broader alcohol e-commerce market is pegged at $64.6 billion this year and is set to climb to $73.9 billion in 2025—amounting to annual growth of 14.5%. The sector’s on the up thanks to post-pandemic direct-to-consumer habits, buzzy subscription models, and smart personalization driven by AI. LQR faces heavyweight competitors, from delivery giants like Drizly and Instacart to specialty players like ReserveBar and Wine.com. LQR House holds its own with a blend of integrated marketing-to-sales, in-house brands, and strong data chops, although it’s still much smaller and less cashed-up than the big names.

Recent Performance

Over the past year, YHC’s stock has dropped about 81%, down from several dollars to just $0.75 as of September 9th, 2025. In comparison, the S&P 500 managed a one-year total return of roughly 14.8% through July. This underperformance reflects both market-wide jitters (in part from April’s tariff shocks) and some stock-specific woes—like ongoing struggles to turn a profit, Nasdaq compliance headaches (including a 35-for-1 reverse split), and investor doubts around LQR House’s pivots into crypto and Bitcoin mining.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

LQR House’s 2024 audited revenue jumped 123.2% year-over-year, hitting $2.50 million (vs. $1.12 million in 2023). This surge followed a business overhaul aimed at cutting fat and focusing on more profitable areas. Management is aiming for positive EBIDA—earnings before interest, depreciation, and amortization—in 2025 as costs in marketing level out. Analysts are predicting around 68% revenue growth in fiscal 2025, powered by SWOL Tequila’s push into global markets, new marketing tie-ups (Montauk Distilling, TikTok), and a bigger online audience via SEO. Longer term, the industry tailwinds (like growing DTC adoption and rising subscriptions) should keep revenue rising at a mid-teens pace.

Quality & Moat

LQR House is still deep in the red: over the last twelve months, it posted a $22.7 million net loss on just $2.39 million in revenue. That’s an eye-watering –950% operating margin, compared to 18.2% for the average company. Return on invested capital is also painful at –167% (market average: +11.1%), and free cash flow yield lands at –458% (market: +1.9%). While net debt to EBITDA sits low at 0.20x (vs. the broader market’s 1.41x), that doesn’t offset the ongoing lack of profits. LQR’s competitive moat is still forming; its proprietary analytics and brand-making could pay off, but the company’s limited scale, strict liquor rules, and big-name competition make it tough to claim a lasting edge. Insider lock-ups cover around 0.6% of shares and aim to keep trading steady, but they don’t solve the underlying profitability issues.

Valuation

It’s tricky to value LQR House the traditional way due to ongoing losses and a recent reverse split. The enterprise value to sales ratio is more or less irrelevant, but the ballpark price-to-sales ratio (market cap of $7.8 million vs. $2.39 million revenue) comes out to around 3.3x—slightly cheaper than the peer average of 4.6x. Standard metrics like forward P/E and EV/EBITDA aren’t useful here, with both earnings and EBITDA in the red. This low multiple hints at plenty of risk—investors are waiting to see if LQR House can deliver on profitability to unlock any real upside.

Market Sentiment

Market mood is decidedly grim. YHC is trading near its 52-week low. There’s no analyst coverage from Wall Street, implied volatility sits at a hefty 69% (market: 23%), and the beta is 1.22. Shares have tumbled further on regulatory updates and missed profitability targets. Announcements about new board members or partnerships haven’t moved the needle much, and most institutions are sitting this out. Even on message boards and social media, things are quiet—suggesting both low interest and low liquidity.

Key Risks

Profitability and Cash Burn: Negative operating margins (–950%) and a free cash flow yield of –458% show LQR House is burning through cash, so it’ll need fresh financing or asset sales to keep the lights on.

Execution and Scale: Being small puts LQR at a disadvantage when bargaining with suppliers and partners. Failure to build real momentum on CWSpirits.com could stall growth and shrink already thin margins.

Regulatory Complexity: Alcohol e-commerce isn’t a simple online sale—each state and country has its own licensing rules, plus age checks and high shipping costs. That’s a big hurdle for expanding beyond the core market.

High Volatility: Implied volatility of 69%—nearly three times the market average—means LQR's share price is prone to wild swings. That makes it costlier to raise new capital, and existing shareholders risk being diluted.

Competitive Pressure: LQR House faces a crowded field of deep-pocketed rivals like Drizly (Uber), Instacart, and ReserveBar, all of whom can put pressure on market share and margins.

Bull Case

Robust Revenue Growth: Audited 2024 revenues shot up by 123%, with analyst forecasts calling for nearly 68% more growth in 2025—driven by new brand partnerships and global expansion.

EBIDA Profitability Target: Management believes break-even (on an EBIDA basis) is within reach in 2025, thanks to the recent overhaul and tighter cost control.

Undercapitalized Peer Valuations: Compared to the peer group’s 4.6x EV/Sales average, LQR House’s roughly 3.3x price-to-sales ratio leaves room for upside if losses shrink and growth holds up.

Industry Tailwinds: Alcohol e-commerce is growing at a 15% annual clip. LQR’s tech-driven and DTC-friendly model is right in the sweet spot for these industry shifts.

Strategic Partnerships: The company’s board now boasts members with experience in Asia, and it’s forging partnerships with TikTok, Coinbase Prime, and Montauk Distilling—all of which could unlock faster growth.

Bear Case

Ongoing Cash Burn: Burning cash and low margins suggest LQR House will have to keep raising fresh money—hurting existing shareholders and dragging on the stock.

Lack of Profit Margin: A negative 950% operating margin flags some serious structural inefficiencies. Getting to profitability may take longer—and more capital—than planned.

Regulatory and Logistics Hurdles: Complex state-by-state rules for shipping alcohol, plus steep delivery costs, could curb U.S. growth and keep margins under pressure.

Microcap Illiquidity: The stock’s a microcap with little institutional ownership. That means low trading volume, bigger swings, and wider bid/ask spreads.

Strategic Focus Drift: Management’s recent jump into crypto, Bitcoin mining, and AI could take their eye off the core e-commerce and marketing business.

On Our Radar

Q3 2025 Earnings: The company’s third-quarter results—expected mid-November 2025 (date TBC)—should shed some light on progress for revenue, margins, and cash flow.

Nasdaq Compliance Milestones: Keep an eye on LQR House’s ability to stay in line with Nasdaq’s minimum share price and equity rules. Falling short could put its listing at risk.

SWOL Tequila International Rollout: Investor focus will be on how the SWOL Tequila launch goes in Greece and Thailand, in partnership with Of The Earth. Look for these numbers in forthcoming press releases.

New Marketing Collaborations: Recent campaigns—like the TikTok collaboration (August 2025) and Montauk Distilling’s new rum—will be key metrics to gauge progress in engagement and sales.

Capital-Raising Activities: Announcements around any new share offerings or warrant redemptions will shape LQR’s cash position and have a knock-on effect on valuation.

Investment Conclusion

LQR House (YHC) gives investors a shot at the fast-growing alcohol e-commerce and digital marketing scene, but the ride is bumpy. Rapid revenue growth and a stated path to EBIDA profitability in 2025 provide a turnaround story, with shares currently trading at a discount to sales compared to peers. Still, deep negative margins, high cash burn, and the risks that come with being a tiny, thinly traded company should make investors cautious. For long-term investors with an appetite for risk, YHC could prove interesting—if management delivers on profit targets and lands new brand partners. Until then, expect plenty of volatility and the likelihood that more capital will be needed to keep the growth story alive. Keep an eye on upcoming earnings, regulatory milestones, and the company’s cash runway before deciding whether to take a position.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-09-09 17:19:54.627534

Despite its impressive growth, the industry continues to grapple with critical challenges that threaten its economic contribution.

Notably, PwC identifies Nigeria as the world’s fastest-growing entertainment and media market with a 12.1% compound annual growth rate,

while Statista forecasts that ad spend in the Advertising market will hit US\$1.04bn in 2025.

This positions Nigeria as one of Africa’s largest advertising markets.

Nigeria’s Economy Expands, Advertising Gains Importance

Meanwhile, Nigeria’s economy expanded by 3.13% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2025, up from 2.27% during the same period in 2024.

The services sector drove this growth, increasing by 4.33% and contributing 57.5% to GDP.

Therefore, the regulatory framework surrounding the advertising industry has become increasingly crucial for sustainable economic development.

Industry stakeholders describe the sector not just as a revenue generator but as an “economic enabler” powering trillion-naira business activities across multiple sectors.

ARCON Intensifies Reform Efforts

In response, the Advertising Regulatory Council of Nigeria (ARCON) has stepped up its efforts to resolve these challenges, particularly focusing on crippling industry debts and delayed payments that have long plagued Nigeria’s advertising sector.

Simultaneously, the council is strengthening its regulatory framework for digital platforms.

Speaking on TVC News during a program titled “Nigeria Advertising Regulation Framework and The Digital Platforms Enforcement,” which Abimbola Mohammed monitored,

ARCON’s director general, Dr. Olalekan Fadolapo, joined Barr. Charles Odenigbo, director general of the Centre for Media and Law Development (CMLD), to discuss comprehensive industry solutions.

Payment Delays Threaten Industry Sustainability

Dr. Fadolapo revealed the damaging effects of extended payment cycles on industry sustainability.

In contrast, Barr. Odenigbo offered legal insights into Nigeria’s evolving advertising regulatory framework.

“Globally, there’s a payment threshold — in the UK it’s 30 days, in Europe it’s 30 days, and in some African countries it’s 45 days.

But when you come to Nigeria, somebody will be giving you a deal of 180 days, 120 days,” Dr. Fadolapo stated. “180 days is like six months.

Imagine a client that says ‘bill me every quarter.’ When will you collect? What is the time value of money?”

He explained that this cycle traps agencies in a system where they work from January to March, bill clients in April, and then wait an additional 120-180 days for payment.

As a result, cash flow and business operations suffer significantly.

Digital Advertising Under ARCON’s Scrutiny

Next, Dr. Fadolapo addressed common misconceptions regarding ARCON’s oversight of digital media.

He emphasized that the agency regulates advertising content—not the digital platforms themselves.

“Content is divided into three: information, entertainment, or advertising.

We don’t regulate information. We don’t regulate entertainment.

We only regulate advertising on traditional media or digital media,” he clarified.

This distinction, he noted, is crucial as Nigeria transitions from e-commerce to a full digital economy.

Dr. Fadolapo identified three key stakeholders in the digital advertising ecosystem: operators (business owners), the public (vulnerable consumers), and the government (regulatory gatekeeper).

“If the government as gatekeeper chooses to leave the operator and the vulnerable general public, there will be maximum exploitation of the general public through advertising,” he warned.

He pointed to over one trillion-naira losses from Ponzi schemes as evidence of unchecked digital advertising abuse.

Nigeria’s Dual Regulatory Model Explained

In addition, Barr. Odenigbo outlined Nigeria’s comprehensive advertising legal framework anchored by the Advertising Regulatory Council of Nigeria Act 2022

“The apex law that regulates advertising today is the ARCON Act 2022, which brought the entire industry community together under one basket,” he stated.

According to him, Nigeria operates under a dual regulatory system, which combines self-regulation by industry bodies with statutory government oversight through ARCON.

This system promotes a corrective, rather than punitive, approach by requiring advertisers to submit materials for pre-exposure vetting to prevent harmful content.

“In Nigeria, we practice a corrective regulatory framework.

Before the action comes up, the law says before you expose an advert, either on traditional media or new media, submit it to ARCON,” Dr. Fadolapo explained.

“If there is any mischief, misinformation, disinformation claim, it would have been solved before you expose.”

Local Content Policy Enforced

Furthermore, Dr. Fadolapo defended ARCON’s enforcement of local content requirements.

He clarified that the directive originates from the Federal Ministry of Information and National Orientation under the government’s “Nigerian First” policy.

This policy aims to prevent the offshoring of production, which denies local talent crucial opportunities.

“You want to produce an advert for the Nigerian market.

You can spend as much as 750 million naira, 1 billion naira to produce an advert.

Now you take this particular advert to another country, collect your commercial in a flash drive, and fly back to Nigeria after investing 1 billion in that economy,” he illustrated.

The ARCON DG questioned such practices: “Are you saying that the ladies and men in Nigeria are not beautiful or handsome enough to grace your product?

Are you saying you cannot find similar voice in Nigeria?”

As a result, under this policy, advertisers must prove Nigerian involvement in production including models, voice-over artists, and technical crew to strengthen the local advertising ecosystem.

Court Upholds Tribunal’s Powers

Significantly, Barr. Odenigbo highlighted a legal victory in the case of Digi Bay Nigeria vs. the Attorney General of the Federation and ARCON.

In April 2025, the Federal High Court ruled that ARCON holds the authority to issue queries for advertising law violations.

The court also affirmed the Advertising Offences Tribunal’s (AOT) power to impose penalties.

“The court held that ARCON is the body that has the power to issue query to those who violate advertising law in Nigeria.

It also gave recognition to the fact that AOT has power to impose penalties stipulated in the act,” he said.

The AOT, established under Section 37 of the ARCON Act, holds criminal jurisdiction throughout Nigeria.

It has handled over 300 cases since its inception, with appeals going directly to the Court of Appeal by passing lower courts.

Industry Remains Under-Regulated, Officials Say

Despite concerns, both officials dismissed suggestions that Nigeria’s advertising industry is over-regulated.

Instead, they argued for stronger oversight.

“The space is under-regulated.

We are still scratching the surface,” Odenigbo asserted, citing widespread digital advertising abuse targeting children and vulnerable populations.

Dr. Fadolapo revealed that ARCON recently intercepted an abortion-related advert sent into Nigeria from abroad, showcasing the challenges of cross-border digital advertising.

“You can be in another country, as close as Ghana, and you’ll be throwing advert into Nigeria,” he noted.

Vetting Process Further Clarified

Dr. Fadolapo clarified that ARCON does not vet advertisements directly.

Instead, it supports the Advertising Standards Panel (ASP), a 20-member body representing the organized private sector and regulatory agencies.

This panel oversees pre-vetting, vetting, and post-vetting compliance checks.

Currently, only three categories remain exempt from vetting: obituaries, vacancy announcements, and bank financial reports.

However, pressure is mounting to include financial reports in vetting.

The agency previously excluded goodwill messages until a controversial bank advert stating it would “rise like Agege bread” prompted policy review.

ARCON Reforms Industry Ethics and Payments

To combat systemic challenges, ARCON has introduced several reforms, including zero debt policies, pitch protection fees, and disengagement protocols.

One such protocol ensures that clients cannot terminate agency relationships while still owing substantial debts and then immediately hire new agencies.

“You can fire your agency.

However, if you are firing your agency, make sure you close the account and bring the business to closure.

You can’t be owing me 500 million, fire me, and engage agency B,” Dr. Fadolapo explained.

Regulatory Future Focuses on Accountability

In conclusion, ARCON’s regulatory framework aims to build an ethical and accountable advertising landscape.

It seeks to protect consumers while ensuring the sustainability of Nigeria’s trillion-naira advertising industry.

Both officials emphasized that the country needs stronger—not weaker—regulation as the sector continues to grow as an economic enabler.",https://marketingedge.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG-20250909-WA0007.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 17:20:56.059810

Instead of generic suggestions, the platform now understands shopping habits, dietary preferences, and even local availability of items. By analyzing data, Instacart provides users with customized shopping lists and timely reminders, making sure nothing is forgotten.

Personalized Recommendations at Your Fingertips

Imagine opening the Instacart app and seeing your cart pre-filled with your usual essentials: milk, bread, and fresh produce from your favorite local store. If you're trying a new diet-like plant-based or keto-the AI recognizes your choices and suggests alternatives. This level of personalization not only saves time but also helps consumers make healthier, budget-friendly decisions.

Smarter Substitutions and Real-Time Updates

One of the biggest frustrations in online grocery shopping has always been out-of-stock items. In 2025, Instacart's AI has nearly solved this issue.

New Brunswick, New Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson announced late Monday, Sept. 8, that Morikis has been elected to the company's board of directors.

Morikis will serve on two board committees — Audit and Compensation & Benefits — according to this filing by Johnson & Johnson with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Joaquin Duato, the chairman and CEO of Johnson & Johnson, said in a statement that Morikis is ""a proven leader of a large multinational organization who possesses a strong understanding of global markets and complex supply chains.""

Those characteristics make Morikis ""an incredible asset to Johnson & Johnson as we continue to deliver the next generation of health care innovation for patients,” Duato added.

Johnson & Johnson makes and distributes medical devices, pharmaceuticals and consumer health products. The executive leadership page on Johnson & Johnson's website lists the company's board with 11 members, not including Morikis. A company spokesperson didn't immediately return an email on Tuesday afternoon, Sept. 9, seeking to confirm that Morikis would be the 12th member of the board.

Johnson & Johnson is another high-profile public company board seat for Morikis, who currently serves on the boards of United Parcel Service Inc., General Mills Inc. and Whirlpool Corp. He has chaired the board of directors for University Hospitals Health System since 2023. Morikis is also a past director and former chair of the Cleveland American Red Cross, according to his bio on the UH website.

Morikis retired from his position as executive chairman of Cleveland-based Sherwin-Williams on Dec. 31, 2024, following a 40-year career with the paintmaking giant.

Previous generations of the Apple Watch, which first hit the market with its first generation in 2015, have featured health monitoring features including sleep tracking, blood oxygen detecting, fitness tracking, heart rate monitoring, and menstrual cycle monitoring.

In 2018, the Apple Watch secured its first FDA approval when it added a feature to detect irregular heart rhythms, including atrial fibrillation. It also earned clearance for its fall detection feature.

Leading up to today’s debut of the new watches, tech experts had several predictions for Apple’s newest watch-related health features. Rumors for the Series 11 device included blood pressure tracking, which turned out to be more than a rumor, and blood glucose monitoring capabilities.

Bloomberg also reported that Apple may be working on a comprehensive AI health initiative, code-named ""Project Mulberry.” Project Mulberry would, allegedly, use AI to deliver personalized workout plans based on a user’s existing health and fitness data.

While Series 11 does have new health features of note, it will not go as far as adding blood glucose detection, or any sort of personalized workout data.

What’s new

The new Apple Watch will copy competitors including the Oura Ring, FitBit, and Google Watch, adding a “sleep score” for users.

In 2020, Apple first debuted a sleep tracking feature that calculates the amount of time users spend awake versus sleeping, but thus far, the watch has not provided patients with a composite sleep score.

The score will calculate how many hours a user spends in the various stages of sleep (light, deep, REM) to offer a better understanding of sleep efficiency.

In addition, the Series 11 boasts a 24 hour battery life, allowing users longer wear before having to charge their device. And, as predicted, Apple also touted new hypertension features.

Apple is expecting to warn around 1 million people of possible hypertension through the new add on, according to the conference, and is currently gunning for FDA clearance of the feature, though the company provided no timeline as to when clearance is expected.

Using data from the optical heart rate sensor, the algorithm will use trends and patterns indicating “possible hypertension.”

“Using data from the optical heart sensor, the algorithm looks for chronic high blood pressure by analyzing how your blood vessels respond,” Sumbul Desai, Apple’s health vice president, said during the event.

Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, also used his time to reiterate the importance of other health and safety features that have been included in past devices, and will remain on the Series 11. He reminded users of the importance of the watch’s high heart-rate alerts and fall detection.

There were several user anecdotes shared from patients who discovered adverse health events, like a collapsed lung and an ongoing stroke, thanks to their Apple Watch.

While users are rallying around Apple’s health features, sharing real-life examples of their benefits, not all medical professionals are onboard with new trends in wearable technology.

“Using a fitness tracker to measure your personal health is like measuring a cell with a ruler. Consumer devices use photoplethysmography—light sensors that detect blood flow changes through the skin—which lacks the precision needed for medical decisions,” Andrew Holman, MD, CEO of Inmedix, told MD+DI. “While this technology is sufficient for tracking basic trends like heart rate changes during exercise, it's nowhere near medical-grade precision provided by devices with high-fidelity electrocardiogram.”

The AirPods Pro 3

On top of its flagship watch, Apple is expanding its portfolio of devices that will offer health tracking.

During today’s event, Apple also announced that its newest generation of AirPods, the AirPods Pro 3, will also add new health features.

The Pro 3s will offer a heart rate sensor that can be used during workouts. Users will be able to “utilize AirPods Pro 3 to measure heart rate and track over 50 workout types with the new experience in the Fitness app on iPhone,” according to Apple. “AirPods Pro 3 introduce a custom photoplethysmography sensor that shines invisible infrared light pulsed at 256 times per second to measure light absorption in blood flow.”

The hypertension monitoring debate

As Apple seeks FDA approval for its new hypertension capabilities, it could join the list of companies clashing with the regulatory body over BP monitoring.

In July, WHOOP toed the line by offering a Blood Pressure Index to users with the intent to measure or estimate blood pressure.

WHOOP’s website markets the product as providing “daily systolic and diastolic blood pressure estimations, offering members a new way to understand how blood pressure affects their performance and well-being,” and lists BPI as an example of how WHOOP delivers “medical-grade health & performance insights.”

On July 14, FDA issued a warning letter to WHOOP, noting potential overstepping.

“WHOOP recently received notice from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asserting that Blood Pressure Insights should be reviewed as a medical device before being available in the United States. We respectfully disagree,” the company posted on its website in response.

“Blood Pressure Insights is a wellness feature, not a medical device. It’s designed to help you understand how your body responds to daily life, not to diagnose or treat any condition. Wellness features like this are common in wearable technology, like tracking your respiratory rate or HRV, and provide valuable insights to support better decisions about your performance without requiring FDA clearance.”

Right now, the difference between needing and not needing FDA approval for a device comes down to “intended use.” While Apple is choosing to seek regulatory approval for this feature, WHOOP did not, which could be what differentiates the two. However, as previously mentioned, it remains to be seen when the Series 11 will earn FDA approval, and what that approval might look like.

“Any device making medical claims about blood pressure will face appropriate FDA scrutiny. The regulatory pathway depends entirely on what Apple claims their device can do—trend tracking versus diagnostic measurement are very different categories,” Dr. Holman said. “But the real challenge isn't just regulatory approval, it’s clinical validity. Apple will need to demonstrate that their data is not only accurate and reliable, but also clinically meaningful for both patients and physicians.”

Physician concerns

While some users may find it helpful to have updated heart rate readings from their AirPods, a composite sleep score, or data on possible high BP readings, physicians warn that this data all must be taken with a grain of salt.

“The fundamental limitation is that these devices can tell you that your heart rate increased, but they can’t tell you why or what it means for your health. Whether it’s heart rate variability, sleep patterns, or activity levels, consumer wearables measure correlations, not causations. Patients need to understand that while wearables are excellent fitness motivators, any concerning trends require clinical evaluation with medical-grade diagnostics to determine the actual causes and appropriate interventions,” Dr. Holman said.

Dr. Holman is not against wearable devices altogether, and like many physicians, he sees the benefits of patients having a growing amount of awareness over their own bodies. The emphasis is on the fact that an Apple Watch cannot function as the end-all-be-all of medical care.

“Patient engagement is always positive, and these devices can encourage healthy behaviors like exercise and sleep tracking. However, physicians need to help patients understand the difference between fitness data and medical diagnostics. The real value comes when patients bring their health concerns to the clinic where we can measure what truly matters with medical-grade precision,” he said.

Apple plans to release the Series 11 at a price point of $399, the same as previous watch generations. The AirPods Pro 3 will retail for $249, the same price as the current generation AirPods Pro 2. Both will go on sale on September 19.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt14ac89070d5e4751/blt6e5b070a446c0cf1/68c0a1aed9ebbc1d4776b76d/Untitled_design_-_2025-09-09T175010.120.png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-09 20:08:56.586440

Dive Brief:

Walmart opened a 725,000-square-foot perishable distribution center in Wellford, South Carolina, the retailer announced last week.

The facility receives and processes fresh produce, eggs, dairy, meat and frozen goods for distribution to 180 Walmart stores. More than 600 full-time employees work at the location, and Walmart is hiring for automation equipment operators and other roles.

“The opening of our new high-tech perishable distribution center, marks a major step forward in how we get fresher products to customers faster — whether that’s in-store, delivered to their home, or even restocking their refrigerator,” said Rob Montgomery, EVP of supply chain for Walmart U.S., in the announcement.

Dive Insight:

The Wellford facility is the third of five new perishable distribution centers Walmart is opening nationwide as the retail giant continues to beef up its grocery supply chain.

Facilities in Shafter, California, and Lancaster, Texas, are also up and running, with locations in Belvidere, Illinois, and Pilesgrove, New Jersey, slated to follow. Walmart said last year it is adding over half a million square feet per site to four of its traditional perishable distribution centers as well.

The Wellford location and other new perishables-focused facilities can process over double the volume of a traditional distribution center by tapping into automation and artificial intelligence, according to Walmart.

Processing begins when cases from farmers and suppliers arrive at the facility and are stored in an automated storage system. High-tech systems then build store-specific pallets from those cases to ensure eggs and other fragile items are placed near the top to limit damage. Pallets are then wrapped and loaded onto a truck for shipping.

""AI tracks every pallet to ensure accuracy and freshness,"" last week’s announcement said. ""This technology also makes unloading at stores faster and easier, allowing store associates to spend more time helping customers.""

OKLAHOMA CITY — CVS Caremark will pay a $32.1 million settlement for allegedly keeping money that “belonged” to the state employee health plan, HealthChoice, the Attorney General’s Office said Tuesday.

CVS Caremark agreed to the settlement to avoid litigation but has denied any wrongdoing, the Attorney General’s Office said. CVS Caremark is a pharmacy benefit manager that works to negotiate prices between insurance companies, drug manufacturers and pharmacies.

“When drug companies give discounts and rebates for medications, CVS Caremark was supposed to pass that money on to HealthChoice,” according to a news release from Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s office. “Instead, the state contends that CVS kept millions of dollars that should have gone to help lower healthcare costs for state employees from January 2020 through December 2024.”

CVS Caremark is set to pay Oklahoma $32.1 million under the terms of the settlement. About $27 million of this goes to HealthChoice once lawyer fees to pay for outside counsel are deducted, according to a news release.

Under the settlement terms, CVS Caremark will also report any collected rebates every quarter to ensure “greater transparency and accountability,” according to the release.

“These funds should be used to help keep premiums lower for HealthChoice members,” Drummond said in a statement. “This recovery reflects our commitment to maximizing benefits for the state employees who serve all Oklahomans and protecting taxpayer dollars that fund these healthcare benefits.”

Drummond said his office is continuing to pursue a separate lawsuit against CVS Caremark for allegedly under reimbursing Oklahoma pharmacies for acquiring prescription drugs. In January he estimated could recover around $2 million in fees and restitution.

CVS Caremark agreed to the settlement to avoid litigation but has denied any wrongdoing, the Attorney General’s Office said. CVS Caremark is a pharmacy benefit manager that works to negotiate prices between insurance companies, drug manufacturers and pharmacies.

“When drug companies give discounts and rebates for medications, CVS Caremark was supposed to pass that money on to HealthChoice,” according to a news release from Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s office. “Instead, the state contends that CVS kept millions of dollars that should have gone to help lower healthcare costs for state employees from January 2020 through December 2024.”

CVS Caremark is set to pay Oklahoma $32.1 million under the terms of the settlement. About $27 million of this goes to HealthChoice once lawyer fees to pay for outside counsel are deducted, according to a news release.

Under the settlement terms, CVS Caremark will also report any collected rebates every quarter to ensure “greater transparency and accountability,” according to the release.

“These funds should be used to help keep premiums lower for HealthChoice members,” Drummond said in a statement. “This recovery reflects our commitment to maximizing benefits for the state employees who serve all Oklahomans and protecting taxpayer dollars that fund these healthcare benefits.”

Drummond said his office is continuing to pursue a separate lawsuit against CVS Caremark for allegedly under reimbursing Oklahoma pharmacies for acquiring prescription drugs. In January he estimated could recover around $2 million in fees and restitution.",https://oklahomavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8190766-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 16:15:24.104280

CVS Caremark is a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) that manages prescription drug benefits for health plans, including HealthChoice which is Oklahoma’s state employee plan. When drug companies give discounts and rebates for medications, CVS Caremark was supposed to pass that money on to HealthChoice. Instead, the state contends that CVS kept millions of dollars that should have gone to help lower healthcare costs for state employees from January 2020 through December 2024. CVS maintained that it complied with its contractual obligations.

“When a company keeps money that belongs to Oklahoma taxpayers, we're going to fight to get it back,” Drummond said. “This settlement ensures that millions of dollars go where they should have gone all along - to benefit our state employees' healthcare.""

Under the agreement, CVS Caremark will pay $32.1 million to the State of Oklahoma. After deducting attorney fees for outside counsel, in line with Oklahoma state statute, approximately $27 million will go directly to the HealthChoice plan within 30 days. None of the funds will remain with the Attorney General's Office. Instead, Drummond directed the recovery dollars go back to the state plan to benefit state employees, their families and retirees.

""These funds should be used to help keep premiums lower for HealthChoice members,"" Drummond said. ""This recovery reflects our commitment to maximizing benefits for the state employees who serve all Oklahomans and protecting taxpayer dollars that fund these healthcare benefits.""

The Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA) oversees HealthChoice. Ellen Buettner, OHCA CEO, welcomed the settlement.

""This settlement ensures millions of dollars will be directed back to the HealthChoice plan, benefiting Oklahoma's state employees and their families,” Buettner said. “This recovery underscores OHCA’s commitment to maximizing the value of healthcare benefits for those who serve our state.""

CVS Caremark must also:

Pay any additional rebate amounts collected for the 2020-2024 period within 90 days;

Pass through all future rebate payments directly to the HealthChoice plan within 90 days of collection; and

Agree to an expanded definition of “rebate” in the state contract to ensure comprehensive coverage of manufacturer payments.

The settlement also includes strengthened contract language that requires Caremark to report and remit all rebates collected to the state plan on a quarterly basis, ensuring greater transparency and accountability, as well as maximum benefits to the state employee health plan for the life of the contract.

""This successful settlement is the result of the team we formed to investigate and negotiate this matter,"" Drummond said. ""This significant recovery would not have been possible without the exceptional work of our Consumer Protection Unit and PBM Compliance and Enforcement Unit. I appreciate the leadership of Deputy Attorney General Michael Leake, who serves as the director of the PBM Compliance and Enforcement Unit.”

This settlement represents the latest action in the Attorney General's ongoing efforts to hold pharmacy benefit managers accountable. The office continues to pursue a separate lawsuit against CVS Caremark for allegedly reimbursing Oklahoma pharmacies below acquisition cost.

Walmart opened a 725,000-square-foot perishable distribution center in Wellford, South Carolina, the retailer announced last week.

The facility receives and processes fresh produce, eggs, dairy, meat and frozen goods for distribution to 180 Walmart stores. More than 600 full-time employees work at the location, and Walmart is hiring for automation equipment operators and other roles.

“The opening of our new high-tech perishable distribution center, marks a major step forward in how we get fresher products to customers faster — whether that’s in-store, delivered to their home, or even restocking their refrigerator,” said Rob Montgomery, EVP of supply chain for Walmart U.S., in the announcement.

Dive Insight:

The Wellford facility is the third of five new perishable distribution centers Walmart is opening nationwide as the retail giant continues to beef up its grocery supply chain.

Facilities in Shafter, California, and Lancaster, Texas, are also up and running, with locations in Belvidere, Illinois, and Pilesgrove, New Jersey, slated to follow. Walmart said last year it is adding over half a million square feet per site to four of its traditional perishable distribution centers as well.

The Wellford location and other new perishables-focused facilities can process over double the volume of a traditional distribution center by tapping into automation and artificial intelligence, according to Walmart.

Processing begins when cases from farmers and suppliers arrive at the facility and are stored in an automated storage system. High-tech systems then build store-specific pallets from those cases to ensure eggs and other fragile items are placed near the top to limit damage. Pallets are then wrapped and loaded onto a truck for shipping.

“AI tracks every pallet to ensure accuracy and freshness,” last week’s announcement said. “This technology also makes unloading at stores faster and easier, allowing store associates to spend more time helping customers.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/H_cvlPGUXRWFoVIbNJPKgNWMsOHJKFqlLHaVA11XANE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9leHRlcmlvci1vZi1wZXJpc2hhYmxlLWRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvbi1jZW50ZXItd2VsbGZvcmQtc2MuanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-09 15:18:41.614839

Conclusion France's political instability in 2025 is a double-edged sword: it introduces uncertainty but also creates opportunities for investors who can identify resilient sectors.
French banks, manufacturing innovators, and agile exporters are demonstrating that structural reforms, technological adoption, and international diversification can mitigate political risks.","Political instability in France has reached a critical juncture in 2025, with the collapse of Prime Minister François Bayrou's government and the failure of a €44 billion austerity plan underscoring deepening fiscal and political challenges. Yet, amid this turbulence, certain sectors—banks, manufacturing, and export-driven industries—demonstrate remarkable resilience, offering strategic opportunities for investors willing to navigate the uncertainty. This analysis explores how these sectors are weathering the storm and outlines actionable strategies to capitalize on their strengths.

French Banks: A Pillar of Stability in a Shifting Landscape

French banks have proven their mettle in 2025, maintaining strong credit quality and profitability despite geopolitical headwinds. According to a report by the European Central Bank (ECB), European banks, including major French institutions, exceeded Q1 2025 earnings expectations and upheld full-year guidance, even as global trade tensions escalated. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) further notes that French banks have shown resilience under severe geopolitical and recessionary conditions, with robust capital buffers and stable net interest income.

However, risks persist. Rising sovereign spreads and the potential for credit rating downgrades could increase borrowing costs for businesses and households. For investors, this underscores the importance of selecting banks with strong balance sheets and diversified international exposure. BNP Paribas and Société Générale, for instance, have bolstered their risk management frameworks and operational resilience, positioning them as safer bets in this environment.

Manufacturing: Innovation as a Buffer Against Uncertainty

France's manufacturing sector, particularly in aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals, remains a cornerstone of economic resilience. The pharmaceutical industry, for example, is witnessing a surge in demand for benzylamine—a critical chemical intermediate in drug synthesis. The market is projected to grow at a 6.3% CAGR, reaching $36.8 million by 2032, driven by AI-driven production efficiencies and green chemistry innovations.

Aerospace, another pillar of the sector, benefits from strategic government support. The 2025 French defense budget allocates significant resources to space defense and advanced technologies, signaling long-term commitment to innovation. While foreign direct investment (FDI) in European manufacturing fell by 9% in 2024, France's focus on digitalization and workforce training—highlighted by the OECD—positions it to regain competitiveness.

Investors should prioritize companies leveraging structural reforms and technological adoption. For example, Safran and Thales are integrating AI and automation to offset rising energy costs and supply chain disruptions.

Export-Driven Industries: Adapting to a Fractured Global Trade Order

The 2025 U.S.-China trade war has reshaped global supply chains, but French exporters in machinery, agrifood, and cleantech are adapting. The agrifood sector, in particular, is poised for growth, with the OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2025-2034 projecting a 14% increase in global production over the next decade. French agrifood giants like Danone and Lactalis are leveraging productivity gains and sustainable practices to maintain their edge.

Cleantech also presents compelling opportunities. The European Cleantech Q2 Briefing 2025 notes a rebound in venture investment, with EU cleantech funding reaching €2.5 billion in Q2 2025. Policies like the Clean Industrial Decarbonisation Accelerator Act further support this sector, making companies like Orano and EDF attractive for long-term investors.

Actionable Investment Strategies

ETFs and Equities with International Exposure: The 40 Index, trading at 14.8 times forward earnings, offers exposure to globally diversified French blue chips like LVMH, L'Oreal, and TotalEnergies. These firms derive 80% of revenue from overseas markets, insulating them from domestic political volatility.

Sector-Specific ETFs: Consider thematic ETFs focused on pharmaceuticals (e.g., iShares Global Healthcare) or cleantech (e.g., Amundi Cleantech) to capitalize on high-growth niches.

Risk Mitigation via Diversification: For exporters, diversifying supply chains and expanding into emerging markets (e.g., Southeast Asia) can reduce reliance on U.S. trade.

Long-Term Structural Bets: Invest in companies aligning with France's fiscal consolidation goals, such as those in digital services or green infrastructure.

Conclusion

France's political instability in 2025 is a double-edged sword: it introduces uncertainty but also creates opportunities for investors who can identify resilient sectors. French banks, manufacturing innovators, and agile exporters are demonstrating that structural reforms, technological adoption, and international diversification can mitigate political risks. By focusing on these pillars, investors can navigate the turbulence and position themselves for long-term gains in a reordering global economy.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-09 18:17:13.648146

More than ever, there’s truth in the idea that “the most successful people leaders are business leaders,” Morris says.","HR leaders today are racing to keep up with a pace of change that is unprecedented for the profession. AI is transforming all facets of the function, employees need—and HR has to forecast—the skills to innovate in the future, record rates of burnout are dragging down engagement and productivity. How can HR get ahead in such an environment? The HR executive at the largest employer in the United States is doing so with a simple mantra in mind: Take action—and do it today.

HR is an “architect” of the business, says Donna Morris, executive vice president and chief people officer at Walmart. This means HR people professionals need to “get out of the administrative [work] and stop talking about, ‘Do I have a seat at the table?’ ”

Own the role of a “strategist,” Morris says, and use that platform to design talent processes around the vision for future business outcomes. That approach underlies Morris’ work at Walmart, which earned her the title of 2025 HR Executive of the Year from HR Executive.

The award recognizes HR excellence and innovation among leaders who have significantly elevated the strategic role of their function. Morris will be among those honored for excellence in HR and HR technology during the inaugural HR Icons Awards next week in Las Vegas.

Company-changing leadership

Morris joined the retail giant in 2020, just one month before the start of the pandemic, after 17 years at Adobe. Today, she oversees all people operations for the company’s 2.1 million global employees, including 1.5 million in the U.S.—with a focus on the interplay between technology transformation, employee experience and long-term business outcomes.

“As Walmart continues to change and put technology to work to better serve our customers, members and associates in new and exciting ways,” wrote Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart, in Morris’ nomination letter, “her leadership continues to change our company. Donna and her team are ensuring our associates remain our priority as we prepare them for the future and provide opportunities to thrive in a tech-powered world.”

AI at Walmart: education and experimentation

As AI rapidly redefines work, Morris has led Walmart’s efforts to design its role in the employee experience.

In 2023, Morris took about 60 team members to the San Francisco Bay Area to do a “deep dive on all things AI.” About two months later, the team rolled out Me@Campus. The all-in-one mobile and desktop solution, for about 50,000 office associates, supports everything from hiring to onboarding, performance management, facilities booking and more.

The platform was later launched as MyWalmart for field-based associates, as the company calls its employees, and Me@Sams for Sam’s Club associates.

Within the platforms, workers have access to My Assistant. Powered by generative AI—and versed in more than 50,000 company policies and procedures—My Assistant was designed to be a “playground” for AI experimentation among employees, who are encouraged to tap the tech for myriad ways to make their jobs more efficient.

As the tool got off the ground, associates across functions and segments participated in “roadshows and bootcamps,” Morris says, which educated them about everything from the potential role of AI at work to the best way to write a prompt. These “regular opportunities” for employees to listen, learn and try the technology have been critical to reducing the fear that often comes with tech integration at work.

Employees across the country have since offered more than 4 million prompts through My Assistant.

“They are now finding ways to disrupt their jobs, or disrupt aspects of their jobs, but they’re not feeling threatened,” Morris says. “Our role in HR is to help equip individuals with skills and provide an environment where they’re not afraid.”

Preparing for AI with transparency and foresight

Employees have to know that change is coming—through AI or other means—and that they shouldn’t fear, but rather, should embrace it, Morris says. Role modeling by HR can be critical to this end. Morris has been working to educate her own team about AI integration so that they can serve as company-wide ambassadors.

For instance, this summer, the total rewards team hosted an expo showcasing how more than 40 associates had leveraged AI in different ways to reimagine their workflows.

“In doing that, it created a comfort level for people to try and experiment and learn,” she says.

Morris says she personally is using AI, specifically ChatGPT, almost daily.

“It’s only making me more effective,” she says.

‘Acknowledge’ the worry

Yet, fear about AI integration is palpable in workforces across industries, Morris notes. HR’s first line of defense against that sentiment, she says, is transparency.

“We have to acknowledge [the fear],” she says. “The more transparent you are, the better.”

Noting the persistent ambiguity in the landscape, however, Morris says frequent communication from HR is essential. Be supportive of change—“to the point of being empathetic,” she advises—and equip workforces with the skills they will need to thrive in a world that is going to look different.

Earlier this month, Walmart announced that it is one of the first participants in the Certificates program from OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. In 2026, Walmart associates will have access to free OpenAI certification.

‘Fixing the toil’ in HR with AI

HR’s critical hand in reimagining workflows, roles and its own processes in light of AI’s influence is placing new expectations on the function.

More than ever, there’s truth in the idea that “the most successful people leaders are business leaders,” Morris says.

HR professionals who are “out and in front of AI” are spending time understanding the real business challenges and envisioning how AI could fill in gaps. Walmart, for instance, is leveraging technology to offload administrative work from associates trained in merchandising so they can focus on finding the items that will resonate with customers—boosting both customer and employee experience.

“If we can use technology to take out some of the work that is more duplicative, more operational in nature, then our employees are actually able to spend more of their time on the more human work,” Morris says.

Key to that aim for HR professionals is getting “proximate to the business to figure out what problems they are trying to solve, and where might they be able to apply digital or AI to be more effective and more productive.”

Where is Walmart’s AI journey headed?

That’s the directive for Morris’ team at Walmart, as they focus on “fixing the toil” and enabling HR professionals to concentrate on more people-centric duties.

The work is already proving effective: Walmart built an AI tool that walks job candidates through an interview, prep work that previously took considerable time for recruiters. The team is looking at how AI can be applied for interview scheduling to continue to relieve the administrative burden on recruiters. Morris’ team is also starting to use large language models to predict salary trends in the market, enabling its professionals to spend more time reimagining rewards plans.

“If I were to forecast a year from now,” Morris says, “I would say there’s probably not a single function across the people team here at Walmart that won’t be shaped somehow because of AI.”

Skills for the future

Given the impact that tech is having on Walmart’s operations, including in HR, leaders have been deliberate in ensuring the focus is right: The company is “people-led, tech-powered.”

“We wanted to make sure that we were underscoring the order of how we were going to drive our strategy going forward,” Morris says. “It was going to be people—and then, it was going to be technology.”

That means the company has invested heavily in equipping its people for exactly what it means to be tech-powered, with a focus on skills-building—all part of a $1 billion investment to provide U.S. associates career-focused training by 2026.

“Donna’s leadership at Walmart in upskilling teaches all of us that skills matter more than pedigrees and you need an investment model for your associates,” says Peter Fasolo, former CHRO of Johnson & Johnson, the 2022 HR Executive of the Year and a judge for this year’s competition.

In 2022, its Walmart Academy, which focuses on training, went global. Last year, Walmart significantly expanded the formal learning opportunities available to associates, including more than doubling the short-form certificates and courses offered through Live Better U.

The ROI of skills-building

The education benefit, offered in partnership with Guild, is available to all full- and part-time hourly and salaried associates—from their first day. Currently, more than 136,000 of them have taken advantage of the benefit, Morris says.

The MyWalmart platform, Morris says, is among the avenues through which the company pushes reminders about learning opportunities.

“We are actively working to, frankly, market within our own organization the ability for someone to be educated—on the job or through a pathway like Walmart Academy,” she says.

Associates who have participated in skills-building programs report higher engagement and retention levels, Morris says, as well as more job mobility. This year, about 78% of jobs have been filled internally, she says.

One prime example is the path to being a driver. By this fall, the company will have educated 1,000 associates to go from working in jobs such as at a distribution center to the role of driver, with a starting salary of $90,000.

“We’ve taken the supply of our own internal talent and have focused on, where do we see the future going in terms of skills and capabilities? How do we equip our own associates with those skills and capabilities?” Morris says.

A collaborative approach from the HR Executive of the Year

These are questions Morris is also encouraging other business leaders to consider. She was integral in bringing to life the inaugural Opportunity Summit in Washington, D.C., last year—uniting stakeholders that included business and nonprofit leaders, government officials and workforce experts to explore the potential of skills-based strategies. A key goal and outcome of the event was the development of a skills taxonomy for core frontline roles, encompassing 11 million U.S. jobs, and the launch of the Skills-First Workforce Initiative.

Fasolo worked with Morris and her team during the D.C. summit while he was at J&J.

“Donna and Walmart continue to have the credibility to pull together employers, government officials, NGOs and others to share what we are doing in upskilling,” he says. “The idea is to create a framework to understand a taxonomy for a common language across multiple jobs. This is a great example of Donna’s thought leadership and being a role model for our profession.”

The next summit will be held in Bentonville, Ark., where Walmart is headquartered, in 2026. Then, Morris says, the organization will “pass the baton” to another organizer as stakeholders work to extend the skills framework to cover 40% of U.S. jobs.

“Our largest workforce is a frontline workforce, and we want to celebrate the skills they acquire on the job and make sure that they’re able to capture those skills and communicate about them as they progress their careers,” she says.

Managers of the future

Associates aren’t the only ones whose skills Walmart is investing in.

Morris was a key force behind the 2022 launch of Manager Academy, a week-long, in-person training for managers in Bentonville. By the end of 2025, all managers of U.S. stores, clubs and supply chain operations will have completed the program.

The training takes a unique human-centric approach to management—focusing on company values and how managers can lead with empathy, navigate change and build relationships with both employees and customers.

These are skills, Morris says, that will be increasingly essential in a tech-powered organization.

“We could all walk around with our eyes in our devices, without stepping back and saying as managers and leaders, ‘It’s actually about the human connection,’ ” she says.

When managers are well-equipped with both the technical know-how and an understanding of how to lead with Walmart’s values at the forefront, their leadership becomes more empathetic and effective, Morris says.

For example, she points to a tool Walmart created that can, among other capabilities, push notifications out to managers of attendance red flags. From there, managers can lean into the connection with their employee to get ahead of a potential issue.

In one week this summer, managers made 50,000 check-ins with associates—conversations driven in part by technology.

“That’s digital equipping,” Morris says. “That’s awareness of how to use digital tools, but more importantly, it’s allowing our managers to spend more time with people, which is paramount to our business.”

Wellbeing driven by listening

That investment in Walmart’s people came to life particularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, the response to which Morris helmed. Among the immediate actions was the rollout of a COVID policy that guaranteed employees paid leave to care for themselves or loved ones during a diagnosis.

“We leaned in to really ensure that their safety and their wellbeing were secured,” she says. The company’s focus on wellbeing—with “real, deliberate” change to support employees’ mental, physical and financial health, such as providing access to counseling for all employees, regardless of whether they participate in the health plan—helped “establish strength and trust and, frankly, even affection between employees and the business,” Morris says.

Staying in tune with the needs of employees is key to how Walmart evolves its benefits offerings to support wellbeing. The Associate Engagement Survey is a critical listening tool, and Morris’ team also “scrapes social data”—from Glassdoor to Reddit—and considers onboarding and exit interview commentary.

At its annual Associates Week—where more than 10,000 associates from around the globe come together for a celebration that has a “career fair” bent to it—employees can offer feedback by participating in listening booths, which are also available at regular associate and leadership meetings.

Walmart’s listening strategy revealed that associates were eager to have more ownership in their employment experience—leading the company to roll out a 3-for-1 stock split to make stock purchases more affordable for employees. Currently, 500,000 associates buy stock regularly, Morris says.

The business case for leading-edge benefits

Employee feedback was also a driver behind the 2022 launch of family-building benefits with partner Kindbody. Associates can access support with fertility treatments, adoption and surrogacy. More than 2,200 employees and their family members have utilized the benefit, with about 275 babies born or on the way.

As HR leaders seek to build a business case for benefits and programs that support employee wellbeing, Morris advises that they lead with business acumen. Know the metrics and margins—and how they could shape the potential investment. Appreciate the business problems you’re trying to solve, and focus on how to actively manage costs—which, ultimately, means managing health outcomes.

Amassing “big data sets” can be a critical tool, she says. For instance, understand the top illnesses affecting certain parts of the workforce; sometimes, small actions—like offering flu clinics in the fall, knowing that absenteeism spikes during flu season—can have meaningful business impacts, Morris says.

“My caveat is: Do not chase what the competition does,” she says. “In HR, we can have envy: ‘This company’s doing that,’ and we need to step back and figure out what we need to do for our own business. It’s not always following what your competition does. It’s what’s right for you.”

A new vision for HR leadership

Viewing talent and business strategy as intrinsically linked, Morris says, is key to evaluating the success of HR efforts. Engagement and retention data are important metrics, but HR should also consider broader business outcomes.

“If business performance starts to soften, then I think you have to step back and say, ‘Are all of our strategies relevant to our people?’ ” she says. “Are they a positive contributor, or are they actually putting a burden on the operating principles of the organization?”

The answers to such questions will grow increasingly complex as the “rate of change accelerates,” Morris notes.

In addition, HR professionals must continue to focus on their own learning to stay on the leading edge in such a dynamic environment. For instance, she recently spent time with the HR leaders at a small AI start-up and OpenAI—in part to stimulate her own “intellectual curiosity” and to role model for her team the power of continuous learning, an essential tool for HR professionals who want to position themselves as strategic contributors.

“All of our jobs continue to morph and be reimagined—I don’t think our learning can ever stop,” she says.

Leading in a transformative moment

Morris is one, Fasolo says, who is always willing to share her own learnings with peers across the profession.

“Donna is on my ‘speed dial’ when I need to work my way through an issue or need a perspective on a workforce issue,” he says.

Constant learning, a willingness to do things differently and the ability to prioritize communication that brings the workforce along can help HR leaders “lead the change” in such an environment.

But, Morris says, getting ahead of change is going to require HR to rethink some long-held norms about the function and their own leadership.

“I will say sometimes in HR, we’re great at changing others. We’re not great at changing ourselves,” she says. “This is a period of time when HR has to be out in front, changing ourselves so that we can actually be role models for the business.”

Top takeaways on HR’s strategic future

The 2025 HR Executive of the Year, Donna Morris of Walmart, says HR needs to embrace change to make their functions truly transformative—from recognizing both the pain points and potential of AI to getting ahead of skills gaps and employee wellbeing challenges.

Here are her top insights for HR professionals riding this wave of change:

AI transformation is as much about the “human” element as it is about the tech. Successful transformation will require HR to understand current and needed workforce skills—and to navigate employee fear through education. With the right strategy, AI can be a force multiplier for a human-centric HR function.

Closing skills gaps can no longer be done organization by organization. Morris advocates for collaborative approaches that bring together employers, government entities, nonprofits and workforce leaders. Employees need to see a defined career path, within and outside their respective organizations, and be armed with the skills to navigate that journey in a quickly changing world.

Wellbeing investment can be a powerful driver of culture. It’s critical to stay attuned to what support employees need to stay engaged, and to leverage business acumen—informed by data-driven insights—to gain leadership buy-in. Wellness strategies that align with employee needs can drive trust and morale in the long term, Morris says.",https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/Executive-of-the-Year.png,N,,2025-09-09 17:21:34.601710

House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) and Federal Law Enforcement Subcommittee Chair Clay Higgins (R-La.) sent a letter last week to David Joyner, president and CEO of CVS Health. In the letter, they accused the company of sending inflammatory and misleading text messages—including warnings about pharmacy closures, higher prescription costs and loss of service providers—to urge customers to pressure Louisiana lawmakers to oppose House Bill 358.

H.B. 358 would ban providers in Louisiana from operating both pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and individual pharmacies. If enacted, the law would prevent CVS Health from simultaneously operating CVS Caremark and its 119 CVS Pharmacy locations in the state.

“This text message campaign raises ethical and potential legal issues if indeed CVS Pharmacy used confidential patient information … to lobby against H.B. 358,” the letter stated.

The lawmakers allege that CVS Health used protected patient data for political advocacy, which would violate HIPAA. They expressed concern that CVS could misuse this information in future legislative efforts.

The executive said the certification course will be available in 2026, though employees currently have access to some AI-related training through the retailer’s Live Better U education benefit.

Walmart says this is part of its effort to commit nearly $1 billion to skills training through 2026.

Dive Insight:

The pairing of one of the world’s largest retailers and a leading AI technology company marks a major moment for the retail industry.

“The future of retail won’t be defined by technology alone — it will be defined by people who know how to use it,” Walmart U.S. President and CEO John Furner said in a LinkedIn post Thursday. “By bringing AI training directly to our associates, we’ll enable our people to maximize the benefit of AI-powered technology — giving them the skills they need to rewrite the playbook and shape the future of retail.”

The news builds on a slew of recent AI-related updates from Walmart.

The mass retailer in July debuted a unified and company-wide AI framework centered around four “super agents.” Those agents (intended to support various business touchpoints and minimize user confusion) include: the customer-facing Sparky agent that launched in June; the partner agent Marty for suppliers, advertisers and sellers; a store-centric associate agent; and an agent for company tech developers.

The updated framework coincided with the announcement that Walmart named former Instacart executive Daniel Danker to be executive vice president of AI acceleration, product and design.

For now, positive financial impacts from AI adoption have yet to yield results at Walmart.

“As it relates to AI, I don’t think it’s lifting our top-line sales yet,” Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon told analysts on an earnings call in August. “I think this is very early days. But I am excited about the road map, as I mentioned.

In today’s “do more with less” environment, holistic measurement is essential. Measurement doesn’t just validate the past. It informs what to do next, why it matters, and how it drives the business.

Too often, measurement is fragmented, reactive, or buried in a PowerPoint. That’s a mistake. Marketing must be measured holistically:

Brand Health: Do people know us? Trust us? Want to buy from us? Brand equity, NPS, and ongoing qualitative research give shape to how the Brand is perceived and how that perception shifts over time. And Brand health is one of the most reliable predictors of long-term growth.

Creative Effectiveness: Great media can’t rescue bad creative. Pre-testing and in-flight evaluation (i.e., lifts, testing, or eye tracking) help ensure ideas resonate and evolve. Creative is a multiplier, not a variable to ignore.

Campaign Effectiveness: Paid, organic, owned, and earned media - plus events, sponsorships, content, websites, and macroeconomics - should ladder up to something measurable. But rather than drowning in dashboards, focus on holistic insights: what’s working, what’s not, and where to pivot.

Commercial Impact: Marketing must drive business results. Attribution and incrementality testing help quantify returns and make the case for sustained or increased investment. But be cautious about using ROI as the only success metric. ROI reflects efficiency, not scale. The goal isn’t to chase the highest ROI. ROI may dip, even as revenue grows. The goal is to grow the business efficiently. Any ROI above 1 means you're generating more than you’re spending.

Many organizations struggle with this. Why? Because it’s not easy changing the culture of siloed teams, underinvestment in tech and automation, and “reporting” over insights. Without executive buy-in, integrated systems, and a clear purpose behind the metrics, even the best frameworks fall flat.

High-performing teams embrace a measurement culture rooted in agility and accountability. They test, learn, and adapt. They treat “failures” as feedback loops, not red flags. They prioritize learning agendas and avoid analysis paralysis. Most importantly, they turn data into simple, human insights that inform decisions, not just reports.

Technology is essential. Connecting fragmented data, automating reporting, and surfacing insights in real-time is table stakes. And AI can accelerate everything.

From creative testing to predictive modeling, AI can reduce what used to take weeks to hours. It won’t replace marketers, but it removes friction so they can focus on interpretation, storytelling, and decision-making.

The best CMOs don’t just ask, “What did we get for our spend?” They ask, “What did we learn, and how will we do it better next time?” They also recognize that expectations must remain grounded, e.g., halving the budget is unlikely to deliver exponential growth. Measurement shines not by performing miracles, but by enabling better, faster decisions, within the bounds of reality.

Marketing measurement isn’t just about accountability. It’s about acceleration. It gives marketers the clarity to act, the confidence to invest, and the credibility to lead. To unlock that value, you have to invest in the people, technology, and processes to build that culture.

Major apparel retailers, including Levi Strauss, are increasingly focusing on selling products at full price to test the resilience of their wealthier customer base, as reported by Reuters. This strategy comes amid a broader market environment where the financial health of affluent consumers, bolstered by stock market gains and lower debt, contrasts with the bargain-seeking behavior of lower-income households affected by price increases. According to data from the IndexBox platform, consumer spending patterns in the apparel sector have shown a notable bifurcation, with the top income decile driving a disproportionate share of market activity.

Levi's raised prices on some products in July but reported no slowdown in demand, according to the denim maker's chief financial officer, Harmit Singh. He noted that the core Levi's consumer, who largely earns over $100,000 annually, has remained resilient. This sentiment is echoed by other industry players; Ralph Lauren, Under Armour, and Abercrombie & Fitch are also leaning into a more full-price strategy, as indicated in recent earnings disclosures. The shift is a deliberate move to capitalize on a consumer segment that appears largely unaffected by the cooling labor market and ongoing trade tensions.

The strategy is underpinned by advanced consumer-tracking technology that allows retailers to pivot quickly. Instead of store-wide markdowns, companies can now offer targeted, geo-specific promotions for items that are not moving, helping to protect overall profit margins. Many companies have already absorbed a significant portion of recent tariff costs and, compared to previous years, intend to discount as little as possible through the crucial holiday shopping season, using a test-and-learn approach to pricing seasonal goods.

Ralph Lauren is once again testing the boundaries of fashion and technology with the relaunch of Ask Ralph, this time as an artificial intelligence–powered shopping tool. Available on the brand’s app starting Tuesday, the new feature marks the company’s first consumer-facing AI integration.

The initiative draws on the brand’s long history with digital innovation. When Ralph Lauren first ventured online 25 years ago, Ask Ralph debuted as a simple Q&A platform where the designer and his team fielded 100 of the most common style questions. Today, powered by Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service, the new version brings that legacy into the age of generative AI.

The chat-based tool uses natural language processing to provide shoppable outfit suggestions in real time. For example, a query about what to wear to a winter wedding in Miami generates a carousel of complete Ralph Lauren looks ready to purchase. While the system draws on the company’s archive and philosophy, its focus remains squarely on live inventory and commerce.

David Lauren, chief branding and innovation officer, sees the tool as a continuation of the brand’s approach to storytelling through technology. “The most difficult thing for any company is to find the right technology to help you tell your story,” he said. “This feels like a very obvious opportunity — not just because everybody’s talking about it, but because it has an ability to learn with us.”

The technology has been under development for a year, absorbing the designer’s style philosophy, brand DNA, and historical imagery. Still, the service maintains clear boundaries: when asked about competitors or politics, it demurs rather than speculate. “We’re not here to try to be clever with it,” Lauren said. “Our aim was to pull from a live inventory of what’s on the site right now.”

Lauren added that this is just the beginning. Future iterations could include voice activation, integration with the Ralph Lauren Collection business, or expansion across additional platforms. “It’s going to become more and more valuable quickly,” he said, noting that weekly learnings will shape its evolution.

Industry analysts predict generative AI could add $150 billion to $275 billion to fashion’s operating profits by 2030, with consumer-facing tools like Ask Ralph expected to play a significant role. For Ralph Lauren, the move underscores a careful but forward-looking strategy. “Everybody’s racing,” Lauren said. “Don’t. Just stop racing. Set your own pace, understand who you are and move carefully to understand how your brand is best married to technology.”",https://theimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ralph-Lauren-Spring-2025-News-The-Impression-002.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 16:17:03.956921

Chevron is expanding its global gas business to meet this demand.
“If you think of the global energy system, it’s a key component,” says Brian Essner, Chevron’s General Manager of LNG Origination & Commercial.","While the push for renewables and clean energy continues at pace, Chevron still believes the need for oil and gas is equally as important.

The energy firm's Chairman and CEO Mike Wirth recently emphasised its dual mandate in a series of interviews, including on CNBC’s Power Lunch with Brian Sullivan, where he said: “We have to meet the demands of the economy today, even as we invest in technologies for tomorrow.”

This simple principle underpins Chevron’s strategy to provide reliable, affordable energy while also lowering the carbon intensity of its portfolio and building out new lower carbon solutions.

Meeting energy needs today while investing for tomorrow

Global energy demand continues to rise due to population growth, industrialisation and the increasing needs of digital infrastructure.

In 2025, Chevron expects to reach one million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the Permian Basin in the US, as well as bring on additional projects in the US Gulf of Mexico and achieve first oil at the Future Growth Project in Tengiz, in Kazakhstan.

Mike also told CNBC’s Brian Sullivan: “We don’t control demand, we supply demand. And so, we will grow our oil and gas business over the next five years.”

While continuing this growth, Chevron is also accelerating investment in reducing operational emissions and scaling new energy technologies.

“We need to reduce the emissions from traditional energy, which we’re doing by reducing our carbon intensity of oil and gas that we produce today,” said Mike.

“At the same time, we’re investing in new technologies to grow new sources of supply as demand for all forms of energy continues to grow.”

Why this balance matters

The world is already witnessing record energy demand, with last year’s oil demand at an all-time high and this year's demand set to be even higher, according to Chevron.

Oil and gas are projected to remain a substantial part of the world’s energy mix to 2050 across a wide range of future scenarios published by the IEA, OPEC, EIA and others.

Sustaining energy security while lowering emissions is therefore essential.

Chevron is advancing multiple pathways to lower carbon energy, including:

Methane reductions: working toward reaching its upstream methane-intensity target by 2028, after reducing the methane intensity of its oil and gas operations by more than 50% since 2016.

Renewable fuels: now the second-largest producer of renewable fuels in the U.S.

Hydrogen and storage: investing in a hydrogen project that enables utility- and industrial-scale storage of renewable energy.

Mike emphasised that durable climate progress requires pragmatic policy that “rules in” more solutions, not fewer.

“There are three things that really matter when you talk about energy: affordability, reliability and the environment,” he said during an interview with Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of S&P Global.

“If you have an energy policy that focuses on only one of those, you can create unintended consequences and have something that is not sustainable.”

Just as important are scalability and speed. “If we can’t scale them up, they can’t make a difference,” he said in the interview.

“And then if you get solutions that work on scale, we need to do it with some speed and that’s where capital markets come in and you harness private investment.

“If you start to rule parts of the solution out, you’re never going to solve the problem. And so, we need to rule things in.”

The clean energy transition

While Chevron specialises in oil and gas, it also advocates for the importance of renewable and clean energy too.

“We have to be able to do both,” said Mike, speaking at the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Summit.

“One of the big challenges for an energy company like ours is we’ve got a big business today that meets the needs of the world, and we’ve got customers and economies around the world that depend on what we do to keep the lights on and the trains going.”

Natural gas is central to enabling an affordable, reliable and lower carbon system. It powers homes and industry, supports manufacturing, fertiliser production and hydrogen generation, and is widely used to generate electricity.

With US electricity consumption projected to hit record highs in 2025–2026 and global electricity demand rising through 2026, gas-fired power provides dispatchable capacity that complements variable renewables and helps integrate more clean energy.

Chevron is expanding its global gas business to meet this demand.

ACSI notes that HP dropped a point from last year’s score while Apple fell three points.
This ACSI report concludes with a helpful table listing overall satisfaction with these three categories, as well as every other one ACSI covers.
Televisions have a score of 82, household appliances and computers tie at 81, and vacuums follow at 79.","Apple has lost its spot atop a long-running study of customer satisfaction in computers to one of its older Silicon Valley neighbors. HP is in the lead with a score of 83 out of 100, with Apple and Dell tied at 82, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index’s (ACSI) latest survey.

ACSI notes that HP dropped a point from last year’s score while Apple fell three points. It doesn’t suggest why the former stayed strong while the latter skidded beyond crediting HP for combining “high-quality products with a strong value proposition.”

Dell is the only company to improve in ACSI’s survey, gaining two points from last year’s score of 80. Four other brands earn lower scores in this category, which includes tablets as well as laptops and desktops: Samsung at 81; Lenovo at 79; Amazon at 78; Asus and Microsoft at 76 each; and Acer at 75.

PCMag’s reviewers may disagree with those ratings. Our lists of the best laptops for 2025 and our best tablets list do not include any HP machines. They do, however, appear in our roundup of best business laptops. HP also got a decent score in our February Readers' Choice survey, but not as good as MSI, Asus, Lenovo, or Dell.

The ACSI survey makes broader points about the computer industry, in particular pointing to the call-center experience (the worst-rated part of the computer user industry with a score of 78) as a missed opportunity.

“Contact centers give companies valuable opportunities for customer engagement,” it reads. “The service provided during these interactions can drive overall satisfaction higher and build brand loyalty when customers find helpful representatives who can offer knowledgeable guidance across a variety of topics.”

(Note the absence of any suggestion that AI handle customer support.)

This edition of the index also assesses customer satisfaction with TVs, appliances, and (for the first time) vacuums, in keeping with the ACSI’s habit of surveying consumer attitudes in a few related markets at the same time.

Samsung leads the TV category at 83, with ACSI complimenting Samsung as “a pioneer in introducing cutting-edge technology.” But all of the brands assessed earned high scores: Hisense and Vizio tied for second place with 82 each, LG and TCL tied for third at 81 each (TCL improved notably from last year’s score of 79), and Sony just behind at 80.

Again, our reviewers could quibble with that ranking, as no Samsung sets appear in our best TVs list. In our Readers' Choice survey from last month, however, they came out on top, returning to the winner’s circle for the first time in almost a decade.

In appliances—meaning major kitchen and laundry appliances—Samsung and Whirlpool tie for first at 82 each. LG follows at 81, with Bosch, Electrolux, and Haier (including the GE and Hotpoint brands) tied at 80 apiece. Bosch shows the biggest improvement, having finished last with a score of 78 last year.

ACSI’s coverage of vacuums includes not just robot vacuums but plain old vacuums. Samsung leads this category too with a score of 82, followed by Shark (81), Bissell, and Dyson (80 each), Roomba (78), Dirt Devil, and Eureka (77 apiece), and Electrolux and Hoover (both 76).

This ACSI report concludes with a helpful table listing overall satisfaction with these three categories, as well as every other one ACSI covers. Televisions have a score of 82, household appliances and computers tie at 81, and vacuums follow at 79. In comparison, the highest-ranked industry the ASCI covers is soft drinks, with a score of 84, while subscription-TV services land at the bottom of the list with a score of 70. (I wonder why?)

Michigan-based ASCI collected this latest set of results from 16,205 completed surveys from customers chosen randomly and reached via email between July 2024 and June 2025.",https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/0610WaHMUF0VjsCZEuwmgzT-2.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1757380496.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 14:24:13.503032

Ikea hopes to open kitchen planning studios, or smaller spaces that offer customers advice on kitchen design, in 10 Best Buy locations in Florida and Texas later this year, the report said.
Tolga Öncü, retail manager at Ingka, which operates almost all Ikea stores worldwide, said this is part of an experiment to expand the retailer’s presence in a way that’s faster than simply opening new stores, per the report.
Best Buy did its “homework in locations where Ikea is not [present],” Öncü said, per the report.
“In-store shopping also gives you access to new customer segments who prefer in-person shopping and can also result in higher conversion rates.”","The Swedish furniture seller is looking into using space inside other retailers’ locations to expand its customer base in “mature” markets in the United States and Europe, the Financial Times reported Tuesday (Sept. 9).

Ikea hopes to open kitchen planning studios, or smaller spaces that offer customers advice on kitchen design, in 10 Best Buy locations in Florida and Texas later this year, the report said.

Tolga Öncü, retail manager at Ingka, which operates almost all Ikea stores worldwide, said this is part of an experiment to expand the retailer’s presence in a way that’s faster than simply opening new stores, per the report.

He added that the Best Buy partnership would bring Ikea “closer to more of the many people” in the U.S. and could be “yet another component for us to accelerate our reach, especially in big mature countries,” according to the report.

Ikea has revamped its business model in recent years, shifting from requiring customers to trek to out-of-town warehouses to pick and assemble the furniture themselves, the report said. It has begun opening shops in city centers, while providing online ordering as well as home delivery and assembly services.

Executives say that customers appreciate the extra convenience of being able to shop on their lunch hour, but some have been frustrated by a lack of availability of products, according to the report.

Best Buy did its “homework in locations where Ikea is not [present],” Öncü said, per the report. “If we were to start and look for a smaller format of Ikea in the same location, it can take years before the square meters become free.”

Ikea is one of relatively few retailers that is still expanding, using its large stores as fulfillment centers for eCommerce orders, the report said.

Emily Amor, a Shopify marketing expert at Digital Darts, told PYMNTS in February that eCommerce brands get immediate credibility when they venture into physical retail.

“It tells customers you’ve grown beyond the screen, proving your popularity and success in a way that online presence alone can’t,” she said. “In-store shopping also gives you access to new customer segments who prefer in-person shopping and can also result in higher conversion rates.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Ikea.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 14:23:38.233274

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

Most of this technology came from companies in a country that has long claimed to support freedoms worldwide: the United States.

Over the past quarter century, American tech companies to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, playing a far greater role in enabling human rights abuses than previously known, an Associated Press investigation found. They sold billions of dollars of technology to the Chinese police, government and surveillance companies, despite repeated warnings from the U.S. Congress and in the media that such tools were being used to quash dissent, persecute religious sects and target minorities.

Most of the companies that responded said they fully complied with all laws, sanctions and U.S. export controls governing business in China, past and present. Here are key findings:

America brought ‘predicative policing’ to China

U.S. companies introduced systems that mine a vast array of information — texts, calls, payments, flights, video, DNA swabs, mail deliveries, the internet, even water and power use — to unearth individuals deemed suspicious and predict their movements. But this technology also allows Chinese police to threaten friends and family and preemptively detain people for crimes they have not even committed. The AP found a Chinese defense contractor, Huadi, worked with IBM in 2009 to design the main policing system for Beijing to censor the internet and crack down on alleged terrorists, the Falun Gong religious sect, and even villagers deemed troublesome. IBM referred to any possible relationship it may have had with Chinese government agencies as “old, stale interactions”: “ ... If older systems are being abused today — and IBM has no knowledge that they are — the misuse is entirely outside of IBM’s control, was not contemplated by IBM decades ago, and in no way reflects on IBM today.” Huadi did not respond.

US tech enabled the Xinjiang crackdown

American surveillance technologies allowed a brutal mass detention campaign in the far west region of Xinjiang — targeting, tracking and grading virtually the entire native Uyghur population to forcibly assimilate and subdue them. IBM agents in China sold its i2 software to the Xinjiang police, China’s Ministry of State Security, and many other Chinese police units throughout the 2010s, leaked emails show. One agent, Landasoft, subsequently copied and deployed it as the basis for a predictive policing platform that tagged hundreds of thousands of people as potential terrorists. IBM said it has no record of its i2 software ever being sold to the Public Security Bureau in Xinjiang, was not aware of any interaction between Landasoft and that bureau and cut ties with Landasoft in 2014. Landasoft did not respond.

Some tech companies even specifically addressed race in their marketing. Dell and a Chinese surveillance firm promoted a “military-grade” AI-powered laptop with “all-race recognition” on its official WeChat account in 2019. And until contacted by AP in August, biotech giant Thermo Fisher Scientific’s website marketed DNA kits to the Chinese police as “designed” for the Chinese population, including “ethnic minorities like Uyghurs and Tibetans.” The Xinjiang government said that it uses surveillance technologies to prevent terrorism, and that Western countries also use such technology, calling the U.S. “a true surveillance state.”

Companies pitched tech to control citizens

Though the companies often claim they aren’t responsible for how their products are used, some directly pitched their tech as tools for Chinese police to control citizens, marketing materials from IBM, Dell, Cisco, and Seagate show. Their sales pitches — made both publicly and privately — cited Communist Party catchphrases on crushing protest, including “stability maintenance,” “key persons,” and “abnormal gatherings,” and named programs that stifle dissent, such as “Internet Police,” “Sharp Eyes” and the “Golden Shield.” IBM, Dell, Cisco and Seagate said they adhere to all relevant laws.

American tech laid the foundation for Chinese surveillance

American technology laid the foundation for China’s surveillance apparatus that Chinese companies have since built on and in some cases replaced. Intel and NVIDIA helped China’s three biggest surveillance companies make their camera systems AI-powered. Contracts to maintain existing IBM, Dell, HP, Cisco, Oracle, and Microsoft software and gear remain ubiquitous, often with third parties. And to this day, concerns remain over where technology sold to China will end up, with former U.S. officials and national security experts criticizing a deal struck this summer for NVIDIA to sell chips used in artificial intelligence to China, saying the technology would fall into the hands of the Chinese military and intelligence. NVIDIA said in 2022 that Chinese surveillance firms Watrix and GEOAI used its chips to train AI patrol drones and systems to identify people by their walk, but told the AP those relationships no longer continue. NVIDIA said it does not make surveillance systems or software, does not work with police in China and has not designed the H20 chips for police surveillance, and the White House and Department of Commerce did not respond to requests for comment.

Big loopholes in sanctions remain

Some U.S. companies ended contracts in China over rights concerns and after sanctions. IBM said it has prohibited sales to Tibet and Xinjiang police since 2015, and suspended business relations with defense contractor Huadi in 2019. NVIDIA and Intel also ended partnerships with China’s top two surveillance companies in 2019. However, sanctions experts noted that the laws have significant loopholes and often lag behind new developments. For example, a ban on military and policing gear to China after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre does not take into account newer technologies or general-use products that can be applied in policing. They also noted that the law around export controls is complicated.

A cautionary tale

What started in China more than a decade ago could be seen as a cautionary tale for other countries at a time when the use of surveillance technology worldwide is rising sharply, including in the United States. Emboldened by the Trump administration, U.S. tech companies are more powerful than ever, and President Donald Trump has rolled back a Biden-era executive order meant to safeguard civil rights from new surveillance technologies. As the capacity and sophistication of such technologies has grown, so has their reach. Surveillance technologies now include AI systems that help track and detain migrants in the U.S. and identify people to kill in the Israel-Hamas war. China, in the meantime, has used what it learned from the U.S. to turn itself into a surveillance superpower, selling technologies to countries like Iran and Russia.

“Because of this technology … we have no freedom at all,” said Yang Caiying, now in exile in Japan, whose family has been trapped in an increasingly tight noose of surveillance for the past 16 years. “At the moment, it’s us Chinese that are suffering the consequences, but sooner or later, Americans and others, too, will lose their freedoms.”

Sustainable supply chains don’t just reduce emissions—they also cut costs and increase efficiency.
They point to the kind of measurable impact businesses can achieve when sustainability is embedded across operations and supply chains.
Supply chain transformation To achieve this kind of shift, Capgemini proposes a three-pillar framework: sustainable product design, sustainable manufacturing and sustainable supply chains.
The third pillar - supply chains - is especially crucial, as it deals directly with logistics, procurement and supplier relationships.","With rising greenhouse gas emissions threatening to derail global climate targets and uncertainty mounting from political tensions and cost pressures, supply chains sit at the centre of a growing storm.

According to Capgemini's Building Sustainable Value Chains report, the industrial sector alone contributes over 35% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Most of this, around 70%, stems from Scope 3 emissions, which are those that come from the wider value chain including suppliers and customers.

Capgemini warns that unless action is taken, emissions could push global temperatures up by between 4.1°C and 4.8°C by 2100. This far overshoots the Paris Agreement goal of keeping the increase below 2°C, ideally 1.5°C.

Yet, there’s opportunity in the challenge. Sustainable transformation offers cost reduction, resilience to disruption and long-term competitiveness - and for businesses looking to protect themselves from market shocks, getting supply chains in order may be the most effective place to start.

Supply chains and the problem with Scope 3

Decarbonisation, especially of Scope 3 emissions, proves to be a persistent stumbling block.

Half of the businesses Capgemini surveyed admit they are off-track in addressing Scope 3. Two-thirds say they lack confidence in delivering a fully developed roadmap.

Why? Because measuring and managing emissions beyond a company’s own operations is complex and resource-intensive.

There are several hurdles; businesses struggle to build a clear case for long-term investment in sustainability. Tracking and reporting emissions across suppliers remains patchy.

Supply chains, especially across multiple geographies, are difficult to decarbonise. Low-carbon technologies, meanwhile, are often hard to scale.

Different sectors also face different pressures. Industries such as steel, cement and mining see most of their emissions in Scope 1, which covers direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. But in electronics, food and chemicals, the bulk lies in Scope 3. This means decarbonising requires coordination between manufacturers, suppliers and retailers.

“Building a sustainable value chain is an iterative process,” say Cyril Garcia, Group Executive Board Member and Head of Sustainability at Capgemini and Charlotte Pierron-Perlès, Global Head of Intelligent Industry, Capgemini Invent, in the report.

“It requires a balanced approach between short-term quick wins, such as energy efficiency and sustainable product design improvements and long-term action, such as strategising on the product portfolio, sustainable asset investment and supply chain re-design.”

Less emissions, more efficiency

Despite the barriers, Capgemini sets out a clear business case. Sustainable supply chains don’t just reduce emissions—they also cut costs and increase efficiency.

The report includes a number of examples. One packaging company redesigned its product using life-cycle assessment, lowering the carbon footprint per unit from 10 kgCO₂e to 3 kgCO₂e. At the same time, it managed to reduce production costs. A car manufacturer brought down Scope 1 emissions by 27% and Scope 2 by 13% across 17 sites.

Circular models prove especially powerful. In water and automotive sectors, circular systems yield material savings of up to 50% and cost reductions as high as 70%.

A heavy industry client uses digital twins, virtual replicas of physical processes, alongside AI to cut kiln energy use by 15% and shorten development cycles by 70%.

These aren’t isolated wins. They point to the kind of measurable impact businesses can achieve when sustainability is embedded across operations and supply chains.

Supply chain transformation

To achieve this kind of shift, Capgemini proposes a three-pillar framework: sustainable product design, sustainable manufacturing and sustainable supply chains. The third pillar - supply chains - is especially crucial, as it deals directly with logistics, procurement and supplier relationships.

Under this model, businesses prioritise responsible sourcing, logistics optimisation and ESG transparency. These steps reduce dependency on vulnerable resources and prepare businesses for disruption.

Capgemini highlights “transversal enablers” that support all three pillars. These include traceability tools, digital product passports and automated systems to evaluate carbon footprints across extensive product catalogues.

Digitalisation plays a critical role here. Data systems, digital twins and AI offer predictive modelling, real-time decision-making and enhanced traceability.

For example, one manufacturer with 8,000 suppliers and 350,000 product references uses an automated carbon footprint system to map out a complete decarbonisation roadmap.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/f1253fa537d2419ea109e8dc9f7a8286:84fcac6d781659f435d0549f621b556d/capgemini-main.webp.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 14:23:42.109901

Mirror and Express publisher to axe 321 jobs

The owner of the Daily Mirror and Daily Express has announced plans to axe 321 journalism jobs as part of a major editorial overhaul.

Reach, which also owns the Daily Star and several regional titles, has put 600 editorial jobs at risk, in what it says is its biggest ever restructure.

The latest cull adds to around 40 redundancies across its sports editorial team, which were announced in July.

Staff affected by the cuts were informed on Monday.

Retail sales up 3.1% last month

Retail sales were up 3.1% in August, driven in part by good weather and an interest rate cut, new figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) show.

Computer and mobile phone sales performed well ahead of the return to school, with food sales also increasing.

New school clothing and footwear did not sell as well as expected as some families opted for second-hand alternatives, the BRC said.

But it warned that retail sales could dip in the following months.

""With the later-than-expected Budget falling just days before Black Friday, many are uneasy about how consumer confidence and spending could be impacted by tax rise speculation in the run-up to Christmas,"" said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson.

Water firms hit with £86m fines

Two water firms have been hit with fines totalling more than £86m over failures linked to sewage spills.

Anglian Water will have to pay £62.5m and South West Water will pay £24m towards benefiting the environment and their customers, regulator Ofwat said.

Lynn Parker, senior director for enforcement at Ofwat, said: ""These are serious breaches and are unacceptable.

""We are pleased both companies have accepted that they got things wrong and are now focusing on putting that right, and taking action to come back into compliance.""

The UK is badly exposed to illegal meat smuggling, according to a new parliamentary report.

The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (EFRA) Committee said that it was ""by luck rather than design"" that the UK had so far avoided a ""major disease outbreak"".

It warned: ""Alarming amounts of meat and dairy products are now being illegally imported to Great Britain for both personal consumption and sale.

""""Criminal smuggling operations are largely responsible for this and are bringing in products of some of the greatest risk.""

It said prohibited products were entering the country by plane, boat, cars and in parcels.

In some cases, it said meat is arriving ""stashed in plastic bags, suitcases and cardboard boxes"".

""This meat is finding its way to our high streets, farms, markets, restaurants and kitchen tables, demand driven by the cost-of-living crisis as well as cultural preferences,"" it added.

The report said that there was no clear data showing the scale of the smuggling.

While it welcomed a government ban in April on most meat and dairy imports from the EU, it warned that the enforcement of it was ""toothless"".

Our Money feature writer Brad Young recently explored how the UK would feed itself in a crisis, and found it was ""criminally"" unprepared...

Barclays is cutting the interest rate on two of its popular savings accounts on Friday.

The bank is reducing the rate on its Reward Saver from 2.25% AER to 2.1% AER, while its Blue Rewards Saver, which comes with a £5 monthly fee, will drop from 2.91% to 2.75%.

The interest rate applies to the accounts when no withdrawals are made in a given month, otherwise a lower interest rate of 0.6% AER applies.

Several banks have been cutting interest rates in recent weeks, after the Bank of England reduced its base rate from 4.25% to 4%.

While this is good news for borrowers, for savers it means a dip in the amount they can earn on their stashed away cash.

If you have one of the latest Barclays accounts to see a cut, here's what you could do...

Savings expert Anna Bowes, from The Private Office, says the rates offered by the Barclays accounts are already ""highly uncompetitive"" and the reduction makes them worse.

""There is no need to wait until the rate cut to find a better paying account. The rates currently on offer can easily be beaten - and with no restriction on the number of withdrawals,"" she says.

The best paying easy access account available is with Chase, though this is only available to new Chase customers, joining since 9 June.

The rate is 4.75% AER - considerably more than the rates offered by Barclays both before and after the new rates are applied.

For those who do not want to open a new current account, and do not want restricted access to their cash, Bowes says Cahoot's Simple Saver is paying more.

It is paying 4.4% AER, but after 12 months your money will be moved to a cahoot Savings Account paying a far lower rate (currently 1% AER), she warns.

Santander is paying 6% AER on its Edge Saver account, but only on balances of up to £4,000, and this rate includes a 2% variable rate bonus for 12 months.

""More importantly, you have to be an Edge Current Account customer, which comes with a £3 monthly fee to be aware of,"" Bowes says.

Up to 30 million people could be eligible for compensation under the UK financial watchdog's motor finance redress scheme, its boss has said.

Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said he hoped compensation could start being paid next year.

It comes after the FCA found many car finance firms broke the law or its rules by not properly informing customers about commission paid by lenders to the car dealers that sold them the loan.

Motorists who bought cars on finance between 2007 and 2021 could be eligible for the compensation.

""During the period that we're looking it - from 2007 through to approximately 2020 - there are around 30 million agreements... and all of those will be eligible for compensation,"" he said.

""One of the things that we are looking at very closely is what the scope of the scheme will be.""

He said the FCA was looking into so-called discretionary commission arrangements, of which there were about 14.6 million over the same period.

Under ""discretionary commission arrangements"", brokers and dealers charged higher levels of interest so they could receive more commission, without telling consumers.

""A very significant proportion of those agreements... we do think probably breached the law when it came to disclosure and, by extension, unfair relationships,"" Rathi said.

He told a group of MPs on the Treasury Committee that the FCA was consulting on an industry-wide compensation scheme because there was ""evidence that there have been unfair relationships between lenders and their consumers"".

He said a ""large number of consumers were not properly informed"" about the interest rate on their motor finance deal.

The consultation is due to be launched by early October.

Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that motorists would not be able to claim compensation for hidden commissions paid on car loans, which narrowed the scope for the people who would be eligible for a payout.

After the ruling, the FCA said it would consult on what issues would make a driver eligible for compensation in a redress scheme.

While it's looking at hidden commissions, it is also looking at other commission agreements that could mean lenders have charged unfair amounts to customers.

We look at who might be eligible for the payment under the redress scheme if it goes ahead...

You can get a £1 pizza at Pizza Express this month.

At the popular chain, customers can get a £1 classic or Leggera pizza when they buy other classic or Leggera pizza at full price.

Prices differ across the country, but are typically between £11 and £20.

The offer is available until 28 September for eat in, collection or delivery via Pizza Express.

It isn't available for orders through delivery platforms such as Just Eat, Uber Eats and Deliveroo.

Under the terms and conditions, the most expensive pizza on the bill cannot be discounted to £1 and Pizza Express's airport locations do not qualify either.

The chain is running a similar offer for its Romana pizzas until 28 September - buy one for full price and get a second for £2.95.

Using a work computer for personal matters, such as shopping or looking for properties, for less than 45 minutes a day is not a sackable offence, a judge has ruled.

An accountancy firm employee has won £14,120 after an employment tribunal ruled the time she spent browsing sites such as Rightmove or Amazon was not excessive.

Named in court documents as Ms A Lanuszka, the worker was sacked in July 2023 after spyware was placed on her computer to record her activity and found she had been using it for personal reasons.

Over 13 and 14 July, she was found to have spent 2 hours and 33 minutes on the computer, of which one hour and 24 minutes was on ""personal matters"" and 1 hour and nine minutes on work matters.

Michael Magee, the judge, said there was ""no prohibition on personal computer use, and the amount of time Ms Lanuszka devoted to personal matters during the two days has not been shown to be excessive"".

He found that Ms Lanuszka's boss, named as Ms Krauze, had also used a work computer for personal reasons, and that no policies were shown to her indicating that she should not do so.

""She was free to use the computer personally when work commitments permitted and during breaks,"" he said.

He also noted that she used the computer to improve her skills. For example, she completed Excel training and used Groupmania to ""improve her use of spreadsheets and presentations"".

He ruled that Ms Lanuszka's boss wanted to dismiss her before she had accrued two years service - the point at which workers are able to bring an unfair dismissal claim against their employer.

""The tribunal concludes that it was Ms Krauze's desire to dismiss Ms Lanuszka before Ms Krauze believed that she would accrue two years' service that was the real reason for Ms Lanuszka's dismissal and not conduct,"" he said.

Mitchum has apologised after customers developed ""painful"" and ""itchy"" rashes under their arms while using its deodorants.

It has told those experiencing the ""irritation"" to stop using the affected products ""immediately"".

Shoppers have been posting videos and photos of their sore armpits on TikTok and X after using some of the brand's roll-on deodorants.

Some assumed it was down to an ingredient change, but Mitchum has clarified the issue is due to ""a change in the manufacturing process"" of one of its raw materials.

""Some of you told us that you have experienced temporary irritation after using selected batches of Mitchum 48-hour 100ml roll on, sold in the UK, Ireland and South Africa,"" it said on Instagram. ""We are sorry to those who were impacted and for the time it took to complete the investigation.""

Angry customers were quick to reply to the Instagram post, with some disappointed by the statement.

""Temporary irritation is an absolute joke, irritation is not the word. Try burns, blisters, scabs, now scars. I'll never buy another Mitchum product again,"" one said.

""I don't think red raw underarms that are burning and peeling is accurately depicted by your phrasing of 'temporary irritation',"" said another.

Mitchum said the manufacturing change ""altered how the product interacts with the skin"" for some people.

""The change didn't meet our standards, or yours. We've gone back to the original process to make sure current and future batches meet the high standards you expect,"" it added.

Not all batches have been affected by the issue, and you can tell if your deodorant has been by checking the batch number at the bottom of the bottle.

These are the products that have been affected:

No other products in the brand's portfolio are affected by the issue.

Mitchum told Money the issue had been resolved and it was working to remove the ""small amount of product remaining on shelf"".

""We ask that any consumers experiencing issues contact our Customer Care team and give us a chance to make this right,"" the spokesman added.

“We advise those experiencing issues to stop using the product immediately and to contact our teams at customerenquiries@mitchum.com or on 0800 085 2716.""

We'll take a look at France, after the collapse of prime minister Francois Bayrou's government, in a moment.

But first, news of a big deal for a FTSE 100 company.

Anglo American, the mining firm, had been at the centre of takeover interest for many years.

But it has moved to end that saga by announcing a merger with Teck Resources, a Canadian rival.

Under the terms, Anglo will own about 62.4% of the newly combined company.

It will be called Anglo Teck. Crucially for the UK, it will continue to have its primary stock market listing in London though it will be headquartered in Canada.

Anglo shares were up 7% in early trading as a result of the deal and leading tentative gains on the FTSE 100.

The index was 0.2% up at 9,242.

Across the Channel, markets are calm in France despite the political turmoil of the night before.

It was confirmed after markets in Europe had closed that Bayrou was to formally resign this morning after losing a confidence vote in the National Assembly that was tied to his plan for £40bn of budget cuts.

It leaves France in political limbo again, with President Emmanuel Macron under pressure to agree new parliamentary elections.

A succession of minority governments have toppled in recent years, with Macron supporters unable to get crucial legislation past a split Assembly.

The CAC 40 was 0.6% up this morning, recovering some losses of recent weeks, and French government borrowing costs were stable, as was the euro.

The calm could easily be replaced if no way forward is found and investors start to question the country's ability to operate effectively.

Move aside Tesco, and get out of the way Waitrose, Pret A Manger is entering the meal deal market.

In a bid to boost lunchtime trade after sustaining heavy losses last year, the coffee chain is rolling out the popular main, snack and drink combo in the final three months of the year.

Boss Pano Christou said the company's priority would be ""offering great value for money"" as it looks to grow the brand and return to sustainable profits.

While it sounds great, it's hard to judge at the moment because we don't know how much it's going to cost, and where it will launch.

At the moment, Pret's range of sandwiches cost between £2.99 and £6.25.

Cold drinks range in price between £1.80 and £4.80. Some of the snacks listed on the website include salt and cider vinegar crisps, dark chocolate corn cakes and dried mango.

Pret suffered heavy losses last year because of non-cash impairments linked to a reassessment of the company by owner JAB, which bought the chain in 2018.

What do supermarkets offer?

Major supermarkets, such as Tesco, have offered meal deals including sandwiches, snacks and drinks for years.

Tesco recently increased the price of its meal deal by 25p as food inflation affects the sector.

Waitrose has the most expensive deal at £5.

Sainsbury's recently increased its price by 20p to £3.95.

Morrisons customers pay £4, the same as Co-op non-members - though members pay £3.50.

Asda doesn't offer a fixed price for its meal deal, instead operating a 3-for-2 system, with the cheapest item free.",https://e3.365dm.com/25/09/1600x900/skynews-money-blog-deoderant_7015066.jpg?20250909111531,N,,2025-09-09 15:17:25.316840

Comerica executives are “taking a hard look at expenses,” CEO Curt Farmer said Tuesday, as the lender has faced activist investor pressure to sell.

Farmer flagged expenses related to real estate, headcount, technology and third parties as areas the Dallas-based company may trim, as it works to improve its efficiency ratio. When giving 2026 guidance during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call in January, executives may be “looking for opportunities to lean in a little bit heavier on the expense side than we have year-to-date,” Farmer said at a Barclays investor conference.

“The No. 1 priority of both management and our board is to protect and grow shareholder value,” Farmer said. “That’s our duty to our shareholders, and we and the board take it very seriously.”

Dive Insight:

In late July, HoldCo Asset Management, a Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based investment firm that owns 1.8% of Comerica stock, called on the $78 billion-asset lender to sell itself to a larger bank, accusing Comerica of making “disastrous decisions” and having “objectively poor performance.”

HoldCo put forth PNC, Fifth Third and Huntington as potential buyers that could make sense. Should Comerica not pursue a sale, HoldCo intends to nominate five directors to the bank’s 11-person board, possibly in December, The Wall Street Journal reported this month, citing unnamed sources.

At the Barclays conference Tuesday, executives stressed their commitment to improving the bank’s performance.

“Our main focus remains on levering this robust franchise to enhance profitability and drive value, and we believe our strategic positioning and strong balance sheet give us the engine and flexibility to meet the demands ahead of us,” Farmer said.

Farmer noted he, CFO Jim Herzog and Kelly Gage, director of investor relations, have met with shareholders over the past 45 days, and long-term shareholders acknowledge “all the things they like about Comerica, but they also acknowledge that we need to improve our performance metrics.”

“We know it’s all about execution,” he said. “Myself and the board hold ourselves accountable to that high standard.”

Asked about considerations around joining another organization, Farmer said “we fully appreciate that this is an environment where there’s always speculation about M&A across our industry,” and Comerica executives seek to manage for the long term.

“We are going to execute on the plan we’ve got, but also be aware of the landscape,” Farmer said.

The bank’s efficiency ratio was about 66% for the second quarter. The metric is found by dividing a bank’s noninterest expense by the sum of noninterest income and net interest income. A higher ratio suggests a bank is less efficient.

During the company’s most recent earnings call, Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo criticized Comerica’s efficiency ratio, asking Farmer why the lender had earned the right to remain independent.

Farmer acknowledged Tuesday the bank’s efficiency ratio is high, “which we continue to believe is a bit more on the revenue challenge than on the expense challenge, but, having said that, we’re looking at every lever that we possibly can to improve that efficiency ratio and ultimately improve [return on equity],” Farmer said. “That includes a hard look at expenses.”

That review is underway now, he indicated. That might include real estate: Comerica has closed about 50 banking centers and “done a fair amount of rationalization of our portfolio” in the past couple of years, “but there’s always more opportunities,” Farmer said.

Comerica had 353 branches as of June 30, compared to 379 as of Sept. 30, 2024. The bank had about 7,565 employees as of the end of last year.

The bank’s management seeks to whittle expenses, Farmer said, but “we want to do that, though, in a way that protects some of the revenue things that we’re working on.”

That includes Comerica’s efforts to offset the loss of the Treasury Department’s Direct Express prepaid-card program, by adding more small-business deposits, and chasing embedded finance opportunities that tap the bank’s payments and treasury capabilities, he said.

“We’re trying to figure out that right balance,” between improving the bank’s performance in the short term, and driving revenue growth longer term, Farmer said. Other revenue-boosting efforts involve investments in the bank’s wealth management and capital markets businesses.

Comerica continues to manage the Direct Express program, he said; accounts have not yet migrated although the Treasury’s move to BNY has been announced. Direct Express average deposits in the second quarter were $3.7 billion.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/f76WAXV1yR1uqfTech2kCnMszrlw1FsaFn3uTKwf1Xw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9jb21lcmljYXNpZ24yLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-09 18:16:37.259054

Even as Kraft Heinz prepares to split in two, its flagship ketchup is doubling down on brand swagger. The company is launching “Looks Familiar,” a global campaign that argues Heinz has become so iconic that even fast-food fry boxes mimic its keystone label.

Created by Rethink, the effort leans into the french fry as ketchup’s ultimate sidekick. French fries are the most-ordered item worldwide on Uber Eats and appear on about half of all restaurant menus. The campaign invites consumers to connect the dots: if the fries come in a keystone-shaped box, they belong with Heinz.

The work also builds on Heinz’s ongoing partnership with Uber Eats. Consumers can now make sure fries arrive with Heinz ketchup through the app, and in select markets can score promotions like half-off a bottle of Heinz. In Los Angeles, participating Carl’s Jr. locations are offering free fries and Heinz ketchup with orders over $30, while supplies last.

“While the insight behind this global idea is a simple one, the Heinz brand’s connection to fries is iconic and universal,” said Nina Patel, vice president, global Heinz brand, in the announcement. “No matter where you are in the world, ‘Looks Familiar’ spotlights the truth that famous fry boxes everywhere are shaped just like our distinctive signature keystone — proving that fries don’t just need any ketchup, they need Heinz.”

The campaign is running in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Brazil, Germany, UAE and China, supported by out-of-home, long-form video, digital shoppable integrations, paid social and earned media. It follows 2023’s “It Has to Be Heinz,” the first unified global brand strategy in the company’s 150-year history, and quirky PR stunts like Heinz-verified Uber Eats listings and even ketchup smoothies.

The timing also underscores why Kraft Heinz is betting its growth on condiments. In last week’s announced breakup, Heinz ketchup and other sauces will anchor a new company focused on global growth. Slower-moving grocery staples, including Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables, will be relegated to a North America-focused spin-off. That split ends a 10-year merger that consistently disappointed investors — and puts more pressure on Heinz to keep proving its label is still the one that matters.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2025/09/09/image001_XW5qzf7.png,N,,2025-09-09 13:25:52.898627

And creativity – often overlooked in retail media – is a priority, powered by a 77,000-square-foot in-house ad agency.
Experiences as the edge What sets Best Buy apart, Valentino argued, is its footprint: 1,000 stores and 100m members.","“When you want to be a media company, you have to position yourself at the intersection of technology and culture,” she said. For Best Buy, that means moving beyond selling gadgets to shaping the cultural moments those gadgets power – from gaming launches to holiday shopping.

From misperception to momentum

Retail media may feel like the hot new thing, but as Valentino pointed out, Best Buy has “been at this for a decade.” Last year alone, the retailer ran campaigns with 600 brands. The turning point came this summer with Nintendo’s Switch 2 pre-order launch, which broke records and even brought back midnight openings.

“Nearly 60% of all online orders for this device were picked up in store. We created a cultural moment around the unboxing. It was huge,” she said. That lightning-in-a-bottle moment convinced her there’s a far bigger opportunity in blending buzz with data-driven solutions.

Lessons from the front line

Valentino outlined three big lessons Best Buy is leaning into:

Solutions, not slots. “It’s really about selling solutions – understanding at a customer level what they’re trying to accomplish.”

Standardization or bust. With more than 200 retail media networks crowding the market, she warned, “If we don’t standardize, the flight to consolidation will just happen very rapidly. Coca-Cola can’t buy 200 versions of anything.”

Operate at tech speed. “We need to be in a mindset that we are a startup – that we are shipping code every 30 days.”

Inside Best Buy Ads

Much of the future rests on automation and self-service. The retailer has launched a programmatic platform capable of working with “thousands of customers, not hundreds.” Measurement is being overhauled with new forecasting and optimization tools. And creativity – often overlooked in retail media – is a priority, powered by a 77,000-square-foot in-house ad agency.

“We ran 3,000 campaigns last year and made all of them from a creative standpoint. Nobody knows the customer better than Best Buy,” she noted.

Experiences as the edge

What sets Best Buy apart, Valentino argued, is its footprint: 1,000 stores and 100m members. That scale unlocks collaborations with brands from Meta to Ikea and pilots for in-store “takeovers” that blur the line between retail and entertainment.

“What an opportunity to build experiences around that kind of physical presence. Nintendo taught us a lot this summer, but there’s a lot more to come.”

Why it matters for marketers

For other marketers, the takeaway is clear: retail media is no longer just about clicks and conversions. It’s about building cultural relevance, standardizing where possible and moving with the speed of technology.

Or as Valentino put it: “Not all good ideas have to be yours. Sometimes the biggest leap forward is collaboration.”",https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-prod/s3/news/356910/lisa_valentino.png?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format,N,,2025-09-09 13:24:05.776331

Why It Matters

Burkholderia cepacia complex organisms are environmental bacteria that can be harmless in many people, but cause serious infections in people with weakened immune systems or chronic lung disease.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and DermaRite say the contamination could lead to local infections in otherwise healthy users with broken skin and to bloodstream infections, or deadly sepsis in immunocompromised patients—outcomes that may require hospitalization and carry substantial risk.

What To Know

The recall was initiated by DermaRite on July 16 and expanded on August 27, with Walmart issuing its own list of impacted Sam's Club stores on Monday.

DermaRite's expansion covers a broad list of skincare and hygiene products, including but not limited to: 4-N-1 No Rinse Wash Cream, DermaCerin, DermaFungal, DermaKleen, DermaMed, DermaSarra, Gel Rite hand sanitizer, Hand E Foam, KleenFoam, Lantiseptic, PeriGiene, PeriGuard, Renew Dimethicone & Renew Periprotect, Renew Skin Repair and UltraSure antiperspirant/deodorant.

According to a new report from the Capgemini Research Institute, 92 percent of all automotive organizations predict that every automotive company will transition to a software company to support Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs) and software-driven mobility (SDM) services.

SDM key focus areas for OEMs

The report titled ‘The software-driven mobility era: Beyond vehicles’, reveals that over eight in ten manufacturers believe that software-defined products and services, not just the physical vehicle, will become their core value proposition. However, only a few manufacturers have been able to scale their developments to their fullest capacity in this direction.

It has come to light that in 2025, fewer than half of automotive organizations had scaled their SDM initiatives — with 34 percent partially scaling at least one use case and only 14 percent reaching full-scale deployment. “For decades, automotive leadership was driven by hardware but today consumers demand connected, digitally enhanced experiences. This calls for adoption of a software first approach across the value chain to enable holistic mobility solutions,” said Laurence Noël, Global Head of Automotive at Capgemini.

Artificial Intelligence: New Area of Innovation

Artificial intelligence (AI) will be the new area of innovation for auto OEMs across the world. The Capgemini report highlights a staggering 85 percent of manufacturers believe that AI is increasingly becoming an integral part of automotive software. Soon, AI will be directly integrated into software features and functions that will help improve in-vehicle experiences, power advanced safety features and cybersecurity, etc.

Around 77 percent automakers feel that AI integration into software development, in-vehicle functions, and mobility services will give them a critical competitive advantage that will reshape the automotive value chain. This will also help OEMs reduce costs, boost productivity and efficiency, and enhance product quality, and therefore, scale profitability.

Most of the organizations surveyed for this report, view AI integration for ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) and autonomous driving capabilities as extremely significant in their organization’s software-driven strategy. This suggests the industry will help develop more advanced autonomous driving technologies in the coming years.

Organizational overhaul on cards

According to the survey, 86 percent manufacturers believe implementation of SDM demands an overhaul of the organizational model, leading to significant changes in processes, and the need to build new skill sets. Besides structural transformations, organizations encounter significant challenges in areas such as software engineering, compliance, safety, cybersecurity, leadership, and talent acquisition.

Notably, 83% of organizations consider the development of a unified software platform to be a critical element of their software-driven mobility strategy. Software-defined products and mobility services are also expected to become significant revenue contributors for OEMs.The report concludes that total revenue for OEMs is projected to double, with SDMs contributing to over 50 percent by 2035.",https://images.financialexpressdigital.com/2025/09/Software-driven-mobility.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 13:24:12.896719

Full transcript - Barclays 23rd Annual Global Financial Services Conference:

Jason, Analyst: Moving right along. I’m very pleased to have U.S. Bancorp with us from the company, Gunjan Kedia, CEO. Became CEO in April of this year, so not that long ago. John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, thank you for being with us. We’ll put up the first ARS question that we’ve been asking all the companies. Gunjan, maybe start with you. You know, five months on the job, certainly as CEO. Maybe just start off by catching us up on what you’ve been up to since mid-April. Key lessons learned so far in your new role?

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: It’s been a privilege to step into the role of the CEO of a wonderful company, and thank you for having us. I think we have passed over the fire alarm, a good sign. Jason, as I stepped into my role five months back now, we had come off of two years of quite intense focus, first on the Union Bank integration and then on building the capital back up again. This time last year, we had built on that and articulated financial targets for the medium term. That was the context in which I had stepped into my role, and I articulated three key priorities to achieve our medium-term financial targets, and that was expense stabilization, organic growth, and payments transformation.

Your question on what I’ve been up to for the last five months has really been putting in place a very talented leadership team, not just at my level but a level below, and rewiring the organization for more urgent execution. That’s sort of been my focus for five months. I’ll tell you, as I have spent an enormous amount of time listening to all our stakeholders, I am very encouraged by how well our brand and our culture resonates with our clients. Our thesis that we have enormous opportunities to deepen these client relationships by interconnecting our products is very strong and real. I’ve also spent a lot of time with our investors, and there we have some work to do to just consistently deliver.

Unidentified speaker: I’ve been investigating the cause. If the cause is in terror, you’ll be notified. May I be a passenger, please? May I be a passenger, please? An alarm has been resumed. We’re investigating the cause. If the cause has been in terror, you’ll be notified.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: I think we’re safe because if the hotel was burning, we’d be being rushed out.

Jason, Analyst: Good. I guess as a follow-up to that, you talked about these three strategic priorities for the near term. Maybe you can just update us on those and the kind of the progress you’ve made.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: Yeah. The first one is expenses, and we are really in very strong shape there. We’ve now reported seven straight quarters of stable expenses, and that has allowed us, Jason, to both deliver our positive operating leverage targets and invest into organic growth. We have runway with expenses. That program is executing very well, so we’re in very, very strong shape there. The second priority was organic growth. Our fee growth trends are strengthening quarter by quarter, so we are very pleased there. What’s very important to us is how the mix has evolved over time. We are really a fee-heavy franchise.

We were at about 42% last quarter, and it’s very balanced across these three pillars: payments, which has been a historical overweight on fees, our trust in investments and capital market-related fees, which we are really doubling down on growing, and then consumer fees, which remain strong, but we don’t have as much dependence on them because they’re more volatile and have some regulatory pressures. The fee growth story is coming along very, very nicely. Last quarter, we took some substantial actions to reposition our balance sheet, so that has set us up for much better NII growth. Organic growth feels well underway as well. The third priority is payments transformation. We’re very differentiated. Our payments franchise is quite unique and quite difficult to replicate either through acquisition or organic growth elsewhere. We are focused on transformative strategies there.

We have two leaders for two parts of the business, and they are executing to that agenda. We feel very good. We measure our success on those three priorities by our medium-term targets, and quarter after quarter, the progress we are making. As you saw last quarter, we’re just really, really delivering strong progress there.

Jason, Analyst: Got it. Maybe put up the next ARS question. I guess as a follow-up to what you just said, you mentioned organic growth and expense management, both strategic priorities. You mentioned seven straight quarters of stable expenses, which I guess on one hand is good. On the other hand, I don’t know, any kind of impact on revenue growth from kind of focusing sort of expenses? Just how do you balance the two?

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: Yeah. We’re not at a point when we need to balance the two because the expense stabilization is not a matter of trade-offs right now for us. It’s very much real productivity. Jason, you’ve been following us for a long time. You know we have spent an extraordinary amount of investment dollars for the last five or six years in building out a wide array of digital capabilities. That gives you a lot of opportunities to drive real productivity. Most of these capabilities are being adopted. The operating processes around them are being designed to drive productivity. You add to it some of the new tools available, like AI, like transformative. I thought he was going to come on.

Unidentified speaker: The cause of the alarm has been determined to be a broken pipe in our garage of the hotel. Sorry for the inconvenience. May I be a passenger, please? May I be a passenger, please? The cause of the alarm has been determined to be caused by a broken pipe in our garage of the hotel. The elements will be back momentarily.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: If any of you have a card in the garage and you need to run right out, we will fully understand and not take it personally. The expense question, let me keep plowing on here. It is very real, and I don’t think you need to worry at all about the trade-offs. In fact, we are generating enough expense savings that not only are we delivering sort of a stable trajectory, we are investing a fair amount, and you’ll see that show up in various business lines as well.

Jason, Analyst: I guess one of the things that we learned in Ambassador Day was spending about $2.5 billion a year on investments. Have we kind of reached a tipping point there? Where is most of these investments going? Is it more offensive to drive growth, more defensive? How should we think about that?

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Yeah. Just to piggyback off of what Gunjan just said, the tech investments are a very important story for us in terms of our spend levels. That level you cited, $2.5 billion, is our annual run rate that we spend. The sweet spot for us in a couple of different paths, Jason, because on one hand, it’s two-thirds offense, one-third defense, to use the words you used, offensively to create products, enhancements, and things of that variety, defensively to have system maintenance and the like. The other part of it is that cost is embedded in our run rate. Part of the reason that we have had this seven quarters of flattish expense and working on an eighth is that we have these opportunities to invest in the business and get that productivity that Gunjan mentioned. We’re really focused on a number of different areas. We’re focused on simple architecture.

How do we utilize the cloud to help our mainframe and hollowing out the core and all those sorts of things? The second thing is about product development and making sure we have all the right digital apps and capabilities available to us. The third that is really a differentiator for us is the reusability. We think the reusability of technology is a very important concept. We use it a lot in our businesses, such as Elan, such as our co-brand, our partnerships with State Farm, with Ed Jones, those sorts of things. A long way of saying this is the long-term investments we’re making in technology is helping that productivity, and it’s a meaningful player in how we’re gaining positive operating leverage going forward.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: Can I add one other point, Jason, to it? There was a time five or six years back when we really needed to focus on the digital capabilities and that $2.5 billion of capital expense was very important. I also want to point out we invest a lot of operating expense into growing our franchise. Just to build off of what has already been built, you will see us investing more in sales, marketing, building brand, building distribution presence, being more front-footed with partnerships. There are lots and lots of ways of investing in growth on top of the $2.5 billion, which was very specifically focused on an agenda of catching up and surpassing really the quality of the digital products and capabilities we had.

Jason, Analyst: I guess maybe just talk to payments. It’s like a quarter of the revenue, so clearly a differentiator versus other regional banks. We haven’t seen consistent year-over-year growth that we’d expect from some of those businesses. Maybe just update us in terms of your payments transformation progress and what we’d expect to see there.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: I’ll start. Let me start with our sort of strategic commitment to the payments, which is very strong. We think of it in two ways. One, it’s a standalone, very attractive product set in a growth business for us, very high returns, fee-oriented. It’s also the first set of products that today’s young customer uses to interact with the financial services system. If you think about how our kids, they don’t start with a checking account necessarily. Years before that, they’ve started using some kind of a payments mechanism, a P2P vehicle, or a credit card. We have this view that in the fullness of time, as you’re trying to evolve your client franchise to a Gen Z or a different type of audience, the payments products will become the more real anchor point of loyalty, longevity, more frequent connection with the bank.

Our philosophy is payments need to both be embedded in every other product set we have as a way of interacting day-to-day with our clients and be a business unit that delivers very good financial returns. Deep commitment to the franchise. It is two very separate things. I’ll start with merchant because I have discovered that most people think of merchant when they’re thinking of payments. That’s about 6% to 7% of our revenue base, strategically very important to a small business franchise. The heart of the American economy is the small business, a very important segment for us. There, the transformative strategies are about narrowing our focus from what used to be a broad-based global acquiring-only horizontal business to a more software-led business that creates a lot more value, so less commodity. We’re focused on five verticals.

The reason for the focus is that these software capabilities are very unique to the needs of the end customer. You have to really think about their operating models and embed your payments products into their front office. You don’t want to be dilutive. These are five very large sectors of the economy. That focus is creating some very meaningful reacceleration of the business. More than a third of that business now is the software-led, and the growth rates there tend to be 5 to 10 times the rest of the acquiring-only business. The margins, the pricing holds up. The last thing I’ll say about merchant is I have heard from the investors some amount of misconceptions about the business. It is not an unprofitable business. It’s not a loss leader. We actually run it for a very high margin and very attractive set of margins.

Perhaps that is the trade-off with the volume growth that most people think about. The second thing is that business is one of the core beneficiaries of the build-out of the digital capabilities. We intend to continue investing in the business, but it’s in the run rate now. It’s neither a disproportionate user of profit margin or investment. Very sustainable franchise. It really anchors many, many parts of our banking franchise, and we’re deeply committed to that business. That’s sort of merchant. On the other side, we have the larger of the two businesses, which is a card issuing business. This is credit cards for small businesses, U.S. Bank, and Elan, which is our white-label platform for 1,200 small banks. Let me just start with Elan. Elan’s digital technology and product was materially upgraded and rolled out December of last year.

The user experience has skyrocketed from some very modest numbers to a very world-class experience. We have new leadership in place. We have built out that team. We expect that to really start to perform at much, much higher rates than the past. That’s one strategy. The bigger strategy is just the U.S. Bank branded cards. Historically, our product set was designed to drive loan growth because it was a balance sheet play. It’s a very attractive set of products for revolvers. Our loan growth there has been very attractive, at par or better than the industry. What we are doing now with this transformation is augmenting that with a new set of products that is equally attractive to transactors. Now we are competing not at the highest level of affluence and wealth, but really at the young affluent and connecting our banking products with our credit card products.

This is a suite of products called Smartly. As that rolls out, and these pipelines, we are seeing the increase in active accounts and the revenue follows, you know, four or five quarters after that. That build-up, and that’s the transformation to go from a revolver-heavy mindset to a revolver and transactor-heavy. Very good progress there, very differentiating franchise. You’ll see some real acceleration of that business over time.

Jason, Analyst: I guess maybe as an adjunct to that, stablecoin has been coming up throughout the conference. Do you think this could be a disruptor to the overall payment ecosystem? Just how you think about using them? I’d just love to get your perspective, given your kind of role in the payment space.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: I always start by asking where the client need is because it’s a very fundamental way to think of prioritizing investments and focus. I will tell you, Jason, I’m hard-pressed to find one single client who’s saying, ""I just really need stablecoin from a bank right now."" The demand is not present and real with consumers. Where there’s interesting conversations is global corporates with cross-border payments. Most of the use cases are anchored around that. Most very large companies actually have very efficient cross-border payment systems because they are not feeling the big cost of cross-border payments. It really has become, in our minds, a new payment rail, one that we expect to participate in. We are expecting to pilot some limited edition stablecoin transactions yet this year. We are doing both a pilot U.S. Bancorp stablecoin and also a sort of a partner-led.

There’s quite a lot of capability available in the market to be able to do that quickly so that we are ready as and when the market develops. The underlying protocols of what the payment rail is going to look like is a collaborative effort in banking along with our industry partners. In many ways, it could be a more efficient disruptor of the institutional cross-border payments type of business, which is a very small footprint for us today, perhaps an opportunity for us going forward. What we really don’t see yet is a path either from a market structure or adoption with everyday retail payments, especially in the U.S., which is sort of our bread and butter. All I can say is it’s quite interesting. It’s a lot of conversation around it.

We are very front-footed in learning, in experimenting, and putting pilots out, but yet not seeing fully the economic models and how they might evolve.

Jason, Analyst: Got it. We’re at the halfway point, so I’m obligated to ask. Two weeks left to go in the quarter. John, I guess this is you.

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Yeah.

Jason, Analyst: You may provide us an update on kind of business loan growth trends. You know, what are you hearing from customers regarding the operating environment?

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Sure. When we look across the board, there’s just been a lot of activity, renewed activity, and it is very helpful from a loan growth perspective. We’ve seen, in particular, on the C&I front, M&A is picking up. Pipelines are strong. Small business loans are growing. Utilization rate is hanging in there. All the things are pointing to strength in the C&I categories. I would also say that payment trends continue to be strong. There’s a lot of payment activity, both on the consumer as well as on the business side of the equation. What I would say there is that the payment trends, particularly in the consumer, are helping loan growth there as well. Those are the positives. There are some components such as commercial real estate and auto loans that continue to drift a little lower.

All in, our loan growth should be in that industry HA data range. We are seeing that growth, which is positive. The other thing I would say is we are watching the employment situation. We’re watching the labor markets. We do acknowledge a softness, but importantly, the unemployment rate itself is favorable. There’s no concern from a credit standpoint as a result of it. The economy is resilient. Our clients are resilient, and we’re excited to see them pull through here as we look through the third quarter.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: Compared to April, you know, right after the tariff discussion started, the mood has shifted, Jason, to sort of a sense that our clients can get their arms around what is happening. Some of the extreme caution that we saw in the April-May timeframe has given way to sort of more front-footedness with clients, so optimism there.

Jason, Analyst: I guess maybe before we delve further into the drivers, you guys give that earnings guidance slide in your deck. It’s kind of a bunch of 2025 and 325 topics. Does it all remain intact? You talked about revenue growth for the year growing at the lower end of up 3% to 5%. Is that still the right way to think about it? Any updates you want to provide?

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Sure. There’s no change to our guidance for the third quarter or for the full year, but maybe just to give some color to the third quarter, we gave a range of net interest income of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion. We expect to be at the high end of that range given a number of different variables I can get into. The fees as well as expenses are coming in favorable as well and as expected for us. That all leads to very meaningful positive operating leverage for us in the third quarter. On the full year, as you mentioned, no change to that on the revenue guide, the 3% to 5% still intact and on the lower end, as you mentioned.

Jason, Analyst: Got it. All right, because if I guess if 3Q and AI fees and expenses are all doing a little bit better than expected, any chance we can get that revenue towards the middle of that 3% to 5%?

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Yeah, I think the lower end is the appropriate amount, but importantly, we’re going to be in the high end of the range from a net interest income standpoint. A lot of it has to do with the favorability we’re seeing on the asset side. We’re seeing some of the strategic actions we took in the second quarter helping out in terms of the loan sale and the investment portfolio movements we did. The loan mix favorability is improving. I mentioned C&I loans and credit cards improving, and that’s really helping the mix side and yield side of the asset side of the equation. Our fixed asset repricing just continues to be favorable, a little bit more better than it was in the first half of the year. All those things kind of lead to the improvement we’re seeing on the NII side.

Jason, Analyst: Got it. Maybe talk about deposits a little bit. Last quarter, you talked about some competitive pressures on the commercial front. Is that moderated? It kind of felt like that maybe U.S. Bancorp is a bit more than peers and just, I guess balances mix kind of what we’re seeing on that front.

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Sure. The deposit portfolio that we have, we feel very comfortable with it. We actually feel better about it now with rate cuts very much coming in in September here. It looks, you know, from a market standpoint, there’s going to be several cuts moving forward. That’s all beneficial to us. We benefit more from rates coming down and a steeper yield curve. That’s all coming together nicely. The one thing I would say about deposits is that if I just step back, we utilize deposits as a really important part in our client’s relationship. It really anchors those clients. When you get into situations like we did last quarter where there’s some competitiveness, we’re going to protect those sorts of deposit holders because they have multiple services and products with us.

That shows up in our fee categories such as corporate trust, fund services, treasury management, things of that variety. We’re not shy about the deposit profile. We still optimize it for cost, obviously, but we’re going to protect it from a relationship standpoint as well.

Jason, Analyst: I guess you touched on this, but you know, the Fed, I’m told, is going to cut next week and maybe, I would assume, again. You know, on the way up, you had one of the higher betas. As the Fed begins to cut, do you expect kind of the same beta as you laid out at Ambassador Day or just how you’re all thinking about that? This cycle has been a little bit different.

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Sure.

Jason, Analyst: It’s like a nine-month pause.

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Exactly. It’s been a very different cycle than when, you know, a year ago we were talking about all these sorts of things. When I was looking at our beta performance, I was actually pleasantly surprised. We were right from a peer group standpoint, we were on the upper end on the up-rate cycle. Actually, on this cycle heretofore, we’ve been on the upper end as well, or the better end of it as well. I think that’s a testament to the business model that we have and how we operate on our deposit side of things. I agree with you that the cycle is very different than what we would have said with the pause that we have here versus the three or four cuts that we had prior to last year.

If we get sustainable rate cuts from here on out, then we certainly see a path to getting to that beta that we talked about last year.

Jason, Analyst: Maybe put up the next ARS question. Right, no good deed goes unpunished. You pointed to the higher end of NII for the 3Q guide. I guess as senior citizens start to think about, you know, 2026, you’ve talked about this 3% NIM at some point. It was 2.66% in the second quarter. Maybe just talk to just, you know, how you’re thinking about next year, that NIM improvement story, and just how kind of rate cuts play into that.

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Yeah, maybe just to start with the current quarters, we expect sequential growth here in the third quarter, as I mentioned, and the fourth quarter as well. We haven’t given guidance particularly specifically on 26%, 27%. However, given where we’re seeing the rate environment evolve to, we definitely see a path to getting to that 3% net interest margin in the 2027 area. That is where, and the speed in which we get there is really going to be dependent on what the cuts look like, what the curve looks like. Importantly, for us, more cuts in a sustained manner is beneficial, along with an upward sloping curve. I always look at SOFR versus the five-year Treasury. I think that’s an important data point for us and how our balance sheet is constructed. Those are kind of the puts and takes.

It’s really because we get the benefit of that fixed asset repricing that we’ve talked about. Our mix of assets are changing and improving to more higher growth, higher yielding in terms of card and/or commercial and industrial type loans. Those are the things that are going to benefit us as we move forward.

Jason, Analyst: Got it. Maybe on the fee side, you know, Gunjan, you talked a lot about the payments businesses, but maybe there’s obviously other fee categories that have done that contribute to capital markets. For example, I think you’ve talked about mid-single-digit growth. I guess John maybe alluded to it a little bit better than that. Maybe just kind of flesh out the fee story.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: The premise of the fee acceleration is deepening our client relationships. Our approach here has been, Jason, to see where we are deploying balance sheets and sometimes deposits to support our client relationships. The relationships are healthy, and they would do more with us if the product sets were there. Those areas would point us to doubling down on expanding our capital markets capabilities. We are definitely underweight our fair share of that fee line relative to the size of the balance sheet. We expect to see some healthy growth there and very good progress there. Treasury management is another one that has seen very good growth, and that comes from just the product set having been strengthened quite materially over the last few years. We are seeing good growth in treasury management. California is beginning to deliver very nicely for us from a regional standpoint across all products.

Payments in particular has been a very consistent story of taking a very attractive, very affluent, very small business-focused customer base that we acquired from Union Bank and beginning to deepen there. That is a growth area. Partnerships where we’re very unique. We talked about Elan and how good we got with providing these white-label credit card services. With State Farm, we developed the banking multi-partner platform. Now with Edward Jones, we are standing that up. Many different products in terms of product expansion, but the bigger lever is really sort of deepening of the client relationships. The number that we shared was just above 40%. That number should be much higher given the strength of the brand and strength of the franchise. Those are the areas that you’d see publicly reported outside acceleration, but of course, internally, quite a lot of momentum in all categories.

Like trust and investments, just to give you, that fee category has done very consistently. The macroeconomic environment has been favorable and market share gains have been. That’s our private credit focus. We have a lot of conversations around the balance sheet growth parts of private credit, but with that comes a lot of our corporate trust business, a lot of our fund services business. That is sort of an interconnectivity at play right there. Another one is health care. Last year, we bought a small bolt-on acquisition called Salukro, which gave us some very good merchant capabilities. That’s been a traditional sector, very, very compatible with the bank’s culture and data privacy rules, and that creates momentum as well. Many, many areas of sort of driving fee growth.

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: One thing I might add as well is it’s in the other revenue category, but our impact finance business, which is really more about tax credit syndications, transferabilities, things of that variety. That has been a meaningful driver for fee growth as well. It’s in the other revenue category, so a little bit harder to see. We’ll try to provide some more color on that going forward.

Jason, Analyst: You talked about $3 billion for the second quarter and kind of this mid-single-digit growth target over time. Is that still the right way to think about it?

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Yeah, on the fee side of the equation, yeah, mid-single digits is the way to think about it. It’s consistent with this year. It’s consistent with our medium-term targets.

Jason, Analyst: The other target you’ve talked about is kind of 200 basis points plus a positive operating leverage for this year. It feels like that’s intact, but just how do we think about that number, maybe looking out to next year as you kind of imagine beginning the 2026 budget process?

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: Let me begin.

Jason, Analyst: Yeah.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: Jason, we are not really sort of managing to a specific positive operating leverage number. We are marching towards our medium-term target goals and stable expenses. As such, we expect that the positive operating leverage will be intact, as you say. The exact level will depend on revenue growth expectations. We are creating a sustainable, attractive EPS growth model. In certain cases, you might see us leaning in more into operating expenses to drive revenue growth. What we are very committed to is positive operating leverage without necessarily quoting a number. As long as it is accretive to a healthy, responsible EPS growth profile, we are happy to spend expenses as needed.

Jason, Analyst: I guess we’ve seen, as John alluded to, we’re going to say the eighth straight quarter of stable expenses. Do we see 12 straight quarters of stable expenses, or you’re okay to spend as long as the operating leverage is there?

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: Oh, we’re okay to spend as long as the operating leverage is there. We’re not trying to sort of get to 12 quarters of stable expenses. The expense takeout has just been sort of institutional productivity. We’ve gotten quite a lot of questions around whether we are sort of squeezing investments to get the expense ratios. I just want to say, at our size, we have considerable scale without the complexity in the businesses that we operate in. A lot of times, we are compared to these large global players. When you’re not in 100 regulatory environments where you’re trying to manage that kind of complexity, you should operate in what we think is a sustainable mid to high 50% efficiency ratio. That’s a business model assertion of ours. The expense flattening is important to get to balance in where we are going to be.

After that, we hope very much to drive the very diversified, very differentiated fee-intensive model that lends itself to good growth.

Jason, Analyst: Got it.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: Third quarter.

Jason, Analyst: Yeah. Six minutes left, six questions. We’re going to go rapid fire here.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: Agreed.

Jason, Analyst: Credit quality, it’s been stable. I guess any areas that we should be focused on?

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: are really no areas. It’s stable. It’s improving in certain areas, so it’s quite stable. There’s not a lot of areas that give us any concern at this point. Trying to keep you on.

Jason, Analyst: Yeah, no, we’re good. I guess capital return, you know, share repurchase has been fairly modest. I think $100 million a quarter for the last several quarters, you know, a modest amount of earnings. Historically, you know, share rep buyback has been like 30% to 40% of earnings. Now it’s been like 5% of earnings. How do you kind of, is 30% to 40% still the right way to think about it longer term? Like when do you think we can get back there?

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Yeah, from a policy standpoint and the way we think about capital return, ideally, we would like to be at 35% to 45% on dividend, 30% to 40%, as you mentioned, on the share repurchases. Right now, we’re right where we need to be on the dividend payout side. On the buyback, we’re on the lower end. We do aspire to get up to that level, but we’re still building capital to get to that category two level that we’ve been migrating toward. It’s been a two-year journey. We still have a little bit of kind of the last leg approaching here. As we approach that, we do intend to move that percentage up. How and when that occurs is going to depend on the macro and how loan growth is doing and all those other things that are important when you’re making these sort of decisions.

Jason, Analyst: Adjusted CET1 in the second quarter was 8.9%. Is there kind of a number you want to get to before you ramp up the buyback? You’ve actually taken a fair amount of actions to improve capital position. Is there more we could do there?

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Sure. I think we’ve made considerable progress. We wanted from 8%, 9% to get to 10%. I think the buyback, back to your question, we’re going to eventually get to that 30% to 40% range as we move forward and march through time. Again, back to what I just mentioned, the timing of when that happens is just going to depend on loan growth, the macro, all those sorts of things. The intention is to glide back up into that realm once we get very close to our levels.

Jason, Analyst: Another use of capital is bank M&A. U.S. Bancorp has a long history of doing bank deals, albeit not recently. How do you think about the acquisition landscape? How does that play into the growth strategy?

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: I was reflecting on the audience survey on what’s the most important thing to get evaluation up, and it was sort of delivering on a medium-term target. Our focus is very much on organic execution towards the targets and consistently delivering to the promise. Outside of sort of big bank M&A, we are always open to sort of bolt-on M&A. We do that very well too. We see that more in the realm of payments or institutional world, and that’s opportunistic. We’re always looking at any properties that might augment either scale or the product capability. The focus right now is organic growth.

Jason, Analyst: Good to hear. One question we get asked a lot is just how you’re preparing for the category two regulatory designation. You expect to cross that. Any update there?

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Yeah, certainly, we continue to grow. We have no restrictions on growth. Along with what our forecast indicates, we think no earlier than 2027 is when we cross that $700 billion mark to get into category two. There’s been a fair amount of investment that we’ve made in terms of reporting, in terms of infrastructure, and all those sorts of things. Some of the technology questions that I answered earlier in this have gone into the development of that as we get ready for higher regulatory expectations, what our expectation is at this point. We have that all embedded in the run rate. Again, no earlier than 2027 is when we expect to get there.

Jason, Analyst: Got it. Just to put up the last ARS question. Gunjan, maybe to wrap up, we’ve talked in the past about kind of restoring investors’ confidence in U.S. Bancorp’s narrative and execution is your top priority. In your view, kind of what aspects of U.S. Bancorp’s story do you believe the market may be overlooking or underestimating? What do you think it will take to get the stock back to its premium valuation?

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: I am very committed to restoring investor confidence. I hear the concerns. I accept them. We are quite focused on that. In the immediate term, we need to just deliver consistent financial results marching towards our medium-term targets. That is credibility building on execution. Once that confidence comes back to the investor base, the true strength of the franchise will come through. It’s a high return, low efficiency ratio, very risk-managed franchise. When you combine that with a diversified fee-oriented mix, the impeccable culture, the memorable brand, and just a long track record of consistent performance, I think the investor story will be very, very strong.

Jason, Analyst: Great. On that note, please join me in thanking Gunjan and John for their time today.

ID37,S&P Global,2025-09-09 16:05:39+00:00,CIO,9 cloud strategy questions every IT leader must answer - CIO,"Stephanie Overby, e& Enterprise, Bob Violino, John Edwards, Stephanie Overby Contributing",,,,,https://www.cio.com/article/4051063/9-cloud-strategy-questions-every-it-leader-must-answer.html,"“We move workloads to the cloud only to discover they are not a fit for the cloud, they are too expensive, regulations change, workload demands change.” As a result, frequent reassessments of cloud strategy are essential.
“While cloud adoption comes with many advantages — scalability, resiliency, and reliability —achieving a strong ROI remains a challenge if the cloud strategy is not comprehensive,” says Krishna Mohan, vice president and global head of the cloud business unit at consultancy TCS.
“It was the perfect trigger to revisit their entire cloud strategy,” Topinka says.
Does our cloud strategy align with our sustainability goals?
As Topinka urges: “Your cloud strategy needs to be a living plan, reviewed often, or it will age out quickly.”","The early days of cloud computing were about migrating infrastructure paradigms for cost savings. In recent years, however, cloud has become a critical enabler of rapid development and digital innovation.

“The ability to spin up environments on demand, leverage robust service libraries, and access global scalability fundamentally transformed how organizations deliver products and services,” says Joe Nathan, associate principal with The Hackett Group.

Meanwhile, the broader technology landscape has also changed dramatically. “The rise of AI, increasing cyber threats, evolving data requirements, regulatory scrutiny, and the rapid advancement of cloud-native architectures have introduced new levels of complexity — and opportunity,” Nathan says. The wrong moves can set organizations back, while the right ones can enable them to leapfrog rivals.

But CIOs’ increasing experience with the cloud has also led them to rethink where specific workloads perform best.

“Cloud repatriation is a reality,” says Niel Nickolaisen, longtime IT leader and current director of strategic engagements for JourneyTeam. “We move workloads to the cloud only to discover they are not a fit for the cloud, they are too expensive, regulations change, workload demands change.”

As a result, frequent reassessments of cloud strategy are essential. “The pace of change in these areas makes ‘set and forget’ cloud strategies obsolete,” says Joe Topinka, veteran IT leader and founder of CIO Mentor. “This becomes even more urgent during major platform shifts or when emerging technology ambitions outpace current infrastructure.”

Cloud strategies must be continuously realigned with business priorities and new technologies. “The decisions made today will shape long-term agility, compliance posture, cost efficiency, and innovation potential,” Hackett Group’s Nathan says.

S&P Global, for example, which operates in more than 35 countries, has had to integrate compliance with diverse and evolving regulatory requirements into its cloud architecture.

“Without robust cloud governance, organizations risk cost overruns, security vulnerabilities, and missed innovation opportunities,” says Swamy Kocherlakota, chief digital solutions officer at S&P Global.

Following are questions IT leaders should ask about their cloud strategies to ensure they continue to serve their business ambitions.

Do we have an enterprise framework to guide cloud decisions?

Cloud platforms are increasingly procured by non-IT teams. Establishing a unified decision framework that brings together expertise from across the enterprise to guide the cloud lifecycle, from selection to sunsetting, is key.

Without this, “organizations face fragmented architectures, redundant tools, and compliance gaps,” says CIO Mentor’s Topinka, who saw the marketing team at one client select a cloud-based customer engagement platform, only for the legal team to discover later that it introduced serious privacy issues. The company then brought together experts from legal, cyber, privacy, risk, and finance to develop a framework that ensures every cloud decision is evaluated for security, compliance, and scalability, without slowing down business-led innovation.

How can we capitalize on multicloud without sacrificing standardization?

Working with multiple cloud partners can offer negotiating leverage and access to best-of-breed services, but it also compounds complexity and requires a range of expertise.

“To address this, develop clear decision frameworks for selecting cloud providers based on workload requirements, security considerations, and cost models,” S&P Global’s Kocherlakota says.

IT leaders can also establish centers of excellence for each major cloud platform and establish a cross-cloud architecture team to ensure consistency and integration across platforms, he adds.

Do we have the talent and culture to innovate in the cloud?

“Technology alone does not create innovation; people do,” says Topinka. “I have seen teams hesitate to adopt new approaches because they are comfortable with what they know.”

At one client organization, Topinka helped create a small, cross-functional innovation team. These individuals, tapped for their curiosity and fearlessness, were paired with mentors and given permission to experiment, ultimately delivering a new customer-facing capability that expanded the organization’s market reach in ways leadership had not considered.

“The maturity and advancement of cloud solutions depend on the team’s culture and their ability to operate and innovate within the cloud,” Hackett Group’s Nathan adds.

Are we prepared to manage cloud costs at scale?

Developing a three- to five-year cost model is essential to understand the break-even period, steady-state benefits, and total cost of ownership of a cloud solution, Nathan says.

In addition, “many organizations face ‘sticker shock’ due to inefficiencies in resource provisioning and suboptimal architectures,” says S&P Global’s Kocherlakota, who advises implementing robust tagging strategies, adopting automated monitoring tools, and conducting regular optimization reviews.

“Clear visibility into consumption patterns, resource allocation, and usage metrics is essential,” says Nathan, noting that cloud financial management practices help maintain accountability and prevent cost overruns, particularly in multicloud environments.

Allocating cloud costs directly to business units or product teams also increases transparency and encourages more efficient use of cloud resources, according to Kocherlakota.

Is our cloud strategy truly advancing operations and the business?

“While cloud adoption comes with many advantages — scalability, resiliency, and reliability —achieving a strong ROI remains a challenge if the cloud strategy is not comprehensive,” says Krishna Mohan, vice president and global head of the cloud business unit at consultancy TCS.

“Cloud is far more than a technical architecture upgrade,” he adds. “Often in enterprises, the legacy systems hold important core business logic, so legacy modernization on cloud to drive business benefits is key. But it’s more nuanced and complex and time consuming.”

Cloud adoption without attendant legacy modernization can backfire, S&P Global’s Kocherlakota says. “Simply using the cloud as a data center while maintaining legacy applications can lead to cost creep,” he says. “Investing in transforming legacy systems optimizes infrastructure and boosts efficiency.”

The good news, says Mohan, is that generative AI is slashing the time it takes to modernize legacy systems from four to five years to 18 to 24 months, “but it requires accelerated governance, reskilling, and risk management.”

A large organization Topinka worked with was replacing a decades-old mainframe system with a cloud ERP platform. “It was the perfect trigger to revisit their entire cloud strategy,” Topinka says. “Without that reset, they would have simply replicated outdated processes in a new environment, missing opportunities to modernize governance, integration, and innovation approaches.”

How will AI impact our cloud architecture and governance needs?

“AI fundamentally changes compute requirements, storage demands, cost models, and security needs,” says Topinka. “Ignore this, and you will have an expensive, insecure science project.”

One organization he worked with planned to run all AI workloads in a single public cloud region until they realized that data residency regulations would make that option non-compliant. A hybrid approach addressed regulatory requirements and kept the project on track.

“Even with the best intentions, AI programs will stall or misfire if they are not grounded in a cloud architecture built for scale, compliance, and secure operations,” Topinka says.

Another of Topinka’s clients had minimal cloud experience and quickly committed to an aggressive AI program. “Their data pipelines, security model, and governance structures were not ready for AI-scale workloads,” Topinka explains. “Revisiting the cloud strategy before scaling AI saved them from costly rework and allowed the AI program to deliver business value faster.”

Access to the high-quality data required for AI models — particularly large language models — is a must.

“Data pipelines are a foundational requirement because they are the fuel that drives the AI models and enables continuous learning and feedback loops to improve model outputs,” says Dinakar Hituvalli, CTO at enterprise software and project management firm Deltek.

To help a large logistics company develop a cloud strategy aligned with its AI and data transformation objectives, Hackett Group’s Nathan says they began with a reassessment of cloud goals before turning to AI readiness, ensuring the infrastructure could support data centralization, model training, and scalable inference, while addressing regional data residency requirements to support the company’s expansion into Europe and Asia-Pacific.

Does our cloud strategy align with our sustainability goals?

“As enterprises increasingly prioritize environmental responsibility, it’s important to request and compare detailed environmental impact data from cloud providers,” says Kocherlakota, especially as cloud providers vary in their commitments to renewable energy and carbon neutrality.

IT leaders can factor energy efficiency into their cloud decisions by hosting workloads in regions powered by renewable energy and optimizing workloads to minimize consumption. “This not only supports sustainability goals but can also enhance brand reputation and align with corporate social responsibility initiatives,” Kocherlakota says.

Should our cloud-first strategy be cloud-only?

In short, no, says Mohan of TCS. Today’s organizations may find that hybrid or distributed cloud designs may make sense in situations with complex business, security, regulatory, or operational spending requirements. It’s about the right workload placement.

AI is also having an impact on these decisions. “Traditionally, enterprises pulled data to a centralized location for orchestration, production, and deriving value,” says Mohan. “With AI now being applied to wherever the data resides across the IT estate, organizations can drive more impactful edge use cases and outcomes.”

As such, CIO’s cloud strategies should consider hybrid and edge solutions. “With AI and cloud working together, CIOs can balance out their return on investment, since edge cloud reduces latency, improves reliability, lowers data transfer, and enables real-time decision-making, directly improving customer experience and ROI,” Mohan says.

What happens if we need to move to a different service or provider?

“In a time of rapid change and massive uncertainty it is critical for technology leaders to avoid technology dead ends. Sadly, it is hard to predict the form of those dead ends,” says Nickolaisen. “Anything in our world may be a barrier to agility — that includes cloud architecture and decisions.”

Whereas in the past a cloud decision may have been primarily made based on cost and elasticity, leaders must now consider obsolescence and portability of workloads, contracts, and skills. IT leaders should work through what they can do to reduce “switching costs” because they might need to change technologies, providers, tools, and skills quickly.

“How can we loosely couple cloud services from other services so that we can find a reasonable balance between replaceability and reusability? Even things like contract terms might need to change to roll with the uncertainty punches,” says Nickolaisen, who has been able to migrate from one cloud provider to another, and migrate to or repatriate from the cloud, in hours. “This becomes essential when conditions are changing quickly, as they are now,” Nickolaisen says.

As Topinka urges: “Your cloud strategy needs to be a living plan, reviewed often, or it will age out quickly.”",https://www.cio.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4051063-0-22053400-1757412282-cloud-strategy-questions-shutterstock_2675764721.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-09-09 18:17:08.578565
ID37,S&P Global,2025-09-09 16:04:40+00:00,www.insurancebusinessmag.com,"E&S market now structural, not just cyclical: Liberty Mutual's Dolan",Gia Snape,,,,,https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/wholesale/eands-market-now-structural-not-just-cyclical-liberty-mutuals-dolan-548999.aspx,"The US domestic E&S market maintained strong momentum in 2024, although its pace of expansion has slowed for the second consecutive year, according to data by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
For Matthew Dolan (pictured), president of North America specialty and executive vice president of global risk solutions at Liberty Mutual Insurance, the market has evolved beyond cyclical forces and is now anchored in structural necessity.
“Yes, there are always cyclical catalysts that push business from admitted to E&S,” he said.
In his assessment, cyclical forces still matter, but the market today is “much more predominantly structural than cyclical.” Complex risk and wholesaler distribution fuel E&S growth Dolan pointed to the heightened complexity and fluidity of today’s risk environment as the primary driver of E&S growth.
“The combination of hotter, wetter, faster, stronger storms with challenged infrastructure creates a very dynamic risk equation,” Dolan told Insurance Business.","The US domestic E&S market maintained strong momentum in 2024, although its pace of expansion has slowed for the second consecutive year, according to data by S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Premiums have now recorded double-digit annual growth for six consecutive years. However, after years of rapid acceleration, this growth raises the critical question: Is the surge in E&S a cyclical reaction or a permanent shift?

For Matthew Dolan (pictured), president of North America specialty and executive vice president of global risk solutions at Liberty Mutual Insurance, the market has evolved beyond cyclical forces and is now anchored in structural necessity.

Dolan’s view is that while both forces are at play, the balance has tilted. “Yes, there are always cyclical catalysts that push business from admitted to E&S,” he said. “But now we’re seeing more permanence.

He argued that there’s a growing recognition that E&S is an appropriate mechanism for today’s risk environment: one that’s faster, more complex, and unlikely to revert to something predictable or benign. In his assessment, cyclical forces still matter, but the market today is “much more predominantly structural than cyclical.”

Complex risk and wholesaler distribution fuel E&S growth

Dolan pointed to the heightened complexity and fluidity of today’s risk environment as the primary driver of E&S growth. Climate change, weakened infrastructure, and increasingly severe natural catastrophes have reshaped the property market.

“The combination of hotter, wetter, faster, stronger storms with challenged infrastructure creates a very dynamic risk equation,” Dolan told Insurance Business. “The ability to respond quickly is incredibly important, and the E&S market is designed to facilitate exactly that.”

“When admitted mechanisms can’t respond quickly enough, business migrates to E&S where flexibility in terms, limits, and pricing is possible,” said Dolan.

Specialty lines, including environmental, healthcare, financial, and cyber, are also contributing to the expansion. Cyber in particular exemplifies the need for adaptability as exposures evolve rapidly.

Another factor is the rise of wholesale distribution. Wholesalers have grown in scale and sophistication, becoming central to connecting risks with solutions. Their influence, Dolan said, has reinforced the self-perpetuating growth of the E&S market: as more business flows in, more carriers and managing general agents (MGAs) invest in aligned capabilities, attracting even more activity.

However, not all lines are growing equally: property remains the most visibly cyclical segment. While E&S property has proven its structural relevance, pricing is heavily influenced by competitive swings. Wind-exposed catastrophe pricing, for example, has fallen sharply.

“Some would argue that it’s disproportionately low and may not be sustainable if we see a major cat event,” Dolan said.

Cyber shows similar traits. Though it has matured, Dolan argues that pricing is now lagging the true level of risk. “There’s significant latent risk, and it may take an event—or a series of losses—for pricing to recalibrate,” he said.

Property, though cyclical, will likely shift more business into E&S following catastrophe events. Casualty, meanwhile, continues to pose challenges across admitted and E&S markets alike, leaving room for sustained growth.

The strengths of the E&S model – speed and flexibility – are also not guaranteed in the long term. Dolan sees two potential inhibitors. First, regulatory oversight. “As more business moves into E&S, there’s always the possibility of increased regulation,” he said. “We haven’t seen meaningful examples yet, but it’s something we monitor because it could slow down E&S’s ability to respond quickly.”

Second, oversupply of capital. Growth has attracted investment and new entrants, and excessive capacity could drive pricing below sustainable levels. “That could distort the market and cause performance issues,” Dolan said.

How can wholesale brokers succeed in this environment?

Despite risks, Dolan sees positive trends in collaboration between carriers and wholesalers. Both sides now share a clearer strategic alignment: delivering responsive, bespoke solutions for clients. Data and analytics are strengthening that partnership by helping wholesalers and carriers better assess loss performance, align appetites, and improve efficiency.

Data is also central to maintaining market discipline. “Historical data is useful, but in a rapidly evolving environment, it’s not always predictive,” Dolan said. “The real differentiator is using contemporary, real-time data to anticipate changes and adjust coverage or pricing accordingly.”

“It’s relatively easy to get in, but significantly more difficult to stay in and do it really well,” he said. “Effective use of data and analytics will be critical to avoiding oversupply-driven disruptions.”

For Dolan, the E&S market’s role is set to expand further. “Commitment to the E&S space is about creating real-time, sustainable risk transfer solutions,” he said.

“That’s the challenge and the beauty of E&S: it requires a contemporary understanding of how risks are evolving. We see it as a vital part of the insurance ecosystem, and we’re deeply committed to it.”",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/003/0356_638930188156702975.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 15:18:04.434476

US FOOD giant Kraft Heinz will divide into two standalone companies by mid-2026, aiming to reverse a prolonged slump in share price and unlock greater brand value.

The larger of the two new companies, yet to be named, will focus on sauces, spreads and seasonings which currently contribute US$15.4bn to Kraft Heinz’s net sales. It will include all Heinz- and Philadelphia-branded products, along with Kraft Mac & Cheese, and the Indonesian and Chinese condiments brands ABC and Master.

The second company will focus on North American grocery products such as packaged meats and cheeses and ready meals, including Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables, which currently contribute US$10.4bn to Kraft Heinz’s net sales. Full brand allocation between the two companies is yet to be announced.

The move echoes Kellogg’s 2023 decision to split into separate snack and cereal businesses.

Kraft Heinz did not specify the reasons behind its poor performance, although CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera hinted at mounting competition from lower-cost own-brand products, saying in an interview that he is “conscious of how consumers today, in the US in particular, are under pressure”. Abrams-Rivera will take the helm of the newly formed groceries-focused business, while the Kraft Heinz board is in the process of appointing a CEO to lead the sauces and spreads company.

The food giant has performed poorly on financial markets since Heinz bought Kraft in 2015. At the time of last week’s announcement, the Heinz Kraft share price was 26% lower than it was 12 months earlier, and 70% lower than in 2017. The board’s unanimous decision to split the company came after a strategic review was launched in May. Jack Pope, the lead director of the Kraft Heinz board, said he is confident the move “will translate into better performance and value creation for shareholders”.

Beanz there, done that

The 2015 merger between Kraft and Heinz was bankrolled by US conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity fund 3G Capital, who spent a combined US$28bn taking Heinz private in 2013, followed by US$63bn to buy Kraft two years later. Billionaire chair of Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett admitted to overpaying for Kraft in 2019, and today Kraft Heinz’s market value is just US$31bn. The board believes the total value of the two new companies could be greater than this, although Buffett told CNBC last week he was “disappointed” when the news of the split broke.

Concerns began to surface in 2023 when 3G Capital sold its entire stake in Kraft Heinz without formally notifying the company’s directors. Tensions became more visible in May this year, when two Berkshire Hathaway executives resigned from the board.

Berkshire Hathaway remains the largest shareholder in Kraft Heinz with a 27.5% stake, although the capital structure of the two new companies is yet to be announced. Kraft Heinz has said the separation transaction will be tax-free but will incur up to US$300m in additional costs.

Miguel Patricio, executive chair of the board of Kraft Heinz, said: “Kraft Heinz’s brands are iconic and beloved, but the complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to allocate capital effectively, prioritise initiatives and drive scale in our most promising areas.”",https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/media/21950/heinzbeans.jpg?width=960,N,,2025-09-09 13:25:57.730985

The new capabilities unify policy management with Vanta AI Agent, offer continuous monitoring for vendors and provide risk oversight and deeper integrations that give security leaders a single system to record to act on risk before it escalations.

The new capabilities seek to address the issue whereby risk management solutions are often fragmented across different siloed tools, teams and manual processes. Vanta argues that the disjointed approach keeps teams reactive, with critical risks often going unnoticed until it’s too late, slowing audits, delaying deals and leaving organizations exposed.

Vanta’s new capabilities have been designed to deal with fragmentation by embedding agentic AI into policy and evidence workflow and in doing so, centralizing risk registers into enterprise rollups. The idea is that with one system of record, organizations can smoothly operate and leaders gain visibility and proactive control. The result delivers reduced manual reporting, accelerates audits and strengthens trust.

“Organizations have long struggled with fragmented systems and reactive reviews,” said Chief Product Officer Jeremy Epling. “By embedding AI in policy workflows and unifying risk oversight across registers and vendors, we are changing how security teams operate.”

The Vanta AI Agent is now embedded in organizational context to manage policy workflows and is able to generate audit-ready policies, execute bulk updates across entire libraries and validate documentation for completeness. With the new capabilities, Vanta automates the most time-consuming tasks and keeps organizations continuously audit-ready by extending the same proactive intelligence that already flags gaps in evidence and service level agreement inconsistencies.

The new capabilities also offer a centralized, proactive approach to risk management, aligning business functions up to and through the boardroom.

New features include Multiple Risk Registers that allow organizations to structure risk management around their business units, with tailored views and risks for each function or category. A complementary feature called Enterprise Risk Rollups then consolidates those registers into a unified, real-time dashboard for executive-level visibility.

For vendor risk management, Vanta is offering continuous oversight, real-time vendor monitoring and triggering alerts based on configurable thresholds. Through continuous monitoring and alerts, summaries streamline questionnaires and surface key findings, ensuring vendor risks are identified proactively and that organizations can take immediate action.

Lastly, Vanta has also enhanced its Slack integration for security workflows with the ability to embed security workflows directly into the tools employees already use. Teams can submit and approve access requests, respond to reviews and questionnaires and receive timely notifications all without leaving Slack.

Vanta was previously in the news in July when it announced it had raised $150 million in new funding to accelerate AI innovation and expansion into new markets, including third-party risk and government compliance. The Series D round was led by Wellington Management Co. LLP and included Growth Equity at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, Sequoia Capital Operations, J.P.

August 27, 2025

To Our Shareholders,

We are living through one of the most profound moments in healthcare history - where artificial intelligence, robotics, sensing, and predictive modeling unlock the most complex operating system in the world: the human body. Patient and provider needs are shifting rapidly, and technology's capacity to meet those needs has never been greater. At the same time, we are entering one of the most pivotal moments in Medtronic's 76-year history. We are at the forefront of this transformation - pioneering innovations that will redefine care, not just improve it. And this is only the beginning.

A dynamic healthcare landscape

Healthcare systems everywhere are under pressure, with rising costs, challenging reimbursement, and persistent staffing shortages. At the same time, care is being redefined as procedures shift from hospitals to outpatient clinics and ambulatory surgical centers. And all the while, rapid advances in AI and digital technology are increasing the pace of change and the nature of competition in all industries, including healthcare.

For Medtronic, these realities have been a call to action. They reinforced that innovation must extend beyond devices alone - to how we partner with customers, integrate into new care settings, and support clinicians before, during and after procedures. We are advancing these new types of innovation, while continuing to deliver the world class product innovation and clinical outcomes that have defined Medtronic for decades.

A changing Medtronic

It is against this backdrop of change that we have been transforming Medtronic to unlock its full potential. Since 2020, we've taken on a methodical evolution that continues today. We redesigned our Operating Model to streamline decision-making and bring us closer to customers and patients. We have built agility and resilience into our supply chain and strengthened reliability and quality, raising standards across the enterprise - both in terms of our people, and the level at which we must execute.

Focused innovation driving growth

To meet the evolving needs of our customers and patients - and to position Medtronic for long-term success - we are shifting the nature of our innovation in meaningful ways. We are increasing investment in

R&D, sharpening our focus through the divestiture of Diabetes, and advancing therapies that not only improve outcomes but also make care simpler, more seamless, and more sustainable. Just as important, we are leveraging our world-class expertise in product development with industry-leading know-how in AI and digital technologies.

One of our core strengths has always been scaling global innovation: taking breakthrough ideas and bringing them to patients and clinicians worldwide. Today, our pipeline is the broadest and deepest in our history, with several once-in-a-generation technologies coming to fruition. But as physicians and hospital leaders remind us, even the most advanced therapy is of little value if it disrupts strained workflows. Technologies must deliver superior clinical outcomes while fitting seamlessly into practice, so clinicians can focus on their patients. That perspective guides our design and deployment of innovative solutions across the enterprise - both those advancing care today and those on the near horizon, such as:

AiBLE™ digital ecosystem gives physicians tools that make procedures more precise and

workflows more efficient - raising the bar for the industry and prompting competitors to exit.

Pulsed-field ablation (PFA) is establishing the new standard of care in atrial fibrillation, and our newest suite of technologies, including the Affera™ mapping and navigation system with Sphere-9™ catheter, is transforming the field.

Closed-loop sensing in neuromodulation enables real-time therapy adjustments for both pain and brain disorders, personalizing care and reducing clinic visits.

Tibial implantable neurostimulator will provide a more convenient, effective option to millions suffering from bladder incontinence.

Robotic-assisted surgery platform expands access to quality surgery across indications and geographies through advanced instrumentation and seamless integration.

Symplicity™ renal denervation therapy may be the biggest thing Medtronic ever does, offering a single procedure to help redefine care for many struggling with hypertension, one of the world's most prevalent conditions.

These and other developments in our pipeline are not incremental advances. They are market-shaping innovations that reflect deliberate portfolio choices - focusing resources where our technology, scale, and Mission come together. By aligning innovation with customer needs and global demand, we are not only redefining care but also creating durable drivers of revenue growth, margin expansion, and longterm shareholder value.

Our FY25 performance

That progress is showing up in our performance. In FY25, revenue grew 4.9% on an organic basis to $33.6 billion in FY25, driven by portfolio strength and our innovation pipeline. We delivered non-GAAP operating profit of $8.65 billion, up 5% (9% constant currency), with operating margins expanding to 25.7%, a 100-basis-point increase on a constant currency basis. Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.49 rose 6%, or 10% on a constant currency basis. GAAP results also improved meaningfully, with operating profit up 16% and EPS up 31%. We returned $5.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, marking our 48th consecutive year of dividend increases.

Guided by Our Mission

Performance matters. And what makes Medtronic unique is that our actions are always rooted in our

Mission, which has been our North Star since it was written more than 60 years ago. It drives us to harness the power of science and technology to address the most pressing needs in healthcare, and it keeps us grounded in the truth that behind every therapy and every data point is a person who needs our help. In FY25 alone, our technologies reached more than 79 million people: an extraordinary milestone, yet only a fraction of those who could benefit.

ID19,H&M,2025-09-09 15:35:46+00:00,Grist,Report: Big businesses are doing carbon dioxide removal all wrong - Grist.org,Joseph Winters,,,,,https://grist.org/accountability/report-carbon-dioxide-removal-companies/,"But only some types of carbon removal are actually effective — and these are largely not the kind that major companies are investing in.
The handful of companies investing in more reliable carbon removal are mostly not doing so in conjunction with deep decarbonization, or the elimination of carbon emissions altogether.
Currently, these durable techniques don’t work at scale: They account for just 0.1 percent of global carbon removal each year.
Government investment and regulations are needed to scale up durable CDR — experts consider the next decade to be “crucial” for developing the technology — but the private sector can help too, by funding durable CDR projects and research.
Tech companies can fully decarbonize without offsets, so their emissions targets should not depend on carbon removal.","Achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 will require removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s foremost authority on the topic. But only some types of carbon removal are actually effective — and these are largely not the kind that major companies are investing in.

A new report from the NewClimate Institute, a European think tank, finds that 35 of the world’s biggest businesses are leaning on short-term tree-planting and other forms of “nondurable” carbon removal in order to say they’ve neutralized some of their climate pollution. The handful of companies investing in more reliable carbon removal are mostly not doing so in conjunction with deep decarbonization, or the elimination of carbon emissions altogether.

There is a “dangerous mismatch between corporate climate claims and the reality of what is needed to reach global net-zero,” the organization said in a press release. Reaching net-zero by the middle of the century — a scenario where all unavoidable human-caused climate pollution is canceled out via carbon removal — is considered necessary to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

Carbon dioxide removal, or CDR, refers to efforts to capture CO2 after it’s been emitted into the atmosphere and store it in rocks, land, ocean reservoirs, or human-made products. The most reliable types of carbon removal, which the NewClimate Institute calls “durable CDR,” involve injecting carbon into geological formations or turning it into rocks, where it will stay put for at least 1,000 years — about the same amount of time that CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels will remain in the atmosphere.

Currently, these durable techniques don’t work at scale: They account for just 0.1 percent of global carbon removal each year. The rest is based on methods like planting trees, restoring wetlands, and burying carbon in the soil, which are much cheaper but can only keep carbon out of the atmosphere for decades or a few centuries at most.

Government investment and regulations are needed to scale up durable CDR — experts consider the next decade to be “crucial” for developing the technology — but the private sector can help too, by funding durable CDR projects and research. In industries like construction, for which total decarbonization is not yet possible, companies will likely need to use durable CDR to offset residual emissions as part of a credible climate strategy.

The NewClimate Institute authors looked at 35 of the world’s largest companies across seven sectors: agrifood, aviation, automobiles, fashion, fossil fuels, tech, and utilities. Tech companies showed the most investment in durable CDR — Microsoft alone is responsible for 70 percent of all durable CDR ever contracted — but the report criticizes the sector for planning to claim “potentially significant amounts” of both durable and nondurable CDR toward net-zero targets. Tech companies can fully decarbonize without offsets, so their emissions targets should not depend on carbon removal.

Aviation was the other sector showing the greatest support for durable CDR, but only one airline — Japan’s All Nippon Airways — had a “reasonable” plan to use the technology to neutralize residual emissions by 2050. Three airlines lacked concrete plans.

Of the 15 companies across the agrifood, automobiles, and fashion sectors, only H&M and Stellantis are investing in durable CDR. Two of the five utilities in the report, Eon and Orsted, are supporting durable CDR projects, but it’s unclear whether Eon intends to use removals to count toward its net-zero goal, and the NewClimate Institute says some of Orsted’s removals are being double-counted in the emissions reduction targets of both Denmark and Microsoft. The five fossil fuel companies analyzed — Equinor, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Sinopec, and TotalEnergies — are focusing mostly on carbon capture and storage, which intercepts CO2 at the point of emission, before it escapes into the atmosphere, and does not reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.

Silke Mooldijk, an expert with the NewClimate Institute and the lead author of the new report, said she wasn’t surprised to find limited support for durable CDR, except from some tech companies. What did surprise her was that companies investing in durable CDR projects did not publicly report any information on these projects’ environmental and social risks. Some CDR methods, for example, may jeopardize biodiversity, while others require large amounts of renewable energy that would have to be diverted from other uses. “Not a single company in our report disclosed details on potential risks of projects they support and how they mitigate those,” Mooldijk told Grist.

Grist reached out to all 35 companies included in the report. Adidas, Amazon, Enel, Google, H&M, Inditex, Microsoft, and TotalEnergies responded by describing their net-zero commitments. Adidas and Enel, which are not currently investing in durable CDR, said they would use “high-quality” carbon removals to offset their residual climate pollution after taking actions to decarbonize; Inditex said it is “exploring” durable CDR to offset residual emissions, and its use of the technology “will be determined by the evolution of reference scientific frameworks.”

Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and H&M are currently investing in durable CDR. A spokesperson for H&M described the fast-fashion company’s purchase of 10,000 metric tons of durable CDR from the Swiss company Climeworks, one of the largest purchases to date, and said H&M plans to use them to neutralize residual emissions. The tech companies affirmed their commitment to reduce emissions first and then use carbon removal to offset residual emissions, though none of them addressed NewClimate Institute’s concerns that they would use large amounts of durable and nondurable CDR to claim progress toward net-zero.

A statement provided to Grist from TotalEnergies did not address CDR. It instead described the company’s support for carbon capture and storage and “nature-based solutions.” The latter refers to short-lived offsets, such as tree-planting, that the NewClimate Institute does not believe are appropriate for offsetting fossil fuel emissions.

Apple, Duke Energy, Google, and Shein declined to comment after seeing the report. The remaining 24 companies did not respond to inquiries from Grist.

Jonathan Overpeck, a climate scientist at the University of Michigan and the dean of its School for Environment and Sustainability, said the NewClimate Institute report is timely. “Right now the whole idea of CDR … is kind of a Wild West scene, with lots of actors promising to do things that may or may not be possible,” he said. He added that companies appear to be using CDR as an alternative to mitigating their climate pollution.

“The priority has to be on reducing emissions, not on durable CDR at this point,” he told Grist.

In the near term, durable CDR is doing virtually nothing to offset emissions. As of 2023, only 0.0023 gigatons of CO2 were removed from the atmosphere each year using these methods. That’s about 15,000 times less than the annual amount of climate pollution from fossil fuels and cement manufacturing.

According to the NewClimate Institute, voluntary initiatives are no substitute for government-mandated emissions reduction targets and investments in durable CDR. To the extent that these initiatives exist, however, the organization says they should provide a clearer definition of what constitutes “durable” carbon removal; determine companies’ responsibility for scaling up durable CDR based on their ongoing and historical emissions, or — perhaps more realistically — on their ability to pay; and require companies to set separate targets for emissions reductions and support for durable CDR. The last recommendation is intended to reinforce a climate action hierarchy that puts mitigation before offsetting. Companies should not “hide inaction on decarbonization behind investments in removals,” as the report puts it.

Mooldijk said voluntary initiatives can incentivize investments in durable CDR by recognizing “climate contributions.” These might manifest as simple statements about companies’ monetary contributions to durable CDR, instead of claims about the amount of CO2 that they have theoretically neutralized.

Some of these recommendations were submitted earlier this year to the Science-Based Targets initiative, the world’s most respected verifier of private sector climate targets. The organization is getting ready to update its corporate net-zero standard with new guidance on the use of CDR. Another standard-setter, the International Organization for Standardization, is similarly preparing to release new standards on net-zero, which could curtail some of the most questionable corporate climate claims while also drumming up support for durable CDR.

John Reilly, a senior lecturer emeritus at the MIT Sloan School of Management, said that ultimately, proper regulation of corporate climate commitments — including of durable CDR — will fall on governments. Companies “are happy to throw a little money into these things,” he said, “but I don’t think voluntary guidelines are ever going to get you there.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/smokestacks.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-09-09 12:44:36.342696

The administration also plans to trial a limited rebate program in 340B next year.
Spats between providers and drugmakers in 340B are nothing new, but are heating up as the program — and the money it represents — expands.
As for drugmakers’ unilateral rebate plans, a federal judge paused their implementation in May — though the ruling left the door open for such models in the future.","Dive Brief:

The country’s largest hospital lobby is accusing five major drugmakers of secretly conspiring to transition to a rebate model in 340B, in the latest salvo between providers and pharmaceutical companies over the future of the drug discount program.

On Monday, the American Hospital Association sent a letter to the heads of the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department’s antitrust division asking them to investigate Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Bristol Myers Squibb, Sanofi and Novartis for potential collusion.

The AHA’s letter points to the overlapping timeline of the drugmakers’ building up to and then announcing their 340B rebate plans, all of which occurred over the same five months.

Dive Insight:

Johnson & Johnson got the ball rolling last summer when it met with federal regulators to test the waters for a proposal to pay hospitals after-the-fact rebates on drugs in 340B, a program that allows safety-net providers to purchase outpatient drugs from manufacturers at significantly discounted rates. Historically, drugmakers issue the savings in the form of upfront discounts.

But Johnson & Johnson officially announced its new rebate model in August, despite warnings from the Health Resources and Services Administration, the federal agency that oversees 340B, that it was likely illegal.

Then, between August and January, Eli Lilly, Bristol Myers Squibb, Sanofi and Novartis all unveiled similar rebate proposals, lobbied regulators on their plans and sued the federal government for blocking their way — a timeline that shows a clear pattern of coordination behind the scenes to remake 340B. At least, that’s according to the AHA’s theory of events, which the hospital lobby laid out in the letter to FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson and Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater of the DOJ.

“The announcement of these rebate models came like a bolt from the blue, shocking hospitals and health systems across the nation,” the AHA wrote. “There was no prior concerted lobbying effort on the part of drug companies prior to their announcement. There was no indication whatsoever. The world’s largest drug companies simply stated — within days and weeks of each other — that this was now how it would be done.”

Specifics of the drugmakers’ rebate plans differ, but they all align on one fundamental premise: that they will stop providing upfront discounts for 340B drugs to providers, and instead require providers to buy the drugs at full price and then submit for a rebate later.

The goal is to check that the requested discount is valid before paying it out, to crack down on fraud and abuse in 340B, according to the pharmaceutical companies. But to hospitals, it’s a thinly veiled strategy to avoid paying the discounts that safety-net providers are owed in the decades-old program, which creates billions of dollars in savings.

The AHA’s plea to the Trump administration cites President Donald Trump’s history of commitments to hold drug companies accountable. But healthcare regulators now appear more open to restructuring 340B than their predecessors in the Biden administration. The Trump administration wants to move 340B oversight under the CMS, which has a history of backing rebate models in other programs. The administration also plans to trial a limited rebate program in 340B next year.

Spats between providers and drugmakers in 340B are nothing new, but are heating up as the program — and the money it represents — expands.

Roughly 3,000 hospitals benefit from discounted drugs under the program, which accounted for a record $66.3 billion in purchases in 2023, according to government data. That’s up more than 50% from $43.9 billion just two years prior.

Some critics point to the growth as evidence that 340B has mutated beyond its original intent, with drugmakers accusing hospitals of manipulating the program to profit. It’s a concern shared by some lawmakers, including Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., the chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.

This spring, Cassidy published an investigation finding that 340B discounts don’t always translate to lower costs or improved access for patients. The report builds on conflicting evidence as to how providers use 340B funds.

Much of drugmakers’ efforts to constrain 340B have taken place in the courts, with mixed outcomes. For example, last month an appeals court allowed a suit to proceed accusing insulin manufacturers of colluding to restrict providers’ use of contract pharmacies.

As for drugmakers’ unilateral rebate plans, a federal judge paused their implementation in May — though the ruling left the door open for such models in the future.

The report points out this is the second suit by an advertising exchange since a ruling in April that found Google held an illegal monopoly over ad exchanges and the tools employed by websites to sell advertising space.

Another trial is set for later this month to determine Google’s remedies in that case. The U.S. Justice Department has said Google should be made to immediately divest itself of its AdX advertising exchange, while Google says such a measure isn’t necessary.

PYMNTS has contacted Google for comment but has not yet gotten a reply.

PubMatic CEO Rajeev Goel told Bloomberg the April ruling was “meaningful but not complete,” and that his company’s lawsuit wasn’t simply about money, but also about making sure online ad markets work.

“It felt like for many years no matter how well we innovated there was a barrier holding us back,” Goel said. “That barrier wasn’t the limits of our technology. It was Google’s illegal monopoly. Every time we adapted or innovated, Google found new ways to stack the deck.”

completed its $218 million acquisition of 623 Fifth Avenue, a 36-story, 382,500-square-foot office condominium currently 75% vacant [1]. This move, while bold in a market still grappling with post-pandemic uncertainty, underscores a calculated bet on Manhattan’s evolving office landscape. By repositioning the property as a “premier Class A boutique office building,” Vornado is leveraging its prime location above the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store to capitalize on surging demand for high-end, flexible workspaces [4].

The Manhattan Office Market: A Tale of Two Skylines

Manhattan’s office market in 2025 is defined by stark contrasts. On one hand, trophy properties—such as the Time Warner Center or 125 Park Avenue—are commanding rents of $120–$125 per square foot, with occupancy rates nearing pre-pandemic levels [5]. On the other, older Class B and C buildings face vacancy rates exceeding 20%, struggling to compete with modernized alternatives [1]. According to a report by OfficeFinder, the first half of 2025 saw 20.6 million square feet leased, a 17.2% year-over-year increase, driven largely by mid-sized tenants (2,000–7,500 SF) seeking agile, amenity-rich environments [1].

Vornado’s acquisition aligns with this shift. The company’s plan to redevelop 623 Fifth Avenue into a boutique office building—complete with flexible lease terms, wellness-focused amenities, and transit-oriented design—positions it to capture demand from firms prioritizing prestige and productivity [4]. This strategy mirrors broader industry trends, where Class A buildings are offering concessions of up to $30 per square foot to attract tenants, while trophy towers remain resilient [1].

Strategic Rationale: Location, Repositioning, and Long-Term Value

The 623 Fifth Avenue site is a textbook example of “opportunistic repositioning.” Its location in Midtown, adjacent to the 42nd Street subway hub and above a retail anchor, provides inherent demand from both office and consumer markets. Vornado’s decision to redevelop rather than divest reflects confidence in Manhattan’s long-term fundamentals. As stated by Cushman & Wakefield in its Q2 2025 market report, Manhattan’s overall availability rate fell to 16.4%, the lowest in four years, driven by a 44% decline in sublease inventory [4].

Moreover, the acquisition aligns with Vornado’s historical playbook of acquiring distressed assets in prestigious locations. The company’s focus on repositioning aligns with citywide efforts to repurpose underutilized office space. For instance, the 467-m tax exemption program has spurred over 17,400 residential units from office conversions in 2025 alone [2]. While Vornado’s project will remain commercial, its boutique approach mirrors the flexibility seen in mixed-use conversions, such as the 2,000-unit Hell’s Kitchen development by Metro Loft [2].

Challenges and the Path Forward

The 75% vacancy rate at 623 Fifth Avenue is a hurdle, but Vornado’s redevelopment timeline—likely spanning 18–24 months—positions the asset to benefit from Manhattan’s accelerating recovery. Data from Avision Young shows that Midtown’s occupancy rates now average 56% on weekdays, with demand concentrated in buildings offering “exclusive” amenities [3]. By targeting mid-sized tenants and emphasizing premium features, Vornado can command rents exceeding $100 per square foot, offsetting initial redevelopment costs.

A critical risk lies in the pace of market normalization. If remote work trends persist, even trophy properties could face pressure. However, Vornado’s strategy hinges on the premise that Manhattan’s office market will stabilize by 2026, driven by corporate relocations and a return to in-person collaboration.

Conclusion: A Bet on Manhattan’s Resilience

Vornado’s acquisition of 623 Fifth Avenue is more than a real estate transaction—it’s a statement of confidence in Manhattan’s ability to reinvent itself. By transforming a vacant asset into a high-demand office hub, the company is betting on the enduring appeal of prime locations, the growing preference for flexible workspaces, and the city’s broader shift toward mixed-use, transit-oriented development. For investors, this move highlights the importance of strategic repositioning in an era of market flux. As the 2025 data shows, the future of Manhattan’s office market belongs to those who can adapt—and Vornado is positioning itself at the forefront.

Ralph Lauren has launched “Ask Ralph,” a new conversational AI chatbot to provide styling and shopping advice.

Developed with Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI platform, the bot can create curated looks from simple prompts and is rolling out on the Ralph Lauren app in the US.

Ralph Lauren is dipping its toe into artificial intelligence (AI) with a new in-app chatbot designed to assist users with styling and shopping advice. The partnership with Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI platform is being rolled out on the Ralph Lauren app in the United States, on both Apple and Android devices.

With prompts like “What should I wear to a concert?” or “How can I style my navy-blue men’s blazer?” the Ask Ralph bot can put together a curated look and offer styling tips. The conversational AI feature uses natural language processing to address open-ended prompts, interpret context, and provide recommendations, much like an in-store stylist. Additionally, users can clarify prompts and refine results based on their tastes.

David Lauren, Chief Branding and Innovation Officer and son of Ralph Lauren shared, “Twenty-five years ago, we partnered with Microsoft to launch one of the fashion industry’s first e-commerce platforms, and today, we are once again redefining the shopping experience for the next generation.”

“Ask Ralph is about more than just discovery — it is about engaging consumers with what they love most about Ralph Lauren: our iconic, unique take on style, providing timeless head-to-toe looks that inspire them to step into our world,” he added.

The launch comes as AI continues to penetrate daily life, with chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and X‘s Grok becoming readily available to general users. Now that these generative AI tools have gained mass use, companies like Ralph Lauren are finding ways to tailor these services to their businesses. Elsewhere, fashion trade publication Business of Fashion has launched the Brain of Fashion with Quilt.AI, a bot trained on the platform’s content and business intelligence.

However, it remains to be seen whether customers will welcome branded AI tools in the same way that they have adopted general chatbots. In particular, heritage brands like Lauren’s run the risk of diluting their brand DNA with increased automation. Ralph Lauren and its sibling labels, Polo Ralph Lauren and RRL, draw from the designer’s charismatic personality, his Americana ethos, and focus on authenticity.

Could these sensibilities and traits be translated into an AI-powered chatbot? As AI capabilities advance with more human-like interactions, the prospect doesn’t seem impossible.

The company has plans to continue developing the tool by adding new features, expanding to other brands, and launching in additional global markets.

One in four shoppers indicates sustainable / recyclable packaging is very important for their online orders, and nearly half of online shoppers indicated they would be willing to pay an additional fee for two-hour delivery.","The next phase of online ordering of groceries includes recognizing that, yes, most people still like to shop in a brick-and-mortar store — but they also increasingly shop online.

Harmonizing those two realities is increasingly on retailers’ and their online ordering partners’ minds.

According to an Instacart spokesperson, the best way to think about the evolution of the company’s services for retail grocery can be summed up thusly: Instacart is no longer just a grocery delivery platform.

“We’re building the future of omnichannel retail. Today, more than 1,800 retail banners and nearly 100,000 individual stores are available on Instacart across a wide variety of verticals, from grocery and home improvement to beauty, pet supplies, and department stores, and many of them use one or more of our enterprise solutions.”

The company has doubled down on providing enterprise solutions for retailers across its Connected Stores and e-commerce offerings to help them thrive in a world where consumers expect seamless experiences across both digital and physical storefronts, the spokesperson added.

Technology helps retailers find solutions that incorporate both online and in-store shopping. Solutions like Instacart’s AI-powered Caper Carts, Carrot Tags for dynamic digital shelf labeling, and FoodStorm order management system help retailers elevate in-store experiences with the intelligence and convenience of e-commerce.

And through its e-commerce solutions, according to the spokesperson, Instacart empowers retailers to grow their digital storefronts with tools like Storefront Pro, a customizable white-label solution that gives retailers full control over their online brand presence while leveraging Instacart’s proven infrastructure, fulfillment, and customer reach.

With Storefront Pro, retailers can also access Carrot Ads, Instacart’s advertising platform, that allows retailers to create their own retail media networks on their e-comm platforms.

On the upswing

According to a new report from The Feedback Group, Online Food Shopping Experience, 48% of those surveyed said they’re shopping for food online more than they did a year ago.

Seventy-nine percent plan to shop online either the same or more in the next 12 months, and almost seven in ten shoppers use their online provider of choice “a few times or more” every month.

Overall satisfaction with online grocery shopping steadily increases with age, according to The Feedback Group report, and supermarkets receive the highest average overall satisfaction score, notching higher approval rates that club, mass, Amazon and other channels.

Nearly nine out of ten shoppers felt positive about the online user experience after ordering, and seven out of ten shoppers receiving product recommendations or suggestions during their online ordering agree they were relevant to them. Half of those polled 50% reported noticing new items to try while shopping online.

Nearly eight out of ten online shoppers purchase groceries online, while at least half purchase meat, produce, bakery, dairy, and deli. Produce is a leader in fresh categories purchased online, but it also shows the lowest shopper confidence in quality and falls short of highest quality standards more than any other category.

Bringing online and in-store together

In 2025, Instacart is especially excited about how more of its retail partners — in the US and internationally — are embracing and expanding their use of Instacart’s enterprise offerings, according to the spokesperson.

“Retailers are increasingly looking for solutions that bridge online and in-store shopping, and our Connected Stores technologies and e-commerce solutions are enabling just that.”

A few examples of how retailers are using Instacart right now include:

ALDI has deployed several of Instacart’s Connected Stores technologies, including Caper Carts in both the U.S. and Austria, In-Store Mode in the Instacart app, and Carrot Tags software for digital shelf labeling. They also use Storefront Pro and fulfillment capabilities to power its e-commerce experience across the U.S., creating a consistent and intuitive brand experience wherever customers choose to shop.

Schnucks is another retailer using a variety of Instacart’s omnichannel solutions with Caper Carts and Carrot Tags that can be found in store. They also power their e-comm with Storefront Pro and use Carrot Ads on their e-comm site, creating new revenue streams for the retailer

The Save Mart Companies has adopted Caper Carts, FoodStorm and Storefront Pro to power their online and in-store shopping experience for their grocery banners, including Save Mart, Lucky, and FoodMaxx. Storefront Pro allows their grocery banners to create a customizable online storefront powered by Instacart while FoodStorm and Caper Cart customers can now place orders for made-to-order items like fried chicken or custom cakes and pies directly on the Caper Cart screen while they shop, and receive a notification once it’s ready for pickup, providing an effortless, in-store ordering experience.

“Instacart is truly a one-stop shop for in-store and e-comm technology,” according to the spokesperson. “We’re able to uniquely integrate the online and in-store shopping experience through our Connected Stores suite of technologies and e-commerce solutions. Each technology has its own standalone benefits, but when retailers invest in multiple offerings, they provide an omnichannel shopping experience.”

That makes Instacart uniquely positioned to help retailers win in the omnichannel era, delivering a more integrated, personalized, and convenient shopping experience for consumers — whether they’re buying in-store, online, or blending both.

Online, the spokesperson added, a retailer is able to build out a fully customizable online shopping experience for their customers using Storefront Pro while also unlocking new revenue streams through Carrot Ads.

In store, meanwhile, a retailer can streamline and digitize the shopping experience for consumers. A consumer is able to upload their Instacart grocery list to a Caper Cart as they enter the store. As they start shopping, they can place an order for a prepared sandwich from the deli department on their Caper Cart screen powered by FoodStorm.

Then, as they wait for their sandwich to be prepared, they can walk down aisles where Carrot Tags software powers an electronic shelf label to flash so the consumer can quickly identify the product they are looking for.

The future of grocery shopping, according to Instacart, won’t be about choosing between online and in-store — people are going to do both, and it will be important for retailers to have an omnichannel approach.

“Research shows that omnichannel customers are more valuable, with higher purchasing power and more annual shopping trips than brick-and-mortar-only customers. And our omnichannel offerings cater to this hybrid approach. Retailers are able to strengthen both their online and in-store presence and ensure that consumers can shop how they prefer, whether it’s online, in-store, or a combination of both.”

Industry strengths — and areas for improvement

Fair price for convenience of shopping online scores highest in the Feedback Group report, while confidence about personalization scores lowest, with all items showing room for improvement.

On the various touchpoints of the online shopping experience, supermarkets fared well as the top scoring channel on the majority of factors, while the dollar store channel had the most bottom mean scores.

While the majority of shoppers did receive all items ordered, nearly one out of every three did not, and more than nine out of ten shoppers report receiving delivered orders in the time window selected.

Personal shoppers received high marks for being pleasant to deal with and competent. They also received the highest score for improving the online order experience.

Nearly two out of ten shoppers indicated using some AI powered features while shopping online for their most recent online grocery order, and nearly half of shoppers would be at least somewhat likely to add items to an online shopping cart using voice commands if available through their provider.

One in four shoppers indicates sustainable / recyclable packaging is very important for their online orders, and nearly half of online shoppers indicated they would be willing to pay an additional fee for two-hour delivery.

Among those shoppers not already using automated reordering, about half were very or somewhat interested in using automated reordered, the other half were not interested.

From hospitals to manufacturers, stock markets to retail stores, the outage caused parts of the global economy to grind to a halt. Payment systems were disrupted, broadcasters went off the air, and flights were canceled. In all, the outage is estimated to have caused direct losses of more than $5 billion to Fortune 500 companies. For US air carrier Delta Air Lines, the error exposed the brittleness of its systems. The airline suffered weeks of disruptions, leading to $500 million in losses and 7,000 canceled flights.

The magnitude of the CrowdStrike incident revealed just how interconnected digital systems are, and the extensive vulnerabilities in some companies when confronted with an unexpected occurrence. “On any given day, there could be a major weather event or some event like what happened…with CrowdStrike,” said then-US secretary of transportation Pete Buttigieg on announcing an investigation into how Delta Air Lines handled the incident. “The question is, is your airline prepared to absorb something like that and get back on its feet and take care of customers?”

Unplanned downtime poses a major challenge for organizations, and is estimated to cost Global 2000 companies on average $200 million per year. Beyond the financial impact, it can also erode customer trust and loyalty, decrease productivity, and even result in legal or privacy issues.

A 2024 ransomware attack on Change Healthcare, the medical-billing subsidiary of industry giant UnitedHealth Group—the biggest health and medical data breach in US history—exposed the data of around 190 million people and led to weeks of outages for medical groups. Another ransomware attack in 2024, this time on CDK Global, a software firm that works with nearly 15,000 auto dealerships in North America, led to around $1 billion worth of losses for car dealers as a result of the three-week disruption.

Managing risk and mitigating downtime is a growing challenge for businesses. As organizations become ever more interconnected, the expanding surface of networks and the rapid adoption of technologies like AI are exposing new vulnerabilities—and more opportunities for threat actors. Cyberattacks are also becoming increasingly sophisticated and damaging as AI-driven malware and malware-as-a-service platforms turbocharge attacks.

To prepare for these challenges head on, companies must take a more proactive approach to security and resilience. “We’ve had a traditional way of doing things that’s actually worked pretty well for maybe 15 to 20 years, but it’s been based on detecting an incident after the event,” says Chris Millington, global cyber resilience technical expert at Hitachi Vantara. “Now, we’ve got to be more preventative and use intelligence to focus on making the systems and business more resilient.”

ACSI Household Appliance and Electronics Study 2025 / American Customer Satisfaction Index LLC.","We always knew that consumers preferred Windows PCs over Macs, but the numbers now back it up.

HP topped Apple as the most preferred PC maker in the 2025 iteration of the American Customer Satisfaction Survey — though general consumer satisfaction with PCs fell slightly compared with 2024 sentiments. Big names, like Microsoft, suffered in the eyes of their consumer critics.

Customers polled by the survey, however, said that the overall design of computers has improved, and that they marked that aspect as the best of the computing experience. The worst? The agony of calling and then navigating through a call center to receive customer support.

ACSI, which runs the study, said that it sent out thousands of email surveys to random customers, and the 16,205 completed surveys it received were used as the foundation for its 2025 report. Customers were asked about their experiences with the largest customers as well as an “all other” category. The ACSI received customer inputs on expectations, quality perceptions, and perceptions of value and used them as inputs to generate a score.

The biggest slips in perceived quality were Apple, Microsoft, and Acer, all of which lost three points in the ACSI rankings. Last year, Apple topped the charts with a score of 85. Yet its score of 82 placed Apple second; Dell’s ACSI score also decreased by a point compared to 2024. However, ACSI assigned Dell a score of 83, making it the most popular computer company for 2025.

ACSI Household Appliance and Electronics Study 2025 / American Customer Satisfaction Index LLC.

The ACSI also included tablets in this category, and added Amazon to its list of manufacturers. Tablet satisfaction scores plunged, from 81 in 2024 to 77 in 2025.

In general, computer satisfaction declined across every PC maker save Dell, which saw an increase in the satisfaction score from 2024’s 80 score to its 2025 score of 82.

ACSI measured several aspects of the computing experience — design, availability of software, ease of operation, graphics and sound quality, and more — and generally found that customers ranked them essentially the same as in 2024. Customers expressed the least satisfaction with a computer’s ability to prevent crashing, the general state of “features” like the OS or preloaded software, and call-center satisfaction. (They apparently hadn’t moved past our first review of Windows 11.)

ACSI Household Appliance and Electronics Study 2025 / American Customer Satisfaction Index LLC.

“The service experience may be a factor in the deviating levels of satisfaction between desktops and tablets,” the ACSI found. “Manufacturers continue to expand their repair networks to connect users with convenient outlets for service, but high repair costs and inconsistent parts availability continue to hinder the service experience for some.”

Interestingly, customers ranked the desktop experience higher than that using a laptop, though aspects like “website satisfaction” should have been mostly thee same for both.

Still, the category with the most need for improvement isn’t PCs, but tablets. Amazon clearly has its work cut out for it.",https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image_d63dc1.png?w=1024,N,,2025-09-09 12:44:46.197089

Walmart will work with the artificial intelligence (AI) startup to develop a version of the program that is tailored to the retailer’s employees, according to Morris’ note.

“This training is designed to help you at work and in your personal life in an increasingly digital world,” Morris told employees in the note.

In the meantime, before the launch of OpenAI’s program, Walmart employees can access AI training and other training opportunities through the retailer’s Live Better U education benefit and can learn more about AI at work at ai.walmart.com, per the note.

When OpenAI announced that it will introduce OpenAI Certification, it said in a blog post that the program will be designed to help businesses ensure that candidates and employees know how to use AI.

The OpenAI program will include tools to help people prepare for the certification, will offer different levels of certification ranging from the basics to prompt engineering and will be able to become part of companies’ own learning and development programs.

OpenAI said in its blog post that Walmart is one of the program’s launch partners.

Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said in the post that the retailer knows that the future of retail will be defined by not only technology but also people who know how to use it.

“By bringing AI training directly to our associates, we’re putting the most powerful technology of our time in their hands — giving them the skills to rewrite the playbook and shape the future of retail,” Furner said.

Walmart said in June that it introduced AI tools that are available to employees through its associate app. The tools include one that gives associates clear guidance on where to focus their efforts by understanding, prioritizing and recommending tasks; a real-time translation feature that is available in 44 languages and facilitates multi-lingual conversations among employees and customers; and an upgraded conversational AI platform that can answer questions such as, “How can I process a return without a receipt?”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Walmart.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 12:47:37.408585

ID35,Publicis Groupe,2025-09-09 14:55:31+00:00,lbbonline.com,"If AI Takes “Our Jobs, It's Because We've Made Our Jobs Really Stupid”: Tom Goodwin | LBBOnline",LBB Editorial,,,,,https://lbbonline.com/news/tom-goodwin-adma-keynote-2025,"But the result is “we have made our jobs really, really robotic.
People have absolutely no idea what is a fad, what is a theme, what is a trend, what is a threat.
“It’s not automation, it’s elevation,” and “a wonderful excuse” to “rethink what marketing can be.” “It allows us to cast aside the way we've done things before.
It allows us to be more ambitious.” He argued that, even before AI’s meteoric rise, the industry moved away from the ‘big ad’ era categorised by campaigns like Carlton Draught’s ‘Big Ad’.
There are people going around saying marketing doesn't matter because bots are going to buy things from other bots.","Marketers and agency executives have stripped the humanity -- “the wonder, the creativity, the mystery, the brilliance” -- from creative jobs in an attempt to understand, implement, and reap the benefits of artificial intelligence, according to marketing consultant and futurist Tom Goodwin.

But the result is “we have made our jobs really, really robotic. So if AI does take our jobs, it's because we've made our jobs really stupid.”

During a keynote speech on-stage at ADMA’s Global Forum in Sydney earlier today, he continued, “If you walk around your agencies, if you walk around your departments, it's people on Excel. They're copying and pasting files. There are people finding the average of what worked before. There are people following best practice. There are people using the right hue of blue that performed the best.

“What we really have at the moment is this era of avera-tising or average-a-tising, where we're making stuff that's sort of plausible and sort of fine and sort of acceptable, and no one's going to get fired, and it kind of works, and it tests well, and it's got a call to action, but I don't think anyone's going to remember this stuff.

“If we are going to save $50,000 of production money, but we're going to produce ads that no one really remembers, and then we're going to spend $1 million on media because no one's remembering it, the economics don't really work out.”

AI is like teenage sex, he claimed, showing a photo of a father sitting down for a conversation with his son. “He's a bit confused by what it is. He feels like everyone else is doing it. He doesn't really know how to do it.” The same is true of marketers who believe they’re “missing a trick” with AI, because “there's a lot of fear and uncertainty and doubt” and “this idea that everyone they know is doing it and everyone's enjoying it and getting really good results.”

“People are completely lost. People have absolutely no idea what best practice looks like,” he continued. “People have absolutely no idea what they should be measuring. People have absolutely no idea what is a fad, what is a theme, what is a trend, what is a threat.

“We're genuinely scared. I think we don't want to talk about it. I think people are fearful for their jobs. They think there's something they should be doing. They think they're doing the wrong things. There's a very low level of confidence out there.”

Tom is the co-founder of consultancy All We Have is Now, ex-head of futures and insights at Publicis Groupe, author of ‘Digital Darwinism: Surviving the New Age of Business Disruption’, and the host of technology show ‘Edge’.

In his view, AI should result in inflated ambitions, not accelerated cost cutting. “It’s not automation, it’s elevation,” and “a wonderful excuse” to “rethink what marketing can be.”

“It allows us to cast aside the way we've done things before. It allows us to have conversations with different people about getting budgets. It allows us to be more ambitious.”

He argued that, even before AI’s meteoric rise, the industry moved away from the ‘big ad’ era categorised by campaigns like Carlton Draught’s ‘Big Ad’. “Whoever came up with that, I’d love to buy them a rosé,” he said of the iconic, 20-year-old ad made by George Patterson and Partners. The era of big ads made way for the era of efficiency, then effectiveness, and now, “we’re in this era of attribution.”

“I've got a TV, I've got a fridge, I've got laundry detergent. I've never clicked on any ads for this stuff. Every single ad that was sent to me online has failed. Every single TV ad, all of the stuff I watched when I was young, all of the print advertising in the TV times, that has succeeded, but in this new world of attribution, that all looks like a failure.”

“It makes no sense” to him that brands that “for hundreds of years [have] dominated in their categories” are hyper-fixated on influencer marketing or personalisation, for example. “This is crazy to me. This is completely crazy.”

“We've got people like Unilever talking about influencer marketing,” he said.

“We've got people like P&G [Procter & Gamble] talking about the need to have one-on-one conversations at scale. For me, and people will disagree on this, this makes no sense whatsoever. I don't want to have a conversation with Head & Shoulders ... I don't need to have a personalised advertising campaign for my flavour of barbecue crisps.”

Similarly, while the ad tech market was worth USD$876 billion in 2024, the ads consumers see are “largely crap” and “we are surrounded by enormously irrelevant advertising.”

He gave an example: After clicking on a car ad out of curiosity, he was “swamped with ads for cars” from all brands and price points. Even if he wanted to buy a car, “'Wait a minute, this is a bit late in the process, isn't it? Maybe we should have done some stuff to make you like our brand before that.'”

But despite the “delta between the promise of technology” and the ads “normal human beings” are served, and the fact “it’s quite unfashionable” right now to be optimistic or calm, Tom was hopeful. He declared brands have “never been more important”, acting as a shortcut to decision-making, “a reason to feel better” about those decisions, and a “way to convey status, who we are.”

“There are people who go around saying that brands are dead. There are people going around saying marketing doesn't matter because bots are going to buy things from other bots. It's absolute nonsense. Brands are the way that we navigate the world.”

“We’re trying to recreate the experience of working with a well-trained Ralph Lauren salesperson,” says David Lauren, chief branding and innovation officer at Ralph Lauren, and son of the founder.
Twenty-five years ago, David appeared on stage with Bill Gates to unveil Polo.com, the very first Ralph Lauren website.
If you already have a blue blazer and turn to the Ask Ralph app for interesting ways to style it, the app will curate looks drawn from Ralph Lauren’s archives and style guide.
“I think of the Ask Ralph app as a kind of style book.","In the early 2000s, fashion brands had a realization: They could throw their inventory up on a website and ask customers to sift through it to find what they were looking for. Two decades later, the fundamental structure of e-commerce hasn’t changed much. Shopping is a drag that involves endlessly scrolling for merchandise.

But change is in the air. AI is about to transform everything about online shopping. Consumers are already turning to chatbots to find and compare products, and to platforms like Daydream that are designed specifically for shopping for clothes. Now, we’re about to see how fashion labels themselves can use AI to make shopping on their sites less laborious and more delightful.

Today, Ralph Lauren launches Ask Ralph, an AI stylist in the brand’s mobile app. The 58-year-old fashion brand has partnered with Microsoft to create an AI agent that mimics the experience of speaking with an stylist. You begin by expressing exactly what you’re looking for. Depending on the day, it might be specific like, “I’m looking for a black cardigan for the fall,” or open-ended like, “I’m moderating a panel at a big conference and I have no idea what to wear.”

Then, rather than sifting through rows of products, the app does the searching for you. It delivers fully styled looks from the current Ralph Lauren collection that you can shop immediately. And through the process, as you figure out what you’re looking for (say, cropped cardigans made of cashmere), the AI adapts to your preferences. “We’re trying to recreate the experience of working with a well-trained Ralph Lauren salesperson,” says David Lauren, chief branding and innovation officer at Ralph Lauren, and son of the founder. “We’ve taken all of our own best practices and built them into the AI.”

An Early Adopter

This isn’t Ralph Lauren’s first partnership with Microsoft. Twenty-five years ago, David appeared on stage with Bill Gates to unveil Polo.com, the very first Ralph Lauren website. This was a time when few other fashion brands had any online presence at all.

David has always been interested in adopting new technologies early. Shortly after the new website debuted, David partnered with NBC to build an online magazine full of videos and articles to blend content with commerce; in the following years, it would become common for brands to launch blogs on their website. And Ralph Lauren was among the first fashion brand to place QR codes in billboard and print ads to send consumers to its website. “We did this before most phones were able to read QR codes,” says David. “But people quickly caught up.”

Ralph Lauren has been toying with the idea of a digital stylist for a long time. In the early 2000s, that early version of the e-commerce website had an “Ask Ralph” feature, where you could read content about how to put a Ralph Lauren look together, and even a video streaming service where you could talk to a salesperson in a showroom. “What we didn’t have at the time was AI,” David says. “We realized that AI could help us realize many of the concepts we had dreamt about back then.”

To train the Ask Ralph model, Microsoft used data from Ralph Lauren’s archives and current collections to help identify the brand’s distinct aesthetic. Ralph Lauren’s creative team, from designers to in-store stylists, participated in the process to make sure that the app would create highly curated looks that reflect the brand’s take on styling.

Then, members of the in-store team were asked to contribute insights about how they work with a customer to help them find pieces. Once they had created a beta version of the app, they asked employees to use it and offer feedback.

The final version of the app uses conversational AI and natural language processing to understand open-ended prompts from the user. It also incorporates the customer’s shopping history, so that it can understand their preferences and pick pieces that match what they already have in their closet.

The app can interpret context: It can identify whether the customer is trying to quickly buy a shirt to match an existing blazer, or whether they are just playing around to find new ideas for outfits. It also only shows pieces of clothing that are currently available for purchase, and over time, the app will adapt to the user.

The Industry Shift

While Ralph Lauren is an early adopter of AI technology, many fashion brands are building their own apps, says Shelley Bransten, corporate VP of global industry solutions at Microsoft. She says that the fashion industry is now shifting from “scroll-based” shopping, which involves looking through rows of thumbnails, to “goal-based” shopping, which deploys AI to surface results based on the customer’s specific needs at that moment. “The shopping experience is going to be more personalized, relevant, and more tied to the customer’s intent,” she says.

Bransten says that many consumers have gotten so used to using AI agents like ChatGPT that they no longer remember how to use search boxes on websites. Instead, they type out full queries into search boxes, only to confuse the system. But companies that have made the leap to using AI on their e-commerce sites are already seeing more success. “They’re seeing higher conversion rates, units per transaction, and consumer happiness scores,” she says.

At the same time, we should expect more general AI agents to improve. I recently wrote about Daydream, a shopping platform that allows you to describe what it is you’re looking for, then searches for pieces from hundreds of brands. It will tailor the results to your size, personal preferences, and budget. Soon, platforms like this are likely to replace searching for clothes on Google, but David believes that some customers will still want to search directly on brand websites. “We have loyal, long-term customers who trust us,” he says. “Ask Ralph is another way to deepen this relationship.”

Ask Ralph is designed to make shopping less time-consuming for the customer, but David also believes it is an opportunity for Ralph Lauren to stand out by emphasizing the brand’s unique point of view. The app will curate looks that are very carefully aligned with the distinct Ralph Lauren aesthetic, and in doing so, will allow customers to enter the brand’s universe. “Our customers come to us because they like our point of view,” David says. “We can help them create the look that they want more directly.”

The app could also be a way to bring new customers in. While it is designed to make the purchasing process easier, David hopes that it is also a useful free tool for anyone looking for help to get dressed in the morning. If you already have a blue blazer and turn to the Ask Ralph app for interesting ways to style it, the app will curate looks drawn from Ralph Lauren’s archives and style guide.

“People still read fashion magazines and blogs to look for tips about how to dress,” David says. “I think of the Ask Ralph app as a kind of style book. It helps you figure out how to put a look together in the morning.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/09/p-1-91397413-david-lauren-ralph-lauren.jpg",N,,2025-09-09 12:46:31.360720

The grocer has also moved this year to accelerate its retail media activities, announcing in July that it had hired a new executive to oversee Albertsons Media Collective.
And on Aug. 27, Albertsons detailed changes to its merchandising strategy that included reassigning several divisional leaders.
Despite the myriad changes Albertsons has implemented thus far in 2025, investors have signaled that they are underwhelmed.
Following is a recap of some of the most significant developments at Albertsons this year.","When Albertsons’ plan to merge with Kroger imploded spectacularly at the end of last year, analysts were quick to point out that the supermarket operator was up against the clock as it worked to regain its footing.

Albertsons seems to have felt the same way.

Days after former Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran declared during a Jan. 8 earnings call that Albertsons had to speed up its growth to keep pace with “the very, very best in the industry,” the company revealed that it was cutting an undisclosed number of corporate jobs. Albertsons also said early this year that more than 150 corporate workers at its marquee Safeway banner would lose their jobs as the company looked to cut costs. The company said in February that it was streamlining its divisional structure to “operate in new and innovative ways,” setting the stage for its March 3 announcement that Sankaran was retiring and would be replaced as Albertsons’ chief executive by Susan Morris, who had served as COO since 2018.

In May, Albertsons continued to shake up its leadership ranks through an overhaul that included the appointment of a new chief merchandising officer and a chief commercial officer. The grocer has also moved this year to accelerate its retail media activities, announcing in July that it had hired a new executive to oversee Albertsons Media Collective. And on Aug. 27, Albertsons detailed changes to its merchandising strategy that included reassigning several divisional leaders.

Despite the myriad changes Albertsons has implemented thus far in 2025, investors have signaled that they are underwhelmed. The company’s stock price is off by about 2% year to date, while shares in Kroger have gained more than 11%.

Our many connected gadgets often refuse to talk to each other, governed by a bewildering ecosystem of apps that add more frustration than freedom.

So, where did the grand vision for the IoT get lost? IoT News caught up with Chitresh Sharma, Head of the Europe Insights Factory at L’Oréal, who offers a blunt diagnosis. He believes the industry has been so obsessed with the tech itself that it has completely forgotten about the people it’s supposed to serve.

Moving past just ‘Things’

The early days of IoT were all about novelty. A fridge that could order milk! A toaster you could turn on from your phone! The problem, Sharma argues, is that we never moved past this fascination with the “things”. The real magic isn’t in connecting a single object; it’s in creating an environment that understands you.

“What excites me most about the future of IoT and connected technology is not the ‘things’ themselves, but the seamless, almost magical, symphony they can create,” he says. “It’s about crafting an ecosystem where technology fades into the background, anticipating our needs with an intuition that feels deeply human.”

Sharma envisions a near future where “our environment intelligently adapts to us, not the other way around.” This is the goalpost of IoT success we should be aiming for: experiences so smooth and personal that they feel less like technology and more like life, just better.

The IoT today is a mess of devices shouting into the void, and it’s a problem of our own making. Sharma is clear that the barrier isn’t technical; it’s a fundamental lack of vision.

“The greatest challenge plaguing the IoT industry is a risk taking capabilities and lack of failure to imagine,” he observes. “Companies are sometimes overly focused on silicon, sensors, and standards, churning out a fragmented mess of ‘smart’ gadgets that don’t speak the same language. They’re building products, not experiences.”

This gets to the heart of why so many smart devices feel so unsatisfying. They exist in isolation.

“The real challenge isn’t technical; it’s a crisis of design and vision,” Sharma states. “We must move beyond the bits and bytes to create something truly beautiful, intuitive, and integrated that people will not just use, but love.”

A trend that actually matters for IoT success

In an industry addicted to buzzwords, we asked Sharma what trend businesses should actually be watching. His initial response was to the point: “Stop chasing trends.”

But then he got serious, pointing to a shift that he believes will separate the true innovators from the gadget-makers.

“The one trend that truly matters… is the explosion of intelligence at the edge,” he declares. This is about ending our reliance on distant, anonymous data centres.

“Forget the cloud. The future isn’t about shipping dumb sensor data to a server farm hundreds of miles away to get an answer back. That’s slow, inefficient, and a massive privacy vulnerability.”

The real innovation is putting a powerful brain inside the device itself. By running sophisticated AI right on the hardware, things can understand and react to the world in real-time, all without needing to phone home.

What this means in practice is faster responses, better privacy, and experiences that are truly personal to you. As Sharma puts it, “This is the trend that will define the next decade, turning simple connected objects into truly intelligent companions.”

Please, no more smart toasters

We’ve all seen the proliferation of smart gadgets that solve problems we never had. This has fuelled a massive misconception about what IoT is even for, and what success looks like.

“The most prevalent and maddening misconception is that IoT is about slapping a chip on every object in your house and calling it ‘smart’,” Sharma says. “A connected toaster is not innovation; it’s a gimmick. It’s a solution in search of a problem.”

And he’s right. The point isn’t to complicate our lives with an app for every appliance; it’s about using deeply integrated technology to solve real problems in a simple, elegant way.

“The goal isn’t to complicate our lives with a thousand different apps for a thousand different devices,” Sharma stresses, “but to simplify it in a truly fundamental way.”

So, how can companies avoid building the next connected toaster? For Sharma, it comes down to one golden rule, a piece of advice he considers both simple and the hardest thing for a tech company to do.

“Start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology,” he advises. “Don’t you dare start with a piece of technology and then try to figure out where to sell it.”

It’s about obsessing over the user. It’s about asking “What beautiful, effortless experience can we create?” before you ever write a line of code or design a circuit board. This human-centric approach is the only way to create products that resonate on an emotional level.

Sharma’s final piece of advice for IoT success is one the entire industry should heed: “If you aren’t creating something that people will fall in love with, something that makes their life better in a meaningful way, then you’re just making another gadget. And the world has enough gadgets.”

Gill Capital said in a statement on Tuesday that through Google Cloud’s AI Cloud Takeoff (AI CTO) program, it has embarked on multiple AI innovation projects.

One of them involves embedding a gen AI-powered search agent into e-commerce websites and apps (iOS, Android) for H&M Indonesia and H&M Thailand.

Built using Vertex AI Search for Commerce, this AI agent understands the true intent behind search queries in natural language.

On the backend, the agent also automatically analyzes and organizes a vast product catalog, freeing staff up from the tedious task of researching and adding keywords to each product.

Going a step further, Gill Capital is integrating a conversational agent into these platforms.

Also developed using Vertex AI Search for Commerce, this agent serves as a virtual shopping assistant, surfacing personalized product recommendations through multi-turn conversation.

It also helps customers with more complex tasks like checking if an item is in stock at nearby stores.

After piloting these two solutions with an initial group of users, Gill Capital has validated their effectiveness in boosting engagement and sales.

There are now plans to roll them out for H&M Indonesia and H&M Thailand later this year.

US retail giant Walmart will open its first namesake-branded stores later this year, selling fresh groceries, essential household goods, apparel, and technology.

The Arkansas-headquartered retailer did not disclose how many stores it would be opening, but indicated it would use a variety of locally sourced products.

The announcement follows Walmart’s first growth summit held in SA in April, which featured suppliers from 12 African countries and led to the recruitment of small and medium-sized suppliers from SA and the rest of the continent.

Kath McLay, Walmart International president and CEO, said in a statement that Walmart’s South African stores would “offer a wide range of merchandise, including fresh groceries, household essentials, apparel and technology”.

“Walmart also will offer a variety of locally sourced products. By partnering with South African suppliers and entrepreneurs, Walmart will bring its signature ”everyday low prices” and global standards to the market, while celebrating the country’s rich culture”.

Walmart said sites were already in development, with the new stores set to open before the end of the year, with official opening dates to be announced in October.

It said customers could “also look forward to digital capabilities to enhance their shopping journey”.

Miles van Rensburg, president and CEO of Massmart, Walmart’s locally owned retail operation, said the group was “thrilled to begin this journey introducing the iconic Walmart brand to South African associates, customers and communities”.

Massmart’s other brands, such as Game, Builders, and Makro, will continue, with Walmart being another brand added to the local portfolio.

Sasfin Wealth senior equity analyst Alec Abraham said this move by Walmart was “probably inevitable”, adding that the US giant was looking to “leverage off the Walmart brand and possibly gain off that” locally.

He said recent entries into SA from international brands, such as Amazon, had seen them coming in and adopting their own branding.

Abraham believed Walmart hoped to “gain a bit of traction due to the pool of brand equity it has”.

“I think, like any new entrant, there will be an initial excitement with people wanting to go and see what the offering is like. Then it will be up to Walmart to see if they can sustain that initial footfall, once everyone has checked out what they are offering.”

Anchor investment analyst Steph Erasmus said more competition entering the South African market was “great for the consumer”, especially a “very big brand like Walmart”.

He said it remained to be seen, though, how the US retailer would expand these Walmart-branded stores. He pointed out that in the group’s initial entry into SA about 12 years ago, it had not been successful in taking market share from the likes of Shoprite.

“Are they [Walmart] going to go flat out and try to take market share, or is it going to just be a little foray into South Africa? I am not sure how they are going to play this.”",https://news24cobalt.24.co.za/resources/029d-1eae0f9cefaa-66a98bdd5748-1000/format/inline/gettyimages-2230322326.jpeg,N,,2025-09-09 12:47:47.876688

Only 21 per cent of organisations currently have sufficient, high-quality data to train and fine-tune AI models.
""With rising citizen demands and stretched resources, public sector organisations recognise the ways in which AI can help them do more with less.
However, the ability to deploy Gen AI and agentic AI depends on having rock-solid data foundations,"" said Marc Reinhardt, Public Sector Global Industry Leader at Capgemini.","Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) is set to gain wider use across government organisations in the coming years, according to new research from the Capgemini Research Institute.

Agentic AI, which can make autonomous decisions, is seen as a natural extension of this momentum as governments seek to streamline operations, enhance decision-making, and respond more effectively to complex social challenges.

The study reveals that 90 per cent of public sector organisations intend to explore, pilot, or roll out agentic AI within the next two to three years.

Meanwhile, nearly two-thirds (64 per cent) of public sector bodies are experimenting with or deploying generative AI (Gen AI) to strengthen service delivery.

Data as the weak link

Despite enthusiasm, data readiness remains a pressing hurdle. Only 21 per cent of organisations currently have sufficient, high-quality data to train and fine-tune AI models. While leaders see the potential for AI to address rising citizen demands with limited resources, weak data foundations continue to slow progress.

""With rising citizen demands and stretched resources, public sector organisations recognise the ways in which AI can help them do more with less. However, the ability to deploy Gen AI and agentic AI depends on having rock-solid data foundations,"" said Marc Reinhardt, Public Sector Global Industry Leader at Capgemini.

The study highlights that in the next two to three years, 39 per cent of organisations will assess feasibility, 45 per cent will begin pilot programmes, and 6 per cent expect to scale existing agentic AI initiatives. Sectors such as defence (82 per cent), healthcare (75 per cent), and security (70 per cent) are particularly active in adopting generative AI solutions.

Security, trust, and skills concerns

Adoption, however, is not without hesitation. As many as 79 per cent of executives cited data security as a leading concern, while 74 per cent expressed doubts about trusting AI-generated outputs. The report suggests that governments must create stronger governance frameworks and data infrastructures to build confidence in these technologies.

The research also points to slow organisational progress in developing AI skills and promoting data sharing. Only 12 per cent of respondents said they were very advanced in activating data effectively, and just 7 per cent rated themselves mature in building AI-related skills.

Although every organisation surveyed reported current or planned data sharing initiatives, most efforts (65 per cent) are stuck at the planning or pilot phase. Challenges related to cloud infrastructure, sovereignty of AI systems, and privacy concerns continue to limit progress, even though data sharing is central to improving model performance and policy outcomes.

Leadership roles expand

Governments are also turning to specialised leadership roles to address these challenges. The report notes that 64 per cent of public sector organisations already have a Chief Data Officer in place, while another 24 per cent plan to appoint one. Similarly, 27 per cent currently employ a Chief AI Officer, and 41 per cent intend to establish this position in the future.

Reinhardt noted, ""Going forward, governments can be more agile and effective as AI augments the work of government employees to source information, conduct policy analysis, make decisions, and answer citizen queries.""",https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/1757424288-TheIntegrationofGenerativeArtificialIntelligenceGenAIintoe-commerceentertainmentandothersectorsisopeningnewdoorsformarketerstomakecustomerexperiencemoreseamles-2025-09-09T184359833.jpg?format=pjeg&auto=webp,N,,2025-09-09 12:43:59.476884

The ruling comes as part of a broader lawsuit unrelated to his resignation but entangled with it through discovery demands.
Jewel, known for her 1990s hits, sought damages exceeding $7 million, claiming Kroger failed to fulfill promotional and financial commitments.
For Kroger, now navigating a proposed $25 billion merger with Albertsons Cos., the decision averts potential distractions.
Sources from Fox News earlier highlighted the irony of a pop star’s lawsuit prying open corporate secrets, though the recent decision closes that door.","In a surprising turn of events in the ongoing legal saga surrounding Kroger Co.’s former chief executive, a judge has ruled that Rodney McMullen will not be compelled to undergo deposition questioning about the circumstances of his abrupt resignation earlier this year. The decision, handed down in Hamilton County, Ohio, shields McMullen from what could have been a revealing probe into his departure, which the company attributed to personal conduct issues.

McMullen, who led the supermarket giant for nearly a decade and had been with Kroger for almost five decades, stepped down in March amid an internal investigation. His exit left industry observers puzzled, especially given the $11 million in compensation he forfeited. The ruling comes as part of a broader lawsuit unrelated to his resignation but entangled with it through discovery demands.

The Unlikely Intersection of Corporate Drama and Celebrity Litigation

The case stems from a 2023 contract dispute involving singer-songwriter Jewel and her business partners, who accused Kroger of breaching agreements related to the Wellness Experience festival. Jewel, known for her 1990s hits, sought damages exceeding $7 million, claiming Kroger failed to fulfill promotional and financial commitments. As the litigation progressed, plaintiffs pushed for details on McMullen’s resignation, arguing it could illuminate Kroger’s corporate culture and ethical standards.

Court documents revealed that an earlier judicial order had required McMullen to provide a written explanation of his exit, described by some as potentially “embarrassing.” According to reporting from Business Insider, this stemmed from the judge’s view that the information was relevant to assessing the company’s oversight and decision-making processes.

Shifting Judicial Winds and Corporate Protections

However, the latest ruling reverses course, determining that further questioning of McMullen is unnecessary. The judge cited sufficient prior disclosures and the tangential nature of the resignation to the core festival dispute. This development, detailed in a recent article by Business Insider, highlights the challenges of balancing discovery rights with executive privacy in high-profile cases.

For Kroger, now navigating a proposed $25 billion merger with Albertsons Cos., the decision averts potential distractions. Industry insiders note that such probes can unearth sensitive details, affecting stock performance and regulatory scrutiny. McMullen’s resignation announcement vaguely referenced conduct inconsistent with company policy, fueling speculation but no public specifics.

Implications for Executive Accountability in Retail Giants

Legal experts suggest this case underscores broader tensions in corporate governance, where personal misconduct allegations often remain veiled under confidentiality agreements. As CNN Business reported, the lawsuit’s connection to Jewel added an unusual celebrity dimension, potentially amplifying public interest in what might otherwise be a routine contract spat.

The ruling also dismisses some of Jewel’s claims while allowing others to proceed to trial, keeping the spotlight on Kroger’s event sponsorship practices. For executives like McMullen, who transitioned to a non-executive chairman role before fully departing, it reinforces protections against invasive inquiries.

Broader Industry Ripples and Future Precedents

In the retail sector, where leaders face intense scrutiny amid economic pressures like inflation and supply-chain disruptions, this outcome may encourage companies to fortify internal investigations against external exposure. Sources from Fox News earlier highlighted the irony of a pop star’s lawsuit prying open corporate secrets, though the recent decision closes that door.

As Kroger presses forward with its merger ambitions, blocked in some jurisdictions over antitrust concerns, the McMullen saga serves as a reminder of how personal narratives can intersect with business strategy. While the full story of his resignation remains opaque, the judge’s protection ensures it won’t be dissected in this particular courtroom, leaving room for speculation but no definitive answers.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-7dff67bf-44e3-417e-a821-fca62fb5488e.jpeg,N,,2025-09-09 10:06:58.262821

Dozens of people from across the country, including one in our state, got sick from one of those meals linked to a salmonella outbreak.

As meal delivery grows in popularity, we’re looking into whether it’s a better option.

“I am very, very busy,” Genesis Robles, of Cromwell, said.

Time is money and for some, money is enough to get food quickly.

“I didn’t really want to think about the meals that I wanted to make and just something different,” Kassandra Ramirez, of Hartford, said.

That’s why these people signed up for meal delivery services.

“I just needed some extra help with getting some food on the table with my busy schedule and everything,” Robles said.

Local

Marketing research firm Statista shows Gen Z and Millennials are the majority of customers when it comes to meal delivery services. A big reason why is convenience.

They’re looking to eat healthier with easy meal planning – that they can just keep in the fridge.

“They deliver right to your front door, like it’s lovely,” Robles said.

But that convenience can come at a price at times. The CDC issued an alert that four different entrees from the company Metabolic Meals, caused a salmonella outbreak with 16 cases across 10 states including one case in Connecticut.

The affected entrees had a best buy date in beginning of the August. The CDC said the company is working with investigators and has reached out to customers who purchased these meals in question.

Most of them contained chicken, which registered dietitian Teresa Dotson said is susceptible to salmonella.

“You have to make sure that it's cooked and it's cooked to the proper temperature,” she said.

Dotson understands the appeal of meal delivery services, but said grocery shopping for the same ingredients is generally cheaper. She said it comes down to choosing between time or money.

“What is your time worth versus what is what is the cost of the meal?” she said.

Dotson said making healthy meals doesn’t have to be complicated or limited to just fresh fruits and vegetables.

“You can buy frozen fruits and vegetables that cut down on your prep time,” she said.

For some, the meal delivery services became too expensive, and they decided to go back to grocery shopping figuring it was now worth their time.

“It was awesome to get everything that you needed, but I think it was just too much,” Ramirez said.

The fintech powerhouse, valued at an impressive $75 billion, is ramping up activities in Paris where it is in pursuit of a French banking license. The company plans to hire up to 200 staff and allocate a substantial €1 billion investment to support its expansion efforts.

From Société Générale to Fintech Innovator

Oudéa, a seasoned leader who guided Société Générale through 15 transformative years post-global financial crisis, sees his new role as an exciting avenue to participate in a bold venture combining cutting-edge technology with robust financial backing. With ambitions to double its French customer base to 10 million by next year, Revolut is gearing up to launch mortgage and savings products tailored for the French market.

Globally, the neobank now caters to approximately 60 million customers, eclipsing traditional banking giants like HSBC. The company reported an impressive 72 percent revenue increase last year, which amounted to £3.1 billion. Its bid for a banking license in France adds to its existing EU authorization from Lithuania, though its UK banking license remains under regulatory scrutiny since 2024.

Swiss Operations Remain Unchanged—For Now

Despite Oudéa’s new moniker as Western Europe chairman, Revolut reassured that operations in Switzerland will remain unaffected in the immediate term. The company indicated in a communication “For our Swiss customers, nothing changes for now.” With whispers of a possible Swiss banking license in the air, the company is clearly not resting on its laurels.

Apple is frequently at the top of various surveys about the company and its products. However, while it is no stranger to the top of hardware and software lists, it does occasionally slip down the table.

This is precisely the case for the 2025 edition of ACSI's Household Appliance and Electronics Study, which studies how consumers value the various producers of electronics.

For the 2025 list, customer satisfaction for personal computers, which includes Mac and iPad users, has maintained its overall market-wide score of 81 from its 2024 result. When it comes to individual scores, there are quite a few changes that affect the standings.

While it occupied the top of the board in 2024 with its score of 85, Apple did see a 4% dip in its rating to 82. Unfortunately for Apple, this has let HP slip into first place.

In 2024, HP was at 84, which was enough for second place. While HP has also dropped for the 2025 chart, it only went down to 83 and for Apple to drop behind.

Apple is in joint second place on the chart, sharing the position with Dell which grew from 80 to 82. Samsung is in fourth after moving from a score of 82 to 81, while Lenovo's one-point slip lands it in fifth place.

They note that Boston Scientific and Elutia had a pre-existing partnership to distribute the bioenvelope products.
We believe the EluPro bioenvelope may offer clinical and handling advantages over TYRX and expect this to be a relatively low-effort product sale for BSX reps,” the analysts wrote.","Elutia (Nasdaq:ELUT) announced today that it agreed to sell its bioenvelope technologies to Boston Scientific for $88 million.

Gaithersburg, Maryland-based Elutia agreed to sell its EluPro and CanGaroo drug-eluting bioenvelopes in the cash deal. It designed these technologies to protect patients receiving implantable medical devices.

Elutia says the deal underscores the value of its proprietary drug-eluting biologic technology platform. It also allows the company to complete the development and commercialization of its near-term pipeline without the need for shareholder dilution.

The company designed EluPro to prevent post-operative complications in patients with implantable cardiac devices. Those include pacemakers and internal defibrillators. The system received FDA clearance in June 2024 and also has approval for use with additional devices. That extends to neuromodulators and neurostimulators for pain management, epilepsy, incontinence and sleep apnea.

CanGaroo is a porcine small intestine submucosa extracellular matrix that creates a healthy pocket for implanted devices. The bioenvelope stabilizes the implantable devices, such as pacemakers and defibrillators, as well.

Boston Scientific develops a number of implantable devices, including leading defibrillators and pacemakers.

“EluPro has clearly demonstrated that our proprietary drug-eluting biologics platform works at scale,” said Dr. Randy Mills, CEO of Elutia. “With the successful launch of EluPro, seven national group purchasing organization contracts secured and more than 160 value analysis committee approvals, we have shown that we can develop, manufacture and commercialize these highly regulated breakthrough products, and that they are valued by physicians.

The company now plans to move forward with its NXT-41x, a next-gen antibiotic biomatrix for breast reconstruction. It expects this deal to close in the fourth quarter of 2025.

The analysts’ take on the Elutia-Boston Scientific deal

BTIG analysts Marie Thibault, Sam Eiber and Alexandra Pang say the market opportunity for Elutia’s technology registers at around $600 million in the U.S.

They note that Boston Scientific and Elutia had a pre-existing partnership to distribute the bioenvelope products. Notably, they say it positions the company to compete against Medtronic in the cardiac rhythm management (CRM) space with its TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope.

“We see this as a strong fit for BSX, since the bioenvelope technology can be used for many of the implantable devices in its portfolio. Moreover, it gives the company the ability to offer a product that competes against long-standing incumbent Medtronic’s TYRX pouch. We believe the EluPro bioenvelope may offer clinical and handling advantages over TYRX and expect this to be a relatively low-effort product sale for BSX reps,” the analysts wrote. “While there could potentially be other interested acquirers (any ICD/pacemaker manufacturer), we do not expect additional bidders, since BSX and Elutia already have a close partnership. The transaction is expected to close in Q4. Our estimates remain unchanged.”",https://www.drugdeliverybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Elutia-EluPro-drug-eluting-bioenvelope-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 12:43:08.897034

The organization launched the First Penguin Net Generation Leadership program earlier this year to provide opportunities for young professionals in the frozen and refrigerators CPG and retail sectors. Program participants will be spotlighted at the 2025 NFRA Convention, slated for Oct. 18-21 in Orlando, Fla.

Progressive Grocer recently spoke with Kate Landis, senior director of marketing at NFRA, about the program that is poised to shape the next generation of leaders in this space.

Progressive Grocer: How has the Fresh Penguin grown and resonated in the industry, and how does that bode well for the future of leadership in this sector?

Kate Landis: NFRA’s First Penguin Next Generation Leadership Program has quickly become a beacon of what’s possible when we invest in the rising stars of frozen and refrigerated foods. Inspired by the idea of the “first penguin” — the one brave enough to jump first — the program has resonated deeply across our membership because it speaks to the courage, innovation, and collaboration this industry thrives on.

The inaugural class has already demonstrated that the program is more than leadership training and development; it’s a catalyst for industry progress. Through collaborative workshops, guided retail tours, monthly industry webinars, and year-long group case studies on critical challenges like supply chain resilience, category innovation, and marketing to Gen Z, our First Penguins are tackling the very issues shaping the future of our business. Their work proves that leadership development and industry problem-solving can and should go hand in hand.

The energy around the program bodes incredibly well for our future. It signals that the frozen and dairy sectors are not only cultivating talent but also preparing visionary leaders who are ready to take bold leaps forward.",https://progressivegrocer.com/images/v/16_x_9_480/files/2025-09/frozen_leaders_teaser_1744324727321_0.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 11:17:55.677337

Over eight in ten (83%) organizations identify the creation of a unified software platform as a key component of their software-driven mobility strategy.","Paris – The automotive industry is undergoing a transformation as software becomes increasingly central to its business strategy and operations. According to a new report from the Capgemini Research Institute, ‘The software-driven mobility era: Beyond vehicles’, nearly all automotive organizations (92%) now anticipate that every automotive company will transition to a software company to support Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs) and software-driven mobility (SDM) services. Over eight in ten believe that software-defined products and services, not just the physical vehicle, will become their core value proposition.

According to the report, while ambitions are strong, less than half of automotive organizations have scaled their SDM initiatives in 2025: 34% have partially scaled at least one SDM use case, and just 14% have achieved full-scale deployment.

While decoupling hardware and software has emerged as crucial to enable faster innovation, drive improved scalability, and unlock new revenue streams, the survey shows that only one in ten original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) has made progress in this journey, with just over a quarter actively piloting new approaches.

“For decades, automotive leadership was driven by hardware but today consumers demand connected, digitally enhanced experiences. This calls for adoption of a software first approach across the value chain to enable holistic mobility solutions,” said Laurence Noël, Global Head of Automotive at Capgemini. “Forward–looking automotive organizations are already treating software as their core product and leveraging key partnerships to expand their ecosystem. While the ambition is high, it requires a complete organizational overhaul. Those that align their talent, platforms, and partnerships, while fostering trust and delivering an elevated customer experience, will stay ahead of the curve.”

Strategic partnerships and ecosystem collaboration are accelerating the shift to SDM

According to the report, automotive organizations are increasingly recognizing the value of broader collaboration, with nearly two in five partnering with big tech and hyperscalers for critical software, cloud, and data capabilities. While only a few have established joint ventures so far, a third plan to do so within three years. Up to 84% are exploring new supplier markets to build resilience, and nearly 70% are doubling down on in-house development of key components to retain control over brand-defining technologies. Organizations are also restructuring their supply chains for geopolitical resilience, by exploring new sourcing markets including India, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe.

Software-defined products and mobility services are also expected to become significant revenue contributors for OEMs. According to the report, their share of OEMs’ total revenue is projected to double, contributing to over 50% by 2035.

AI is driving a new era of innovation in the auto industry

The report highlights that a vast majority (85%) agree that AI is increasingly becoming an integral part of automotive software, embedded directly into software features and functions, from improving in-vehicle experiences to powering advanced safety features and cybersecurity.

Over three-quarters (77%) see AI integration into software development, in-vehicle functions, and mobility services as a critical competitive advantage that will reshape the automotive value chain. By reducing costs, boosting productivity and efficiency, and enhancing product quality, AI is propelling the industry into a new era of innovation. Notably, most surveyed organizations view AI integration for ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) and autonomous driving capabilities as extremely significant in their organization’s software-driven strategy.

Software-driven mobility demands an organizational overhaul to reap its full potential

According to the survey, most organizations (86%) believe SDM strategy demands an overhaul of the organizational model, leading to significant changes in processes, and the need to build new skill sets. In addition to structural changes, organizations face a range of challenges in software engineering, compliance, safety, cybersecurity, leadership, and talent acquisition. Over eight in ten (83%) organizations identify the creation of a unified software platform as a key component of their software-driven mobility strategy.

Report Methodology

In June 2025, the Capgemini Research Institute conducted a survey of 600 executives from 200 long-established automotive organizations, with no more than four respondents from each organization. These executives represented organizations across four segments: OEMs, suppliers, mobility service providers, and digital natives from countries across North America, Europe, and APAC.

The report -- Cyber Claims Unveiled: A Focused Study on Trends, Threats, and Tailored Solutions -- provides an in-depth analysis of 300+ cyber claims, revealing trends in incident types, severity, causes of loss, triggered insurance agreements, industry-specific risks, and insights into risk management practices.

According to Fran Gari, Head of Pricing, Global Cyber and the lead author of the report, ""This report highlights a vital truth in the cyber risk landscape: a limited number of high-value claims account for the bulk of total losses, emphasizing the value for businesses in effective cybersecurity measures and proactive risk management strategies to provide effective protection and limit potential disruption in today's digital environment. Conducting a thorough examination of claims over an extended period is essential for uncovering evolving trends and patterns in cyber incidents.""

""Our claims analysis reveals some very promising trends,"" said Danielle Roth, Head of Cyber Claims for AXA XL in the Americas. ""Shorter shutdown durations, an increasing number of companies successfully detecting breaches independently, and in less time. All of these improvements show that organizations are becoming more resilient and proactive in their cybersecurity efforts.""

According to Andrew Farr, AXA XL's Global Chief Underwriting Officer for Financial Lines, ""The data tells us a story. By understanding the narratives of our most prominent cyber claims, AXA XL can leverage our own experiences to improve underwriting practices, develop new products, adjust risk pricing strategies, and enhance our risk management solutions, ultimately providing better protection against future cyber risks for our insured clients.""

Key findings from the analysis include:

Rising Severity of Claims: The analysis shows an increasing severity of large claims, particularly related to ransomware incidents.

Ransomware as a Dominant Threat: Since around 2018, ransomware has emerged as a leading cause of large claims, affecting 54.3% of claims in recent years. This trend emphasizes the need for tailored underwriting and proactive policy design.

Improvements in Detection: There is a notable shift where a growing proportion of data breach incidents are being identified by insureds themselves rather than external parties. Prior to 2019, only 35.7% of attacks were flagged internally, since then some 66% of incidents were detected by the insured themselves. This suggests that enhanced monitoring capabilities within organizations are having an impact.

Industry Specific Insights: The report highlights how claims experience and overall impact from cyber incidents varies across industry sectors. For instance, ransomware claims in certain industry sectors, such as manufacturing or retail, have a greater propensity to trigger business interruption compared to others. Larger organizations experience a higher frequency of large claims due to their extensive networks and greater exposure to risks, with both healthcare and financial services experiencing higher relative frequencies of large claims compared to other industries.

The French firm has been touted as a European AI champion as technological sovereignty concerns fester between the European Union and the United States under President Donald Trump.
Mistral chief executive Arthur Mensch said its AI could help ASML ""solve current and future engineering challenges"" in both hardware and software.
Mensch co-founded Mistral in 2023 after working for Google's DeepMind AI division, while fellow founders Guillaume Lample and Timothee Lacroix previously worked at Meta's AI lab.
As well as text, Mistral offers generative AI models capable of turning out images and computer code.","France's Mistral on Tuesday cemented its position as Europe's top AI hope against far larger US and Chinese competitors after a record fundraising round and a tie-up with chipmaking equipment heavweight ASML.

The 1.7 billion euro ($2 billion) cash infusion values Mistral at 11.7 billion euros, double its heft last year but a fraction of the $183 billion price tag placed on US firm Anthropic this month.

ASML, a key producer of the machines that churn out the chips powering artificial intelligence models, was the lead investor, stumping up 1.3 billion euros to give the Dutch company an 11 percent stake in Mistral.

The French firm has been touted as a European AI champion as technological sovereignty concerns fester between the European Union and the United States under President Donald Trump.

""By bringing together a world-class industrial firm and a leading French startup, Europe is demonstrating its ability to build strong digital sovereignty,"" Clara Chappaz, digital minister in the French government MPs voted out of office on Monday, told AFP.

The Dutch firm's boss Christophe Fouquet said he hoped for ""innovative products and solutions enabled by AI,"" from the deal.

Mistral chief executive Arthur Mensch said its AI could help ASML ""solve current and future engineering challenges"" in both hardware and software.

ASML said it would gain a seat on Mistral's strategic committee, giving the Dutch firm ""an advisory role in Mistral AI's future strategy and technology decisions"".

ASML's Chief Financial Officer Roger Dassen will assume this role.

- 'Real alternative' -

Mistral's fundraising comes after months of rumours that it could be the target of a takeover bid by Apple, which has lagged other tech giants in developing its own AI.

The latest funding round ""reaffirms the company's independence"", Mistral said in its statement.

The company said that the founders together retain majority control.

But tying Mistral more closely into the wider European high-tech sector through ASML was necessary to compete, the founder of AI and data firm Ekimetrics Jean-Baptiste Bouzige told AFP.

""There's no way to be in the fight in this sector while remaining strictly French,"" he said, adding that ""Europe is the appropriate scale"" for a company like Mistral.

""Mistral can set itself up as an indispensable European player,"" benefiting from ""ASML's industrial legitimacy that can increase its visibility in the ecosystem"" worldwide, EY partner Franck Sebag commented.

Other players in the latest investment round included chip giant Nvidia, venture capital funds Index Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz and French public investment bank Bpifrance.

Mensch co-founded Mistral in 2023 after working for Google's DeepMind AI division, while fellow founders Guillaume Lample and Timothee Lacroix previously worked at Meta's AI lab.

The company said Tuesday that it has so far amassed client contracts worth 350 million euros a year.

It has opened offices in Paris, London, Luxembourg, New York, California's Palo Alto tech hub and Singapore. It has expanded to over 350 staff.

- Bet on 'open source' -

Mistral's key products include Le Chat, a large language model (LLM) chatbot competing with the likes of ChatGPT from the sector's American heavyweight OpenAI.

But OpenAI, headed by Sam Altman, operates on a different scale: It is reportedly in talks to allow employees to sell shares at a $500 billion valuation.

As well as text, Mistral offers generative AI models capable of turning out images and computer code.

One factor setting it apart has been its practice from the beginning of releasing ""open source"" versions of its AI models, allowing other developers to run and modify them for their own purposes.

This year Mistral has announced a slew of partnerships, including with American chip giant Nvidia to create a cloud computing platform, or with Saudi investment fund MGX to build an AI campus outside Paris.

The company's 3 lines of business include retail and commercial banking, finance, investment, and market banking, and profit management, brokerage, and pension fund management. As of 2023, Wells Fargo managed $1.4 trillion in current deposits and $936.7 billion in current loans.

Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) presented at the Wells Fargo 20th Annual Healthcare Conference 2025, highlighting its strategic growth and challenges. The company reported robust top-line growth driven by the Pharma and CAM sectors, despite facing tariff-related margin pressures. Agilent remains optimistic about future growth through innovation and strategic investments.

Key Takeaways

Agilent reported a core revenue growth of 6%, with strong contributions from Pharma and CAM sectors. Tariffs impacted margins, but mitigation strategies are in place, with improvements expected by 2026. The company anticipates continued growth driven by downstream QA/QC in Pharma and reshoring activities in the U.S. Agilent’s service business satisfaction scores exceeded 90%, reflecting strong customer relationships. The company is strategically positioned in China, with local manufacturing and competitive pricing strategies.

Financial Results

Agilent showcased a solid financial performance in its third quarter: Core revenue growth was 6%, with double-digit growth in Pharma. CDMO saw a 20% increase, with bookings extending into 2026. Tariffs resulted in a 200 basis point decline in margins, but a 230 basis point increase is expected from Q3 to Q4. China contributed $300 million in revenue this quarter.

Operational Updates

Agilent highlighted significant operational progress: The Affinity III chromatography instrument experienced mid-teens growth, driven by productivity gains. The 8,850 GC instrument replacement cycle has begun, indicating potential for future growth. The NASD platform grew over 20% in Q3, with bookings secured into 2027. BioVectra has been booked well into 2026 and beyond.

Future Outlook

Agilent remains optimistic about its future prospects: Tariff impacts are expected to decrease through 2026, potentially becoming a tailwind. Long-term growth is anticipated from QA/QC in Pharma and U.S. reshoring efforts. The company expects steady improvement in China, with a strong win rate in the country’s stimulus programs.

In a press release, Walmart explained the state-of-the-art facility is designed to receive and process fresh produce, eggs, dairy, meat and frozen goods for delivery to 180 Walmart stores.

“The opening of our new high-tech perishable distribution center, marks a major step forward in how we get fresher products to customers faster — whether that’s in-store, delivered to their home, or even restocking their refrigerator,” said Rob Montgomery, executive vice president, Supply Chain, Walmart U.S.

The Lyman area facility is the third of five new high-tech PDCs Walmart is opening nationwide, marking a significant milestone in the company’s supply chain transformation, Walmart added. These facilities leverage advanced automation to process more than double the volume of a traditional distribution center. Prior to Wellsford, the retailer had opened automated PDCs in Shafter, California (2021) and Lancaster, Texas (2023), with two more planned: one in Belvidere, Illinois and another in Pilesgrove, New Jersey. These PDCs leverage technology from warehouse automation company Witron, as Walmart noted in this announcement about its high-tech PDC network plans.

“South Carolina continues to lead in innovation and logistics, and Walmart’s investment in Spartanburg County is driving that momentum forward,” said South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. “Through advanced supply chain technology and a strong commitment to local sourcing, we’re proud to partner with Walmart to deliver fresh, affordable food to communities across our state and the region.”

Walmart is reshaping associates’ work by integrating technology that removes some of their most physically demanding tasks, Walmart added. For example, robotics now handle the movement of cases on and off pallets, reducing the need for strenuous lifting.

Associates at the facility work alongside the high-tech systems that build store-specific pallets, ensuring fragile items like eggs and yogurt are placed toward the top, to minimize product damage. AI tracks every pallet to ensure accuracy and freshness. This technology also makes unloading at stores faster and easier, allowing store associates to spend more time helping customers.

The facility is home to more than 600 full-time Walmart associates with ongoing opportunities for career growth and development. Walmart is currently hiring a variety of roles, including automation equipment operators, the company pointed out.

“We are thrilled to welcome Walmart to the Lyman community. Walmart’s new high-tech facility is a powerful investment in our future – creating hundreds of quality jobs and bringing lasting career opportunities across the Upstate,” said Lyman Mayor Glenn Greer. “This milestone not only strengthens Lyman but also positions our region for continuing economic growth in the coming years.”

During the celebration, Walmart awarded $15,000 in grants to the following local non-profit organizations: local food pantry, Greer Relief; STEM-focused public school, Wellford Academy of Science and Technology; area soup kitchen, Breaking Bread for Jesus and foster care support provider, PS I Love You Ministries. In FYE 2024, Walmart stores, clubs and the Walmart Foundation donated $16.8 million in cash and in-kind donations to local organizations in South Carolina.

(Reuters) - Paris prosecutors opened a criminal probe into in June over its recall of sleep apnea devices, probing possible charges including aggravated fraud and failure to report safety incidents that could cause death, they said on Monday.

The 2021 recall affected about 15 million machines worldwide, including 350,000 in France, after concerns emerged that degrading polyurethane foam could cause health problems ranging from headaches and respiratory irritation to potential cancer risks.

The Paris Public Health division confirmed on Monday that it had received 104 individual complaints, prosecutors said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

The judicial investigation was formally opened on June 12 after a preliminary inquiry by the Central Office for the Fight against Environmental and Public Health Damage (OCLAESP).

In response, a Philips spokesperson said this is not a new investigation.

""Ongoing proceedings launched in 2023 cover the alleged activities of Philips in the lead up to and during 2021 recall. The proceeding does not make allegations about the quality and safety of products currently marketed in France by Philips.""

The company will continue to engage constructively in the required court processes, the spokesperson told Reuters.

The fraud charges in the Philips case carry severe criminal penalties under French law. For aggravated fraud involving endangering human health, individuals face up to seven years’ imprisonment and fines of 750,000 euros, while corporations can be fined up to 3.75 million euros, prosecutors said.

Last year, Philips agreed to pay $1.1 billion (937.5 million euros) to settle related litigation in the United States.

Renner, an about 60-year-old firm whose largest shareholder is BlackRock BLK, runs almost 700 stores in Brazil.

""The second half of the year will see lower growth,"" Chief Financial Officer Daniel Martins told Reuters in an interview on Friday, without providing specific details on the expected performance.

The executive said that the level of Brazil's benchmark interest rate, which is currently at a near 20-year high, has been affecting consumers, making them more selective.

For the third quarter, which ends this month, he said there would be an effect from a tougher comparison base year-on-year, as a warmer than usual autumn in Brazil last year postponed purchases to the third quarter.

However, Martins said he expected Renner's earnings to recover from then on, with a stronger fourth quarter and a more positive outlook for 2026.

He said eventual lower interest rates in Brazil next year could allow credit, through Renner's financial arm Realize, to have a greater contribution to the group's sales, although he noted this potential move would be made carefully.

Besides struggling with interest rate levels, Brazilian fashion retailers have been also seeing growing competition from foreign rivals, especially Asian firms such as Shein, which has said the country is one of its five main markets globally.

Kyle Watson, previously the company’s chief marketing officer, will be responsible for overseeing brand equity, marketing and deepening consumer loyalty across the portfolio. JoBeth Fink will oversee Celsius’ creative vision. Fink joined Celsius as part of its recent purchase of Alani Nu.

Celsius also named Rishi Daing as chief marketing officer. He has more than two decades of global marketing and commercial leadership experience, including senior roles at PepsiCo and Mark Anthony Brands.

Dive Insight:

Just a year ago, Celsius’ portfolio consisted predominantly of its namesake beverage, whichgenerated $1.36 billion in revenue, up sharply from $17 million in 2015. During the past eight months, the Florida-based company has purchased rival Alani Nu for $1.8 billion and recently added Rockstar to the mix as part of a deal announced last month with PepsiCo.

The transaction included PepsiCo upping its stake in Celsius to 11% while the beverage giant agreed to incorporate Alani Nu into its distribution system in the U.S. and Canada.

Celsius now possesses a portfolio that will require more attention to grow sales and recognition. The brands also appeal to different audiences, which will increase demand for marketing and brand expertise.

Levi Strauss has successfully increased prices on select products without seeing a decline in demand, indicating resilience among wealthier consumers.

Retailers are utilizing advanced consumer-tracking technology to implement targeted promotions, allowing them to maintain higher profit margins while testing consumer willingness to pay full prices.

A handful of apparel retailers including Levi Strauss are teasing more full-priced products, testing how much wealthier shoppers are willing to pay despite the sobering effect of tariffs.

They have not been disappointed so far.

Levi's raised prices on some products in July but saw no slowdown in demand, the denim maker's chief financial officer, Harmit Singh, said at the Goldman Sachs Global Retailing Conference in New York on Wednesday.

""We are making a full-court press in selling higher full-price sales than we have done in the past,"" he said. ""The Levi's consumer largely earns $100,000 and over. And that consumer we are seeing is generally resilient."" Ralph Lauren RL.N, Under Armour UAA.N and Abercrombie & Fitch ANF.N are also leaning into a more full-price strategy, they said, in recent earnings disclosures. While lower-income households are hunting for bargains as U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war has forced companies to raise prices, wealthier consumers are buying steadily, largely unaffected by the cooling labor market. Stock market gains and low credit card debt have bolstered the finances of the affluent. According to Moody's Analytics, the richest 10% of Americans - those earning at least $250,000 a year - now account for half of all consumer spending.

""We've been shifting our business towards a more elevated full-price consumer base, and this has served us well as our core consumer around the world remains resilient,"" Ralph Lauren CEO Patrice Louvet said in early August. Under Armour's CEO Kevin Plank said in August the company was considering bumping up prices for the ""embedded consumer who we do have pricing power with,"" referring to loyal customers. ""We're seeing success testing new key items at full price, including our $45 Self-form hat and our heat gear collection are both strong examples.""

And if that strategy doesn't work, better consumer-tracking technology now allows retailers to pivot quickly and offer targeted promotions, helping them generate higher profit margins, said Kate McShane, managing director at Goldman Sachs.

At the forefront of this transformation is Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), which is redefining the boundaries of satellite-based infrastructure. By leveraging its expertise in 5G Direct-to-Device (D2D) technology, laser communications (SOLiS), and flexible geostationary satellites (Space Inspire), the company is not merely adapting to market needs but actively shaping the next generation of global connectivity. For investors, this strategic positioning offers compelling insights into the firm’s potential to capture emerging demand in a sector poised for exponential growth.

5G D2D: Bridging Terrestrial and Satellite Networks

The convergence of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks is a critical milestone in achieving seamless global 5G coverage. Thales Alenia Space has taken a leading role in this domain through its U DESERVE 5G project, a government-backed initiative under France’s 2030 industrial strategy. This project, involving partners such as Capgemini, Orange,

, , and Loft Orbital, aims to demonstrate direct communication between satellites and mobile devices or fixed terminals. A demonstrator satellite in low-Earth orbit will test interoperability between terrestrial and satellite 5G networks, addressing a key challenge: ensuring smooth handovers between the two systems. According to a report by Thales Alenia Space, this initiative will evaluate how devices can transition between satellite and terrestrial coverage, a capability essential for applications ranging from IoT to emergency response [1].

The company’s collaboration with

and Qualcomm since 2022 has further advanced this vision. In early 2025, the trio achieved a breakthrough by demonstrating an end-to-end 5G Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) call using a simulated LEO satellite channel in a French laboratory. This milestone proved that 5G-capable devices can maintain uninterrupted connectivity in remote areas—such as oceans or dense forests—without requiring additional satellite equipment [3]. By tackling technical hurdles like latency management and Doppler effects, Thales Alenia Space is accelerating the commercialization of NTN, a market projected to grow rapidly as demand for ""connectivity anywhere"" intensifies.

SOLiS: Revolutionizing Laser Communications

While 5G D2D addresses the ""last mile"" of connectivity, Thales Alenia Space is simultaneously pushing the frontiers of data transmission through its SOLiS (Service Optique de Liaisons Spatiales Sécurisées) project. Funded under the France 2030 program and led by CNES, SOLiS aims to demonstrate the viability of optical communications via geostationary satellites. This technology promises to deliver ultra-secure, high-speed data transfer—up to one terabit per second—while mitigating the vulnerabilities of traditional radio-frequency systems [1].

The project builds on prior innovations, such as the CO-OP and VERTIGO initiatives, and involves a consortium of industry leaders and startups. The optical payload will be deployed on the Hellas Sat 5 geostationary satellite, with pilot ground stations in Cyprus and Côte d’Azur. By leveraging free-space optics (FSO), SOLiS could enable multi-orbit connectivity, addressing the growing need for resilient, high-capacity networks in sectors like defense, finance, and critical infrastructure. As stated by Thales Alenia Space, this initiative underscores the company’s commitment to developing technologies that not only meet current demands but also anticipate future challenges in data security and transmission efficiency [1].

Space Inspire: Flexible Geostationary Satellites for Dynamic Markets

While LEO and MEO satellites dominate discussions on 5G and IoT, geostationary (GEO) satellites remain indispensable for high-capacity, wide-area coverage. Thales Alenia Space’s Space Inspire platform is redefining the role of GEO satellites through its all-digital, reconfigurable-in-orbit design. This innovation allows operators to dynamically adjust satellite capacity in response to market fluctuations, a critical advantage in an era of rapidly evolving demand.

In 2022, the company secured six of the ten contracts for GEO telecom satellites in the global open market, a testament to the platform’s appeal. Notable projects include the Intelsat 41 (IS-41), Intelsat 44 (IS-44), and Eutelsat Flexsat satellites, which leverage Space Inspire’s flexibility to deliver tailored services. More recently, the firm secured an order for the JSAT-31 satellite, which will provide broadband services across Asia and the Pacific [2]. By combining high throughput with adaptability, Space Inspire positions Thales Alenia Space to dominate a market segment that remains vital for global connectivity, even as LEO constellations expand.

Strategic Implications for Investors

Thales Alenia Space’s tripartite strategy—advancing 5G D2D, laser communications, and flexible GEO satellites—positions it as a linchpin in the next-gen telecom infrastructure. The company’s ability to integrate terrestrial and satellite systems, pioneer secure data transmission, and offer adaptable satellite solutions aligns with three key trends: the global push for universal connectivity, the rise of data-intensive applications, and the need for resilient infrastructure in the face of geopolitical and environmental risks.

For investors, the implications are clear. The satellite telecom market, valued at over $250 billion in 2023, is expected to grow at a compound annual rate exceeding 10% through 2030, driven by 5G expansion, IoT proliferation, and the digitization of critical sectors. Thales Alenia Space’s leadership in these areas, supported by government partnerships and commercial contracts, suggests a strong capacity to capture market share. Moreover, its focus on interoperability and reconfigurability ensures that its solutions remain relevant across diverse use cases, from consumer broadband to industrial IoT and defense communications.

Conclusion

Thales Alenia Space is not merely a participant in the satellite telecom revolution—it is a catalyst. By pioneering technologies that bridge the gap between terrestrial and space-based networks, the company is addressing the most pressing challenges in global connectivity. For investors, the firm’s strategic alignment with emerging demand, coupled with its track record of innovation and commercial success, presents a compelling case for long-term growth.

The South African government is being urged to renationalize ArcelorMittal South Africa (AMSA) to prevent widespread job losses and revive the nation's industrial sector, according to a report. Zwelinzima Vavi, general secretary of the South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU), stated that the company has started closing its long-rolling mill assets, threatening approximately 3,500 direct jobs and up to 100,000 indirect positions.

Data from the IndexBox platform indicates that South Africa's steel production has faced significant headwinds, contributing to the sector's instability. Nearly two years of negotiations between the company and the government have failed to address core issues, including high raw material costs and intense competition from cheap imports.

Vavi warned that job losses are accelerating at an alarming rate, a situation compounded by the 30% tariffs imposed on South Africa by the United States, which he said threaten an additional 100,000 jobs. Negotiations for the state-owned Industrial Development Corp (IDC) to acquire ArcelorMittal's local division are reportedly at an impasse due to differences over valuation, with offers of up to 7 billion rand ($398.6 million) being discussed.

According to a statement, AMSA is exploring various strategic options while the IDC conducts a comprehensive review. Recent reports from the Solidarity trade union suggest the company plans to lay off nearly half of its workforce, or about 4,000 employees, with cuts potentially extending to its flagship flat steel production facility in Vanderbijlpark.

About the ACSI The American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI®) has been a national economic indicator for over 25 years.","ANN ARBOR, Mich., September 09, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Consumers are raising the bar for what they expect from their home electronics and appliances, and shiny new features will only impress them so much.

According to the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI®) Household Appliance and Electronics Study 2025, satisfaction remains steady across televisions and personal computers (PCs) — 82 and 81 (on a scale of 0 to 100), respectively — and up just 1% to 81 for household appliances. The vacuum cleaner industry debuts with an ACSI score of 79.

Yet, as brands race to introduce new technologies and smarter devices, the real battleground is shifting from product innovation to the overall customer experience.

""Manufacturers are discovering that the true test isn’t just in delivering the latest tech, but in providing reliable, high-quality service that meets rising consumer expectations,"" said Forrest Morgeson, Associate Professor of Marketing at Michigan State University and Director of Research Emeritus at the ACSI. ""In this competitive market, value and support matter as much, if not more, than innovation. The brands that can deliver on both fronts while listening, adapting, and evolving alongside their customers will set the pace for what comes next.""

Samsung maintains grip on television industry

Televisions remain one of the most competitive industries measured by the ACSI — just 3 points separating the highest- and lowest-scoring companies — as all companies achieve scores in the 80s.

Despite slipping 1%, Samsung still leads the way with an ACSI score of 83. The industry leader continues to be a pioneer in introducing cutting-edge technology and sets the standard in the premium higher-price categories.

Hisense and Vizio, each up 1% to 82, tie for second place. The brands are making strong plays in the U.S. market, leveraging quality retail relationships and a high value proposition. LG (down 1%) and TCL (up 3%) are next at 81 apiece — the latter making the biggest strides in the industry — while Sony brings up the rear after sliding 1% to an ACSI score of 80.

At an industrywide level, ratings of the individual customer experience benchmarks are largely consistent year over year. The highest marks go to fundamental product attributes like image quality, durability, ease of set up, and ease of using the remote. The lower marks are with the outcome of service repairs, courtesy and helpfulness of technicians, repair timeliness, and call center satisfaction.

Apple’s fall gives HP its opening in the PC industry

While overall industry satisfaction is unmoved, individual personal computer brands experience notable changes.

Apple (82) cedes the top spot to HP (down 1% to 83) after tumbling 4% year over year. The latter combines high-quality products with a strong value proposition to lead all competitors in overall satisfaction.

Dell, which is leaning into AI PCs, stands out in 2025 as the only measured brand to see customer satisfaction improvement, gaining 3% to move into a second-place tie with Apple. Samsung and Lenovo remain middle of the pack after modest 1% declines to 81 and 79, respectively. Amazon (78) and Asus (76) both suffer 3% drops, while Microsoft (76) and last-place Acer (75) decline 4% each.

The effort to harness new technology, cater to growing customer demands, and compete with other global leaders has led to high ratings across nearly all the individual characteristics measured in the survey. Computer design leads the way, followed closely behind by the availability of software or applications and graphics/sound quality. Meanwhile, call center satisfaction is the lowest-rated aspect of the PC user experience.

As for device types, 7 points separate the overall rating for desktop satisfaction (84) and tablet satisfaction (77). While laptop satisfaction is unchanged at 81, desktop user satisfaction increases 2% and tablet satisfaction falls 5%.

Samsung joins Whirlpool atop household appliances

Only 2 points separate the highest and lowest brands in the household appliance industry, which includes major kitchen and laundry appliances.

Samsung (up 1%) now shares the lead with Whirlpool (down 1%) with ACSI scores of 82. LG (down 1%) sits a point off the leaders at 81, followed by Bosch, Electrolux (up 1%), and Haier (up 1%) — which also includes the GE and Hotpoint brands — at 80 apiece. After experiencing strong U.S. sales growth in 2024, Bosch sees the largest gain in the industry, climbing 3% year over year.

In terms of appliance types, Whirlpool leads the over-the-range microwave (85) and refrigerator (84) segments outright and ties Samsung for highest dryer satisfaction (82). LG claims the top spot in washers (84) and ties Bosch atop dishwashers (82). Haier takes first in the combined range/cooktop/oven segment with a score of 83.

The reliability of mobile apps used in relation to household appliances jumps 4% to lead all other benchmarks. A series of product-based attributes follows, with high marks for capacity, durability, and design. Overall, the outcome of service repairs improves, up 4%. Similarly, the service repair timeliness (up 3%) is better. However, the lower scores for service shine a light on the opportunity companies have to distinguish themselves, whether that’s choosing the right appliance, day-to-day usage, or service and customer interactions.

Samsung sweeps away the competition among vacuum cleaners

Samsung takes the top spot in the inaugural vacuum cleaner measurement with an ACSI score of 82. Shark (81), Bissell (80), and Dyson (80) are all close behind.

iRobot’s Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner scores 78, just ahead of Dirt Devil and Eureka at 77 apiece. Electrolux and Hoover finish in last place with ACSI scores of 76.

Industrywide, ease of operation tops the list of benchmarks. The ease of emptying the canister or dust collector is also rated high, with some models now including self-cleaning features as manufacturers look for innovative ways to reduce user burden.

In general, vacuum owners have great success with the outcome of their service repair and the ease of arranging service. The timeliness of the repair is rated slightly lower, while the lowest service-based score is given to the courtesy and helpfulness of the technician.

“The opening of our new high-tech perishable distribution center marks a major step forward in how we get fresher products to customers faster — whether that’s in-store, delivered to their home, or even restocking their refrigerator,” Rob Montgomery, Walmart U.S. executive vice president for supply chain, said in a news release.

The Lyman-area facility is the third of five new high-tech perishable distribution centers Walmart is opening nationwide, marking what the company calls a significant milestone in its supply chain transformation. These facilities leverage advanced automation to process more than double the volume of a traditional distribution center, according to the release.

“South Carolina continues to lead in innovation and logistics, and Walmart’s investment in Spartanburg County is driving that momentum forward,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in the release. “Through advanced supply chain technology and a strong commitment to local sourcing, we’re proud to partner with Walmart to deliver fresh, affordable food to communities across our state and the region.”

Walmart says the company is reshaping work for employees by integrating technology that removes some of their most physically demanding tasks. For example, robotics now handle the movement of cases on and off pallets, reducing the need for strenuous lifting.

Associates at the facility work alongside the high-tech systems that build store-specific pallets, ensuring fragile items like eggs and yogurt are placed toward the top to minimize product damage, the release stated. AI tracks every pallet to ensure accuracy and freshness. This technology also makes unloading at stores faster and easier.

The facility is home to more than 600 full-time Walmart associates with ongoing opportunities for career growth and development, the release said. Walmart is currently hiring a variety of roles, including automation equipment operators. Full-time positions qualify for Walmart’s total rewards and benefits plans, including medical, vision and dental insurance, 401(k) matching, paid time off, stock purchase plan and access to a tuition-paid college degree through Walmart’s Live Better U.

“We are thrilled to welcome Walmart to the Lyman community. Walmart’s new high-tech facility is a powerful investment in our future — creating hundreds of quality jobs and bringing lasting career opportunities across the Upstate,” Lyman Mayor Glenn Greer said in the release. “This milestone not only strengthens Lyman but also positions our region for continuing economic growth in the coming years.”

During the celebration, Walmart awarded $15,000 in grants to the following local nonprofit organizations: local food pantry, Greer Relief; STEM-focused public school, Wellford Academy of Science and Technology; area soup kitchen, Breaking Bread for Jesus; and foster care support provider, PS I Love You Ministries.

Speaking with ANI, on the side lines of ISA Steel conclave in New Delhi, Kazuo Mike Fujisawa, Representative, Japan Iron & Steel Federation told ANI, that many Japanese steel companies are showing interest in India.

""India has high steel production growth and its population is growing so it has high steel consumption per capita,"" he said.

JFE-JSW electrical steel JV progressing in Karnataka

India and Japan are old trade partners when it comes to the steel industry.""We have couple of joint ventures. JFE has major stake holding in JSW Steel...The latest joint venture between JEF and JSW was established over a year ago and expanding now. May be new ventures in near future cannot be ruled out,"" he added.

Japan's JFE Steel Corporation (JFE Steel) and JSW Steel Limited (JSW Steel) had established JSW JFE Electrical Steel Private Limited (subject to statutory approvals), a joint venture company for grain-oriented electrical steel in India and held a groundbreaking ceremony on February 12, 2024 at Bellary in Karnataka, India, where the new facility is proposed to be developed.

The joint venture was aimed to start full production in fiscal 2027, and to expand production in line with the growing market for grain-oriented electrical steel in India.

Nippon Steel-ArcelorMittal JV also expanding capacity

Similarly, Japan's Nippon Steel and India's Arcelor Mittal had a joint venture, they have plans to expand their capacity, Fujisawa said.

The ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel joint venture, known as AM/NS India, was formed in December 2019 following the acquisition of insolvent Essar Steel by the two major steel companies. It is an integrated flat steel manufacturer in India, offering a wide range of steel products for industries like automotive and infrastructure. The JV operates a large integrated steel plant in Hazira, Gujarat, and other facilities across India

However, he added, ""Doing business in India is not easy we need well established domestic players to do business here in India.

US slashes tariffs on Japanese cars to 15%

""On US tariff, Fujisawa said, Japan government has recently signed a document with US to reduce the tariff on the East Asian country. On Friday, US inked an executive order slashing import tariffs on Japanese cars from 27.5 per cent to 15 per cent.

It was a major thrust to the Japanese industry where earlier threat of 27.5 per cent tariff was lurking.

""Auto industry is big industry in Japan not for exports but also local supply chain as well,"" he said, adding that Japan exports around 1.3 million units of cars to US in a year.

The number of automobiles being shipped out from Japan to US are quite enormous.

""Japan is working hard to find middle ground. Tariff is really affecting us,"" Fujisawa said.

The current15 per cent tariff may still impact the industry to certain extent.

Major car producing companies in Japan are Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Suzuki.

For motor finance providers, the tariff rollback reduces uncertainty around vehicle pricing, residual value forecasting, and leasing volumes.

With this new investment, Anheuser-Busch aims to meet rising demand for Michelob ULTRA, which has become the top-selling beer in the Southeast and continues to gain market share nationwide.

Anheuser-Busch’s latest investment reflects both increased consumer demand for low-calorie beers like Michelob ULTRA and the company’s strategy to maintain its leadership in the American brewing industry.","Anheuser-Busch has announced a $9.2 million investment in its Cartersville, Georgia brewery to expand production capacity for Michelob ULTRA, the fastest-growing beer brand in the United States. The company made the announcement on Monday, stating that the funds will be used to upgrade brewing equipment at the facility, which has been operating since 1993.

The Cartersville brewery currently produces 48 different products that are distributed to 32 states across the country. With this new investment, Anheuser-Busch aims to meet rising demand for Michelob ULTRA, which has become the top-selling beer in the Southeast and continues to gain market share nationwide. The company cited data from Circana showing Michelob ULTRA’s leading position in sales growth as of mid-August.

This move is part of Anheuser-Busch’s broader Brewing Futures initiative, a commitment to invest more than $300 million in U.S. facilities to support manufacturing jobs and local economies. Since 2020, the company has invested over $230 million in the Cartersville brewery alone and nearly $2 billion across its 100 U.S. facilities over the past five years.

Brendan Whitworth, CEO of Anheuser-Busch, said that ongoing investments in people, breweries, and communities are essential for driving local economic growth and providing more American-made products to consumers. He emphasized that expanding production at Cartersville will help meet consumer demand while supporting jobs in Georgia.

Georgia State Representative Matthew Gambill of Cartersville welcomed the announcement, highlighting Anheuser-Busch’s role in boosting economic vitality and job creation in the region. He noted that continued investment ensures Cartersville remains a leader in industry innovation and growth.

The Cartersville brewery’s expansion comes as Michelob ULTRA strengthens its presence as a lifestyle brand associated with sports and wellness. The beer is an official sponsor of Major League Soccer, the PGA Tour, and several upcoming global sporting events including the 2026 FIFA World Cup and Olympic Games in Milan and Los Angeles.

Anheuser-Busch’s latest investment reflects both increased consumer demand for low-calorie beers like Michelob ULTRA and the company’s strategy to maintain its leadership in the American brewing industry. The upgrades at Cartersville are expected to enhance production efficiency and support continued growth for one of the country’s most popular beer brands.",https://www.vinetur.com/imagenes/iconos/favicon-192x192.png,N,,2025-09-09 17:20:50.648645

Automotive supply chains could shed 13,000 jobs.
Redirecting ZAR 248 billion ($14.2 billion) in Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) funds to protect industrial jobs.","The South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) has condemned ArcelorMittal South Africa (AMSA) for shutting down its long steel operations in Newcastle and Vereeniging, while also putting the future of Vanderbijlpark at risk. The union warned that the closures will devastate workers and communities, accelerating the collapse of South Africa’s steel and manufacturing base.

Vanderbijlpark alone has lost 10,000 jobs since 1990. The latest closures will directly eliminate 4,000 jobs, with tens of thousands more threatened in downstream industries such as automotive and construction.

Subsidies failed to prevent shutdowns

Despite receiving ZAR 3.4 billion ($194.6 million) in public funds over the past 18 months, including Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) loans, wage support and special electricity tariffs, AMSA is closing plants.

IDC support: ZAR 1 billion in June 2024, ZAR 380 million ($21.74 million) in early 2025, and ZAR 1.68 billion ($96.16 million) in March 2025

Unemployment Insurance Fund/Temporary Employee Relief Scheme wage support: ZAR 417 million ($23.88 million)

Discounted tariff granted by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) despite domestic electric company Eskom’s rejection

SAFTU accused AMSA of “corporate plunder”, arguing that subsidies benefited executives and foreign shareholders instead of saving jobs. AMSA CEO Kobus Verster, reportedly earning over ZAR 20 million ($1.14 million) annually, was criticized for prioritizing profits.

National and industrial consequences

The closures threaten to erase South Africa’s last integrated carbon steel capacity, leaving the country dependent on imports and vulnerable to global market manipulation.

The Newcastle closure could put 60,000-80,000 downstream jobs at risk.

Automotive supply chains could shed 13,000 jobs.

Manufacturing’s share of gross domestic product (GDP) has already dropped from 20 percent in 1994 to 11-13 percent today, with 430,000 factory jobs lost since 2008.

Global trade pressures

South Africa also faces global steel overcapacity, dumping from China, and Trump’s 50 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum that redirected supply into weaker markets. SAFTU criticized the Ramaphosa government for failing to build a BRICS-wide defense strategy.

SAFTU’s demands

The federation has declared the closures a national emergency and demands:

Renationalization of AMSA under worker-state co-ownership.

Export taxes and beneficiation mandates on chrome, iron ore, and other minerals.

Strict antidumping tariffs.

A public investment-led national reindustrialization plan for steel, rail, ports, and energy.

A jobs rescue package for Newcastle, Vereeniging, and Vanderbijlpark.

Dabur, India’s third-largest oral care player, has launched a campaign positioning its toothpaste as the national alternative to Colgate-Palmolive, intensifying calls to support local goods amid worsening trade relations between the United States and India.

THE DETAILS The US$11 billion Indian consumer goods company ran a front-page advertisement in the Times of India, using unbranded packaging resembling Colgate’s to highlight that India’s best-selling toothpaste is American-owned. The copy, styled in red, white, and blue font, declared “Born there, not here” and urged consumers to choose “Swadeshi” — or made-in-India — products. Colgate currently controls 43% of India’s toothpaste market, ahead of Unilever’s Pepsodent at 23%, with Dabur holding 17%, according to Euromonitor. The campaign coincides with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s renewed calls for citizens to favour local goods after the U.S. imposed tariffs of up to 50% on Indian imports. Dabur’s ad included a QR code directing shoppers to Amazon India, while other domestic companies — including dairy brand Amul and email provider Rediff — have also leaned into nationalist messaging in their promotions.

THE WHY? Advertising around consumer goods has become entangled with geopolitics, as Indian companies seek to capitalise on heightened nationalist sentiment amid trade frictions with the United States.

Last year, Western Digital touted its partnership with Chinese surveillance company Uniview at a policing trade expo, months before Uniview was sanctioned over complicity in rights abuses.","BEIJING (AP) — American tech companies to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, playing a far greater role in enabling human rights abuses than previously known, an Associated Press investigation found. They sold billions of dollars of technology to the Chinese police, government and surveillance companies, despite repeated warningsfrom the U.S. Congress and in the media that such tools were being used to quash dissent, persecute religious sects and target minorities.

The AP investigation was based on tens of thousands of leaked emails and databases from a Chinese surveillance company; thousands of pages of confidential corporate and government documents; public Chinese language marketing material; and thousands of procurements, many provided by ChinaFile, a digital magazine published by the non-profit Asia Society. The AP also drew from dozens of open record requests and interviews with more than 100 current and former Chinese and American engineers, executives, experts, officials, administrators, and police officers.

American tech firms were by far the biggest suppliers, but German, Japanese, and Korean firms also had a role. Here are some examples:

MILITARY ACCESS: A Chinese military contractor worked with Armonk, New York-based IBM in 2009 to design national intelligence systems, including a counterterrorism system, according to classified Chinese government documents. These systems were used by China’s secret police, the Ministry of State Security, and the Chinese military. IBM referred to any such deals as “old, stale interactions”: “ ... If older systems are being abused today — and IBM has no knowledge that they are — the misuse is entirely outside of IBM’s control, was not contemplated by IBM decades ago, and in no way reflects on IBM today.”

ANTI-TERROR ANALYSIS: IBM agents in China sold IBM’s i2 policing analysis software to the Xinjiang police, China’s Ministry of State Security, and other Chinese police units throughout the 2010s, leaked emails show. i2 software was subsequently copied and deployed by one former IBM agent, Landasoft, as the basis for a predictive policing platform that tagged hundreds of thousands of people as potential terrorists during a brutal crackdown in China’s far west Xinjiang region. IBM says it ceased relations with Landasoft in 2014, prohibited sales to police in Xinjiang and Tibet since 2015, and has no record of any sales of i2 software to the Public Security Bureau in Xinjiang.

ETHNIC REPRESSION: Dell and then-subsidiary VMWare sold cloud software and storage devices to police and entities providing data to police in Tibet and Xinjiang, even as late as 2022 after ethnic repression there was widely known. Dell addressed race in its marketing: In 2019, Dell said on WeChat it had teamed up with surveillance firm Yitu to sell a “military-grade” AI-powered laptop for Chinese police with “all-race recognition.” Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, told AP it conducts “rigorous due diligence” to ensure compliance with U.S. export controls. Chinese policing systems, including in Xinjiang, also used software from Oracle, based in Austin, Texas, and from Microsoft, based in Seattle, according to procurements and a leaked database obtained by AP.

FINGERPRINT RECOGNITION: Chinese defense contractor Huadi worked with IBM to construct China’s national fingerprint database; IBM said it never sold “fingerprinting-specific” products to the Chinese government and that any possible misuse “for fingerprinting purposes” was done without its knowledge or assistance. HP and VMWare sold technology used for fingerprint comparison by Chinese police. Intel said in 2019 marketing material that it partnered with Hisign, a Chinese fingerprinting company that sold to Xinjiang police, to make their fingerprint readers more effective, and that the new reader was “fully tested in an actual application scenario” with a municipal police bureau. Hisign was still an Intel partner as of last year, according to Chinese media reports. California-based Intel said it has not had any technical engagement with Hisign since 2024, and told AP it would “act swiftly” if it became aware of any “credible misuse.”

AI CAMERAS: IBM, Dell, Tokyo-based Hitachi, and VMWare promoted facial recognition for use by Chinese police. Japanese electronics giant Sony said on its official WeChat account that it wired a Chinese prison with “intelligent” cameras, saying it was widely trusted for “surveillance projects.” California chip giant NVIDIA and Intel partnered with China’s three biggest surveillance companies to add AI capabilities to camera systems used for video surveillance across China, including in Xinjiang and Tibet, until sanctions were imposed. Relations with other Chinese surveillance companies continued more recently: NVIDIA posted on its WeChat social media account in 2022 that Chinese surveillance firms Watrix and GEOAI used its chips to train AI patrol drones and systems to identify people by their walk. NVIDIA told AP those relationships no longer continue.

SURVEILLANCE RESEARCH: NVIDIA, IBM, and Hitachi staff collaborated with Chinese police researchers and companies on surveillance technology. NVIDIA said in a post dating to 2013 or later that a Chinese police institute used its chips for surveillance technology research. NVIDIA said it doesn’t currently work with Chinese police but did not address the past. And in 2021, an IBM and a U.S. Army researcher coauthored an AI video study with a Chinese police researcher working at a sanctioned company, according to a paper unearthed by IPVM, a surveillance research publication. The U.S. Army told AP the Chinese police researcher only worked on the paper after the Army researcher’s work had concluded.

DNA: Chinese police DNA labs bought Dell and Microsoft software and equipment to save genetic data on police databases. In 2021, Hitachi advertised DNA sequencers to Chinese police, and police labs bought pipettes from German biotech firm Eppendorf last year. And until contacted by AP in August, Massachusetts-based biotech firm Thermo Fisher Scientific‘s website stated that its kits are made for China’s national DNA database and “designed” for the Chinese population, including “ethnic minorities like Uyghurs and Tibetans,” and featured the work of a Chinese police researcher who discussed using Thermo Fisher kits to identify ethnic Uyghur and Manchu populations at a 2016 conference. Thermo Fisher stopped sales in Xinjiang in 2021 and in Tibet in 2024, but still promotes kits to police elsewhere in China, including at a police trade show earlier this year. In a statement to AP, Thermo Fisher said its kits “are designed to be effective across diverse global populations” but “do not have the capability to distinguish among specific ethnic groups.”

INTERNET POLICE: In 2014, VMWare said internet police in cities across China used its software, and in 2016, Dell said on its WeChat account that its services assisted the Chinese internet police in “cracking down on rumormongers” — essentially promoting censorship. An undated IBM marketing presentation said that internet police in Shanghai and Guangzhou used its i2 software, with metadata suggesting it was from 2018. IBM held a conference in Beijing promoting i2 in 2018, according to its official WeChat account.

ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGY: Leaked government blueprints show Illinois-based Motorola provided encrypted radio communications technology to the Chinese police for handling “sudden and mass events in Beijing.” Motorola did not respond to requests for comment.

AI DRIVES: Californian hard disk giants Seagate and Western Digital and Tokyo-based Toshiba sell hard drives specialized for AI video systems for use by Chinese police. In 2022, Toshiba wrote about how its surveillance hard drives can help police monitor communities to “identify and control suspicious” or “blacklisted” individuals. “They’re optimized and adapted for security systems,” Toshiba sales director Feng Hao told AP. Last year, Western Digital touted its partnership with Chinese surveillance company Uniview at a policing trade expo, months before Uniview was sanctioned over complicity in rights abuses. And Seagate said on WeChat in 2022 that it sells hard drives “tailor made” for AI video systems in China for use by police to help them ”control key persons,” and promoted their drives to police at a security trade association in China this year.

MAPPING SOFTWARE: Blueprints show that in 2009, IBM, Oracle, and Esri, the creator of ArcGIS based in California, sold hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of software to build China’s Police Geographic Information System, and in 2013, HP said it sold “digital fencing” solutions to Chinese police. Such systems alert Chinese police even today when Uyghurs, Tibetans or dissidents stray out of provinces, counties or even villages. The U.S. curbed exports of such mapping software to China in 2020. But the restrictions are narrow in scope, and Esri maintains a research center in Beijing that marketed to police and other Chinese clients. Esri denied involvement.

POLICE GEAR: Chinese police patrol the streets equipped with foreign technology. Officers stroll the streets of Beijing with Motorola walkie-talkies, for example, while Korean electronics giant Samsung sells microSD cards for police body cameras, advertising them at Chinese police trade shows in 2023 and 2024. And in WeChat posts, Chinese state-owned company Jinghua said it cooperated with German electronics giant Philips on China’s first ”AI-powered 5G” police body camera and advertised Philips-branded recorders and cameras to Chinese police. In a statement, Philips said it had no partnership with Jinghua, did not authorize sales of Philips-branded body cameras in China, and would be contacting Jinghua over the posts.

IBM, Dell, California network seller Cisco, Seattle-based Amazon Web Services, Seagate, Intel, Thermo Fisher and Western Digital all said they adhere to relevant export controls, laws and regulations where they operate. Eppendorf, Sony, and Hitachi declined to describe their business relationships in China but said they respected human rights.

Oracle, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and California tech conglomerate Broadcom, which acquired VMWare in 2023, did not comment on the record. HP, Motorola, Samsung, Toshiba, Huadi, and Landasoft did not respond. Microsoft said it did not knowingly provide software for updates to China’s main policing system.

The Xinjiang government said in a statement that it uses surveillance technologies to “prevent and combat terrorist and criminal activity” and does not target any particular ethnicity. The statement said Western countries also use such technology, calling the U.S. “a true surveillance state.” Other government agencies did not respond to a request for comment.

The new Marketplace store that will house the deli will occupy a site that was formerly home to a K-Mart store and is about 10 miles from Kroger’s headquarters in Cincinnati. Kroger said it invested $25 million to develop the new location, which is set to open on Sept. 19. The store will span about 101,000 square feet, according to a report in The Cincinnati Enquirer.

A Freedom of Information request lodged by the Daily Express showed that tax office staff took 551,064 sick days between August 2024 and July 2025.
This was down slightly from 565,244 the previous year, but an increase on the 540,052 sick days taken between August 2022 and July 2023.
“This is unfair on taxpayers and damaging to productivity.” There are 65,000 staff working for the tax office meaning each employee takes an average of eight sick days per year.

A total of 1.6 million working days were lost in that time thanks to staff absences at HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) – something the Conservatives said was “unfair on taxpayers”.

It comes after a HMRC boss admitted four million calls from taxpayers were going unanswered every year.

A Freedom of Information request lodged by the Daily Express showed that tax office staff took 551,064 sick days between August 2024 and July 2025.

This was down slightly from 565,244 the previous year, but an increase on the 540,052 sick days taken between August 2022 and July 2023.

Helen Whately, shadow work and pensions secretary, told the Daily Express: “These statistics are shocking – far too many days are being lost to sick leave.

“This is unfair on taxpayers and damaging to productivity.”

There are 65,000 staff working for the tax office meaning each employee takes an average of eight sick days per year.

Across the entire Civil Service, more than four million working days are being lost to sick leave, with absence rates rocketing by more than 10pc in some areas.

Ms Whately added: “People should only be signed off if they are genuinely too ill to work. Too many sick notes are handed out without proper care or consideration for what’s best for patients, employers and taxpayers.”

Last week, Jonathan Athow, HMRC boss, was forced to admit as many as four million taxpayer calls were going unanswered during a parliamentary grilling from Liam Byrne, the Labour MP.

Mr Byrne pointed out £46.8bn of tax is owed but not collected by HMRC, and asked how many calls go unanswered.

Mr Athow replied: “Off the top of my head, we’re talking three, maybe three or four million calls potentially.”

Elliot Keck, of lobby group the TaxPayers’ Alliance, told The Telegraph: “HMRC isn’t the only department with a lethargic attitude to work, sick note culture is rife amongst the Civil Service.

“Millions of days are being lost, costing taxpayers a fortune and sapping productivity at a time when Britain can least afford it. Civil service chiefs need to get a grip and ensure staff deliver value for money, rather than treating time off as an extension of their holiday entitlement.”

Seb Maley, of tax insurance provider Qdos, said: “The complexity of the UK’s tax system makes clear, reliable advice indispensable. Without effective communication channels, many taxpayers are left to navigate unclear rules on their own.”

Earlier this year, The Telegraph reported that civil servants are taking more long-term sick days than they did during the Covid crisis.

Civil servants missed 3.5 days as a result of long-term sickness on average in the year to March 2023, up from 2.8 days in 2021, according to analysis of official data by the Financial Times.

Britain’s worklessness crisis has spiralled since the pandemic, and NHS England data shows that 11 million sick notes were issued in 2022-23.

An HMRC spokesman said: “Our sickness rates are in line with the UK workforce average. We successfully handle millions of customer queries every month, mostly online, and the Government is investing £500m in our digital services so more people can sort their tax affairs without having to wait on the phone.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/money/2025/09/09/TELEMMGLPICT000435674910_17574129824110_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-09-09 09:12:26.614907

And according to cyberdefence experts, it's reasonable to expect that airlines will continue to be targets of hackers, both the cybercriminal and state-sponsored varieties.
The Aeroflot attack was political in nature, though not perpetrated by a state actor.
Airlines also often rely on third-party providers for IT systems, a weakness that was exploited by hackers this summer.
As far as attacks by state espionage services, McGladrey said airlines aren't the only target within the travel industry.","Qantas. Hawaiian. WestJet. Air France-KLM. Aeroflot. Each of these airlines has fallen victim to cyberattacks this summer.

And according to cyberdefence experts, it's reasonable to expect that airlines will continue to be targets of hackers, both the cybercriminal and state-sponsored varieties.

""If I were a hacker, that's what I would do,"" said Recep Ozdag, a vice president in the cybersecurity division of Los Angeles-based Keysight Technologies.

""You've found an industry that is not well-protected. It's critical infrastructure with a lot of sensitive information. Why would I not go after that industry? It's low-hanging fruit.

WestJet was the first of the large airlines to report a breach this summer. Hackers were able to obtain travel-related documents, such as passports, but not payment information.

Hawaiian was struck next, on 26 June. The airline didn't offer details on which of its IT systems were compromised, but the incident almost surely played a part in the FBI issuing a warning the following day that a notorious cybercriminal organization called Scattered Spider had turned its attention to the airline industry.

Next came a 30 June attack on Qantas, in which hackers gained access to a customer-servicing platform with the names, email addresses, birth dates and frequent flyer numbers of 6 million customers.

Hackers gained access to similar data from an early August attack on Air France-KLM.

The attack on Russia's Aeroflot in late July stands out among the summer onslaught both for its motive and impact. Two pro-Ukrainian hacking groups, Silent Crow and Belarusian Cyberpartisans, claimed credit for the attack, which unlike the others, impacted operations, forcing Aeroflot to cancel more than 100 flights. The hackers claimed the attack was the culmination of a year's work in which they had destroyed 7,000 Aeroflot servers and obtained control over airline employee computers.

The Aeroflot attack was political in nature, though not perpetrated by a state actor. But cybersecurity veteran Kayne McGladrey, a senior member of IEEE, the world's largest professional society of technologists, said airlines are also under continuous attack by nation states conducting espionage. Carriers, he said, have contracts to transport government workers whose data and itineraries are of interest to foreign spy agencies.

""Statecraft is a feature of the landscape. It's day-to-day normalcy,"" McGladrey said. ""There are folks in government offices who do this for their job.""

Even if an airline, perhaps jolted by this summer's events, decides to diligently invest the required resources to harden its systems, the process will take time, Ozdag said.

Large airlines typically rely on a wide mix of operating systems, including legacy technology that is decades old and not easily updated. Plus, their IT systems are sprawling. For example, in the chaos at Delta last year following a failed software update by cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike, the airline had to physically reset 40,000 servers.

""I think there is still an opening,"" Ozdag said about airline vulnerability, even if they are improving their defences. ""Is it six months? Is it a year? That depends on the airline. But if I'm a hacker, I've come to that conclusion.""

Airlines also often rely on third-party providers for IT systems, a weakness that was exploited by hackers this summer. Qantas and Air France-KLM each reported that their customer data breaches came through third-party systems.

In its notice in late June, the FBI said Scattered Spider often uses phishing attacks – impersonating employees or contractors to deceive IT help desks into granting access to internal systems. Ozdag, who works directly with aviation-aligned systems to help simulate real-world attack scenarios, said approximately 80% of successful hacks and system takeovers use similar types of social engineering attacks. The other 20% involve more direct methods, such as physical takeovers of IP systems and remote attacks on WiFi networks.

He said one reason airlines aren't as well protected as they could be is that they don't have the strong cybersecurity regulatory requirements that the financial services and healthcare sectors do. Still, he said, carriers should spend more on cyber audits, testing and security updates.

As far as attacks by state espionage services, McGladrey said airlines aren't the only target within the travel industry. An attack on the reservation system of Marriott's Starwood brands in 2018, which exposed nearly 500 million customer records, is believed to have been perpetrated by China.

Generally, espionage attacks aren't geared toward credit card fraud and personal account takeovers the way criminal cyberattacks can be, McGladrey said, but there's always a chance a government hacker will moonlight on the dark web.

While there's not much travellers can do to protect their data that is held by airlines, one step he suggests is putting a freeze on credit reports, which can prevent the unauthorised setup of new accounts.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/MC-Asia/uploadedImages/Articles/News/Association_Meetings/why-airlines-are-targeted-for-cyberattacks.jpg?tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-09-09 08:06:28.534825

Likely Trend of CAH Stock Following the News

Following the announcement, shares of the company closed flat at $149.6 on Friday. In the year-to-date period, CAH’s shares have gained 26.5% compared with the industry’s 2.4% growth. The S&P 500 has increased 10.8% in the same time frame.

Cardinal Health's new distribution center in Fort Worth, TX, can boost its stock price in the long run by improving efficiency and reducing delivery times, thereby helping CAH to meet growing demand in the healthcare sector.

More on CAH’s New Distribution Center in Texas

Cardinal Health’s Fort Worth-based distribution center is 340,000 square feet in size and will support its at-home Solutions business. The facility is dedicated to shipping medical supplies directly to patients’ homes, serving more than 6 million people annually. It is expected to handle around 10,000 packages per day, covering critical needs such as diabetes, sleep apnea, and urological care. This move further strengthens the company’s role in home-based healthcare delivery.

The Texas site is the third distribution center built from the ground up in just three years for at-Home Solutions. Similar to the recently added facilities in Ohio and South Carolina, it is equipped with robotics and automation technology. These investments reflect Cardinal Health’s focus on supply chain excellence, with an emphasis on faster delivery, improved safety, and higher service levels. The expansion demonstrates the company’s commitment to meeting rising demand in the home healthcare market.

CAH’s at-Home Solutions business is delivering strong results from its recent investments in distribution capacity and automation. In the fourth quarter, revenue grew nearly 50%, with double-digit gains on an organic basis. Notably, this growth significantly outpaced the increase in freight and warehousing costs, highlighting the efficiency and scalability of the business model.

CAH’s Notable Distribution Network

Cardinal Health is continuing to strengthen its U.S. distribution network with new investments in facilities and automation. Most recently, the company announced plans to break ground on a new distribution center in Sacramento, CA, entirely dedicated to its at-Home Solutions business. The site is expected to be operational by Summer 2027 and will expand Cardinal Health’s reach on the West Coast, improving delivery speed and efficiency for patients. In addition, the company is retrofitting its existing Ontario, CA, facility with advanced automation technologies, including a fully automated outbound conveyor system.

In September 2024, the company launched a new distribution center in Greenville, SC, and partnered with Australia-based Telix to distribute Zircaix, a PET imaging agent for kidney cancer, pending regulatory approval. In August 2024, CAH unveiled plans for a state-of-the-art distribution center in Walton Hills, OH, to support its medical products and distribution segment. Prior to that, in 2023, Cardinal Health opened two distribution centers in Central Ohio and a medical products replenishment center in New York, further reinforcing its inventory capacity and supply chain resilience.

By securing the exclusive global rights to administer Salesforce certification exams, has not only solidified its dominance in the skills assessment space but also tapped into a high-growth sector poised to accelerate with the rise of AI and digital transformation. For investors, this collaboration represents a strategic masterstroke that could redefine Pearson’s revenue trajectory and market relevance.

A Market in Motion: Why Certifications Matter

The global professional certification market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.08%, . This surge is driven by the urgent demand for upskilling in AI, cloud computing, and CRM technologies—sectors where Salesforce is a dominant force. Pearson’s 2025 Value of IT Certification Candidate Report underscores this trend, , . .

Pearson’s Strategic Gambit: Capturing the Full Certification Funnel

Pearson’s partnership with Salesforce is more than a transactional agreement; it’s a calculated move to dominate the end-to-end certification lifecycle. . The integration of Pearson VUE’s OnVUE online proctoring, , and event-based testing options ensures accessibility, a critical factor in a post-pandemic world where flexibility is king.

This partnership also aligns with Pearson’s broader enterprise learning strategy. , signaling confidence in its ability to monetize its testing infrastructure [5]. By capturing the full certification pathway for Salesforce professionals, Pearson gains access to a captive audience for its learning products, from prep courses to corporate training programs. As one analyst noted, “This isn’t just about exams—it’s about building a around Salesforce’s ecosystem” [6].

Quantifying the Opportunity: Market Expansion and Revenue Leverage

While specific financial terms of the Pearson-Salesforce deal remain undisclosed, the broader market dynamics suggest substantial upside. , , . , .

Risks and Realities: Is This a Sustainable Edge?

No partnership is without risks. Competitors like

Additionally, the lack of disclosed financial terms leaves some uncertainty about Pearson’s revenue share. However, Pearson’s first-mover advantage in securing exclusivity with Salesforce—a company that raised its 2025 revenue guidance by $1 billion post-partnership—suggests a high degree of confidence in the deal’s value.

Conclusion: A Win-Win for Investors

Pearson’s alliance with Salesforce is a textbook example of strategic alignment. It leverages Salesforce’s market leadership in CRM and AI with Pearson’s global testing infrastructure to create a virtuous cycle of certification demand, data insights, and monetization. For investors, this partnership isn’t just a short-term boost—it’s a long-term play on the skills economy.

When Ralph Lauren took to the web 25 years ago, it was one of the first designer brands to make a big push online, looking to carve out its own bit of digital Americana early.

That launch included Ask Ralph, featuring 100 commonly asked fashion questions answered by the designer himself and his team.

Now there’s a new high-tech member of that team ready to weigh in on just what fashion is as Ask Ralph relaunches Tuesday as an artificially intelligent shopping experience on the brand’s app.

“The most difficult thing for any company is to find the right technology to help you tell your story,” said David Lauren, the company’s chief branding and innovation officer, in an interview.

“Over 25 years we’ve explored a lot of different technologies. Some of them have been totally groundbreaking and have helped to change our industry and some of them disappear,” he said. “This feels like a very obvious opportunity. Not just because everybody’s talking about it, but because it has an ability to learn with us.”

There’s plenty to learn in the world of Ralph Lauren and already the AI, which has been under development for a year, has absorbed a lot, from the designer’s personal take on style to how that philosophy has been absorbed by his team and how it all has translated into the brand’s DNA.

“[AI] has the ability to sort of absorb our incredible archive as well as the words,” Lauren said. “We use the pictures and our philosophy and put it all together and make sense of it.”

Powered by Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, the chat-based service uses natural language processing to serve up shoppable visual laydowns of complete outfits.

So a query on just what to wear to a wedding in Miami in December will pull up a carousel of options that can be added to one’s cart and bought immediately.

In a preview test at the brand’s Prince Street store in Manhattan’s SoHo shopping district, the service seemed, like Ralph Lauren in general, very buttoned up. The experience felt commercially oriented, offering up looks that can be bought at the moment and avoiding questions that might send it off course.

Asked how to dress in the style of Tommy Hilfiger or if President Donald Trump wore Polo, the technology demurred.

AI’s launch into the world has led to any number of slip-ups and embarrassing hallucinations, but Ask Ralph does not seem primed to make any big fashion faux pas.

“We’re not here to try to be clever with it,” Lauren said. “Our aim was to pull from a live inventory of what’s on the site right now. There is a whole section that pulls from the archive and the history and gives you the philosophy, but the piece that I think is going to be most valuable to customers is sort of what’s really shoppable.”

This is the first time the brand has had a consumer-facing AI tool. Lauren said the future was still wide open and that Ask Ralph could eventually become voice-activated, integrate the Collection business or be added to other platforms.

“It’s going to become more and more valuable quickly,” Lauren said. “We know that everybody’s talking about artificial intelligence, but we wanted to explore it, use it, and learn. We’re confident that this is going to be a valuable tool, but we also recognize that what it is right now is the very beginning.”

Generative AI is almost universally seen as a business and cultural game changer — potentially on the order of the iPhone or the internet itself — but there is still little consensus on just what the mid-term impact will be, other than big.

McKinsey & Co. estimated that generative AI will add $150 billion to $275 billion to fashion’s operating profits by 2030.

That would include supply chain and other back office efficiencies, changes to the workforce and new ways to connect with consumers, like the Ask Ralph feature.

Just what AI means to the future of fashion might be the big question in the industry, but it’s too big a question to answer right from the start, so Ralph Lauren is just leaning in for now.

“Everybody walks in and they want, ‘How big can it be? How fast can it grow?’” Lauren said. “That’s not really how we’re doing this. For us, this is very incremental. We have key learnings we’re trying to measure for every week.

“What we know is that we have the tool that’s going to help us get to the place we want to get to, and that over the next year it’s going to become so much smarter that by the end of this year you’ll be saying ‘Ralph Lauren led again.'”

Lauren is reaching for the stars, but not promising the moon.

“Perfectionism is important in fashion, but it can also stop you from taking risks and moving forward,” Lauren said. “I think we know that there’s a good marriage here, but it’s going to have to grow together to get stronger and better.

“Everybody’s racing. Don’t. Just stop racing. Set your own pace, understand who you are and move carefully to understand how your brand is best married to technology. And don’t rush to keep up with: ‘I have to change, I have to evolve. It has to be the hottest new thing.’ That’s what’s killed a lot of fashion.

“What makes good brands work is that they understand who they are and they know how to evolve carefully with the right pace that’s right for their brand,” Lauren said. “We’ve done that over 60 years. Ralph Lauren today is not the same company as it was when it started, or else we would just be a tie.”",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ask-Ralph.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,N,,2025-09-09 10:07:50.316636

He said a study conducted by Arion Research for Zoho showed that over half of Nigerian firms had moved from experimenting with AI to applying it organisation-wide.
Ogundare said the findings proved Nigerian businesses were adopting AI responsibly, with privacy now a central part of their strategy.
He said growth was driven by products such as Zoho Workplace, Zoho Books, Zoho Campaigns and Zoho One, with demand from financial services, IT, energy, education, media and retail.
He explained that this growth underscored how Nigerian businesses were accelerating digital adoption to scale and compete.","Zoho, a global technology company, says 93 per cent of Nigerian companies have adopted artificial intelligence (AI), while 84 per cent strengthened privacy measures.

The Country Head of Zoho Nigeria, Mr Kehinde Ogundare, disclosed this during Zoho’s 2025 User Conference, Zoholics Nigeria, held in Lagos on Monday.

He said a study conducted by Arion Research for Zoho showed that over half of Nigerian firms had moved from experimenting with AI to applying it organisation-wide. He noted the report also found 94 per cent of companies now had a privacy officer or team, while 40 per cent allocate major IT budgets to privacy.

Ogundare said the findings proved Nigerian businesses were adopting AI responsibly, with privacy now a central part of their strategy. “This reflects Zoho’s philosophy of building privacy-first AI tools that help businesses grow while protecting customer trust,” he said.

He added that 65 per cent of organisations reported increased awareness of regulations since the introduction of Nigeria’s Data Protection Act. “Many firms now conduct privacy audits of AI systems (57 per cent), apply data minimisation (57 per cent), and demand explainability of AI decisions (52 per cent),” he said.

According to him, 69 per cent of businesses invest in data analysis skills, 53 per cent in AI literacy, and 40 per cent in prompt engineering for generative AI. He, however, noted that lack of technical expertise remained a barrier for 37 per cent of firms, though many were responding through upskilling.

Alongside the report, Ogundare revealed that Zoho achieved 75 per cent customer growth in Nigeria in 2024, making it one of its strongest African markets. He said growth was driven by products such as Zoho Workplace, Zoho Books, Zoho Campaigns and Zoho One, with demand from financial services, IT, energy, education, media and retail.

The Federal Government, through the Ministry of Labour and Employment, had convened the emergency meeting in a bid to end the planned industrial action on Monday in Abuja.

The meeting aimed to address allegations of anti-union practices against the Dangote Refinery, but discussions reportedly broke down as the Dangote representatives’ walkout of the meeting.

The Minister of Labour and Employment, Alhaji Muhammad Dingyadi, who presided over the meeting, told newsmen that progress was slow. “We have not been able to reach final agreement on this matter. Negotiations will continue.

“Maybe by tomorrow, we will resolve the issues. I appeal to everyone to maintain peace as discussions continue,” he said. The minister, therefore assured all, that the government is still committed to finding common ground for all parties.

Speaking, Mr Benson Upah, Acting General Secretary of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), alleged that the Dangote’s delegation was deliberately sabotaging the process.

“The representative of the Dangote Refinery walked out on the Honourable Minister and Organised Labour. So, there was no agreement.

“Even, when we bent backwards to accommodate his uncompromising behaviour, he still did what he did.

“So, we are left with no choice than to do the needful. The action continues,” Upah said. He added that the labour movement remained open to dialogue, but, could not negotiate alone.

“It takes more than one party to reach a resolution.

“Whenever the Dangote Refinery sees the need for genuine dialogue, we are ready, even this night, if they return,” he said.

According to him, NUPENG’s action on the matter is for the interest of Nigerians. “We cannot stand an investor whose main purpose is to enslave Nigerians.

In 2024, 1.36 billion de minimis shipments entered the U.S., according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
But the ramifications are big for all retailers heading into the holiday shopping season.
This year, Drabicky said clients are asking for three to four holiday ad plans that can be quickly adjusted.
PMG’s Shea agreed that the change could potentially result in global shipping delays when consumers are shopping for holiday gifts.","Retailers are bracing for another challenge during the critical holiday season: import fees.

The recent ending of the so-called de minimis rule closes a longtime trade exemption that allowed companies to skip paying import fees on packages entering the U.S. if the packages are worth less than $800. The exception was supposed to end in July 2027 but was pushed up by President Trump with an executive order on August. 29. Since the U.S. Customs and Border Protection began enforcing the executive order, postal deliveries to the U.S. have dropped 80%, according to the Universal Postal Union.

In 2024, 1.36 billion de minimis shipments entered the U.S., according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Experts said that the de minimis rule was largely used as a loophole for Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein to get products into the U.S. But the ramifications are big for all retailers heading into the holiday shopping season. Retailers are already facing significant challenges with uncertain tariffs and drops in consumer spending.

“Retailers are getting beat up left and right, and de minimis is another hit that retailers have to take this year,” said Vic Drabicky, founder and CEO of agency January Digital. “It forces brands to not think as long-term as they want—they have to be more reactionary and more conservative with big bets on products and advertising.”

Ad budgets in limbo

Drabicky said that the ending of de minimis—as well as the broader retail environment—means that holiday ad budgets are not set in stone. He compared this year’s budgets to 2020, when brands planned their ad budgets week to week instead of yearly.

This year, Drabicky said clients are asking for three to four holiday ad plans that can be quickly adjusted.

“Most brands haven’t cut their spend, but they also haven’t fully released it yet,” he said.

Mark Power, founder of ecommerce agency Podean, anticipated that Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein would need to pull back on their own ad spend to offset import fees and the availability of products. Temu has already pulled back significantly on its U.S.-based ad spend.

In July, Amazon briefly cut its spending on Google Shopping ads, opening up more inventory for other retailers to buy. Amazon has since come back to Google Shopping, showing how quickly retailers are changing strategies, said Simon Poulton, evp of innovation and growth at agency Tinuiti.

“On the fringes, there are probably some areas where there’s a lot of opportunity, but in general, it isn’t going to be the boom that you might expect or hope it to be,” added John Shea, head of commerce at PMG.

Higher prices are headed to consumers

The ending of de minimis means that China-based retailers will need to raise their prices to offset higher import prices. The move may offset consumers from shopping, said Podean’s Power.

“We’ll likely see Temu, Shein, and even TikTok Shop be less compelling for consumers in certain areas, given prices will have to increase as a result and [face a] possible disruption in availability,” he said.

The end of de minimis is likely to cause delays and backlogs at ports that could impact all brands, regardless of whether they previously used de minimis, Power added.

PMG’s Shea agreed that the change could potentially result in global shipping delays when consumers are shopping for holiday gifts.

“It’s going to change shipping patterns pretty dramatically,” Shea said.

Retailers are bracing for a tough holiday season

The loss of de minimis will likely help curb counterfeit products, which will help high-quality brands weed out their products. But the exemption will also affect categories like electronics that heavily rely on being imported, said January Digital’s Drabicky.

It will also change how retailers buy products with a bigger emphasis on bulk buying instead of buying from independent sellers, he said.

While de minimis is only focused on import fees, the disruption around it also extends to other issues like tariffs that retailers are managing, Tinuiti’s Poulton said.

HOBOKEN, N.J., Sept. 9, 2025 /CNW/ -- Pearson (FTS: PSON.L) and its Pearson VUE business, the global leader in computer-based testing solutions, today announced an exclusive multi-year collaboration with Salesforce, the world's #1 AI CRM, to be the sole provider of Salesforce certification exams worldwide.

As advanced technologies and AI reshape how businesses operate, professionals and organizations are racing to keep skills sharp and relevant. Together, Pearson and Salesforce are meeting this demand, integrating Pearson VUE's trusted testing systems into the Salesforce certification program, equipping employees and employers with the most current, verified Salesforce skills to drive greater value for their businesses and customers.

Key partnership benefits include a new streamlined certification pathway, vast exam catalog, and flexible delivery options. Registration for Salesforce certification exams opened on July 21, 2025.

Dr. Gary Gates, managing director, Pearson VUE says, ""Our strategic collaboration with Salesforce underscores a shared commitment to innovation and professional growth. Our new seamless certification experience is an investment in the future of professionals around the world, providing opportunities for individual career advancement and organizational success.""

According to Pearson's 2025 Value of IT Certification Candidate Report, over 70% of certified professionals report increased efficiency, innovation, and enhanced productivity as a result of gaining a certification. Sixty-three percent received or anticipated a promotion within the context of earning a certification.

For Salesforce, certifications help ensure that professionals using Salesforce keep pace with the platform's evolution and make the most of its powerful capabilities.

""Salesforce has become essential as companies embrace digital transformation, integrating advanced AI capabilities into their workflows to unlock new levels of efficiency across sales, marketing, and service teams. As enterprises look for ways to outpace competitors and adapt to changing market demands, harnessing Salesforce's CRM and AI features is key to achieving lasting success and operational excellence. Salesforce certifications unlock this potential, empowering professionals to enhance their skills, demonstrate expertise and lead their organizations in achieving operational excellence and lasting growth,"" says Sanjeev Balakrishnan, EVP of Customer Success at Salesforce.

A Unified Certification Journey

Pearson and Salesforce have connected their systems to create a single, streamlined journey for certification candidates. From registration to exam day, everything is in one place - clear, efficient, and built around the candidate.

Extensive Salesforce Exam Catalog

Pearson VUE will oversee a diverse catalog of 80 Salesforce certification exams, including:

Salesforce Administrator: A foundational certification validating skills in customizing Salesforce and managing users and data.

Innovative Exam Delivery Options

Pearson VUE will offer Salesforce certification exams in three flexible formats, designed to meet professionals whether they are online, in person, or on-site at client events:

Walmart associates, elected officials, and community leaders celebrated the grand opening of a new 725,000 square-foot perishable distribution center (PDC). The state-of-the-art facility is designed to receive and process fresh produce, eggs, dairy, meat and frozen goods for delivery to 180 Walmart stores.

Freshness Delivered Faster

“The opening of our new high-tech perishable distribution center marks a major step forward in how we get fresher products to customers faster — whether that’s in-store, delivered to their home, or even restocking their refrigerator,” said Rob Montgomery, executive vice president, Supply Chain, Walmart U.S., in a recent release.

The Lyman area facility is the third of five new high-tech PDCs Walmart is opening nationwide, marking a significant milestone in the company’s supply chain transformation. These facilities leverage advanced automation to process more than double the volume of a traditional distribution center.

“South Carolina continues to lead in innovation and logistics, and Walmart’s investment in Spartanburg County is driving that momentum forward,” said South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. “Through advanced supply chain technology and a strong commitment to local sourcing, we’re proud to partner with Walmart to deliver fresh, affordable food to communities across our state and the region.”

Technology That Transforms Work

Walmart is reshaping associates’ work by integrating technology that removes some of their most physically demanding tasks. For example, robotics now handles the movement of cases on and off pallets, reducing the need for strenuous lifting.

Associates at the facility work alongside the high-tech systems that build store-specific pallets, ensuring fragile items like eggs and yogurt are placed toward the top to minimize product damage. AI tracks every pallet to ensure accuracy and freshness. This technology also makes unloading at stores faster and easier, allowing store associates to spend more time helping customers.

The facility is home to more than 600 full-time Walmart associates with ongoing opportunities for career growth and development. Walmart is currently hiring a variety of roles, including automation equipment operators. Full-time positions qualify for Walmart’s total rewards and benefits plans, including medical, vision, and dental insurance, 401(k) matching, paid time off, stock purchase plan, and access to a tuition-paid college degree through Walmart’s Live Better U.

“We are thrilled to welcome Walmart to the Lyman community. Walmart’s new high-tech facility is a powerful investment in our future – creating hundreds of quality jobs and bringing lasting career opportunities across the Upstate,” said Lyman Mayor Glenn Greer. “This milestone not only strengthens Lyman but also positions our region for continuing economic growth in the coming years.”

The move, which brings together CXOs of global corporations, industry bodies like NASSCOM, business councils, consulting leaders, real estate developers, and top academic institutions, is expected to significantly accelerate GCC investments, and position AP as a national leader in the digital economy.

GCCs, which are the strategic units of multinational corporations handling R&D, IT, finance, procurement, and customer services, are among the fastest growing engines of global business. Unlike traditional outsourcing, GCCs are wholly owned by their parent companies, ensuring innovation, efficiency, and larger integration with global operations. With over 1,600 GCCs already operating in India, and employing 1.6 million professionals, Andhra Pradesh is now making an aggressive pitch to capture the next wave of investments.

The newly formed GCC Advisory Council has a wide-ranging mandate, including preparing a five-year strategic roadmap for AP’s GCC sector. Its focus includes creating a future-ready talent ecosystem through partnerships with IIT Tirupati, IIM Visakhapatnam, and skill development programmes, driving innovation and R&D through global collaborations, developing world-class infrastructure, including IT parks, plug-and-play facilities, and Grade-A commercial spaces, reviewing and monitoring IT & GCC Policy 4.0 implementation, and leading branding and global outreach via roadshows in the US, Europe, and Asia.

The move is intended to speed up Ikea’s presence in mature markets. It takes years to build large stores, while space inside Best Buy stores is ready right away. Ikea says these sites are in “white spots” where it does not currently operate, including Daytona Beach and Lakeland in Florida, and Humble and Mesquite in Texas. At the same time, Best Buy gains a new reason for shoppers to walk into its stores. That may be useful as consumer electronics chains face slowing demand after a surge in the pandemic years.

Meanwhile, BBY shares have climbed a modest 1.86% yesterday, closing at $77.59.

New Formats and Global Push

Over the past few years, Ikea has changed its business model. The retailer used to rely on big warehouses outside cities. Now it offers city center shops, online ordering, click and collect services, and home delivery with assembly. Customers like the convenience, though some complain about product availability in the smaller spaces.

Globally, Ikea holds a 5.7% share of the furniture market. It aims to increase this figure and is testing new formats in both stores and online. In China, the company sells on Alibaba’s (BABA) Tmall and, since last month, on JD.com (HK:9618). About one-fifth of new customers in the country now come from Tmall. Sales on JD.com in the first week were better than expected.

Executives say there are no plans to use third-party on-line sites in the United States or Europe. Instead, the Best Buy partnership may serve as a model in those regions. Ikea can use large stores as fulfillment centers for online orders, while new partnerships allow it to move faster.

Is Best Buy a Good Stock to Buy Now?

On the Street, Best Buy scores a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Out of 20 analysts’ ratings, eight rate it a Buy, with one analyst seeing it as a Sell. The average BBY stock price target is $79.67, implying a 2.68% upside from the current price.

Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.

You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.

You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

As the sector continues to consolidate, regional banks that navigate regulatory shifts with agility will emerge as the dominant players in the post-merger landscape.","The U.S. banking sector is undergoing a transformative phase, driven by regulatory tailwinds and a strategic shift toward scale-driven growth.

Financial Services Group’s $4.1 billion acquisition of Holding Company exemplifies this trend, positioning the regional bank to capitalize on favorable policy changes and market dynamics. As the Federal Reserve and banking regulators recalibrate capital requirements and antitrust enforcement, the stage is set for a new wave of consolidation in retail banking.

Regulatory Tailwinds: Easing Capital Constraints and Antitrust Scrutiny

Recent regulatory reforms have created a more permissive environment for M&A activity. The Federal Reserve’s proposed changes to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR) for global systemically important banks (GSIBs) are particularly significant. By recalibrating the eSLR to function as a backstop rather than a binding constraint, the reform reduces required Tier 1 capital for GSIBs by approximately 1.4% at the holding-company level and 27% at the depository institution subsidiary level [1]. This easing of capital requirements frees up liquidity for strategic acquisitions, enabling banks like PNC to pursue growth without compromising regulatory compliance.

Simultaneously, antitrust enforcement has shifted under the Trump administration, with regulators adopting a more flexible approach to merger approvals. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have shown a willingness to accept structural remedies, such as divestitures of standalone businesses, rather than outright blocking deals [3]. This contrasts with the Biden administration’s aggressive antitrust stance, which led to the collapse of high-profile mergers like TD Bank’s acquisition of

. The current regulatory climate, therefore, provides a more predictable path for PNC’s $4.1 billion deal with FirstBank, which is expected to close in early 2026 [2].

Strategic Rationale: Expanding Market Presence and Digital Capabilities

PNC’s acquisition of FirstBank is a calculated move to strengthen its position in high-growth markets. FirstBank’s 95-branch network in Colorado and Arizona—regions with robust economic expansion—will triple PNC’s footprint in Colorado to 120 branches and expand its Arizona presence to over 70 branches [2]. This expansion aligns with PNC’s long-term strategy of leveraging strategic acquisitions to scale its retail and commercial banking operations.

The deal also underscores PNC’s commitment to digital innovation. FirstBank’s robust digital banking capabilities complement PNC’s existing technology infrastructure, enabling the combined entity to offer a seamless customer experience. As noted by

ISI analyst John Pancari, the acquisition “enhances PNC’s growth profile by integrating a digitally savvy regional player into its ecosystem” [3]. This synergy is critical in an era where embedded finance and digital-first banking are redefining customer expectations.

Market Implications: A Blueprint for Regional Bank Consolidation

PNC’s acquisition signals a broader trend of regional bank consolidation, driven by the need to achieve scale in a low-margin, high-competition environment. The Federal Reserve’s recent individual capital requirements for large banks, including stress capital buffers and G-SIB surcharges, have further incentivized mergers by reducing year-over-year volatility in regulatory expectations [4]. For regional banks, this stability lowers the risk of overpaying for acquisitions and ensures a clearer path to profitability.

Moreover, the regulatory reset has aligned with macroeconomic conditions. Improved economic growth and a more favorable interest rate environment in 2025 have bolstered investor confidence in M&A activity. PNC’s ability to retain all FirstBank branches and employees—ensuring continuity in community banking—demonstrates how strategic acquisitions can balance growth with local market engagement [2]. This model is likely to be replicated by peers seeking to expand without sacrificing customer trust.

Conclusion: A Win-Win for Investors and the Banking Sector

PNC’s acquisition of FirstBank is more than a strategic expansion—it is a harbinger of a new era in U.S. banking. By leveraging regulatory tailwinds and aligning with market demands for scale and digital innovation, PNC is positioning itself to outperform in a competitive landscape. For investors, the deal represents a compelling opportunity to capitalize on the convergence of policy-driven growth and operational efficiency.

(Reuters) - U.S. bank said on Monday it would buy privately-held FirstBank Holding in a $4.1 billion cash-and-stock deal, adding momentum to a long-predicted wave of dealmaking among regional lenders.

The deal, which is expected to close in early 2026, will bring PNC closer to $600 billion in assets, and narrow its gap with rivals such as .

It will also help PNC to expand in the fast-growing markets of Colorado and Arizona, bolstering its position in the western United States.

Shares of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based PNC fell nearly 1% in morning trading.

PNC CEO Bill Demchak said in June that he expected consolidation in retail banking to boost industry profits.

FirstBank’s ""deep retail deposit base, unrivaled branch network in Colorado, (and) growing presence in Arizona make it an ideal partner,"" Demchak said in a statement on Monday.

PNC’s branch network in Colorado will more than triple to 120, becoming one of its biggest U.S. markets.

Discussions between the two banks started in the summer, and the transaction will help PNC strengthen its reach beyond its traditional stronghold on the east coast, Alex Overstrom, head of retail banking at PNC, told Reuters.

""We are a top five retail player in the United States,"" Overstrom said. ""Our ambition is to be one of the top, if not the top retail bank in the country. This transaction allows us to do that by increasing our scale and density in certain areas, which is really important in retail banking,"" Overstrom added.

Talk of potential mergers and acquisitions among Wall Street banks and large regional lenders increased at the start of the second half of the year in a major shift under the Trump administration after regulators under the Biden administration opposed or blocked big deals.

""PNC is prudently taking advantage of the warmer regulatory waters to gain scale in attractive markets via manageably-sized deals,"" said Evercore ISI analyst John Pancari.

WHAT NOW FOR PNC?

Investors and analysts had been widely anticipating PNC to acquire a bank, although some expressed surprise at the size of the transaction.

""While we aren’t surprised to see PNC re-enter the M&A arena given the current administration’s de-regulatory agenda, our sense is that investors were more hopeful for a larger splash,"" said Raymond James analyst Michael Rose.

The deal could also rule out PNC as an acquirer for another large bank, Piper Sandler analysts said.

""PNC has been a name associated as a potential buyer for ,"" the analysts said, but the FirstBank deal could take it out of the running.

Comerica, a regional lender with $78 billion in assets, is being pushed to sell itself by an activist investor. It did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.

In July, regional lenders and agreed to combine in an $8.6 billion deal, the biggest U.S. bank acquisition this year.

Under the PNC deal, FirstBank stockholders will get roughly 13.9 million PNC shares and $1.2 billion in cash.

""At 5% of PNC’s size, FirstBank won’t materially move the needle, but added scale in Colorado and Arizona raises the company’s underlying growth profile and likely removes an overhang on the stock,"" Stephens analyst Terry McEvoy said.

FirstBank, which began offering banking services in 1963, manages $26.8 billion in assets and operates 95 branches.

FirstBank CEO Kevin Classen will become PNC’s Colorado regional president and mountain territory executive, which includes Arizona and Utah. Overstrom said that PNC will retain FirstBank client-facing employees.

He will succeed Amandine Ohayon, who has held the position of CEO for two years.
The choice of Tom Mendenhall seems a particularly wise decision.
Last year, Stella McCartney was named “Person of the Year 2024” by the animal rights organization PETA.
Since Stella McCartney regained her independence at the beginning of the year, the figures have continued to fall short of forecasts.","Stella McCartney has just appointed its new CEO: Tom Mendenhall. He will succeed Amandine Ohayon, who has held the position of CEO for two years. Why such a change now? Since the fashion house took a gamble on independence by buying back LVMH's minority stake, Stella McCartney has been facing tensions in the luxury market, which has been hit by a lasting crisis. The company has therefore implemented a recovery plan aimed at long-term growth.

The choice of Tom Mendenhall seems a particularly wise decision. In a statement, the businessman, who has extensive experience in the luxury sector, said he was “honored to now be working with Stella McCartney and her incredible international team on the next stage of the company's development.”

His expertise will be fundamental to the future of the company. Mendenhall has previously worked for Ralph Lauren, Gucci, and Tom Ford in various management positions. He is also the co-founder of the men's clothing brand Jamestown Hudson. His skills and experience will therefore be essential in giving the brand new momentum while enhancing its identity.

Amandine Ohayon, who had the difficult task of leading the company during the split with LVMH, will continue to serve as an advisor until Mendenhall officially takes up his position. Last year, Stella McCartney was named “Person of the Year 2024” by the animal rights organization PETA. Her status as a pioneer in ethical and sustainable fashion has allowed her to continue her role as an advisor to Bernard Arnault's group on environmental issues. But this prestige has not translated into financial success: in 2023, the company's turnover was around €26 million, compared to more than €47 million the previous year. Since Stella McCartney regained her independence at the beginning of the year, the figures have continued to fall short of forecasts. It must be said that the current economic climate, characterized by a multifactorial crisis (both economic and geopolitical), is particularly critical for mid-sized luxury brands, which do not benefit from the desirability of major international brands.",https://content.luxurytribune.com/app/uploads/2025/09/SMC_WI25_SHOW_DETAILS_4x5-8.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 10:08:39.280176

The closure of the Longs division, which includes the plants in Newcastle and Vereeniging, will directly and indirectly affect approximately 3,500 workers.
AMSA, formerly known as Iscor, has been a cornerstone of South Africa’s industrial landscape since its founding in 1928.
The company expanded significantly in the post-war years, with the Newcastle plant being commissioned in the 1970s.
However, its long-steel division has been suffering financial losses for many years due to logistical and energy challenges and unsustainable competition.","After 78 years of operation, ArcelorMittal South Africa (AMSA) has confirmed that it will wind down its long-steel business, a move that will have a devastating economic impact on Newcastle and the surrounding areas. The decision, announced in a letter to employees on August 29, follows several failed attempts to secure support and address long-standing operational challenges.

AMSA’s CEO, Kobus Verster, stated in the letter that the company had “no option but to prepare for closure” after negotiations with the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) and the government fell through. The company will begin issuing Section 189 retrenchment notices on a staggered basis starting 1 September.

The closure of the Longs division, which includes the plants in Newcastle and Vereeniging, will directly and indirectly affect approximately 3,500 workers. The company cited a combination of factors for the decision, including rising imports, soaring electricity costs, poor rail performance, and weak local demand.

Trade union NUMSA has condemned the closure as a “social and economic catastrophe.” Analysts warn that the move highlights the broader decline of South Africa’s manufacturing sector. The South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) echoed these concerns, with General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi stating that the decision will “devastate thousands of workers, their families, and entire communities.”

Vavi also highlighted the national implications of the closure, noting that South Africa will lose its last integrated carbon steel capacity. This will make the country “wholly dependent on imported steel, vulnerable to global pricing manipulation, and stripped of industrial sovereignty.” He pointed to the slow response by the state to combat the dumping of cheap steel, particularly from China, as a contributing factor.

Berkshire Hathaway Insurance Group comes in at number four, while Lloyd’s is ranked at number 5 and SCOR is number six. (See chart below for the full top 40 list).

For the purposes of developing the top 40 ranking of global reinsurers and overcoming the issue of comparing reinsurers that report under the GAAP versus IFRS 17 accounting standards, the ratings agency referred to gross premium written (GPW) for pure reinsurance business.

“For those reinsurers reporting under IFRS 17 and that do not publish GPW, we estimated the pure reinsurance GPW and marked them in the ranking. At the same time, we added the gross insurance revenue for reinsurance for all IFRS 17 filers,” said S&P in its report titled “S&P Global Ratings’ Top 40 Global Reinsurers In 2025 And Reinsurers By Country,” published on Sept. 3.

One of the main challenges for creating this report, S&P said, was drawing a clear line between companies’ reinsurance and primary insurance activities, “especially in cases where the reinsurance operation is a division within a company and not a distinct business.”

“Generally, premium data relate to a company’s reinsurance premium written. In some cases, however, other metrics include data from the primary insurance and the reinsurance business. If we did not view the metrics provided by companies as representative of their reinsurance operations, we marked the relevant metrics as not available (N.A.).”

Further, for groups that write both non-life and life reinsurance businesses, the combined ratio reflects non-life business only.

The report also breaks down the top reinsurers by country.

Compiling almost ten years’ worth of materials data, in-house labs, and artificial intelligence, the ZYA platform is designed to optimize sustainability-minded material formulations. Colgate-Palmolive will be given direct access to the system and is set to play an ‘active role’ in aligning the system with its packaging roadmap.

The platform will present ‘hundreds’ of industry biopolymers, additives, and naturally occurring polymers by their performance, cost, and compliance. Colgate-Palmolive will use the resource to virtually design materials in line with its performance specs and sustainability targets.

This is expected to speed up material screening and boost the success rates of trials, thus reducing R&D time ‘significantly’. In turn, it is set to streamline the market launch and scaling process for new packaging designs as global policies and consumer demands evolve.

On a wider scale, the partnership is considered a step forward in the use of artificial intelligence to help consumer brands adopt new materials and help tackle plastic waste.

“At Erthos, we believe the future of packaging isn’t just about new materials—it’s about reimagining the systems behind them,” said CEO Nuha Siddiqui. “Through our partnership with Colgate-Palmolive, we’re building a new playbook for sustainable packaging with ZYA—demonstrating how technology, science, and leadership can unlock the scale and speed needed to move the world beyond plastic.”

“Improving the performance, usability, and sustainability of our packaging materials is a key priority for Colgate-Palmolive,” added Greg Corra, senior vice president of Global Packaging at Colgate-Palmolive. “We are very excited to support Erthos in their development of the ZYA platform, and eager to collaborate in accelerating and enhancing the material development process.”

Last year, Colgate-Palmolive expressed its concerns that ‘industry-wide challenges’ related to flexible packaging could become a roadblock in achieving its recyclable, reusable, and compostable packaging targets for 2025. It claimed to have reached 89.5% by the end of 2023.

In other AI-related news, Unilever, Amcor, and Asahi are just some of the consumer brands trialling Greyparrot’s waste intelligence platform, designed to offer product-level recyclable waste data and address knowledge gaps. Using AI-camera systems in material recovery facilities, the solution follows packaging through the waste system and records which units are sorted, recycled, or lost – generating real-world recycling rates for brands to reference in their packaging developments.

Gaspard Duthilleul, COO at Greyparrot, spoke to Packaging Europe to dive deeper into how the technology works and what the company has learned through its implementation.

By Kritika Lamba and Krystal Hu

(Reuters) - Data analytics firm Databricks said on Monday it was on track to hit $4 billion in annualized revenue on the back of booming demand for its artificial intelligence products, as it closed a $1 billion funding round.

The Series K funding valued the company at $100 billion, making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world. The round was co-led by existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Insight Partners, MGX, Thrive Capital and WCM Investment Management.

The company plans to use the proceeds to accelerate its AI strategy, including expanding products, launching a new operational database category, and future AI acquisitions and research.

In the second quarter, the company served around 15,000 customers, including energy major Shell and electric-vehicle maker Rivian, surpassing a $4 billion revenue run rate, with AI products reaching $1 billion.

Databricks is targeting a net revenue retention above 140%, more than 650 customers with more than $1 million in annual spending and positive free cash flow over the past 12 months, the company said.

CEO Ali Ghodsi said the company intends to remain cash-flow positive, which could keep the door open for an initial public listing, without committing to any specific timeline.

The raise could help the company invest more in AI products such as Agent Bricks, a platform that helps people build AI autonomous systems, as well as its data warehouse product Lakebase, which has already generated tens of millions in annualized revenue since its launch in June. It has been actively making acquisitions, including the recent buy of machine learning startup Tecton.

The San Francisco-based company has long been seen as a leading candidate to go public. The firm has received numerous investor inquiries since the successful $1.22 billion initial public offering of design software firm Figma, another venture capital-backed startup, in July, according to Ghodsi.

Databricks, founded in 2013, offers a platform designed to help users ingest, analyze and build AI applications.

The interplay of these forces has reshaped investment landscapes, creating both challenges and opportunities for forward-looking investors. This analysis explores how corporations are leveraging AI-driven solutions and currency-hedged strategies to navigate uncertainty, and identifies actionable investment opportunities in sectors poised to outperform.

Tariffs and AI: A Strategic Counterbalance

The imposition of 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports has forced companies to rethink supply chains and capital allocation. For example, Colgate-Palmolive and General Motors have adopted flexible sourcing strategies to mitigate retaliatory measures, while Texas-based firms have increased AI adoption by 59.1% to offset tariff-driven costs [1]. AI is proving critical in optimizing logistics and supplier diversification. A U.S. automaker, for instance, used data observability tools to reroute EV battery production to Vietnam and India, cutting costs by 12% amid Biden-era tariffs [3].

Beyond cost management, AI is driving productivity gains. Microsoft’s AI-driven code-writing tools now handle 30% of internal development, saving $500 million annually [1]. Similarly, Walmart leveraged AI to predict supply chain bottlenecks, avoiding $5 million in losses during the 2024 tariff crisis [4]. These examples underscore AI’s role in transforming operational resilience, making it a cornerstone of corporate strategy.

Dollar Strength and Hedging: Mitigating Currency Volatility

The U.S. dollar’s 6% appreciation in trade-weighted terms during Q4 2024 pressured multinational earnings, particularly in technology and consumer goods. Apple and Procter & Gamble both reported reduced overseas revenues due to foreign exchange fluctuations [1]. To counter this, firms are adopting dynamic hedging strategies. For instance, the iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (HEEM) locks in currency prices via forward contracts, reducing exposure to volatile markets [3]. WisdomTree’s DDWM fund, which adjusts hedge ratios based on interest rate differentials and momentum signals, has delivered 8.3% annual returns since 2016 [4].

The dollar’s long-term strength faces headwinds as global investors diversify into non-U.S. assets, driven by concerns over fiscal sustainability [2]. This shift has spurred demand for hedged ETFs, with flows increasingly favoring products that balance U.S. growth with international diversification.

AI-Driven Investment Opportunities: Hyperscalers and Semiconductors

The AI infrastructure boom is fueling growth in semiconductors and cloud computing. NVIDIA’s Q4 2024 revenue surged 265.3% year-over-year, driven by demand for its Hopper GPU and Blackwell processors, which are already sold out until late 2025 [3]. TSMC and ASML are also benefiting: ASML’s Q4 net bookings doubled to €7.09 billion, despite geopolitical risks in China [2]. For investors, the Vaneck Vectors Semiconductor UCITS ETF offers broad exposure to 25 global leaders in this space [1].

Meanwhile, AI adoption in non-technology sectors is gaining traction. Citigroup’s AI initiatives in fraud detection and operational automation highlight the financial sector’s potential for productivity-driven growth [1].

Currency-Hedged ETFs: Balancing Risk and Return

For investors seeking to hedge against dollar volatility, HEEM and DDWM provide tailored solutions. HEEM’s focus on emerging markets, combined with currency hedging, mitigates the drag of local currency depreciation. DDWM’s dynamic approach, which adjusts hedge ratios based on market conditions, offers flexibility in uncertain environments [4]. However, investors should weigh higher management fees and tax inefficiencies inherent in these strategies [3].

Case Studies: AI as a Tariff Mitigation Tool

Walmart: AI-powered predictive analytics enabled $5 million in savings by rerouting shipments during the 2024 tariff crisis [4].

European Automaker: AI-driven supplier diversification reduced high-tariff region dependence by 15% [4].

Texas Firms: 25% of companies plan to increase automation to counteract tariffs, per the Dallas Fed [1].

Actionable Recommendations

AI-Driven Sectors: Invest in hyperscalers (NVIDIA, Microsoft) and semiconductor ETFs (Vaneck Semiconductor UCITS) to capitalize on infrastructure demand.

Currency-Hedged ETFs: Allocate to HEEM for emerging markets exposure and DDWM for dynamic hedging.

AI-Adopting Industries: Target financials (Citigroup) and manufacturing firms leveraging AI for supply chain resilience.

Conclusion

Q4 2024 has underscored the necessity of adaptive strategies in a landscape defined by tariffs and dollar strength. Companies that integrate AI into their operations and adopt currency-hedged investments are best positioned to thrive. For investors, the path forward lies in aligning portfolios with these transformative trends, prioritizing sectors where technological innovation and macroeconomic agility converge.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-09 06:07:03.203393

This growth comes at a time when, due to restrictions, apparel exports to India are allowed only through Chittagong port.
This marks nearly 16.5 per cent growth in apparel exports.
By that count, there has been an increase of 15 per cent in the apparel export following the ban.
Currently, all apparel exports to India are routed through Chittagong seaport.","Bangladesh’s apparel exports fell in August but, shipments to India increased. This growth comes at a time when, due to restrictions, apparel exports to India are allowed only through Chittagong port.

Over the past four months, India imposed restrictions three times on imports via land ports. On 17 May, apparel was among the goods hit by the first ban.

According to India’s restrictions, its importers were barred from bringing apparel through land ports. Only the ports of Nhava Sheva in Mumbai and Kolkata remained open.

To send goods to Nhava Sheva, shipments from Chittagong seaport must pass through Sri Lanka’s Colombo port first, involving four rounds of container loading and unloading, which raises the cost and time both.

Data from the National Board of Revenue (NBR) show that in August, two and a half months after the restrictions being imposed, Bangladesh exported apparel worth USD 80.6 million (USD 8.06 crore) to India.

During the same month last year, the figure was USD 69.2 million (USD 6.92 crore). This marks nearly 16.5 per cent growth in apparel exports.

According to NBR figures, in the three months (June–August) after the ban being imposed, Bangladesh exported apparel worth USD 183.5 million (USD 18.35 crore) to India, compared to USD 159.1 million (USD 15.91 crore) during the same quarter last year.

By that count, there has been an increase of 15 per cent in the apparel export following the ban.

Currently, all apparel exports to India are routed through Chittagong seaport. Before the ban was imposed on export through land ports, 30 per cent of the apparel was shipped via Chittagong port, 69 per cent through land ports with about 1 per cent sent by air.

Meanwhile, Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) data show that Bangladesh’s overall apparel exports in August fell by 4.75 per cent to about USD 3.17 billion (USD 317 crore), down from USD 3.33 billion (USD 333 crore) recorded in the same month last year.

During the same period last year Bangladesh had exported goods worth USD 302.8 million (USD 30.28 crore). That means export to India increased by around 4 per cent on the whole.

India is Bangladesh’s eighth-largest export destination, and within Asia, it is the largest. Bangladesh exported goods worth nearly USD 1.82 billion (USD 182 crore) to India in the 2024–25 fiscal year.

Apparel accounted for 36 per cent of this export, while non-apparel goods made up the remaining 64 per cent.",https://media.prothomalo.com/prothomalo-english%2F2025-09-09%2F2hckq6qb%2Fprothomalo-bangla2021-055f28f541-cead-462f-8efd-f581f133b11fa22f455a-68b6-4918-a0c6-5a51031e49ff.avif?rect=0%2C0%2C622%2C327&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&overlay=&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width_pct=1,N,,2025-09-09 04:02:42.372512

While its early success demonstrated the viability of premium pet food, the company’s current challenges underscore the sector’s evolving dynamics.","The premium pet food sector, once a golden child of the post-pandemic consumer boom, is showing signs of strain. Freshpet, a pioneer in the fresh, refrigerated pet food category, has epitomized this shift. In 2024, the company celebrated a “breakout” year, reporting $975.2 million in net sales and its first full-year net income of $46.9 million [1]. Yet, by Q1 2025, Freshpet posted a $12.7 million net loss, citing increased media spending and economic headwinds [3]. This volatility raises a critical question: Is the premium pet food model reaching its limits in a market increasingly defined by cost-conscious consumers and fragmented demand?

The Freshpet Paradox: Growth, Margin Gains, and Structural Weaknesses

Freshpet’s 2024 success was built on a combination of cost optimization and strategic retail partnerships. Gross margins improved to 40.6% from 32.7% in 2023, driven by lower input costs and plant efficiency [1]. However, the company’s reliance on premium pricing and a retail-centric distribution model has exposed vulnerabilities. In Q1 2025, despite 18% sales growth, Freshpet’s adjusted EBITDA dipped to $35.5 million from $43.5 million in Q3 2024 [5]. This reflects a broader trend: as the U.S. premium pet food market grows at a modest 0.5% CAGR [3], companies like Freshpet must balance innovation with affordability to retain price-sensitive customers.

The company’s revised 2025 guidance—projecting $1.12–$1.15 billion in sales—acknowledges a slowdown in new customer acquisition [4]. This is a stark contrast to the hypergrowth of 2021–2023, when pet owners treated pets as family members and splurged on premium products. Now, with inflation and wage stagnation constraining budgets, consumers are recalibrating. According to Euromonitor, 68% of Gen Z and 69% of Millennials still view pets as family, but their spending priorities have shifted toward value [4].

Walmart’s Omnichannel Edge: Affordability Meets Convenience

While Freshpet struggles with margin compression, Walmart has leveraged its omnichannel strategy to dominate the value segment. The retailer’s private-label brands, such as Goodlands and Zuke’s Dog Treats, offer high-quality alternatives at lower price points, capturing 0.5 percentage points of market share in 2024 [1]. Walmart’s integration of in-store Pet Services Centers and virtual vet care further enhances its appeal, addressing pet owners’ growing demand for holistic, affordable solutions [3].

Walmart’s e-commerce expansion has also been a game-changer. Over 70% of pet owners purchased supplies online in 2024, with platforms like Amazon and Walmart benefiting from repeat purchases [1]. By combining fast delivery, in-store pickup, and subscription models, Walmart has created a seamless experience that rivals Freshpet’s retail partnerships. For example, Walmart’s subscription-based dog food and dental treats cater to convenience-driven buyers, a demographic that Freshpet’s refrigerated, single-serve format may not fully address [2].

Colgate’s Resilience: Innovation and Cost Discipline in a Volatile Market

Colgate-Palmolive’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition segment offers a blueprint for navigating market volatility. In Q2 2025, Hill’s reported a 3.8% sales increase, driven by innovations like the Science Diet ActivBiome+ line and a targeted advertising campaign [2]. Crucially, Colgate’s disciplined cost management—via a three-year productivity program—has allowed it to maintain profitability despite rising raw material costs and tariffs.

Unlike Freshpet, which relies heavily on retail partnerships, Colgate has diversified its channels, including veterinary and online sales. This flexibility has insulated Hill’s from the same economic pressures facing Freshpet. For instance, Hill’s Prescription Diet line saw strong volume growth in Q2 2025, capitalizing on pet owners’ willingness to pay for specialized nutrition [2]. Colgate’s ability to balance premium positioning with operational efficiency underscores the importance of structural resilience in a maturing market.

The Premium Model at a Crossroads

The premium pet food sector’s growth is no longer a given. While the global market is projected to expand at 5.6% CAGR through 2034 [2], U.S. premium pet food revenue grew at a mere 0.1% CAGR from 2020–2025 [3]. This moderation reflects a shift from “premiumization” to “value-conscious premiumization.” Consumers are still willing to pay a premium for quality but are increasingly price-sensitive in their purchasing decisions.

Freshpet’s struggles highlight the risks of over-reliance on a retail-driven model. Its distribution strategy—relying on 27,000 stores and custom refrigerators—requires high fixed costs and leaves it vulnerable to margin pressures. In contrast, Walmart’s omnichannel approach and Colgate’s diversified, innovation-led strategy offer more scalable paths to growth.

Conclusion: A Cautionary Tale for Disruptors

Freshpet’s story is a cautionary tale for companies betting on retail-driven disruption. While its early success demonstrated the viability of premium pet food, the company’s current challenges underscore the sector’s evolving dynamics. Walmart and Colgate, by contrast, have adapted to macroeconomic pressures through affordability, innovation, and operational agility. For investors, the lesson is clear: the premium pet food model is not dead, but it requires a more nuanced approach—one that balances quality with accessibility and leverages omnichannel and product diversification to weather volatility.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-09 10:07:17.274037

In 2001, the 9/11 al-Qaida attacks turbocharged interest in surveillance technology.","BEIJING (AP) — The body camera hung from the top of the IV drip, recording the slightest twitch made by Yang Guoliang as he lay bloody and paralyzed in a hospital bed after a police beating with bricks.

By then, surveillance was nothing new for the Yang family in rural China, snared in an intricate network based on U.S. technology that spies on them and predicts what they’ll do.

Their train tickets, hotel bookings, purchases, text messages and phone calls are forwarded to the government. Their house is ringed with more than a dozen cameras. They’ve tried to go to Beijing 20 times in the past few years, but masked men show up and grab them, often before they depart. And last year, Yang’s wife and younger daughter were detained and now face trial for disrupting the work of the Chinese state — a crime carrying a sentence of up to a decade in prison.

Yet the Yangs say they are not criminals. They are simply farmers trying to beg Beijing to stop local officials from seizing their 1 1/2 acres of land in China’s eastern Jiangsu province.

“Every move in my own home is monitored,” Yang said, sitting behind black curtains that block him from the glare of police lights trained straight at his house. “Their surveillance makes me feel unsafe all the time, everywhere.”

Across China, tens of thousands of people tagged as troublemakers like the Yangs are trapped in a digital cage, barred from leaving their province and sometimes even their homes by the world’s largest digital surveillance apparatus. Most of this technology came from companies in a country that has long claimed to support freedoms worldwide: the United States.

Over the past quarter century, American tech companies to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, playing a far greater role in enabling human rights abuses than previously known, an Associated Press investigation found. They sold billions of dollars of technology to the Chinese police, government and surveillance companies, despite repeated warningsfrom the U.S. Congress and in the media that such tools were being used to quash dissent, persecute religious sects and target minorities.

Critically, American surveillance technologies allowed a brutal mass detention campaign in the far west region of Xinjiang — targeting, tracking and grading virtually the entire native Uyghur population to forcibly assimilate and subdue them.

U.S. companies did this by bringing “predictive policing” to China — technology that sucks in and analyzes data to prevent crime, protests, or terror attacks before they happen. Such systems mine a vast array of information — texts, calls, payments, flights, video, DNA swabs, mail deliveries, the internet, even water and power use — to unearth individuals deemed suspicious and predict their behavior. But they also allow Chinese police to threaten friends and family and preemptively detain people for crimes they have not even committed.

For example, the AP found a Chinese defense contractor, Huadi, worked with IBM to design the main policing system known as the “Golden Shield” for Beijing to censor the internet and crack down on alleged terrorists, the Falun Gong religious sect, and even villagers deemed troublesome, according to thousands of pages of classified government blueprints taken out of China by a whistleblower, verified by AP and revealed here for the first time. IBM and other companies that responded said they fully complied with all laws, sanctions and U.S. export controls governing business in China, past and present.

Across China, surveillance systems track blacklisted “key persons,” whose movements are restricted and monitored. In Xinjiang, administrators logged people as high, medium, or low risk, often according to 100-point scores with deductions for factors like growing a beard, being 15 to 55 years old, or just being Uyghur.

Some tech companies even specifically addressed race in their marketing. Dell and a Chinese surveillance firm promoted a “military-grade” AI-powered laptop with “all-race recognition” on Dell's official WeChat account in 2019. And until contacted by AP in August, biotech giant Thermo Fisher Scientific’s website marketed DNA kits to the Chinese police as “designed” for the Chinese population, including “ethnic minorities like Uyghurs and Tibetans.”

While the flood of American technology slowed considerably starting in 2019 after outrage and sanctions over atrocities in Xinjiang, it laid the foundation for China’s surveillance apparatus that Chinese companies have since built on and in some cases replaced. To this day, concerns remain over where technology sold to China will end up.

For example, 20 former U.S. officials and national security experts wrote a letter in late July criticizing a deal for NVIDIA to sell H20 chips used in artificial intelligence to China, with 15% of revenues going to the U.S. government. They said no matter who the chip is sold to, it will fall into the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services.

NVIDIA said it does not make surveillance systems or software, does not work with police in China and has not designed the H20 for police surveillance. NVIDIA posted on its WeChat social media account in 2022 that Chinese surveillance firms Watrix and GEOAI used its chips to train AI patrol drones and systems to identify people by their walk, but told the AP those relationships no longer continue. The White House and Department of Commerce did not respond to requests for comment.

Thermo Fisher and hard drive maker Seagate promoted their products to Chinese police at conferences and trade shows this year, according to online posts. Officers stroll the streets of Beijing with Motorola walkie talkies. NVIDIA and Intel chips remain critical for Chinese policing systems, procurements show. And contracts to maintain existing IBM, Dell, HP, Cisco, Oracle, and Microsoft software and gear remain ubiquitous, often with third parties.

What started in China more than a decade ago could be seen as a cautionary tale for other countries at a time when the use of surveillance technology worldwide is rising sharply, including in the United States. Emboldened by the Trump administration, U.S. tech companies are more powerful than ever, and President Donald Trump has rolled back a Biden-era executive order meant to safeguard civil rights from new surveillance technologies.

As the capacity and sophistication of such technologies has grown, so has their reach. Surveillance technologies now include AI systems that help track and detain migrants in the U.S. and identify people to kill in the Israel-Hamas war. China, in the meantime, has used what it learned from the U.S. to turn itself into a surveillance superpower, selling technologies to countries like Iran and Russia.

The AP investigation was based on tens of thousands of leaked emails and databases from a Chinese surveillance company; tens of thousands of pages of confidential corporate and government documents; public Chinese language marketing material; and thousands of procurements, many provided by ChinaFile, a digital magazine published by the non-profit Asia Society. The AP also drew from dozens of open record requests and interviews with more than 100 current and former Chinese and American engineers, executives, experts, officials, administrators, and police officers.

Though the companies often claim they aren’t responsible for how their products are used, some directly pitched their tech as tools for Chinese police to control citizens, marketing material from IBM, Dell, Cisco, and Seagate show. Their sales pitches — made both publicly and privately — cited Communist Party catchphrases on crushing protest, including “stability maintenance,” “key persons,” and “abnormal gatherings,” and named programs that stifle dissent, such as “Internet Police,” “Sharp Eyes” and the “Golden Shield.”

Other companies, like Intel, NVIDIA, Oracle, Thermo Fisher, Motorola, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Western Digital, creator of mapping software ArcGIS Esri, and what was then Hewlett Packard, or HP, also sold technology or services knowingly to Chinese police or surveillance companies. Four practicing lawyers said sales like those uncovered by AP could potentially go against at least the spirit, if not the letter, of U.S. export laws at the time, which the companies denied.

American technology made up nearly every part of China’s surveillance apparatus, AP found:

MILITARY AND POLICE: In 2009, Chinese defense contractor Huadi worked with IBM to build national intelligence systems, including a counterterrorism system, used by the Chinese military and China’s secret police, the Ministry of State Security. Chinese agents sold IBM’s i2 police surveillance analysis software to the same ministry and to Chinese police, including in Xinjiang, through the 2010s, leaked emails and marketing posts show. IBM said it has no record of its i2 software ever having been sold to the Public Security Bureau in Xinjiang.

SURVEILLANCE: NVIDIA and Intel partnered with China’s three biggest surveillance companies to add AI capabilities to camera systems used for video surveillance across China, including Xinjiang and Tibet, until sanctions were imposed. NVIDIA said in a post dating to 2013 or later that a Chinese police institute used its chips for surveillance technology research.

ETHNIC REPRESSION: IBM, Oracle, HP, and ArcGIS developer Esri sold hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of geographic and mapping software to Chinese police that allows officers to detect when blacklisted Uyghurs, Tibetans or dissidents stray out of provinces or villages. As late as 2019, with detentions in Xinjiang well underway, Dell hosted an industry summit in its capital. Dell and then-subsidiary VMWare sold cloud software and storage devices to police and entities providing data to police in Tibet and Xinjiang, even in 2022 after abuses there became widely known.

IDENTIFICATION: Huadi worked with IBM to construct China’s national fingerprint database; IBM told AP it never sold “fingerprinting-specific product or technology” to the Chinese government “in violation of US law.” HP and VMWare sold technology used for fingerprint comparison by Chinese police, while Intel partnered with a Chinese fingerprinting company to make their devices more effective. IBM, Dell, and VMWare also promoted facial recognition to Chinese police. China’s police and police DNA labs bought IBM, Dell and Microsoft software and equipment to save genetic data on police databases.

CENSORSHIP AND CONTROL: In 2016, Dell boasted on its WeChat account that its services assisted the Chinese internet police in “cracking down on rumormongers.” Seagate said on WeChat in 2022 that it sells hard drives “tailor made” for AI video systems in China for use by police to help them ”control key persons,” despite facing backlash for selling drives in Xinjiang.

“Everything was built on American tech,” said Valentin Weber, a researcher at the German Council on Foreign Relations who studied the use of U.S. tech by Chinese police. “China’s capability was close to zero.”

IBM, Dell, Cisco, Intel, Thermo Fisher and Amazon Web Services all said they adhere to export control policies. Seagate and Western Digital said they adhere to all relevant laws and regulations where they operate.

Oracle, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and tech conglomerate Broadcom, which acquired VMWare and cloud company Pivotal in 2023, did not comment on the record; HP, Motorola and Huadi did not respond, and Esri denied involvement but did not reply to examples. Microsoft told AP it found no evidence that it “knowingly sold technology to the military or police” as part of the “Golden Shield” update.

Some U.S. companies ended contracts in China over rights concerns and after sanctions. For example, IBM said it has prohibited sales to Tibet and Xinjiang police since 2015, and suspended business relations with defense contractor Huadi in 2019.

However, sanctions experts noted that the laws have significant loopholes and often lag behind new developments. For example, a ban on military and policing gear to China after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre does not take into account newer technologies or general-use products that can be applied in policing.

They also noted that the law around export controls is complicated. Raj Bhala, an expert in international trade law at the University of Kansas, said the issues the AP described fell into “the kind of gray area that we put in exams.”

“It would raise concerns about possible inconsistencies, possible violations,” said Bhala, who emphasized he was speaking generally and not about any specific company. “But I really stress ‘possible.’ We need to know more facts.”

While German, Japanese and Korean firms also played a role, American tech firms were by far the biggest suppliers.

The Xinjiang government said in a statement that it uses surveillance technologies to “prevent and combat terrorist and criminal activity,” that it respects citizens’ privacy and legal rights and that it does not target any particular ethnicity. The statement said Western countries also use such technology, calling the U.S. “a true surveillance state.” Other government agencies did not respond to a request for comment, including China’s police and authorities in the Yangs’ province.

This technology still powers the police database that controls the Yangs and other ordinary people. An estimate based on Chinese government statistics found at least 55,000 to 110,000 were put under residential surveillance in the past decade, and vast numbers are restricted from travel in Xinjiang and Tibet. China’s cities, roads and villages are now studded with more cameras than the rest of the world combined, analysts say — one for every two people.

“Because of this technology … we have no freedom at all,” said Yang Guoliang’s elder daughter, Yang Caiying, now in exile in Japan. “At the moment, it’s us Chinese that are suffering the consequences, but sooner or later, Americans and others, too, will lose their freedoms.”

Selling surveillance superpowers

Back when China was emerging from the chaotic violence of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, three in four Chinese were farmers, including the Yangs. They lived in a three-room home of tiles and pounded earth nestled among the lush, humid fields of the Yangtze River delta.

After Chairman Mao Zedong’s death that year, Beijing’s new leaders opened China to the world, and American tech firms like HP and IBM rushed in. But there were hard limits on how much change the government would accept. In 1989, the Tiananmen pro-democracy protests rattled Beijing, which sent tanks and troops to shoot students.

Soon after, Beijing began planning the “Golden Shield,” aimed at digitizing China’s police force.

In 2001, the 9/11 al-Qaida attacks turbocharged interest in surveillance technology. One researcher claimed authorities could have foiled the attack by unearthing connections between hijackers through public information in databases.

American companies cashed in, selling the U.S. billions of dollars in surveillance technologies they said could prevent crime and terror attacks.

They spotted the same sales opportunity in China. Researchers warned surveillance technologies would be “instruments of repression” in the hands of authoritarian states. Yet IBM, Cisco, Oracle, and other American companies clinched orders to supply Beijing’s “Golden Shield.”

“China didn’t have this kind of thing before,” said Wang, a former Chinese police official in Xinjiang who asked to be identified only by last name for fear of retaliation. “These concepts all came from the West.”

Soon, disturbing stories emerged. Chinese police blocked sensitive news, pinpointing dissidents with unnerving precision. They stalked adherents of the Falun Gong sect banned by authorities. Congress demanded explanations from tech companies.

In 2008, documents leaked to the press showed Cisco saw the “Golden Shield” as a sales opportunity, quoting a Chinese official calling the Falun Gong an “evil cult.” A Cisco presentation reviewed by AP from the same year said its products could identify over 90% of Falun Gong material on the web. Followers sued Cisco, which is now petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to throw out the lower court ruling that allowed the lawsuit.

At a human rights conference in February, then-Cisco lawyer Katie Shay said companies had a responsibility to understand how customers might misuse their technology for “surveillance and censorship.”

“A lot of people have suffered at the hands of their government, and I want to acknowledge that pain,” said Shay, who left Cisco in June. “I also will say that Cisco disputes the allegations of Cisco’s involvement.”

Cisco told the AP it is committed to human rights, but the court allegations may “open the floodgates for suits against U.S. corporations merely for legal exports of off-the-shelf goods and services.”

As Cisco was summoned before Congress, IBM partnered with a Chinese defense contractor on Phase Two of China’s “Golden Shield.”

Classified government blueprints obtained by AP show that in 2009, IBM worked with Huadi, the state-owned subsidiary of China’s biggest missile military contractor spun off from China’s Ministry of Defense, to build out predictive policing.

“Consolidate Communist Party rule,” read the Huadi blueprint, which showed the databases would track hundreds of thousands of people online.

In response to AP’s questions, IBM referred to any possible relationship it may have had with Chinese government agencies as “old, stale interactions”:

“ ... If older systems are being abused today — and IBM has no knowledge that they are — the misuse is entirely outside of IBM’s control, was not contemplated by IBM decades ago, and in no way reflects on IBM today.”

Back in 2009, Beijing needed the technology urgently to quash critics bonding online. Among them were the Yangs.

In April that year, local authorities ordered the Yangs and more than 300 other families in their village off their land. Developers coveted their prime lakefront property for “Western-style” apartments and villas, with fountains, football fields and shopping centers.

The Yangs had no idea police were installing systems that could target families like theirs. They just knew their land was being seized — in return for just a unit in a five-floor walk-up, too many stairs for their elderly mother to climb.

The Yangs and other farmers across China filed complaints.

“I discovered the way the government took our land was illegal,” Yang Caiying said. “They cheated us.”

Predict and prevent

In July 2009, three months after the Yang land was seized, riots erupted on the other side of the country in Xinjiang. Gory images of a Uyghur lynched at a toy factory spread online, angry Uyghurs took to the streets, and hundreds were killed.

Once again, American firms pitched their technology as the solution.

The government sent troops and cut Xinjiang’s phone and internet connections. In secret meetings, officials concluded that police had failed to spot the danger signs because they couldn’t identify Uyghurs deemed separatists, terrorists, and religious extremists, three engineers then working for the Xinjiang government told AP.

At the time, Xinjiang police and data systems were already running on American technology including IBM, Cisco, Oracle, and Microsoft, the engineers said, which AP verified by reviewing government contracts. But the databases were unconnected.

So Xinjiang launched an ambitious initiative to fuse data from all available sources, including banks, railways, and phone companies, into a central database. Officials demanded complete information on all suspicious individuals and their relatives going back three generations, according to the engineers, who described specific meetings in which they participated. Two asked to remain anonymous, fearing for their family in China; the third, Nureli Abliz, is now in Germany.

Soon, lucrative contracts went up for bidding. Among those seeking to profit was IBM.

“Prevent problems before they happen,” IBM promised Chinese officials. In an August 2009 pamphlet, IBM cited the Xinjiang riots and said its technology could help the government “ensure urban safety and stability.”

IBM executives fanned out across the country to court Chinese officials. In December 2009, they set up a new “IBM Institute for Electronic Governance Innovation” in Beijing. In 2011, IBM acquired i2, a software program designed to prevent “terrorist threats.” IBM touted i2’s ability to analyze Chinese social media and licensed a Shanghai-based firm called Landasoft to sell it to China’s police, corporate records show.

Chinese police purchased tens of millions of dollars’ worth of products from companies like IBM, Cisco, Oracle, and Microsoft to upgrade the “Golden Shield” policing systems, a leaked accounting ledger acquired by AP from a whistleblower shows.

In the confrontation between the Chinese state and its critics, American technology tipped the scales of power.

In 2011, thieves ransacked the Yangs’ house, hunting for their property deed. They didn’t find it.

Two years later, bald men with tattoos and gold chains smashed down their door, shattered windows and flipped furniture to bully them out of their home anyway. Yang’s mother dropped to the floor in terror. Doctors diagnosed a heart attack, but the Yangs didn’t have money for a pacemaker.

Furious, the Yangs sued local police. In June 2015, a judge ruled their land had been seized illegally. The Yangs celebrated.

But just weeks after the ruling, officers identified human rights lawyers through the “Golden Shield” technology, cuffed hundreds of them and pressed them into police vans across China. One lawyer later recalled how police monitored his messages on human rights in WeChat before they grabbed him, shackled him to a chair, and tortured him.

Overnight, China’s budding rights-defense movement was dealt a fatal blow — and with it, the Yangs’ case. The Yangs were called in and curtly told the judgment was being overturned, their lawsuit dismissed without trial.

“We really had too much faith in the law, you know?” Yang Guoliang said, his hands clenched in fists. “It turned out to be worthless.”

Technologies of terror

In the meantime, Beijing was transforming Xinjiang into the most heavily surveilled place on earth, sweeping around a million people into camps and prisons.

When bombs tore through a train station in Xinjiang’s capital hours after a visit by leader Xi Jinping in 2014, Xi demanded a crackdown.

“He was super angry,” said Abliz, one of the engineers with the Xinjiang government. “They concluded they weren’t surveilling Uyghurs closely enough.”

The next year, in April 2015, Abliz attended a closed-door exposition in Xinjiang. A booth ran by Landasoft, the former IBM partner, caught his eye.

After years as a vendor of IBM’s i2 police surveillance analysis software to Xinjiang police, Landasoft had struck out on its own, touting i2-like software it said could detain extremists before they caused trouble. The similarity was no coincidence: Landasoft’s software was copied from i2, according to leaked emails and records.

“The platform is developed based on i2,” a Landasoft project manager wrote in an email.

It used a proprietary data visualization system developed by i2. The software powered what was called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform, or IJOP, with the authority to trigger arrests.

Abliz went numb.

“I thought then that this was the end of humanity,” he said.

Landasoft did not respond to repeated requests for comment. IBM said it cut ties with Landasoft in 2014 and was not aware of any interaction between Landasoft and the Public Security Bureau in Xinjiang.

In the autumn of 2015, months after the Xinjiang expo, Landasoft signed contracts with Xinjiang police, emails show. Workers installed millions of cameras and wired over 7,000 police outposts, often built just hundreds of meters apart. Nearly 100,000 officers were recruited to pound on doors and collect names, addresses, fingerprints and face-scans.

Though Chinese hardware was favored, foreign software was irreplaceable for its performance and compatibility with China’s American-built systems, engineers told AP. That included server and database software from Oracle and Microsoft and cloud software from VMWare, which Dell acquired in 2016.

In late 2016, the crackdown began. Internal documents, a leaked copy of the Landasoft software and interviews with 16 former Xinjiang police officers, officials and engineers reveal how the system worked.

Landasoft’s software combined data fed into a central police database to compile a dossier on vast swaths of Xinjiang’s population, tagging them with categories like “went on pilgrimage” or “studied abroad.” Administrators then questioned them, computed risk scores and decided who to detain.

Hundreds of thousands of people were tagged “untrustworthy”, leaked messages show. Leaked documents show the IJOP flagged 24,412 people as “suspicious” in just one week in 2017, leading to most being detained.

“They thought it better to grab thousands of innocents than let a single criminal slip free,” Abliz said.

The technology was crude and flawed. Landasoft emails show engineers frantically fixing a software bug to release hundreds of people categorized as high-risk. And surveillance cameras often misidentified people, a former Xinjiang police officer found when he checked their ID cards.

Yet officers were told “computers cannot lie” and that the IJOP’s listed targets were “absolutely correct,” Abliz said. The software’s orders were often obeyed fearfully, unquestioningly.

“The tech companies told the government their software is perfect,” Abliz said. “It’s all a myth.”

Minority report

The all-encompassing surveillance forced total compliance: Officers arrested colleagues, neighbors informed on each other.

In May 2017, Kalbinur Sidik, a teacher now in the Netherlands, was summoned to her district government office in a yellow brick apartment building in Xinjiang’s capital. A young Uyghur woman, fresh from college, rose and introduced herself as a local official. Sidik, the woman explained, was being appointed as the head of her building, responsible for collecting information on neighbors.

“What’s this data going to be used for?” Sidik asked.

The woman looked at a computer, with a Landasoft program running and lists of names and tags: “Goes out at night,” “Overseas phone,” “unemployed.” One button stood out: “Push Alert.”

The woman clicked it, and the screen filled with names. These people, the woman explained, would be detained and interrogated for suspected ties to terrorism. Sidik’s eyes widened.

“I hated her for what she was doing,” Sidik said. “I knew those people would disappear.”

Xinjiang officials issued arrest quotas, Sidik and five other former officers and administrators said. Sidik watched with horror as the number of people who attended her compound’s weekly mandatory flag-raising ceremony shrank, from 400 to just over 100, as residents were arrested.

At the district office, she observed the logos popping up on screens: Oracle, Microsoft, Intel. The AP found evidence of products from all three companies used in Xinjiang’s policing and data systems during the crackdown, along with Esri, Seagate, Western Digital, NVIDIA, Thermo Fisher, and VMWare, then owned by Dell, which advertised cooperation with Xinjiang authorities on its website.

Sidik asked her neighborhood official where it all came from.

“We’ve spent a lot of money to import foreign technology,” she recalls the official telling her.

Among those caught in the digital dragnet was Parida Qabylqai, an ethnic Kazakh pharmacist at a military hospital in Xinjiang.

In February 2018, Qabylqai was flagged by the IJOP for visiting her parents in Kazakhstan. At first, her boss thought it was a mistake.

“You’re a good person, you shouldn’t be listed,” she recalled him saying. Then he checked the IJOP and spotted her name.

“It’s really serious! You’re going to end up in the camps,” he blurted out in shock.

An officer pressed a confession into her hands.

“What did I do wrong?” Qabylqai asked.

“Just sign!” the officer shouted.

Qabylqai was cuffed, hooded, and whisked to a camp, where cameras watched her day and night, even peering at her naked body in the toilet. Guards barking over speakers ordered her not to speak or even to move.

“They did things to us that no human being should ever have to experience,” she said. “But they said my name was listed by the IJOP, so they didn’t need to explain anything.”

Even enforcers of the system weren’t spared.

In 2018, Liu Yuliang, a civil servant in Xinjiang, was ordered to the home of a young police officer in his village. He and dozens of others stood, silent, as the officer embraced his sobbing, pregnant wife.

The officer had forced many people into the camps. Then he himself was flagged for detention.

Too fearful to resist, Liu went along with the arrest, just as the young officer had done before him.

Landasoft software alerted police when flagged people did anything labeled suspicious, like going out at night or logging on the internet repeatedly. Liu was sent to knock on doors, questioning residents whose “eyes filled with fear.”

As police swept Xinjiang, Landasoft purchased software from Pivotal, a cloud company later acquired by Broadcom, emails show. And Landasoft registered accounts on both Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure in 2018, seeking to expand cloud offerings to police clients, emails show.

AWS said Landasoft “consumed very limited cloud services for a brief period” and not for software in the Xinjiang crackdown. Microsoft said Landasoft used Azure services through a self-service portal retired in 2021, and that any Landasoft data was deleted.

The Xinjiang government told the AP: “There is absolutely no such thing as ‘large-scale human rights violations.’”

Liu eventually resigned and returned to his hometown in eastern China, trying to forget what he had seen and done. But he noted with unease the new cameras and checkpoints being installed around his home.

Four days later, state security called and summoned him for questioning. The all-seeing surveillance apparatus had followed him home.

“The Xinjiang model is being copied everywhere, in every city in China,” Liu said.

In 2024, Liu left China, ignoring an airport officer who warned that wherever he went, he would be watched.

“This technology has no emotions,” Liu said. “But in the hands of a government that doesn’t respect the law, it becomes a tool for evil.”

Automated autocracy

The Yangs are still trapped by U.S. technology. IBM, Dell, HP, Cisco, and Seagate servers, switches and drives power police systems targeting them, maintenance contracts dating to this year show. Intel and NVIDIA chips process data. Oracle and VMWare software run the database.

But the harder the Yangs push, the harder the system pushes back.

In February 2023, they went to the National Public Complaints Administration in Beijing with a letter. Two days later, police grabbed them from their hotel and drove them home.

The Yangs persisted, trying to plead their case to Beijing. In the following months, they were seized at bus and train stations, beaten at a hospital and abducted by ambulance.

Last July, Yang’s mother tried again. She carried a letter for Chinese leader Xi Jinping:

“They’re using violence and kidnapping to bar me from petitioning and seeking medical treatment ... We beg you, General Secretary, to save us.”

Outside Beijing’s leadership compound, burly men in black tackled Yang’s mother to the ground. She was jailed for over a month, questioned, strip-searched, force-fed medication and deprived of food and water. In October, she and Yang’s sister disappeared.

The Yangs’ house is now the last left standing. The father lives alone.

His relatives have cut contact, unnerved by the flock of police that tail him. Thousands of pages of documents stashed in drawers, stuffed in bags, and piled in boxes in a bathtub chronicle every step of their 16-year quest for justice.

In April, Yang was sent criminal charges showing how much police had spent to stop the family’s “abnormal petitioning.”

The cost: About $37,000.

Kennedy Jr.

In announcing the switch, the 155-year-old company said it has used many colors derived from natural sources in the majority of its products for many years and that the move away from artificial dyes only affects a few products.

“Our commitment to making great food means we adapt to consumer needs and lead with innovation. People want simpler, recognizable ingredients — and we’re responding,” the company’s announcement says.

The artificial colors currently used in Campbell’s products are all allowable by the Food and Drug Administration and are on the agency’s Food, Drug and Cosmetics (FD&C) approved list. However, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Martin Makary earlier this year asked food companies to stop using several of the dyes that are FDA approved. Companies are responding with voluntary actions.

“We will no longer produce any of our food or beverages with FD&C colors. The transition means that Lance crackers and V8 Splash will use colors derived from natural sources, such as annatto and purple carrot juice concentrate. Our regional Snacks brands such as Jay’s, O-Ke-Doke and Tom’s and cookie brands like Archway and Stella D’oro will also no longer use FD&C colors,” Campbell’s said.

Campbell’s move to natural colors is set to begin sometime between March and August 2026. The existing products will be replaced “as inventory clears.”

“We’ve been actively reviewing our portfolio and tracking the evolving regulatory environment. People are increasingly seeking better-for-you options with simpler, recognizable ingredients. This move reflects both consumer preferences and our commitment to making great food,” Campbell’s said.

In its announcement, the company pointed out that it’s red Goldfish crackers have used colors sourced from plants for more than 15 years. The product is made with a mix of beet juice concentrate and paprika extracted from sweet red peppers. Beginning in 2026 annatto and purple carrots will be used to color products like Lance crackers and V8 splash.

Other companies that have responded to Kennedy’s suggestion include General Mills, Kraft Heinz, PepsiCo, Danone North America, TreeHouse Foods, Conagra Brands, Nestlé USA and Tyson. The companies currently use artificial food dyes that have FDA approval, but are switching to natural dyes.

The FDA currently approves the use of Blue 1, Blue 2, Green 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Citrus Red and Orange B. All are petroleum based and are used in the production of highly processed foods. Kennedy has repeatedly said he wants to reduce the amount of processed food consumers eat — including those colored with artificial dyes — but has not said how he plans to do so.

In the quest to entice food companies to voluntarily stop using artificial dyes, FDA officials have given approval for some natural dyes that have previously been banned. The newest color is gardenia blue. It is extracted from the fruit of the gardenia, a flowering evergreen. The FDA has approved the color additive for use in sports drinks, flavored or enhanced non-carbonated water, fruit drinks and ades, ready-to-drink teas, hard candy and soft candy.

With the approval of the blue coloring, the FDA has now put four food dyes on the approved list. In May the agency gave the OK for three colors derived from natural sources. Those were: galdieria extract blue, a blue colorant derived from the unicellular red algae Galdieria sulphuraria; calcium phosphate, a white powder; and butterfly pea flower extract, a blue color that can be used to achieve a range of shades including bright blues, intense purple, and natural greens.",https://images.bannerbear.com/direct/y0aJ23zRDdqMxX4OGl/requests/000/104/442/937/ZwVbKlDe9Y8AvNJmz8moa3jPM/beb7dfe60b6586e60380c2c12e8ee9e45ea38b3a.png,N,,2025-09-09 01:06:57.757942

That's down from the 60 percent that the apps kept before minimum pay, but it's still significant.
[Minimum pay] hasn't threatened in any way the app delivery business model,"" said Parrot.","The city's first-of-its-kind ""deliverista"" minimum wage is working: previously underpaid gig-workers are taking home more money per hour and delivery app companies are getting more orders than ever.

New data from the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection shows an all-time high of $120.2 million in consumer spending in the first quarter of 2025 — up 13.4 percent from the same period last year. The data reporting was a requirement of the 2021 bill that created the deliverista minimum wage.

And the amount of orders has risen, too — up 4.2 percent over the past four quarters. Economists see this as a sign that minimum pay is not having a negative impact on business.

“Whatever has happened to worker pay has not diminished, literally, the appetite of consumers for food delivery,” said James Parrot, the director of economic and fiscal policies at the Center for New York City Affairs at The New School, who consulted with the city on the original minimum pay law.

Instacart's last ditch efforts

In July, the City Council passed two bills that would expand the minimum pay standard from just restaurant delivery app workers to all contract gig workers in the five boroughs, including those working for grocery giant, Instacart. The laws were meant to close the ""Instacart loophole"" that allowed grocery delivery apps to pay workers less than their restaurant counterparts, even though the job is largely the same.

An all-out campaign against the bills worked on Mayor Adams, who vetoed the bills after originally supporting their intent. But Speaker Adrienne Adams has vowed to override the vetoes at the upcoming stated meeting on Sept. 10, and cited Streetsblog’s coverage in her decision.

Even so, Instacart continues to lobbying against the bills. In a new op-ed in Politics NY that closely mirrors a letter sent to Speaker Adams last week, Instacart’s Chief Corporate Affairs Officer Dani Dudeck argued that “the cost of food deliveries surged 10 percent, tips fell by 68 percent, and fees on restaurants surged 13 percent” during the period covered by the city data.

Focusing on tips ignores the fact that workers are making significantly more money and are therefore less reliant on tips to supplement low wages.

""While tips-per-order fell, what's critical for workers is their total earnings per delivery and that increased by 21 percent,"" said Parrot. ""When the apps more efficiently operate their business to bolster worker productivity, worker pay per hour more than triples, and earnings per hour nearly double.""

The aggregated combined pay was at $21.11 per hour in the first quarter of this year. Before the minimum wage went into effect, that number was as low as $10.87, not including tips.

And highlighting consumer and restaurant fees misses the point, Parrot added.

""It is quite disingenuous for Instacart to say that restaurant fees 'surged' by 13 percent,"" said Parrot. ""The apps would have increased fees even more were it not for the fee cap, and the recent settlement will allow the apps to get their way so they can increase fees more.""

A recently passed Council bill, which was a part of the legal settlement around the minimum pay law, would lift the fee cap for restaurants, meaning the apps would be able to take a cut of up to 43 percent of each order.

The apps charge consumers and merchants a fee, which total $13.24 per order, of which the companies keep 40.5 percent or $5.36. That's down from the 60 percent that the apps kept before minimum pay, but it's still significant.

""It's hard to feel any empathy for the companies at all. They are still taking a huge share of these fees even when they're required to pay the workers. [Minimum pay] hasn't threatened in any way the app delivery business model,"" said Parrot. ""The app delivery experience shows that the apps had considerable leeway to reduce their take per order and Instacart will have that same leeway, probably more so since they are a much more dominant player in the grocery delivery business.""

Flexing flexibility

Instacart has also started recycling the same argument that restaurant apps used before the 2021 bill passed, mainly that a minimum pay rate would result in a decrease in “flexibility.”

“For these New Yorkers, the ability to earn money on their own time and their own terms is not just a preference — it is essential. It allows them to log on to work — and log off — at any moment they choose,” Dudek wrote.

But that's a specious argument; after the minimum wage went into effect, the average hours per worker remained pretty much unchanged.

“That doesn’t suggest any impingement of flexibility at all,” said Parrot. “With the seasonal rebound in orders, the number of workers increased in response to that. The labor force remains flexible in response to changes in consumer demand.”",https://lede-admin.nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2025/09/delivery-cyclists-deliveristas-with-money-0093.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 03:05:03.234311

OpenAI in talks with Indian data centers on Stargate project - ET

OpenAI, the leading AI technology company behind ChatGPT, is in advanced discussions with Indian data centers to establish a 1 gigawatt (GW) facility as part of its $500 billion Stargate initiative. This strategic move, announced earlier this year, aims to bolster OpenAI’s AI capabilities and tap into India’s burgeoning tech ecosystem. The project is a significant expansion of OpenAI’s global infrastructure footprint, aligning with India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act and its $1.2 billion IndiaAI Mission [1].

The planned 1 GW data center in India is expected to reduce latency for local users and address data sovereignty concerns by keeping sensitive information within India’s borders. This move is particularly timely given India’s rapidly digitizing economy and the growing demand for AI capabilities. The country’s unique combination of scale, policy support, and market dynamics makes it an attractive destination for OpenAI, which is already the second-largest market for ChatGPT, with user growth quadrupling in the past year [4].

OpenAI’s partnership with Reliance and UrsaCloud highlights its strategy to leverage India’s renewable energy potential. Reliance’s 3 GW green-powered data center in Jamnagar and its telecom network position it as a strategic ally for global AI firms seeking to localize services. Meanwhile, UrsaCloud’s greenfield projects aim to meet next-generation AI demands. These collaborations underscore OpenAI’s commitment to sustainability and its focus on building resilient infrastructure to support allied nations’ security interests [5].

However, the project faces challenges, including India’s fragmented energy grid and competition from local players. OpenAI is adopting a phased approach to mitigate these risks by registering as a legal entity in India, opening an office in New Delhi, and collaborating with energy providers. The company is also investing in local upskilling programs to foster goodwill and ensure long-term viability [5].

The Indian AI-optimized data center market is projected to grow from $1.2 billion in 2025 to $3.1 billion by 2030, driven by surging demand for cloud computing and AI workloads. The broader AI market could reach $257 billion by 2035, fueled by applications in healthcare, agriculture, and financial services [2]. OpenAI’s entry accelerates this trend, positioning the company to capture a significant share of the market.

For investors, OpenAI’s India venture represents a high-reward bet on a market poised for exponential growth. The Stargate Initiative’s alignment with India’s AI ambitions and its focus on data sovereignty create a defensible moat. However, success hinges on resolving energy and regulatory bottlenecks. The projected $3.1 billion AI-optimized data center market by 2030 and the IndiaAI Mission’s $1.2 billion investment provide a robust tailwind [6].

OpenAI’s Stargate Initiative in India is more than a data center—it’s a strategic pivot to capture a market where AI is reshaping economies and societies. If OpenAI can navigate the operational and competitive challenges, its India venture could become a cornerstone of its global AI dominance, offering returns that mirror the scale of its ambition.

In 2021, Philips launched a recall of DreamStation machines for sleep apnoea, a disorder in which breathing intermittently stops during sleep.

Millions of devices were recalled over concerns that users were at risk of inhaling or swallowing pieces of toxic sound-absorbing foam and fears that it could potentially cause cancer.

The Paris prosecutor's office confirmed to AFP it has received 104 complaints from individuals, two from associations, as well as an alert from France's medical device regulator in connection with the devices, which several hundred thousand French patients used.

Several complaints of involuntary homicide were related to the devices.

The prosecutor's office said an investigation was opened in June into possible fraud and whether the company met its obligations to report incidents that could cause the death of a patient.

The probe follows a preliminary investigation opened in 2023 that collected evidence and analysed documents.

Following additional testing, Philips said the devices posed no health risks. Still, it agreed in 2024 to pay $1.1 billion to settle US lawsuits related to the machines, although it acknowledged no liability.

Aluminum producers in Quebec are diverting more of the metal used to make cans and car parts to Europe as rising U.S. tariffs make their shipments more expensive for American customers.

The U.S. accounted for 78% of Quebec aluminum exports in the second quarter versus 95% in the first quarter, while Europe’s share rose to 18% from 0.2%, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The data are the latest indication of the disruptive impact of tariffs on the flow of goods in North America’s highly integrated market. President Donald Trump first reinstated a 25% tariff on aluminum imports in March, then doubled the levy in June.

Sprawling processing plants owned by Rio Tinto Group, Alcoa Corp. and Aluminerie Alouette mean Quebec represents about 90% of Canada’s aluminum-making capacity, with the U.S. as the province’s natural buyer given the close proximity.

RELATED: Trump Stuns Logistics Industry With Wider Tariffs on Metal

Rio Tinto and Alcoa didn’t immediately respond to requests for shipment data, although Bloomberg reported last month that Rio curbed shipments to the U.S. and instead started buying supplies from rivals and reselling it to American customers since the 50% levy took effect.

Alouette, North America’s largest aluminum smelter which is owned 40% by Rio, confirmed by email that metal being shipped to Europe increased to a 57% from 4% over the same span.

“Shareholders are continuing their efforts to develop new alternatives to mitigate the effects of the current situation and maintain Aluminerie Alouette’s long-term competitiveness,” the company said.

RELATED: Canada Launches $3.6 Billion Fund to Counter Tariff Damage

For Canadian producers, Europe has offered a buffer against the loss-making U.S. market over the summer, Jean Simard, head of the Aluminium Association of Canada, told reporters in Montreal.

“It’s an easy call. You ship anything you can to Europe,” he said. “As the price builds up into the U.S., you can expect metal to come back to the U.S. market.”

Trump’s tariffs have pushed aluminum prices well above global benchmarks. The so-called U.S. Midwest premium — the amount added to global price benchmarks to deliver the metal to that region — jumped 82% since early June.

“The concern is actually that it’s going to be Chinese material being diverted into Europe,” said S&P Global’s nonferrous metals analyst Jason Kaplan. “But in fact, maybe it’s Canadian material.”",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-09/aluminum-1200.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 01:07:07.538988

Bull Case Aerospace Tailwinds: High-margin sales from both aftermarket and OEM commercial and military aerospace segments fuel double-digit organic growth.
Strong Cash Flow: Reliable free cash flow means Parker can keep growing its dividend, buy back shares, and pay down debt.
Secular Automation Growth: Parker benefits as more industries embrace robotics, IIoT, and electrification, locking in durable demand.
But with strong growth drivers in aerospace, automation, and electrification—and the discipline instilled by The Win Strategy™—the long-term outlook stays positive.","Overview

Parker-Hannifin (NYSE: PH) sits comfortably in the Fortune 250, building the essential motion and control systems that help run everything from airplanes and energy grids to trains and HVAC units. The company has two main arms: Diversified Industrial brings in most of the revenue (73% of sales in fiscal 2024), selling things like fluid connectors, precision motion systems, and climate control tech to manufacturers and service shops worldwide. Its Aerospace Systems wing (27% of sales) makes the high-tech hardware behind airplane and defense platforms—think control actuation systems and advanced engine solutions. Parker runs up against serious competition: Eaton, Danaher, Emerson Electric, Honeywell, Rockwell Automation, and Bosch Rexroth all operate in the same space. But Parker stands out for its huge product lineup, well-established distribution network, and over 100 years of trust. The company’s positioned squarely in some of the biggest secular trends around—growth in aerospace aftermarkets, greener electrification, and the steady march of industrial automation.

Recent Performance

Over the past year through early September 2025, Parker-Hannifin has handed investors a 31.4% total return, comfortably outpacing the S&P 500’s 23.9% gain. Four key things fueled this run: big demand for aerospace aftermarket parts (the Aerospace Systems arm posted 19.2% organic sales growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, thanks to healthy orders from Boeing, Airbus, and steady defense spending); margins that keep climbing to record highs, the result of tight cost control and smart operations; a habit of beating earnings estimates for eight straight quarters, which keeps confidence up; and investor-friendly moves like 68 consecutive years of dividend raises and opportunistic share buybacks.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

Parker pulled in $19.9 billion in net sales for fiscal 2024, and is guiding for sales to grow by 2–5% (with organic growth of 1.5–4.5%) by fiscal 2026, powered by ongoing strength in aerospace and steady industrial demand. Long term, the company stands to benefit from industrial automation (a sector expected to reach $256 billion in 2025 and grow by an impressive 9.3% each year through 2034), with tailwinds from rising demand for robotics, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and predictive maintenance tools. Trends in electrification, infrastructure upgrades and solid defense spending should further boost the outlook.

Quality & Moat

Parker has a knack for turning profits into cash. Its current Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is 15.52%—higher than its five-year average of 12.96%, and above the wider market’s 11.13%. Operating margins come in at 22.75%, beating the market’s 18.24%, and free cash flow yield is a strong 3.59% (versus 1.91% for the market). Management’s Win Strategy™ is all about continuous improvement—confirmed at the May 2024 investor day, where they set five-year goals for 27% segment margins and double-digit EPS (Earnings Per Share) growth through fiscal 2029. These targets rest on careful capital allocation and disciplined execution.

Valuation

Parker shares currently trade at an EV/Sales multiple of 4.94×, not only above its own five-year average of 3.47× but also higher than the market's 4.55×—a nod to its market-leading margins and growth prospects. Its forward Price/Earnings ratio sits at 25.3×, just under the S&P 500’s 25.95×, which looks reasonable given Parker’s edge in free cash flow and ROIC.

Market Sentiment

Wall Street likes what it sees: on TipRanks, Parker is rated a 'Strong Buy' by the consensus of 15 analysts heading into Q1 fiscal 2026 results. Targets keep drifting higher. Short interest is low at just 1.4% of shares, with two to three days’ worth of average trading volume to cover—a sign there’s little bearish conviction. News around Parker is mostly upbeat thanks to steady earnings beats and expanding margins. High levels of institutional ownership reflect strong confidence in management and strategy.

Key Risks

Cyclical Demand: Sales and margins could take a hit if industrial capital spending and commercial aerospace cycles cool off during economic slowdowns.

Macroeconomic Slowdown: Sluggish activity in end markets—especially China and Europe—raises the risk that orders for transport and off-highway take a breather.

Supply Chain & Inflation: Rising raw material costs and shipping hiccups could shrink margins if Parker can't fully pass these costs on to customers.

Valuation Reversion: Parker’s premium price tag (EV/Sales) could come down in a hurry if growth or margins disappoint and return closer to historical norms.

Geopolitical & Trade: Things like tariffs, export controls, and changes in defense spending could shake up operations in some of Parker’s key end markets.

Leverage & Volatility: Net debt to EBITDA is 1.63×—higher than the market average—and with a beta of 1.19, Parker shares are more sensitive to big market swings.

Bull Case

Aerospace Tailwinds: High-margin sales from both aftermarket and OEM commercial and military aerospace segments fuel double-digit organic growth.

Margin Expansion: Ongoing operational improvements via The Win Strategy™ are on track to push operating margins close to 27%.

Strong Cash Flow: Reliable free cash flow means Parker can keep growing its dividend, buy back shares, and pay down debt.

Secular Automation Growth: Parker benefits as more industries embrace robotics, IIoT, and electrification, locking in durable demand.

Reasonable Valuation: Current forward P/E is in line with the broader market, despite Parker’s superior ROIC and free cash flow yield.

Analyst Optimism: A consensus 'Strong Buy' rating and recent target upgrades reflect continued bullishness from analysts.

Bear Case

Cyclical Downturn: If the economy cools, a pullback in industrial spending and aerospace orders would likely weigh on Parker’s revenue.

Overextended Multiple: With EV/Sales well above its historical average, Parker risks seeing its valuation slip if growth normalizes.

Rising Rates: Higher interest rates could eat into margins and put pressure on the company’s balance sheet as debt becomes more expensive.

Supply & Cost Pressure: If inflation in commodity and freight costs runs hotter than Parker’s pricing power, margins could suffer.

Competitive Intensity: Heavyweight peers like Eaton, Emerson, and Danaher could snag market share if they ramp up investment or innovation.

Execution Risk: Falling short of the ambitious five-year targets for margins and growth could erode management’s credibility with investors.

On Our Radar

Q1 FY 2026 Earnings: November 6th 2025 (before market open). Consensus EPS is $6.61—investors will be watching for organic growth and margin updates.

Morgan Stanley Conference: September 10th 2025 (1.00pm ET): Expect management to talk near-term strategy and macro outlook.

Defense & Aerospace Orders: Keep an eye on Boeing and Airbus delivery schedules, plus defense contract updates, for signs of momentum in the aerospace segment.

Industrial Automation Events: Events like Automate in Detroit (June 2026) could bring new product reveals or strategic news.

Investment Conclusion

Parker-Hannifin brings together a global reach in motion and control technologies, reliable free cash flow, high returns on invested capital, and a demonstrated ability to grow margins. The premium valuation and sensitivity to economic cycles mean caution is warranted. But with strong growth drivers in aerospace, automation, and electrification—and the discipline instilled by The Win Strategy™—the long-term outlook stays positive. For investors interested in quality cash flow and moderate growth, any pullbacks in the share price could look like a good entry point, provided you keep a close eye on economic signals and how management executes on its five-year plan.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-09-09 02:07:55.133504

Cart Index AI evaluates creative across four key dimensions: attention attraction, message clarity, brand recognition, and trigger power. Users of the platform receive a Cart Index score out of 100, simulated shopper heatmaps, and AI-generated recommendations. The platform is based on shopper research, eye-tracking data, and marketing effectiveness studies.

Sanitarium and Connecting Plots are among the early adopters of the platform. The platform aims to address what is perceived as a costly blind spot in retail media: the lack of creative testing. Retail media in Australia is projected to reach between $2.6 billion and $3 billion by the financial year 2026–27.

Gary Head, the creator of Cart Index AI said, ""Time and again, I’d see two campaigns with similar products and similar media plans deliver vastly different ROI. The missing variable was creative. You can optimise every media metric under the sun, but if the asset that meets the shopper isn’t creatively effective, you’re leaving sales on the table and driving down your ROAS. Cart Index helps fix that.""

Dave Jansen, Executive Creative Director at Connecting Plots added, ""Retail media isn’t just another ad channel, it’s one of the few places left where attention is captive. Shoppers aren’t doom-scrolling; they’re in decision mode, carts open, wallets out. That’s gold. And when the creativity’s good? It doesn’t just ‘show up on shelf.’ It changes behaviour at the shelf. That’s the power of CART Index. We've finally got a shared language between creative and media.""

This is driven by factors such as cloud integration (51 per cent), faster graphics processors (49 per cent), and high-speed network upgrades (45 per cent).

In addition, 62 percent of respondents plan to maximise current infrastructure without new capital spending. This would involve tools such as real-world AI workload emulation, which can help with performance validation, eke efficiency gains and enable faster deployment of next-generation AI clusters.

With the rising infrastructure pressures, 50 per cent of operators surveyed say their biggest challenges when it comes to scaling AI include: budget constraints (59 per cent), infrastructure limitations (55 per cent), and talent shortages (51 per cent).

Another factor impacting AI scalability is network capacity, with 55 per cent of operators deploying 400G technology in their networks. Yet, operators are also showing a growing interest in 1.6T networking, which is still emerging but promises much higher speeds.

At the same time, high-speed networking is on the rise, as the adoption of advanced networking technology is accelerating, with 34 per cent of respondents investigating 800G, 22 per cent testing 1.6T, and 58 per cent considering Ultra Ethernet as a high-performance networking choice.

Keysight, a testing and measurements company, had conducted the survey of the industry leaders globally with research outfit Heavy Reading earlier this year.

Another finding is that real-world workload emulation is critical, according to 95 per cent of respondents. However, many do not have the tools to effectively simulate production-scale AI environments.

The new Techo International Airport (KTI), built to 4F international standards, welcomed its first commercial flight with a symbolic water cannon salute. The inaugural aircraft was operated by the national flag carrier, Air Cambodia, carrying passengers from China.

Designed to handle long-haul intercontinental services, the airport can accommodate some of the world’s largest aircraft, including the Airbus A380-800 and Boeing 747-800.

Located about 20 kilometers south of Phnom Penh, the facility began limited operations ahead of its official inauguration, which is scheduled for October 20 and will be presided over by Hun Manet.

Marking the milestone, the prime minister wrote on Facebook that the airport represents a major step in broadening Cambodia’s global connectivity.

“The aviation sector is one of many ways to connect tourists, businesses, political networks, and multi-purpose missions,” Hun Manet said, noting that aviation remains a critical source of national revenue driven by policies to attract investment, strengthen diplomacy, and promote new destinations.

He added that Cambodia has steadily upgraded its airports to meet growing demand, enhancing access for international travelers.

Phase 1 of the Techo International Airport is expected to serve up to 13 million passengers annually. Phase 2 will add a parallel runway, boosting capacity to 30 million passengers a year.

Officials said that once Phase 2 is completed, the civil aviation authority and project partners will study long-term passenger growth to determine whether a third phase is needed by 2050.

The airport’s construction involved companies from six countries: China, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Singapore, and South Korea. The project was spearheaded by the Overseas Cambodian Investment Corporation (OCIC), which broke ground in 2018.

The new airport also marks the permanent closure of Phnom Penh International Airport, which had served the capital for 66 years since 1955.

According to the Ministry of Tourism, Cambodia could receive as many as 8 million international visitors annually by 2028, highlighting the urgency of modernizing aviation infrastructure.

According to the poll, only 54% of people support capitalism, which is down from 60% in 2021. When asked about their attitudes toward socialism, Americans feel more negative (57%) than positive (39%) about it.

Data for the Gallup poll is based on telephone interviews performed by ReconMR Aug. 1-20 with a sample of 1,094 people 18 years old or older living in the U.S. and Washington, D.C.

Americans' views of big business continue to drop

Dig deeper:

Americans were asked their opinions on free enterprise, big business, and small business in addition to capitalism and socialism. And the poll found that Americans are extremely positive toward small business (95%) and free enterprise (81%). However, they are more negative toward big business, with 37% rating it positively and 62% negatively.

And among political parties, approximately 60% of Republicans, 36% of independents and 17% of Democrats rate big business positively, the poll noted.

Political parties view capitalism less positively

Big picture view:

Democrats and independents view capitalism less positively this year. Less than half of Democrats (42%) view capitalism positively, while a slight majority of independents (51%) still do. Republicans’ views are essentially unchanged, with three-quarters holding a positive opinion.

Separately, Democrats are the only political group of the three that views socialism more positively than capitalism — 66% to 42%, respectively. Independents are modestly more pro-capitalism than pro-socialism (51% vs. 38%), while Republicans are overwhelmingly so (74% vs. 14%).",https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2025/09/1280/720/cleaners.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-09-09 09:13:16.631042

While the official rationale for the delisting remains opaque, indirect clues suggest a confluence of credit rating dynamics, strategic corporate realignments, and evolving global production strategies. These factors collectively underscore a broader transformation in the industrial sector, with long-term consequences for investors.

Credit Ratings and Index Rebalancing

S&P Global BMI indices are designed to reflect the performance of large, liquid stocks, often weighted by market capitalization and financial stability. According to a report by S&P Global Ratings, DBRS Morningstar confirmed General Motors at a BBB (high) rating with stable trends, a classification that, while still investment-grade, may signal a relative decline in creditworthiness compared to peers [2]. Index providers frequently adjust constituents based on such metrics, and GM’s downgrade could have triggered its exclusion. This highlights a critical risk for industrial stocks: even marginal shifts in credit ratings can alter index inclusion, affecting institutional investment flows and liquidity.

Strategic Collaborations and Supply Chain Resilience

General Motors’ partnership with Hyundai to co-develop vehicles for global markets illustrates a broader trend of automakers prioritizing cost-sharing and supply chain flexibility [1]. This collaboration includes hybrid and internal combustion engine models tailored to diverse regions, reflecting a strategic pivot toward localized production. However, such alliances also expose vulnerabilities. For instance, South Korean battery manufacturers face challenges as automakers like Hyundai increasingly source cells from Chinese suppliers, a shift driven by cost efficiency but potentially destabilizing domestic supply chains [1]. This dynamic suggests that industrial supply chain stocks—particularly those reliant on niche markets—may face margin pressures as global production becomes more centralized.

Long-Term Implications for Investors

The removal of a major automaker from a global index signals a recalibration of risk perceptions in the industrial sector. For investors, this underscores the importance of monitoring credit ratings and strategic partnerships as leading indicators of stock performance. Additionally, the growing reliance on cross-border supply chains—exemplified by GM’s and Hyundai’s strategies—points to a structural shift toward cost optimization over regional self-sufficiency. This could benefit low-cost producers but disadvantage firms with higher operational costs, creating a bifurcation in the industrial stock landscape.

Conclusion

General Motors’ exit from the S&P Global BMI Index is a microcosm of larger forces reshaping the industrial sector. As credit ratings influence index composition and strategic collaborations redefine supply chain architectures, investors must adopt a nuanced approach. The long-term health of industrial supply chain stocks will depend not only on immediate financial metrics but also on their ability to adapt to a globalized, cost-conscious production environment.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-09 01:07:10.455440

For workers and businesses in 2025, everything comes back to the post-pandemic rise of hybrid work and the AI juggernaut.

In 2025, more than 80% of Australian workers expect hybrid work, while 65% believe the hybrid model improves work/life balance and 41% cite increased wellbeing. And, for AI, studies predict the tech could add US$4.4 trillion to productivity and raise Australian GDP by 0.17% over the next decade.

When it comes to hybrid work and the future of productivity, AI technology is going to be indispensable. “AI infused devices help us shift towards the future of work by not just reimagining new workflows but also super-charging our existing workflows,” says Aman Sangar, category manager at HP. “Hybrid work specifically by its very nature necessitates the frictionless transition between workplaces, technology and multimodal I/O for all of which AI is primed.”

As businesses settle into hybrid work and ramp up AI use, there’s no time like the present for Australian SMEs to make sure they’re set up for the future.

What if your laptop worked as smart as you do? Meet the HP EliteBook X G1a—AI-powered, ultra-secure, and built for the hybrid executive. Powered by AMD Ryzen™ AI 7 PRO, it’s not just a device. It’s your next best hire.

The need for speed (and increased productivity)

Australia’s productivity has stagnated over the past decade, prompting considerable concern. One reason AI-powered technology is set to be a powerful asset going forward is that it’s designed for speed and increased productivity – particularly for remote and hybrid work.

The idea is clear for workers, according to the 2024 HP Work Relationship Index, with 73% reporting that AI ‘makes their jobs easier’, and 60% suggesting that AI ‘plays a key role in improving their work-life balance’.

“AI tools that enhance productivity and support hybrid work perform best on modern hardware,” says Sangar. Devices like HP’s EliteBook X G1a are built to run AI assistants such as HP AI Companion and Microsoft Copilot, offering productivity gains that complement human expertise rather than replace it.

“HP AI Companion is particularly exciting because it actively learns how you work and optimises your laptop’s performance behind the scenes,” says Sangar. “With that, you’re working on a finely tuned device, even if you’re constantly switching between locations. Plus, it quickly analyses your files, extracting insights in seconds, which genuinely saves hours each week.”

Safe and secure

Outside of the firewall of the office, security is a different ballgame and it means businesses are increasingly vulnerable. According to HP’s 2024 Threat Insights research, 71% of IT and security decision-makers reported that the rise in remote work has ‘made managing platform security more difficult’. By harnessing AI, Sangar says businesses can help mitigate the threat.

“AI-powered devices have become essential to improving security through intelligent, proactive measures,” Sangar says. “Not only has the hybrid work environment introduced additional threat vectors such as visual hacking but now we also must contend with AI threat vectors that are growing in sophistication and scale.”

So what should business leaders and future workers be looking for in terms of security features?

According to Sangar, tools like AI-driven biometric authentication, AI-powered onlooker detection (which are part of HP’s Wolf Security suite), and the use of AI algorithms to “detect and neutralise cyber threats in real-time” are going to be vital for working outside traditional office security. For example, AMD Ryzen™ AI PRO processors feature multi-layered security, like AMD Memory Guard (to safeguard sensitive business data if the PC is lost or stolen​) and the dedicated on-chip security of AMD Secure Processor.

Better work now, and into the future

AI and hybrid work are not just tools for today; they are an investment in the future. As hybrid work becomes the new normal and AI integrates with existing technologies, businesses need to be future-ready with technology equipped for the rigours of remote, AI-powered work.

“Businesses and individuals should seek AI tools that simplify workflows, ensuring robust security, automating routine tasks, and adapting to user needs,” says Sangar. “All our next-gen devices, including the EliteBook X G1a, tap into our OneHP approach, integrating hardware, software, and security to deliver agility, security, and efficiency to excel in a constantly evolving professional landscape”.

HP’s AMD PCs tick all these boxes, boosting productivity, enabling greater speed and efficiency, using AI-enhanced conference tools, and boasting the protection of full-stack security. Devices like the HP EliteBook X G1a are powered by AMD Ryzen™ AI PRO processors (including the AI 7 PRO 360) that harness an NPU (Neural Processing Unit) with up to 55 TOPS (trillions of operations per second) for superior AI speed no matter how heavy the workload.

Hybrid work is going nowhere, making it more important than ever for businesses to harness the latest AI-powered technology to facilitate the working model in a way that’s safe, secure and always innovative.",https://www.smartcompany.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/HP-article-1-1680x945-1.png,N,,2025-09-09 00:04:57.361033

ANZ created CART Index: an AI platform built specifically to test and optimise retail media and shopper creative before it hits the market.
“Retail media isn’t just another ad channel, it’s one of the few places left where attention is captive.
Unlike traditional pre-testing methods, which are slow and expensive, CART Index delivers evidence-based feedback in minutes.","Creative is the single biggest driver of campaign ROI, accounting for up to 70% of performance, according to Analytic Partners. Yet fewer than half of marketers test creative and in retail media, testing is almost non-existent. With retail media forecast to reach $2.6–3B in Australia by 2026–27, that blind spot is especially costly.

That’s why Gary Head, former General Manager of Omnichannel at Mars United Commerce ANZ (Publicis Groupe) and Company Secretary of industry body Shop! ANZ created CART Index: an AI platform built specifically to test and optimise retail media and shopper creative before it hits the market.

Head helped grow XPO Brands from a three-person start-up into one of ANZ’s most awarded independents. Following its acquisition by The Mars Agency, Head became Executive Creative and Strategy Director and later General Manager. In that role, he led award-winning omnichannel campaigns and spearheaded the global rebrand to Mars United Commerce ahead of its Publicis Groupe acquisition in 2024.

A 2025 TripleLift study found 82% of marketers say high-quality creative is essential to campaign success, yet more than a third admit they struggle to consistently deliver it.

“Time and again, I’d see two campaigns with similar products and similar media plans deliver vastly different ROI,” says Head. “The missing variable was creative. You can optimise every media metric under the sun, but if the asset that meets the shopper isn’t creatively effective, you’re leaving sales on the table and driving down your ROAS. CART Index helps fix that.”

The platform evaluates creative across four shopper-centric dimensions: attention attraction, message clarity, brand recognition, and trigger power. Marketers upload an asset and receive a CART Index score out of 100, simulated shopper heatmaps, and AI-generated recommendations to strengthen clarity, branding, and calls-to-action.

Early adopters are already putting the platform to work. Sanitarium, maker of Weet-Bix, UP&GO and So Good, is testing and refining creative across Australia and New Zealand, while creative agencies such as Connecting Plots are also using CART Index to review and optimise campaign assets.

“Retail media isn’t just another ad channel, it’s one of the few places left where attention is captive. Shoppers aren’t doom-scrolling; they’re in decision mode, carts open, wallets out. That’s gold. And when the creativity’s good? It doesn’t just ‘show up on shelf.’ It changes behaviour at the shelf. That’s the power of CART Index. We’ve finally got a shared language between creative and media,” said Dave Jansen, Executive Creative Director at Connecting Plots.

Unlike traditional pre-testing methods, which are slow and expensive, CART Index delivers evidence-based feedback in minutes.

“Having CART Index as a third-party validation tool takes all the subjectivity out of creative and provides a clear rationale to defend and optimise our shopper centric execution,” said Helen Vacher, Snr Shopper Marketing Manager at Sanitarium.",https://campaignbrief.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CART-Index_Banner-Gary-Head.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 23:06:51.035676

Medtronic, a global leader in medical devices, has positioned itself at the forefront of this transformation by leveraging cutting-edge innovation, expanding market access, and aligning with long-term growth drivers. This analysis explores how Medtronic is capitalizing on these trends to solidify its strategic advantage.

Innovation as a Core Growth Engine

Medtronic’s investment in R&D—though not quantified explicitly for 2023–2025—has yielded transformative products that redefine patient care. The company’s MiniMed 780G insulin pump and Guardian 4 continuous glucose monitoring system, approved by the FDA in 2023, exemplify its leadership in wearable diabetes management [3]. These devices integrate advanced sensor technology and AI-driven predictive analytics, eliminating the need for manual calibrations and improving outcomes for patients with diabetes [2].

Beyond diabetes, Medtronic has pioneered AI-powered solutions in cardiology and gastroenterology. The LINQ™ II insertable cardiac monitor uses AI algorithms to enhance arrhythmia detection accuracy, while the GI Genius™ endoscopy module employs computer vision to identify colorectal polyps in real time [2]. Such innovations not only address unmet clinical needs but also align with the broader industry shift toward value-based care, where precision and efficiency are paramount.

Market Expansion: Portable Devices and Telehealth Integration

The portable patient monitoring system market, valued at $11.23 billion in 2024, is projected to grow significantly by 2031, with Medtronic as a key player [1]. The company’s focus on home healthcare and telehealth platforms has accelerated adoption of its portable devices, which enable continuous monitoring and data sharing between patients and providers. For instance, Medtronic’s Aurora Extravascular (EV)-ICD and Affera Mapping and Ablation System are designed for seamless integration with remote care models, supporting the “hospital-at-home” paradigm [3].

Strategic partnerships further bolster Medtronic’s market access. In 2025, the company partnered with Brainomix to distribute AI-driven stroke diagnostic software alongside its neurovascular devices, enhancing its offerings in acute care [2]. These collaborations underscore Medtronic’s ability to adapt to regulatory and interoperability challenges while expanding its footprint in high-growth regions.

Financial Resilience and Long-Term Guidance

Medtronic’s Q3 fiscal 2025 results highlight its financial resilience: revenue reached $8.292 billion, with organic growth of 4.1%, driven by robust demand for Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) systems and neuromodulation therapies [1]. While R&D spending figures remain undisclosed, the company’s leadership has emphasized long-term returns from investments in high-growth areas like cardiac ablation and AI-enhanced surgical robotics [1].

The company reiterated its FY25 guidance, projecting organic revenue growth of 4.75% to 5%, reflecting confidence in its innovation pipeline and market positioning [1]. This stability is critical in an industry where reimbursement pressures and high initial costs often hinder adoption of new technologies. Medtronic’s focus on cost-effective, user-friendly devices—such as its Hugo RAS surgical robot—addresses these challenges while catering to the rising demand for minimally invasive procedures [2].

Long-Term Growth Drivers: AI and Chronic Disease Management

The wearable medical device market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 25.53% from 2025 to 2030, driven by AI-powered diagnostics and chronic disease prevalence [2]. Medtronic’s portfolio, including its Guardian 4 sensor and LINQ™ II monitor, is well-aligned with this trajectory. By integrating AI into its devices, Medtronic not only improves diagnostic accuracy but also reduces healthcare costs through early intervention and reduced hospital readmissions [1].

Conclusion: A Strong Strategic Position

Medtronic’s strategic investments in AI, portable monitoring systems, and telehealth integration position it as a dominant force in the evolving medical device landscape. By addressing post-pandemic shifts toward remote care and chronic disease management, the company is not only capturing market share but also driving systemic improvements in healthcare delivery. While explicit R&D figures remain absent, its product pipeline and financial performance underscore a commitment to innovation that aligns with long-term growth. For investors, Medtronic represents a compelling opportunity to capitalize on the convergence of technology and healthcare in the 2020s.

For this current fiscal year, SAIC now sees a range of $680 million-to-$690 million in adjusted EBITDA versus the prior range of $715 million-to-$735 million.","Science Applications International Corp. has been transparent about its ongoing strategic pivots and efforts to reinvigorate organic growth, but the company is also finding today’s environment more challenging to navigate than it previously thought.

Agencies were slower to obligate funds against active contracts and ramp up new programs, while award delays also remained a fact of life during SAIC’s fiscal second quarter. The continued scrutiny on government spending and federal workforce numbers also are overhangs on the industry.

Against that backdrop, SAIC lowered its fiscal year 2026 revenue guidance to $7.25 billion-to-$7.325 billion from the prior $7.6 billion-to-$7.75 billion range. That signals expectations of a 2%-to-3% organic decline.

The company also cut its fiscal 2027 sales goal to $7.30 billion-to-$7.50 billion from the previous $7.95 billion-to-$8.1 billion range.

During SAIC’s second quarter earnings call with investors Thursday, chief executive Toni Townes-Whitley said the company expects to see a more settled landscape in its 2027 fiscal year that starts on Feb. 1.

But choppy waters seem to remain the norm in the meantime, as SAIC is seeking to tell everyone in its new top-line guidance ranges. Fiscal 2026 revenue expectations are 5% lower than previously anticipated with the fiscal 2027 goal now down 7.5%.

“We have all acknowledged the volatility in the market over the last few quarters with changes of fundamental reduction in the government personnel, and I would say a disproportionate impact on government acquisition personnel, which is the channel to the private sector,” Townes-Whitley told analysts.

“We are all are trying to react to this new environment, and delay does not mean that we don't expect things to normalize over time,” she added.

It is worth pointing out that SAIC unveiled its current blueprint for growth in April 2024, about eight months before the Trump administration began. The blueprint’s emphasis on integrating more commercial technology into federal environments also is a theme that industry and government customers have talked about over multiple years.

SAIC and other GovCon companies have had to accelerate some elements of their strategies here in the first eight months of the Trump administration, which has highlighted speed and efficiency of government as major initiatives.

Within SAIC’s context specifically, Townes-Whitley talked about the company's venture capital arm for investing in startups and partnerships with other companies not traditionally thought of as defense contractors as two examples of acceleration.

Reston, Virginia-headquartered SAIC has also pushed toward more of an enterprise operating model since Townes-Whitley joined as CEO in the fall of 2023.

A former Microsoft executive, Townes-Whitley brought over a former colleague of hers in Tim Turitto to lead the work on that front as executive vice president of enterprise operations.

SAIC announced Monday its promotion of 20-year company veteran Bob Ritchie to chief growth officer, a role that reports to Turitto and seeks to unite business development functions with the company’s technology office he previously led.

As SAIC’s chief technology officer since 2022, Ritchie oversaw collaborations with the business groups and innovation office. Ritchie will now oversee efforts to ramp up how SAIC’s various teams in innovation, tech and business development work together in his expanded duties.

For the ecosystem at-large, Townes-Whitley views efforts to reform government acquisition and rewrite the rules for it as “positive for many parts of our market as well.”

She is alluding to the Federal Acquisition Regulation overhaul effort called FAR 2.0, which will be another sign of the market settling after the new rules for doing business with the government are finalized.

But for now, bridging the current environment and keeping its eye on the ball seems to be SAIC’s approach for operating in the short-term and in setting other targets for its future.

“I would argue that as we move into the second horizon of this strategy, we actually will be lined up with where supply and demand should hopefully intersect in what we built and what the government is asking for,” Townes-Whitley said.

Fiscal second quarter revenue of $1.8 billion was approximately 3% lower than the prior year period, while profit of $185 million showed a 9% increase in adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, appreciation and amortization).

SAIC also adjusted its bottom-line outlooks for this current fiscal year and the next one, like it did with the revenue guidance revisions.

For this current fiscal year, SAIC now sees a range of $680 million-to-$690 million in adjusted EBITDA versus the prior range of $715 million-to-$735 million. That indicates a margin of 9.3%-to-9.5% versus the prior 9.4%-to-9.6% outlook.

The greatest value of a full-funnel retail media strategy lies in its ability to deliver consistent messaging across the customer experience—an advantage cited by 61% of marketers, according to Skai’s 2025 The State of Retail Media Report.
Ideally, marketers should stop viewing in-store retail media as influencing behavior during just one visit, said Chernofsky.","Retail media networks rely on driving conversions—and Walmart is no exception. Its search results are saturated with ads, with 97% of queries serving at least one sponsored product, per Pentaleap data.

But Walmart is also growing its upper-funnel capabilities, using its stores to do it despite physical retail’s traditional role as a bottom-of-the-funnel channel.

“When we think about the store, we’ve always thought about it from this pure sales perspective,” said Ethan Chernofsky during EMARKETER’s virtual summit earlier this year. But the “pure marketing value of the eyeballs that pass a physical location” is extremely valuable for marketers.

Bringing digital discovery into the aisle

In April, Walmart announced the opening of its newest Supercenter in Cypress, Texas.

In addition to a refreshed look and feel, the store features digital QR codes throughout the store that customers can use to access digital tools and an extended online assortment.

Shoppers at the Cypress location can use the Walmart App for store services like TV mounting, registry enhancement, or tire installation.

The approach reflects changing shopper behavior—28% of US adults use their phone to research products in-store, according to June 2025 data from SPAR Group.

The most common actions are price checks (44%) and hunting for promos (41%), but nearly a third (30%) access retailer apps, and over one in five (22%) scan QR codes.

Bridging marketplace and store shelves

Walmart has also begun bringing items from its digital third-party marketplace to store aisles, giving shoppers a wider array of goods and enabling third-party sellers to widen their reach.

Walmart’s US marketplace sales grew 20% in its latest quarter, according to the company’s earnings report.

The marketplace surpassed 200,000 active sellers for the first time this year, according to data from Marketplace Pulse.

The greatest value of a full-funnel retail media strategy lies in its ability to deliver consistent messaging across the customer experience—an advantage cited by 61% of marketers, according to Skai’s 2025 The State of Retail Media Report.

Marketers also value the ability to shape consumer decisions at every stage of the journey (59%) and enable more informed, data-driven choices throughout the funnel (58%).

Ideally, marketers should stop viewing in-store retail media as influencing behavior during just one visit, said Chernofsky.

As the global coffee and foodservice markets evolve, Pret’s trajectory under JAB’s ownership offers critical insights into how corporate governance frameworks shape risk management, innovation, and long-term value creation.

Corporate Governance: A Foundation for Strategic Clarity

Jab Holding’s governance model, led by Co-CEOs Joachim Creus and Frank Engelen, emphasizes centralized oversight across its portfolio, with distinct segments for consumer, insurance, and long-term investments [1]. For Pret A Manger, this structure has translated into a board reshuffle in 2023-2025, including the appointment of José Cil as Chairman in May 2025 [2]. Such leadership changes underscore JAB’s focus on aligning governance with international expansion goals. The company’s 2024 proxy statements reveal a board composition that balances executive expertise with non-executive oversight, a hallmark of JAB’s broader governance principles [3].

This governance framework has enabled Pret to pivot strategically. For instance, the shift toward dine-in-centric store formats in the UK, launched in 2024, reflects a calculated response to hybrid work trends and changing consumer preferences [4]. By embedding governance decisions within JAB’s risk-averse culture, Pret has navigated macroeconomic uncertainties while maintaining operational discipline.

Risk Management: Balancing Expansion and Stability

Pret’s risk profile under JAB has been shaped by dual imperatives: scaling global operations and mitigating exposure to volatile markets. According to a report by Martini.ai, Pret’s credit rating improved from B3 to B2 in late 2024, with default probability dropping below 1.8%—a testament to its financial resilience [5]. This stability, however, coexists with strategic risks. For example, the brand’s expansion into Saudi Arabia and India via franchise models aims to reduce “liability of foreignness” but introduces dependencies on local partners and regulatory environments [6].

JAB’s influence is evident in Pret’s adaptive strategies. The introduction of Pret Express self-service machines and partnerships with Reliance in India diversify revenue streams while reducing labor costs [7]. Such innovations align with JAB’s emphasis on operational efficiency, as outlined in JDE Peet’s 2022 Annual Report, which highlights risk mitigation through technology and stakeholder engagement [8].

Ownership Dynamics and Capital Strategy

While JAB maintains full ownership of Pret, whispers of an IPO or stake sale in 2024-2025 suggest potential shifts in capital structure [9]. These moves could unlock liquidity for further expansion or refocus JAB’s portfolio. However, the absence of detailed disclosures on Pret’s annual reports complicates precise risk assessment. Investors must weigh JAB’s track record in managing exits—such as its 2024 acquisition of JDE Peet’s—against Pret’s evolving market position [10].

The volatility in Pret’s credit profile between late 2024 and early 2025, with default probabilities fluctuating between 1.6% and 2.3%, highlights the challenges of scaling new formats [5]. Yet, JAB’s governance framework, which prioritizes long-term value over short-term gains, appears to buffer against such turbulence.

Future Growth: Navigating Uncertainties

Pret’s future hinges on its ability to replicate its UK success in emerging markets. The brand’s global sales surpassing £1 billion in 2025, driven by international partnerships, signal robust growth [7]. However, risks such as currency fluctuations, political instability, and labor training challenges remain [6]. JAB’s governance model, which integrates stakeholder engagement and environmental responsibility into decision-making, provides a template for sustainable scaling [8].

Conclusion

Jab Holding’s strategic influence on Pret A Manger exemplifies how rigorous corporate governance can drive innovation and risk mitigation in a competitive sector. While ownership dynamics and capital strategies remain opaque, the brand’s financial resilience and adaptive governance structure position it as a compelling long-term investment. Investors, however, must remain vigilant to the inherent risks of rapid internationalization—a challenge JAB’s governance framework appears well-equipped to address.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-09 01:06:53.014583

Conclusion: A Calculated Bet on Premium Pricing The shift to full-priced strategies in US apparel retail is neither a universal panacea nor a guaranteed failure.
In this new paradigm, the most compelling investments will be those that align premium pricing with purpose: profitability without compromise.","The US apparel retail sector is undergoing a seismic shift as brands pivot toward full-priced strategies in response to post-tariff economic conditions and evolving consumer behaviors. This transition, driven by the need to balance profitability with market relevance, raises critical questions for investors: Can premium pricing sustain long-term growth in a climate of rising costs and cautious consumer spending? And how do sustainability and technological innovation factor into this new paradigm?

Market Dynamics: Profitability Over Price-Taking

The 2025 Consumer Products Industry Outlook highlights a sector-wide pivot toward “profitable volume” as brands abandon traditional discounting models [1]. Tariffs and supply chain disruptions have eroded pricing power, forcing retailers to modernize demand-generation strategies. Digital tools, such as 3DLOOK’s virtual fitting platform YourFit, are now central to reducing return rates and enhancing the online shopping experience [2]. Meanwhile, mobile transactions dominate fashion e-commerce, with 64% of sales occurring on mobile devices—a trend underscoring the necessity of tech-driven retail adaptations [2].

However, profitability hinges on segmenting consumers. Affluent shoppers, who earn over $100,000 annually, have shown resilience to price hikes, as seen in Levi Strauss’s 2025 strategy to raise prices on select products without demand erosion [3]. Conversely, brands targeting price-sensitive demographics, like Under Armour and Tapestry, face steeper challenges. Under Armour’s Q1 2025 earnings shortfall—attributed to tariff-driven costs and soft demand—illustrates the risks of rigid full-price models in less elastic markets [1].

Financial Performance: Winners and Losers

Data from Yahoo Finance reveals a mixed landscape. While Levi Strauss and Aritzia have navigated price increases successfully, others, such as Target and Abercrombie & Fitch, report significant tariff-related margin pressures [1]. For instance, Tapestry anticipates a $160 million tariff impact in 2025, equivalent to a 0.67% margin headwind [1]. Department stores like Macy’s and Nordstrom have incrementally raised apparel prices by 1.9% and footwear prices by 4.2%, reflecting broader industry adjustments [4].

Long-term projections, however, remain cautiously optimistic. The global apparel market is forecasted to grow at a 2.11% CAGR through 2028, reaching $365.70 billion by 2025 [3]. Yet, this growth is tempered by macroeconomic headwinds. The Yale Budget Lab estimates that 2025 tariffs could shrink the US economy by 0.4%, indirectly curbing consumer spending [1].

Challenges and Risks

The sustainability of full-priced strategies depends on mitigating three key risks:

1. Consumer Price Sensitivity: Tariff-induced price hikes have already pushed apparel prices 18% higher in the short term, with long-term increases projected at 17% [1]. While affluent consumers absorb these costs, broader market segments may retreat to private-label or secondhand alternatives.

2. Supply Chain Volatility: Tariff uncertainties and geopolitical tensions continue to inflate operational costs. Retailers like Target have reported sales declines tied to both trade policies and brand perception shifts, such as backlash against DEI policy rollbacks [1].

3. Regulatory Shifts: The closure of the de minimis tariff loophole in May 2025 has reshaped global sourcing, while state-level sustainability regulations may force brands to adopt costly transparency measures [1].

Future Outlook: Sustainability and Innovation as Differentiators

Investors must weigh the role of sustainability in long-term viability. A 2025 ComplianceCart report notes that US consumers are willing to pay 12% more for sustainable products, signaling a shift toward ethical consumption [1]. Brands leveraging circular fashion practices—such as digital IDs for traceability and on-demand manufacturing—are better positioned to meet these expectations while minimizing waste [4].

Technological innovation also offers a pathway forward. Retailers using AI-driven consumer-tracking tools to adjust promotions dynamically, as seen with Ralph Lauren and Under Armour, demonstrate how data analytics can optimize pricing without alienating customers [3].

Conclusion: A Calculated Bet on Premium Pricing

The shift to full-priced strategies in US apparel retail is neither a universal panacea nor a guaranteed failure. For premium brands with loyal, affluent customer bases and robust digital infrastructures, the model offers a viable path to profitability. However, success requires balancing price resilience with sustainability, supply chain agility, and consumer-centric innovation. Investors should prioritize brands that integrate these elements—such as Levi Strauss’s targeted price hikes or 3DLOOK’s virtual solutions—while remaining wary of those overexposed to price-sensitive markets or regulatory risks.

In this new paradigm, the most compelling investments will be those that align premium pricing with purpose: profitability without compromise.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A handful of apparel retailers including Levi Strauss are teasing more full-priced products, testing how much wealthier shoppers are willing to pay despite the sobering effect of tariffs.

They have not been disappointed so far.

Levi's raised prices on some products in July but saw no slowdown in demand, the denim maker's chief financial officer, Harmit Singh, said at the Goldman Sachs Global Retailing Conference in New York on Wednesday.

""We are making a full-court press in selling higher full-price sales than we have done in the past,"" he said. ""The Levi's consumer largely earns $100,000 and over. And that consumer we are seeing is generally resilient.""

Ralph Lauren RL.N, Under Armour UAA.N and Abercrombie & Fitch ANF.N are also leaning into a more full-price strategy, they said, in recent earnings disclosures.

While lower-income households are hunting for bargains as U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war has forced companies to raise prices, wealthier consumers are buying steadily, largely unaffected by the cooling labor market.

Stock market gains and low credit card debt have bolstered the finances of the affluent. According to Moody's Analytics, the richest 10% of Americans - those earning at least $250,000 a year - now account for half of all consumer spending.

""We've been shifting our business towards a more elevated full-price consumer base, and this has served us well as our core consumer around the world remains resilient,"" Ralph Lauren CEO Patrice Louvet said in early August.

Under Armour's CEO Kevin Plank said in August the company was considering bumping up prices for the ""embedded consumer who we do have pricing power with,"" referring to loyal customers. ""We're seeing success testing new key items at full price, including our $45 Self-form hat and our heat gear collection are both strong examples.""

And if that strategy doesn't work, better consumer-tracking technology now allows retailers to pivot quickly and offer targeted promotions, helping them generate higher profit margins, said Kate McShane, managing director at Goldman Sachs.

""In the old school way of doing things, you would get a circular saying everything is 25% off ... Now if they're selling North Face fleece jackets and it's 60 degrees, say, in New York, they can offer it on sale only for a couple of days in New York"" while keeping prices the same elsewhere, she said.

Many companies have absorbed a lot of the tariff costs already, analysts said, and will try to discount as little as possible through the holiday shopping season, compared to years past when they discounted any extra items held in inventory.

""If you look at Summerween and back-to-school this year, the strategy there was to put the seasonal items on the shelves at full price to start,"" said Alison Furman, a PwC retail consultant, referring to Halloween-in-summer shopping.

""You're kind of testing the waters around what a consumer will pay full price for. And then when it doesn't move, you very quickly go into your promotion strategy.""

The mapping serves as both a directory and a strategic tool to identify partners critical to maintaining continuous operations and competitiveness in the automotive sector.

Unlike Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers focused on production, these in-plant services cover maintenance, cleaning, logistics, waste management, and consulting. According to Cluster Industrial B2B, these services reduce downtime, control costs, support sustainability efforts, and help plants achieve certifications. “Service providers are essential links within the operational chain of automotive plants,” reads the report.

The mapping categorizes providers into three main groups with 30 subcategories. General services, the largest group with 1,027 providers, grew 49.06% year-over-year and includes industrial cleaning, machinery maintenance, packaging, industrial installations, and waste management. Specialized services grew 4.48%, highlighting occupational health and water well drilling. Professional and consulting services rose 6.56%, covering construction, engineering, telecommunications, and environmental compliance.

The growth reflects broader market trends, including nearshoring, increased plant construction, and growing emphasis on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. The global industrial services market is projected to reach US$37 billion in 2025, potentially exceeding US$65 billion by 2034. In Mexico, related construction and logistics investments are expanding rapidly.

Dell Technologies and its CFO, Yvonne McGill, mutually agreed that she would step down, according to a regulatory filing on Monday. The news comes after upheaval at Dell this summer saw its chief accounting officer depart, widespread layoffs in the company’s sales teams, and its PCs president get replaced.

Dell Technologies CFO Yvonne McGill, a regular voice on the company’s quarter earnings calls and a Dell employee for nearly 30 years, is stepping down, which according to a regulatory filing, was a decision reached by Dell and McGill.

“As I reflect on my 28-plus years with Dell, I am incredibly honored to have worked alongside such a talented global team. I am proud of all we have accomplished together and believe that after such long service with one company this is the right time for me to embark on my next chapter,” she said, according to a press release.

While McGill will remain with the company until Oct. 31 — the end of the quarter — as of Sept. 9, she will be replaced as CFO by executive David Kennedy, who will work on an interim basis until Dell finds a permanent replacement.

“I want to thank Yvonne for nearly three decades of partnership and for her significant impact throughout her career at Dell,” said Michael Dell, chairman and CEO of the Round Rock, Texas-based tech giant, in a press release. “She has been a tremendous contributor as CFO and across almost all parts of our company – with prior leadership roles including corporate controller, ISG CFO and chief accounting officer. We are grateful for her help in facilitating a smooth transition by serving as a resource to David and the rest of the management team over the coming weeks, as we search for our next CFO. Yvonne’s leadership has made a lasting mark, and we wish her all the best in what’s next.”

According to an 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, McGill’s decision to resign her position is “not the result of any disagreements with the Company on any matter relating to its financial statements, internal control over financial reporting, operations, policies or practices.” McGill (pictured above) will receive a cash payment reflecting a pro rata bonus for fiscal 2026 in an amount equal to approximately $562,500, the company stated.

McGill’s replacement, Kennedy, is 48 years old. He has been with Dell since 1998. Kennedy was most recently senior vice president, global business operations, finance, a job he started in February 2023. Before that, Kennedy’s title was senior vice president and chief operating officer for global sales, which he won in 2020.

“We are fortunate that David (Kennedy) will transition to the CFO role on an interim basis,” the company’s COO, Jeff Clarke, said in a statement. “With 27 years of experience at Dell and significant contributions including serving as the CFO of CSG, David is well suited to provide immediate leadership for our finance team and the company.”

Clarke said Dell’s leadership remains confident in its strong market position, ongoing growth and long-term value creation. In the statement, the company also reaffirmed its guidance for the third quarter and full year that McGill provided less than two weeks ago during the company’s earnings call.

This is the latest shake-up for Dell, which saw widespread sales layoffs earlier this summer as well as a reorganization of its PC business with Clarke being placed in charge of that unit.",https://www.crn.com/news/computing/2025/media_1c769eba0a0c2f2b0b89fa88fa9ba51bc6d9c7551.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2025-09-08 20:11:50.714326

(Sept. 8, 2025) – North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University has partnered with the Bluford Healthcare Leadership Institute (BHLI) and Guilford County Schools to launch a groundbreaking course designed to educate and inspire the next generation of healthcare leaders.

The course, “Health Systems Management Introduction to Health Professions,” introduces students to a wide range of healthcare careers, with a special emphasis on leadership, equity and innovation. It incorporates BHLI’s signature “Be the Change” model, developed by BHLI Founder and President John W. Bluford, a nationally recognized healthcare executive and change agent.

Students gathered for the inaugural speaker series Thursday, Sept. 4, when they were joined by Bluford and his team. During his visit, Bluford shared personal stories of leadership, resilience and vision drawn from his decades-long career transforming public hospitals across the country.

“You don’t have to be a doctor or a nurse to make a major impact and have a healthcare-related career,” said Bluford. “I was lucky enough to get an opportunity. But opportunity can come and hit you in the face — the key is to be prepared to take advantage of it. Maximize your return on luck.”

Bluford’s message resonated deeply with the class, which includes 21 high school students from Guilford County Schools’ STEM Early College and A&T Four Middle College, both located on N.C. A&T’s campus. The remaining students are undergraduates in the health services management program, which is housed in the John R. and Kathy R. Hairston College of Health and Human Sciences.

Throughout the semester, students will engage with prominent healthcare leaders, like chief legal officers, global public health experts and other executives of major healthcare systems. These interactions are designed to expose students to the breadth of opportunities in healthcare management and to cultivate leadership skills early in their academic journeys.

In a powerful gesture of support, each high school student received a free laptop, provided through a collaboration between BHLI and Best Buy. The laptops will be used throughout the course and are theirs to keep upon completion.

“Today’s event highlights the importance of engaging and inspiring students early in their career pathways to explore the amazing variety of opportunities in healthcare,” said Catherine White, Ph.D., associate professor of biology and pre-professional scholars program director. “It was incredibly encouraging for our team to see students connect so genuinely with Mr. Bluford and his remarkable story. We are excited to build more partnerships that offer this kind of meaningful exposure to our high school and college students.”

This initiative reflects N.C. A&T’s ongoing commitment to community engagement, educational equity, and workforce development in the healthcare sector. By connecting high school and college students with real-world leaders and resources, the university is helping shape a more inclusive and visionary future for healthcare.",https://www.ncat.edu/news/2025/09/ncat-gcs-bhli.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 03:04:53.810923

Retail brands like Levi Strauss, Ralph Lauren, Under Armour, and Abercrombie & Fitch are turning to wealthier shoppers to boost profits, sticking with full-price selling even as tariffs raise costs and bargain hunters cut back.

What does this mean?

Affluent shoppers—those earning $100,000 or more—are still spending big, letting retailers ease up on discounts and ramp up profit margins. Levi Strauss has managed to lift prices without driving away loyal buyers, while Ralph Lauren’s upscale appeal is delivering solid results across global markets. Under Armour and Abercrombie & Fitch are following suit, scaling back promotions to favor profitability. With America’s top 10% now accounting for half of all spending, brands are turning to smarter pricing tech, testing where they can stick to full price and serving up targeted deals as needed. While most retailers have handled increased tariff costs so far, the big question is whether this full-price focus will hold steady through the upcoming holiday crunch.

Why should I care?

For markets: Premium prices signal changing shopper priorities.

Retailers' ability to charge and keep higher prices shows not just the spending power of wealthier consumers, but also sharper use of customer data. Instead of constant discounting, companies like Levi Strauss and Ralph Lauren are boosting profits by sticking to tighter pricing strategies. With half of all US consumer spending coming from just 10% of earners, expect more brands to double down on premium pricing.

The bigger picture: Retail’s real-time strategy ups the ante.

An era of data-driven retail is well underway, with brands using real-time tracking and smarter pricing tools to manage promotions by region, product, and shopper type. This approach has helped limit broad discounts and soften tariff impacts, but as income gaps persist, retailers will need to keep evolving if they want to stay out in front—especially with the holidays looming.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Ftag_reuters_com_2025_newsml_L6N3UV122.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=7ef69d76485233c6cc9d7827e25423cc,N,,2025-09-08 20:12:11.083594

Attorneys representing a business owned by Jewel wanted to question McMullen about his exit as part of a contract breach lawsuit filed against Kroger in 2023.

Jewel, born Jewel Kilcher, is an owner of the Wellness Your Way Festival, LLC.
Meanwhile, details surrounding McMullen's sudden resignation are also being sought in a separate lawsuit filed by Albertsons against Kroger over the supermarket chains' failed merger last year.","Ex-Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen can breathe a sigh of relief — for now.

An Ohio judge has sided with McMullen, ruling in a recent order that he does not have to face deposition questioning about his resignation from the supermarket giant as part of a lawsuit involving the singer-songwriter Jewel.

Attorneys representing a business owned by Jewel wanted to question McMullen about his exit as part of a contract breach lawsuit filed against Kroger in 2023.

McMullen's attorneys argued in court documents that his March resignation has nothing to do with the ""You Were Meant For Me"" singer's lawsuit and that lawyers' questions about it are aimed at ""annoying and embarrassing"" him.

Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge Christian Jenkins agreed with McMullen, writing in an order filed late last month that ""the facts and circumstances surrounding Mr. McMullen's resignation from his position as CEO of Kroger are not relevant to the claims before this Court.""

In granting McMullen's request for a protective order barring attorneys from questioning him about his resignation, the judge wrote that McMullen ""argues this line of questioning is irrelevant, not proportional to the needs of the case, and would be embarrassing.""

Kroger announced in March that McMullen stepped down from the CEO role he held for more than 10 years after an internal investigation into his ""personal conduct."" The grocery chain said that conduct was ""unrelated to the business,"" but added it was ""inconsistent with Kroger's Policy on Business Ethics.""

Kroger's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that McMullen forfeited $11.2 million in bonus and stock payments when he resigned.

McMullen is not a defendant in the lawsuit that Jewel and her business partner are behind, but the plaintiffs' attorneys have argued that McMullen would be a trial witness in the case, and details around his resignation could be relevant to his credibility.

The judge previously ordered that McMullen must explain in a written response what led to his exit from Kroger and the identities of those involved. McMullen submitted that response to the judge on August 8.

Jenkins wrote in his August 21 ruling that he ordered a private review of McMullen's response to assess the ""relevance, proportionality, and risk of annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression to Mr. McMullen.""

The judge previously said that if he granted McMullen's request for a protective order, McMullen's response would be made part of the record under seal.

Attorneys for McMullen did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider on Monday. Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case — Wellness Your Way Festival, LLC and Inclusion Companies, LLC — also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jewel, born Jewel Kilcher, is an owner of the Wellness Your Way Festival, LLC.

The lawsuit against Kroger stems from allegations of a breach of partnership agreement between the supermarket chain and Jewel and her business partner, Trevor Drinkwater, the CEO of Inclusion, over Kroger's annual Wellness Festival event in Cincinnati.

Meanwhile, details surrounding McMullen's sudden resignation are also being sought in a separate lawsuit filed by Albertsons against Kroger over the supermarket chains' failed merger last year.

McMullen's conduct ""raises significant concerns not only regarding his credibility, integrity, and compliance with the law, but also about his focus during the merger process and his ability to fulfill Kroger's contractual obligations to Albertsons,"" Albertsons attorneys wrote in a July motion, Bloomberg reported.

Kroger countersued Albertsons earlier this year.

The company's shares fell by nearly 5% following reports of the new French criminal probe, but they recovered to be down by 1.3% by 1249 GMT [2].","Philips has denied a new French criminal investigation over its sleep apnea device recall. The company is a leading health technology firm focused on improving health outcomes through advanced technology and clinical insights. Philips has a range of products and services, including diagnostic imaging, patient monitoring, and consumer health.

Philips, a leading health technology company, has denied a new French criminal investigation over its 2021 recall of sleep apnea devices. The company, which specializes in diagnostic imaging, patient monitoring, and consumer health, has been facing legal challenges following the recall of millions of devices due to concerns over degrading polyurethane foam [1].

The recall, which affected approximately 15 million devices worldwide, including 350,000 in France, was prompted by fears that the foam could cause health issues ranging from headaches and respiratory irritation to potential cancer risks [2]. Philips has previously settled related litigation in the United States for $1.1 billion [2].

Philips spokesperson stated that ongoing proceedings launched in 2023 cover the alleged activities of the company leading up to and during the 2021 recall. The spokesperson emphasized that the current investigation does not make allegations about the quality and safety of products currently marketed in France by Philips [2].

The company's shares fell by nearly 5% following reports of the new French criminal probe, but they recovered to be down by 1.3% by 1249 GMT [2]. The stock market reaction underscores the ongoing scrutiny and legal challenges that Philips faces due to the recall.

Philips has been actively working to address the recall issues and has promised to replace the affected devices as soon as possible. However, some users have expressed frustration with the company's response time, leading to class action lawsuits and calls for more transparency [1].

Intel is also establishing a new Central Engineering Group led by Srinivasan (Srini) Iyengar, a senior vice president and Fellow. In his expanded role, Iyengar will lead horizontal engineering functions and build a new custom silicon business to serve a broad range of external customers.

Iyengar joined Intel in June from Cadence Design Systems, where he led global silicon engineering. He brings deep technical expertise in custom silicon development and has worked closely with hyperscale data center customers to optimize solutions for key workloads.

“With Srini leading Central Engineering, we’re aligning innovation and execution more tightly in service to customers,” Tan said. “We are laser-focused on delivering world-class products and empowering our engineering teams to move faster and execute with excellence. Kevork, Jim, and Srini are exceptional leaders whose deep technical acumen and industry relationships will be instrumental as we continue building a new Intel.”

Kechichian, Johnson, and Iyengar will report directly to CEO Lip-Bu Tan.

Naga Chandrasekaran to Expand Foundry Leadership Role

Naga Chandrasekaran, executive vice president and chief technology and operations officer of Intel Foundry, will expand his role to include Foundry Services. This will create a more integrated structure spanning technology development, manufacturing and go-to-market to better serve customers. Intel consolidated technology development and manufacturing under Chandrasekaran’s leadership earlier this year.

Chandrasekaran joined Intel in 2024 from Micron, where he served as senior vice president for technology development. He brings decades of experience spanning the breadth of semiconductor manufacturing and R&D.

“Naga’s strong leadership, combined with a more integrated foundry operating model, will help us enhance the quality of execution, collaboration and customer service across our foundry business,” Tan said.

Chandrasekaran will continue reporting to Tan. Kevin O’Buckley continues as senior vice president and general manager of Foundry Services, reporting to Chandrasekaran.

Michelle Johnston Holthaus to Depart Intel

Additionally, Intel announced that Michelle Johnston Holthaus, chief executive of Intel Products, will depart after more than three decades with the company. Holthaus held numerous senior leadership roles, including interim co-CEO, executive vice president and general manager of CCG, and chief revenue officer. She will remain a strategic advisor over the coming months to ensure a seamless transition.

“Throughout her incredible career, Michelle has transformed major businesses, built high-performing teams and worked to delight our customers,” Tan said. “She has made a lasting impact on our company and inspired so many of us with her leadership. We are grateful for all Michelle has given Intel and wish her the best.”

He has previously held various roles at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Cushman & Wakefield, and The Economist Group Ltd. Elkann received his undergraduate degree from Politecnico di Torino.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa has called for urgent action and a flexible strategy to support the European auto industry, as it faces significant market challenges. In an interview with Il Sole 24 Ore, Filosa highlighted the need for Europe to act quickly and outlined a proposal that includes technological neutrality, the development of hybrid and range-extended powertrains, incentives for fleet renewal, and super credits for city cars and EVs [1].

Filosa emphasized the importance of strategic dialogue but warned that further delays are not an option. He pointed to the structural decline in demand, noting that the European market has lost about three million vehicles in the past five years, the equivalent of the combined Italian and Spanish markets [1]. To address this, Filosa proposed extending the CO₂ emissions averaging period for automakers from three to five years and introducing an offset credit system to reward investments in electrification, infrastructure, and fleet renewal [1].

One of the long-term ideas proposed by Filosa is the introduction of a new category of vehicles inspired by Japan’s kei cars. This would involve super credits for small EVs, incentives tied to eco-scores, and measures aimed at replacing older vehicles [1]. The CEO believes this strategy would help address the issue of affordability in Europe.

This is an opportunity for us to lean in and hear our customers differently perhaps than what we have before.

“If you’re at a mid-sized company and you’re looking for an exit or a sale, you’re going to have to be patient,” Humphrey said.
Whether it’s at Patient Square, whether it’s with any of our over a dozen portfolio companies, nobody is backing off.","Leaders from Medtronic, Insulet and more taking action in the face of policy and economic challenges offer tools for others to do the same.

The medical device industry is facing unprecedented pressures, straining our ecosystem to the point of breaking.

Supply chain disruptions continue to impact the availability and cost of critical components and devices, creating uncertainty in production and delivery timelines. Compounding those issues are worldwide healthcare labor shortages, which slow the adoption and ultimately the implementation of new technologies.

Shifting U.S. policies are impacting reimbursement and market access as regulatory uncertainty intensifies with structural changes at the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services and its agencies. Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) rollbacks are compromising efforts to achieve more representative workforce and clinical trial populations.

“We have tariffs, the biggest changes to the world trading system since 1947,” former Philips VP and GM Heather Hudnut-Page said during our Women in MedTech Breakfast at DeviceTalks Minnesota in June. “If those tariffs all hit, it could increase the cost of care by more than 15%.”

Register now: Our DeviceTalks West Women in Medtech Breakfast is scheduled for Oct. 16 in Santa Clara, California

How are leaders expected to lead in these uncertain times? That was the question facing Hudnut-Page and four panelists: Insulet SVP of Global Commercial Capabilities & U.S. GM Carolyn Sleeth, Medtronic CRM Marketing Communications VP Ravyn Miller, Patient Square Capital Operating Executive Ellie Humphrey, and The Bailey Group CEO Ann Houser.

Economic uncertainty

“As we see government departments completely shut down, we see funding for healthcare shut down, we see grants going away, I think some businesses are seeing license to be a bit more mercenary in the work they’re doing,” Houser said. “The result may be doing things like some mass layoffs, return-to-work edicts. … I’m seeing these extremes in our society that we’re dealing with, and some extremes in business, and that leads to leadership behaviors that feel a bit more extreme.”

Remote medtech jobs: These medical device employers have remote job openings

The panelists offered advice to larger organizations.

“The uncertainty today, whether it be tariffs or what’s going to happen with Medicaid, is just making that mismatch between those who need investment and those who can provide investment even worse,” Humphrey said. “You’re seeing kind of a paralysis, to a certain extent. If you’re at a big company, that means you’re going to have to be really creative on deal structures to find some of those unique opportunities that, in the past, you could just pay with your stock.”

“Don’t panic,” Miller said. “As these new things are getting interrupted, give yourself enough time to understand and contextualize what’s actually happening. As you do that, you see the thing starts to settle down.”

From reaction to pro-action, the panelists suggest that these unprecedented economic challenges can also create opportunities.

“We just hosted one of our largest conventions in the world. China did not come out of fear. Canada did not come out of principle,” Miller said. “… So what did we do instead? We made a decision that if our customers don’t feel comfortable coming to us, we will go and visit our customers. This is an opportunity for us to lean in and hear our customers differently perhaps than what we have before. How are they understanding the market? How can we find mutual benefit and then move forward towards execution together? And thus far, it’s proven to be very beneficial.”

Policy and funding shifts

“Ten thousand HHS roles have been eliminated, 300 CMS roles, 3,500 (or 20%) of the FDA, which could impact timely approvals for big companies and startups, and especially those startups who are dependent on hitting milestones to continue their investments,” said Hudnut-Page. “And then big cuts to NIH and NSF will affect foundational research that we depend on as we work within the medtech space.”

R&D alert: Research and development spending stalls in the 2025 Medtech Big 100 ranking

These recent developments, plus EU MDR requirements and potential policy shifts, have introduced new complexities for medtech companies as changes to healthcare coverage, like Medicaid, have compromised patient access to care.

“We have to be very, very patient-oriented because diabetes is actually quite a consumer business,” said Sleeth. “I’ve got to think about how else I might get my diabetes medical products covered. And thinking through that entire patient journey and saying, ‘Where are the moments that we could help that maybe we weren’t thinking about before?’ Because it’s the entire experience, not just the product we’re selling.”

Restructuring, cutbacks, changes to policy and coverage, and more have brought uncertainty to medtech companies at all stages of fundraising.

“What you’re going to be facing in a small company is the really ruthless decisions about your ability to raise capital to fund your innovation,” Humphrey said. “You’re going to have to be ruthless about prioritization. … If you don’t, you’re going to have significant capital constraints and potentially liquidity crises. … The last thing you want … is to be in a crisis that makes you vulnerable to somebody coming in and effectively taking your company out from underneath you at a cheap price.”

Adding to Humphrey’s point, Miller said, “There’s now the opportunity to talk about radical prioritization. What are the must-dos in the company in order to still maximize our impact across the world? And what are some things that we need to trade off? … It gives us a chance to check back in with our strategy to say, ‘Is this sustainable, or is this where we need to make some tweaks? Do we need to continue to do things offshore? Is there an opportunity to bring local manufacturing? Is there a way for us to design our way out of this because we were looking at new components anyway?’”

The panelists also had advice for those at the end of their funding journey.

“If you’re at a mid-sized company and you’re looking for an exit or a sale, you’re going to have to be patient,” Humphrey said. “You’re going to have to be seeing those complicated deal structures and understanding you’re probably going to have to take on more risk than you might have had to in the past.”

Diversity, equity and inclusion

“The top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams are 25% more likely to have above average profitability,” Hudnut-Page said. “Ethnically diverse companies are 36% more likely to outperform their competitors. We also know that the FDA is removing the diversity requirement in many of their clinical trials, which we need to get approval.”

Equity is increasingly politicized, and with federal cutbacks, making access to information and health challenging, the panelists shared how their organizations are responding.

“At The Bailey Group, we are big fans of DEI, and we’re still doing it because it resonates with our beliefs and values. I think organizations should try to be as true to their values as possible,” said Houser. “And oftentimes, I think they may find that their values have an underpinning in DEI.”

Sleeth said it is “an absolute imperative that our sales team represents our customers … and the marketing teams and the product development teams are listening to folks, listening to our field and saying, ‘What is it this patient needs?’ A patient living in the Bronx is going to be very different than a patient living in Sacramento Valley.”

“And if we don’t have people … thinking differently with a different set of experiences, mindset, and bringing that forward, you’re not going to get the most innovative solutions,” she continued. “We continue to prioritize inclusion and diversity to make sure we’ve got that.”

Miller cited a study reported in the American Scientific Journal that found diverse teams don’t make the same assumptions as homogeneous teams.

“And because of that, we have not shifted, we have not changed,” she said. “We are still going to move forward with that because it impacts patients’ lives.”

Talent is the most important factor for a company’s success, Humphrey said.

“Scour every corner of every part of the world to find the best talent,” she said. “The data is so clear about the value of diversity and how much better diverse companies perform. And I think the key is to remember that progress isn’t linear, and we’ve made so much progress on this dimension over the past 20 years, and to not let us be deterred. We need to stay focused on why we’re doing this, which is to get the best talent, produce the best results. Whether it’s at Patient Square, whether it’s with any of our over a dozen portfolio companies, nobody is backing off. You’ve got to recognize that you can’t be bullied into doing something that isn’t the best thing for you and your customers and your patients.”

Leading fearlessly

We will always face uncertainty, and a fearless leader doesn’t wait for volatility to pass. They know disruption is the norm, but they lead anyway. These fearless leaders shared how they communicate operational changes and decisions internally.

“Communicate honestly, communicate openly, and communicate often,” said Houser. “Give people space to process what’s going on and to stay on top of the changes.”

Miller offered up what she calls the Five Cs.

“The first is to contextualize. Contextualize the situations that we’re facing so people are very clear about what this is and what this isn’t,” she said. “The second is criticality. Who are the critical people who need to hear the critical message … and what is the critical action that they need to take? Three and four go together: candor, concise. People like candor. They trust you. They rely on you. It builds credibility. But keep it concise. And finally, communicate whatever channel that is.”

“Those five Cs have served us well,” she continued. “It has served us with retention. It has served us with people doing the right thing at the right time for the right outcome.”

Humphrey offered two more Cs: courage and conviction.

“It’s up to all of us to decide how we’re going to behave in an environment of change and uncertainty and how we’re going to show up to our teams and our companies, how we’re going to show up in our communities,” she said.

The panelists end the conversation by sharing hard-won advice on how best to lead teams for better outcomes.

“I’m a huge fan of positive intelligence and positive psychology, the premise being that the more positive we can be, the more we see opportunity, the more we have good results,” said Houser. “… [Ask yourself] what actions do you want to take so you can be that best version of yourself 10 years from now.”

Said Humphrey, “We run a company with efficiency and integrity and don’t compromise on compliance or cut corners. Staying focused on the original purpose and how we’ve created value for decades in this industry, those are the things that are going to continue to create value in the future.”

Sleeth said she’s constantly telling her team, “You’re my eyes and ears. I rely on you. I want to listen to you and make sure you feel heard and valued. We’re going to get a lot better information, and we can move forward with confidence and conviction.”

But for the person leading the team, Sleeth said, “Manage yourself. That self-care really helps you to be able to step forward.”

Listening more often with empathy is a winning strategy for Miller’s organization, she said.

“Our superpower is our authenticity,” she added. “We don’t need to be anybody else. Nobody else is trying to be us. And as we do that, we will see the best of our work, which then proves to be the best for our patients.”

“Stay true to the moral compass of your company and stay true to yourself through authenticity,” Miller continued. “Those two things will guide you through any challenge and actually elevate all opportunities.”",https://www.medicaldesignandoutsourcing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ravyn-Miller-Medtronic-Carolyn-Sleeth-Insulet-WIMT-DTMN.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 18:17:23.657733

Celsius now possesses a portfolio that will require more attention to grow sales and recognition. The brands also appeal to different audiences, which will increase demand for marketing and brand expertise.

Celsius is popular with consumers seeking better-for-you energy drinks. The male-focused Rockstar resonates with consumers who prefer classic flavors and formats, while Alani Nu goes primarily after female energy drinkers.

""These appointments reflect our commitment to building a world-class marketing organization capable of scaling our brands from big brands into mega brands,"" John Fieldly, Celsius’ CEO, said in a statement. ""With Rishi, Kyle, JoBeth, and our strong leadership bench, we are creating a marketing powerhouse that positions us to be a leading, global, functional beverage portfolio company and deliver long-term value for our shareholders.""

Last month, the sector lost 12,000 jobs, while wages for manufacturing workers stagnated.
“The argument is: We’re all meant to sacrifice a bit, so that tariffs can help rebuild American manufacturing.
“We do [manufacturing] now with very few workers, we do it in a very automated way,” Luck told the CBC.
“Even if we do increase manufacturing I don’t know that we’re going to increase jobs along with it.”","US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, imposing levies as high as 50% on the United States’ trading partners, have not proven compatible with his campaign promise to turn the US back into a “manufacturing powerhouse,” as Friday’s jobs report showed.

The overall analysis was grim, with the economy adding just 22,000 jobs last month, but manufacturing employment in particular has declined since Trump made his April 2 “Liberation Day” announcement of tariffs on countries including Canada and Mexico.

Since then, the president has introduced new rounds of tariffs on imports from countries he claims have treated the US unfairly, and all while manufacturers have tightened their belts to cope with the higher cost of supplies and materials.

Overall manufacturing employment has plummeted by 42,000 jobs, while job openings and new hires have declined by 76,000 and 18,000, respectively, according to the Center for American Progress (CAP), which released a jobs analysis report titled Trump’s Trade War Squeezes Middle-Class Manufacturing Employment on Friday.

“The manufacturing sector is struggling more than the rest of the labor market under Trump’s tariffs, and manufacturing workers’ wage growth is stagnating,” CAP said.

Last month, the sector lost 12,000 jobs, while wages for manufacturing workers stagnated.

In line with other private employees, workers in the sector saw their wages go up just 10 cents from July, earning an average of $35.50 per hour.

“Despite Trump’s claims that his policies will reignite the manufacturing industry in the United States, his policies have achieved the opposite,” wrote policy analyst Kennedy Andara and economist Sara Estep at CAP.

The findings are in line with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ Texas Manufacturing Survey, which was taken from August 12-20 and found that 72% of manufacturing firms say the tariffs have had a negative impact on their business.

“The argument is: We’re all meant to sacrifice a bit, so that tariffs can help rebuild American manufacturing. Let’s ask American manufacturers whether they’re helping,” said University of Michigan economics professor Justin Wolfers on social media, sharing a graph that showed the survey’s findings.

As Philip Luck, a former deputy chief economist with the US State Department, told the CBC last month, Trump has been promising “millions and millions of jobs” will result from his tariff regime, but those promises are out of step with the reality of manufacturing in 2025.

The case, which has been moving through federal courts since the mid-2000s, involves more than a thousand current and former employees who claimed the company underpaid lump-sum distributions from its retirement plan.

How It All Began

The story goes back to 1989, when Colgate switched from a traditional pension plan to a cash-balance plan, a model that promised more flexibility but quickly drew criticism for its complexity.

Employees who chose lump-sum payouts argued that the company’s formula left them shortchanged.

Colgate did attempt to fix the issue in 2005 with a retroactive amendment. But according to the plaintiffs, the recalculations still didn’t measure up. That disagreement opened the door to years of litigation, with claims filed under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).

Litigation History and Case Development

By 2007, the first lawsuits were already on the docket. A consolidated class action followed in 2016, formally titled McCutcheon et al. v. Colgate-Palmolive Co.. Plaintiffs accused the company of breaching fiduciary duties and misrepresenting benefits.

Colgate never admitted liability. Instead, it argued that its calculations complied with federal law. Yet after years of motions, appeals, and mounting legal costs, the company made the calculation most corporations eventually do: settling was safer than rolling the dice at trial.

What the Deal Means for Workers

The agreement, filed in Manhattan federal court, sets aside $332 million in total. Once attorneys’ fees and expenses are deducted, employees and retirees should see about $232.7 million flow back to them. Roughly 1,177 individuals are covered by the settlement.

Colgate had prepared for this moment, reserving funds in its financial statements as far back as 2023.

The move ensures the payout won’t come as a shock to investors, even though it is one of the largest pension-related settlements in recent memory.

This case is a reminder that pension disputes can cast a very long shadow. A change made more than thirty years ago still ended up pulling a global company into a costly courtroom fight.

For employers, the message is straightforward: even small errors in pension math can grow into major liabilities over time. For employees, the outcome shows that persistence under ERISA can make a difference, even when the opponent is a Fortune 500 giant.

The settlement still needs a judge’s approval. If it goes through, it will finally close the book on a dispute that began in the late 1980s and lingered in the courts for nearly two decades.

Next-generation supply chains that are agile, sustainable, and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered were listed as a current top three tech priority for 70% of life sciences organizations polled in the report (1).

Does the report have any significant revelations?

A similar percentage (72%) of organizations said they have made significant progress in transforming their supply chains in the three years leading up to the release of the report (up 18 percentage points from 54% in 2022), and almost as high a percentage as that (68%) said they have set a clear vision and objectives for their supply chain (up 33 points from 35% in 2022) (1).

Another key finding in the report is that AI systems, including agentic AI, are increasingly reshaping company operations. Two-thirds (67%) of the executives surveyed said they believed that agentic AI would increase productivity, with 58% being confident it would transform frameworks for supply chains (1). Already, the report said, nearly 1 in 10 life sciences organizations have implemented multi-agent systems or are using AI agents in some way.

That is a timely statistic; on Sept. 4, 2025, the nonprofit Pistoia Alliance said it would be establishing a new initiative bringing together experts from the pharmaceutical, technology, and biotech industries to help shape certain standards and protocols under which AI agents will be allowed to perform (2).

Where do cybersecurity and sustainability rank as priorities?

While supply chains are named by organizations as a prospective top priority going forward, companies and their executives who were surveyed, overwhelmingly, already include cybersecurity high on their list of concerns. For life sciences, more than three-quarters of respondents cite cybersecurity as a major challenge to their supply chains, the highest percentage of all industries polled (1). More organizations are investing in real-time threat monitoring and supplier diversification.

Meanwhile, the geopolitical climate thus far in 2025 is also something organizations are keeping their eyes on. Many, according to the report, have put tariff mitigation strategies in effect to protect their operations and profit margins in response to the shifting trade policies between the United States and other countries (1).

As organizations adopt various practices, including AI, to become more efficient, sustainability is seen as a key driver. The survey said that 76% of organizations have a comprehensive strategy in place for supply chain sustainability, and a similar percentage agrees that sustainable practices not only reduce costs but also deliver increased value in the long term (1). Nearly as many (71%) feel that the value provided by those sustainability initiatives outweighs the potential costs.

What is necessary to build a future-ready supply chain?

To navigate disruption and build new- or next-generation supply chains, the report suggests that organizations take the following steps:

make resilience a continual strategic priority

adopt active risk management to keep ahead of threats

implement human-centered agentic AI as a means of strengthening governance

build sustainable, competitive supply chains through collaboration

leverage AI to establish robust data foundations while implementing cybersecurity protocols

encourage cross-functional alignment for the purpose of creating solutions alongside suppliers (1).

The company’s ability to navigate short-term volatility—driven by challenges in its Health Care Benefits segment—while laying the groundwork for long-term value creation underscores its leadership’s commitment to operational discipline and innovation. This analysis evaluates CVS’s strategic direction, financial guidance, and execution post-earnings, offering insights into its potential to deliver sustainable returns for investors.

Leadership and Strategic Vision: A Focus on Integrated Healthcare

CVS Health’s leadership, under CEO David Joyner, has prioritized stabilizing its Aetna insurance business and leveraging its integrated healthcare model to drive affordability and accessibility. Joyner emphasized during the Q4 2024 earnings call that the company’s “vision to become America’s leading and most trusted healthcare company” hinges on improving outcomes while reducing costs [1]. This vision is operationalized through initiatives such as the CostVantage pricing model, which aims to enhance transparency for prescription medications, and AI-driven updates to its health app, which streamline patient care pathways [2].

The appointment of Ed DeVaney as President of CVS Caremark further signals a strategic pivot toward strengthening the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) segment, a critical component of CVS’s value proposition [3]. By addressing reimbursement pressures and optimizing formulary arrangements, DeVaney’s leadership is expected to bolster margins in this high-margin business line.

Financial Guidance and Market Response: Balancing Caution and Optimism

CVS Health’s Q4 2024 results revealed a 4.2% year-over-year revenue increase to $97.7 billion, with adjusted EPS of $1.19—above analyst estimates but below the $2.12 reported in Q4 2023 [1]. The decline in profitability was largely attributable to the Health Care Benefits segment, which swung to an adjusted operating loss of $439 million due to elevated medical costs and Medicare Advantage star rating penalties [4].

Despite these headwinds, the company issued 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of $5.75 to $6.00, aligning with Wall Street expectations and reflecting confidence in its strategic initiatives [2]. This guidance was subsequently revised upward in Q2 2025 to $6.30–$6.40, driven by strong execution in the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment and improved Aetna operations [5]. The stock’s 15% rally post-earnings [4] and a 9.3% premarket surge following the Q2 2025 update [6] highlight investor optimism about these projections.

Operational Execution: Cost-Cutting and Strategic Exits

CVS Health has undertaken aggressive cost-cutting measures to address margin pressures, including a $2 billion expense reduction plan over the next few years [3]. A key component of this strategy involves exiting unprofitable business lines, such as individual Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchanges, which will cease operations in 2026 [7]. This pivot allows the company to focus on higher-margin segments like Medicare Advantage and commercial insurance, where Aetna’s improved star ratings are expected to enhance profitability [5].

Innovative payment models, such as risk-sharing agreements for high-cost gene therapies, further demonstrate CVS’s commitment to managing long-term financial risks [4]. These initiatives, coupled with biosimilar conversions and partnerships like the Novo Nordisk deal to offer Wegovy at reduced prices, position the company to capture market share in value-driven healthcare [6].

Analyst Perspectives: A Bullish Outlook with Caveats

Analysts have largely endorsed CVS Health’s strategic direction. Jefferies reiterated a “Buy” rating with an $80 price target, citing the stock’s 10x P/E ratio as undervalued relative to peers [5]. However, some caution persists. A downgrade by Seeking Alpha noted that “incremental improvement, not transformation, is the best hope for 2025,” highlighting ongoing challenges such as rising healthcare costs and regulatory scrutiny [8].

Nonetheless, the company’s $20 billion investment over a decade to improve U.S. health system interoperability [5] and its digital-first initiatives—such as Aetna Care Paths—underscore a long-term commitment to systemic change. These efforts align with broader industry trends toward value-based care and could solidify CVS’s position as a healthcare ecosystem leader.

Conclusion: Navigating Volatility with Resilience

CVS Health’s Q4 2024 earnings and subsequent strategic moves illustrate a company in transition. While short-term volatility in its Health Care Benefits segment remains a concern, the leadership’s focus on cost discipline, pricing innovation, and strategic exits positions the company to capitalize on long-term opportunities. With a revised 2025 guidance reflecting strong operational execution and a stock price buoyed by investor confidence, CVS Health appears well-equipped to navigate the evolving healthcare landscape and deliver durable value for stakeholders.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 17:15:58.111493

The company will occupy seven floors across 265,000 square feet at 400 Summer St. in the Seaport District, it said in a press release.

[More on this story from Boston Business Journal.]

“We are thrilled that Hasbro has chosen Massachusetts as the home of its new headquarters, and we're ready to support the hundreds of jobs they will create here,” Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said. “We're proud to welcome this iconic company to Team Massachusetts — where we are number one for education, health care and innovation, and ranked the best state to live in, to raise a family, to be a woman and to be a working parent.""

“I’m delighted to welcome Hasbro to its new home in Boston,” Mayor Michelle Wu added. “The creativity and wonder at the heart of Hasbro’s work are also at the heart of our mission to make Boston a home for everyone—the safest major city in the country and the best place to raise a family, with opportunities for all to Connect(4) and Play(-Doh). We look forward to supporting Hasbro’s transition to Boston and partnership with the city.”

The decision ends a relocation search that began last year, when Hasbro and Massachusetts government leaders met over dinner and started discussing a move.

Hasbro's move is the latest company that Boston's been able to draw from across the region.

Just last month, Keurig Dr Pepper announced they are acquiring JDE Peet’s and basing the global headquarters for their Global Coffee Co in Burlington. Earlier this year, Lego opened its new U.S. headquarters in Boston, supporting 800 jobs. And Biogen is planning a new global headquarters and innovation hub in Kendall Square.

Hasbro's search led last year to tours of office buildings in Boston including two downtown on Summer Street. In 400 Summer in the Seaport, the company chose what may have seemed an unlikely destination at the outset of the search: a lab-and-office building.

WS Development leased the 580,000-square-foot property to Foundation Medicine in 2019, and the building opened last year. But Foundation had put a large chunk of the property on the sublease market, where it sat amid a broader slump in lab demand.

In 2024 alone, Hasbro said it contributed over $1 million in product and in-kind donations to local Rhode Island organizations, including long-standing partners like Hasbro Children’s Hospital and the Rhode Island Special Olympics.

This is especially important for international businesses where travelers’ safety and well-being are top priorities.

By promoting AI-powered hotel recommendations, companies can reduce the likelihood of travel disruptions and maintain corporate compliance, while also improving the overall employee experience. The combination of increased content, personalized travel solutions, and higher conversion rates makes this partnership a commercial success for both TMCs and corporate travelers.

The toy and entertainment giant will relocate its headquarters from Pawtucket, Rhode Island, to Boston's Seaport District.
The Executive Office of Economic Development said Hasbro's move would make the company eligible for Economic Development Incentive Program tax credits of $20,000 per job relocated to Massachusetts.
If Hasbro relocates 700 jobs as expected, the tax credits could total $14 million over a handful of years.
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu also welcomed the move of the maker of games like Monopoly, Connect Four and Battleship.","Hasbro, Inc., one of the world's largest toy companies, is relocating its headquarters to Boston, company officials announced Monday.

The toy and entertainment giant will relocate its headquarters from Pawtucket, Rhode Island, to Boston's Seaport District. The move, expected to bring at least 700 full-time jobs to Massachusetts by the end of 2026, is seen as a boost to the state’s business landscape.

The company will occupy seven floors across 265,000 square feet at 400 Summer St., a building owned by WS Development. This new location will serve as the primary headquarters for Hasbro’s toy, board game and licensing operations, as well as a majority of its corporate services.

Gov. Maura Healey expressed enthusiasm for the relocation, calling it ""an exciting step for Massachusetts."" She highlighted the state's reputation for innovation and education as key factors in attracting the company.

""We are thrilled that Hasbro has chosen Massachusetts as the home of its new headquarters, and we're ready to support the hundreds of jobs they will create here,"" Healey said in a statement. ""I’m grateful for the leadership of [Hasboro CEO] Chris Cocks and his team at Hasbro, and for the hard work of my economic development team that helped make this possible.""

The state and Hasboro have been in talks about the move since early 2024, state officials said.

The Executive Office of Economic Development said Hasbro's move would make the company eligible for Economic Development Incentive Program tax credits of $20,000 per job relocated to Massachusetts. If Hasbro relocates 700 jobs as expected, the tax credits could total $14 million over a handful of years.

The secretariat said it ""expects to recommend this award of tax credits for approval by the Economic Assistance Coordinating Council (EACC), which meets quarterly to award EDIP tax credits, and to explain that this incentive is a material factor in the company’s decision to relocate to Massachusetts."" The EACC's next meeting is scheduled for Sept. 17.

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu also welcomed the move of the maker of games like Monopoly, Connect Four and Battleship.

""The creativity and wonder at the heart of Hasbro’s work are also at the heart of our mission to make Boston a home for everyone,"" Wu said.

Hasbro’s decision marks the latest in a series of corporate relocations to Boston. Recent moves include LEGO’s North American headquarters and Keurig Dr Pepper’s acquisition of JDE Peet’s global coffee division, which will be based in Burlington, Massachusetts.

General Election moved its world headquarters from Fairfield, Connecticut, to Boston in 2016, also citing the city's reputation for innovation and access to young, educated talent.

The 725,000-square-foot facility will receive and process fresh produce, eggs, dairy, meat, and frozen foods. It is the third of five high-tech perishables DCs that Walmart is planning to open across the country. The automated DCs can process more than double the volume of a traditional distribution center, the company said.

Walmart said the facility uses technological innovations that remove some of the most physically demanding tasks that its workers perform. For example, robotics now handle the movement of cases on and off pallets, reducing the need for strenuous lifting.

The high-tech systems at the facility build store-specific pallets and ensure that fragile products such as eggs and yogurt are placed toward the top to minimize product damage.

The facility also uses artificial intelligence to track pallets, helping ensure accuracy and freshness. The technology also makes it easier for store workers to unload the pallets at the store, the retailer said.

The facility employs more than 600 full-time workers, and is continuing to hire for several positions, including automation equipment operators.

“The opening of our new high-tech perishable distribution center marks a major step forward in how we get fresher products to customers faster—whether that’s in-store, delivered to their home, or even restocking their refrigerator,” said Rob Montgomery, executive VP, supply chain, Walmart U.S.

Walmart opened its first automated perishables distribution center—which the company refers to as PDCs—in Shafter, Calif., in 2021, followed by a second automated PDC last year in Lancaster, Texas, that one measuring 730,000 square feet. Additional PDCs are planned for Belvidere, Ill., and Pilesgrove, N.J.

It is also opening a series of milk processing facilities, including one in Valdosta, Ga., set to open later this year, and one in Robinson, Texas, that is scheduled to open next year.

Broader Sector Trends: Labor Unrest and Macroeconomic Pressures The Kroger strike is part of a larger wave of retail labor activism.
In 2023 alone, 105 retail strikes were recorded, with two-thirds resolving within seven days but leaving lasting scars on corporate-labor relations [5].","The 2025 Kroger Teamsters strike has become a focal point for investors scrutinizing labor disruptions in the retail sector. With over 30,000 workers in Southern California, Colorado, Indiana, and Georgia poised to walk out over demands for living wages, affordable healthcare, and safer staffing levels, the strike underscores the growing tension between labor rights and corporate profitability. For Kroger, a company already reeling from a failed $25 billion merger with Albertsons and the closure of 60 underperforming stores, the labor unrest adds another layer of complexity to its strategic overhaul [1]. This analysis examines how labor strikes like Kroger’s intersect with broader retail sector trends, historical precedents, and investment dynamics, offering a framework for assessing risks and opportunities in an increasingly volatile market.

The Kroger Strike: A Microcosm of Retail Sector Strains

Kroger’s labor disputes are emblematic of systemic challenges facing the retail industry. Teamsters and UFCW workers have criticized the company for offering minimal raises that lag behind inflation, while also outsourcing roles to gig workers—a practice that has drawn sharp rebukes from unions [3]. The strike’s potential to disrupt supply chains and reduce in-store safety further amplifies its significance. For example, in Denver, where 10,000 workers have already authorized a strike, concerns over understaffed pharmacies and unsafe conditions have galvanized rank-and-file activism [3]. Meanwhile, Kroger’s recent restructuring efforts, including store closures and cost-cutting measures, have not assuaged worker frustrations, highlighting a disconnect between corporate strategy and employee welfare [1].

The financial implications for Kroger are nuanced. While Q3 2025 earnings showed resilience—driven by pharmacy sales and digital initiatives—the company’s reliance on short-term gains to offset long-term labor costs raises questions about sustainability [5]. Investors must weigh whether Kroger’s focus on “identical sales without fuel” and stock buybacks can offset the reputational and operational risks of prolonged strikes.

Broader Sector Trends: Labor Unrest and Macroeconomic Pressures

The Kroger strike is part of a larger wave of retail labor activism. In 2023 alone, 105 retail strikes were recorded, with two-thirds resolving within seven days but leaving lasting scars on corporate-labor relations [5]. These actions reflect a shift in worker priorities, with demands increasingly centered on living wages and safe staffing ratios rather than traditional union benefits. The rise of “rank-and-file” organizing—where workers bypass union leadership to push for direct action—has further complicated negotiations, as seen in Indiana, where Kroger workers rallied for transparency amid stalled talks [4].

Macroeconomic factors amplify these tensions. High inflation, persistent interest rates, and looming tariffs have squeezed retail margins, forcing companies to balance wage increases with cost control [2]. For instance, the airline industry’s 2024 strikes led to a 7.6% year-over-year rise in labor costs, a warning bell for retailers facing similar pressures [1]. Meanwhile, experiential retail formats—such as grocery-anchored centers—remain resilient, but discretionary retail struggles, creating a fragmented landscape for investors [2].

Historical Precedents: Strikes, Stock Volatility, and Investor Sentiment

Historical data reveals that labor strikes can act as both catalysts and cautionary tales for investors. The 2024 rail and port strikes, for example, forced retailers to front-load inventory, disrupting seasonal sales cycles and creating in-store chaos [2]. While these disruptions were temporary, they underscored how labor disputes can ripple through supply chains and investor sentiment. Similarly, the VIX (volatility index) and Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (GEPU) have shown that labor-related uncertainty often drives short-term market swings, particularly in sectors reliant on stable operations like retail [1].

For Kroger, the stakes are high. If strikes lead to prolonged store closures or reputational damage, the company’s stock could face downward pressure. However, historical recoveries—such as the V-shaped rebound in corporate earnings observed in 2025—suggest that companies adapting to labor demands through innovation (e.g., omnichannel strategies, AI-driven logistics) may emerge stronger [1].

Risks and Opportunities: A Balanced Perspective

Risks:

- Operational Disruptions: A full-scale strike could reduce foot traffic, erode customer trust, and force Kroger to accelerate store closures.

- Rising Labor Costs: If unions secure higher wages, Kroger’s margins may compress, particularly in a high-inflation environment.

- Sector-Wide Volatility: Retailers like Walmart and Amazon may exploit Kroger’s instability to gain market share, intensifying competition.

Opportunities:

- Strategic Adaptation: Kroger’s investments in digital expansion and store remodeling could position it to capture shifting consumer preferences, even amid labor challenges [5].

- Long-Term Labor Agreements: A resolution with unions might set a precedent for fairer wage structures, aligning worker demands with corporate sustainability goals.

- Sector Consolidation: The failed Albertsons merger highlights the fragility of retail M&A, but it also creates opportunities for nimble investors to bet on companies streamlining operations.

Conclusion

The Kroger Teamsters strike is more than a labor dispute—it is a barometer for the retail sector’s evolving relationship with workers, consumers, and investors. While the immediate risks of operational disruption and rising costs are clear, the long-term outlook hinges on Kroger’s ability to innovate and adapt. For investors, the key lies in balancing short-term volatility with strategic opportunities, recognizing that labor unrest, while disruptive, can also catalyze necessary reforms. As the retail sector navigates this turbulent landscape, the Kroger case serves as a critical case study in the interplay between labor dynamics and market resilience.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 18:15:54.877001

About Capgemini Capgemini (capgemini.com) is a global business and technology transformation partner, helping organizations to accelerate their dual transition to a digital and sustainable world, while creating tangible impact for enterprises and society.","Capgemini, a global leader in business and technology transformation, Thales, a global leader in advanced technologies for the Defense, Aerospace and Cyber & Digital sectors, and Thales Alenia Space, a joint company between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), have been selected by the French Space Agency (CNES) (cnes.fr) as part of a government-backed call for projects under the France 2030 program to lead an innovative demonstration of 5G direct-to-device (D2D) connectivity.

The project named U DESERVE 5G will demonstrate the feasibility of direct communications between satellites and mobile devices or fixed terminals (5G direct to device, or D2D). A demonstrator satellite will be placed in low-Earth orbit to test interoperability between terrestrial and nonterrestrial 5G networks. The project will use a set of scenarios to evaluate how smoothly devices can switch between satellite and terrestrial 5G coverage, which is a crucial step toward truly global, seamless and uninterrupted connectivity.

At a time when anytime, anywhere connectivity has become a strategic priority both to meet market demand and ensure infrastructure resilience in crisis situations satellite technology is emerging as a crucial and complementary solution alongside terrestrial networks.

At the heart of the project is an innovative 5G satellite payload with an active antenna. It will enable voice calls and data transmission directly between the satellite and a test mobile device, without routing via a ground station. The demonstrator will include all components of the chain: test satellite, payload, NTN* ground segment and test mobile devices. It will be compatible with Release 17 of the 3GPP 5G standard and will provide an end-to-end test platform to evaluate the performance of the 5G NTN/TN system and trial use cases, especially involving the Internet of Things (IoT).

Drawing on its expertise in telecommunications and its successful efforts to promote satellite 5G standardization, Thales Alenia Space will lead the consortium, which brings together:

• Capgemini, responsible for radio access solutions and 4G/5G core networks.

• Thales, which will assess the feasibility of a 5G D2D terminal with a directional antenna operating in the future C band.

• Orange, which will contribute its operator expertise and host the demonstration at its Bercenay facility in France.

• SES, in charge of studying the implementation of D2D services.

• Qualcomm, which will supply a 5G NTN-compatible test mobile terminal.

• Loft Orbital, responsible for the platform, AIT (assembly, integration, testing), launch reservation and satellite operations for the demonstration phase.

“This new 5G D2D project paves the way for Thales Alenia Space to provide high-speed coverage in areas not served by terrestrial networks, as well as emergency or continuity services in crisis situations,” said Stéphane Anjuère, 5G Venture Leader for Thales Alenia Space. “By leveraging its expertise in geostationary telecommunications and medium- and low-Earth orbit constellations, our company has played a key role in the standardization of 5G by satellite and is ideally positioned to support future large-scale 5G D2D projects.”

“This pioneering 5G-by-satellite project represents a major breakthrough for Thales and the telecommunications industry,” said Alexandre Bottero, VP Networks and Infrastructure Systems for Thales. “By developing 5G NTN D2D modem solutions enabling high-speed connectivity, even in the most remote areas, we’re laying the groundwork for the future of global communications and stepping up our commitment to a more connected and resilient world.”

""This project perfectly emphasizes Capgemini's commitment to pushing the boundaries of connectivity. Thanks to our unique expertise in integrating terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks, in addition to our mastery of radio access solutions and 4G/5G core networks, Capgemini is playing a key role in demonstrating 5G via satellite,"" said Angélique Lallouet, Executive Director of Capgemini Engineering in France. ""We are particularly proud to be contributing to this strategic initiative alongside Thales Alenia Space, Thales, and all of our partners, and to be collaborating once again with CNES to advance French and European technological sovereignty.""

Are companies blindly investing in AI?

With AI use skyrocketing in recent years, the focus has largely been on the companies behind the AI tools we use, and not the companies using them.

For example, Google recently uncovered a 27% rise in its data center energy consumption during the last half of 2024 and the first half of 2025. Microsoft saw a 168% rise in total energy consumption between 2020 and 2024.

Companies aren’t just failing on sustainability – one in five (21%) aren’t satisfied with their outcomes so far, and many note “bill shocks,” where scaling AI efforts outpace initial projections.

“Rapid adoption doesn’t necessarily translate into large scale deployment with tangible ROI,” CTO Franck Greverie explained.

Looking ahead, more companies are turning to small language models for increase cost effectiveness, with 12% of IT budgets on average dedicated to generative AI alone.

However, investing freely in AI isn’t the most effective solution. Greverie explained that “enterprises must set up a solid data foundation, in a trusted environment that’s compliant, secure and ensures necessary privacy” to see the biggest ROI.

Looking ahead, Capgemini suggests a more targeted approach to keep a handle on the environmental and economic impacts of AI, and that started with establishing governance policies (which only 46% have done) and focusing on high-impact areas like customer operations, marketing and risk management.

(NASDAQ: GRRR) in the Asia-Pacific region underscores a pivotal shift in public-sector AI adoption. This one-year deal, focused on AI-first smart policing and GPU-as-a-Service for a national investigative bureau, marks Gorilla’s second consecutive AI-led national enforcement deployment in 2025 and solidifies its position as a leader in AI-based IPDR analytics in the APAC region [1]. The platform leverages Gorilla’s proprietary AI inference engines to reconstruct historical network traffic, detect anomalies, and analyze petabytes of metadata for real-time decision-making and post-incident forensics [1]. This win aligns with the company’s broader strategy of offering long-term AI partnerships, emphasizing compute scale-up, edge-cloud federation, and national model training capabilities [2].

Public-Sector AI Adoption in Asia: A Catalyst for Growth

Asia’s public-sector AI adoption is accelerating at an unprecedented pace. According to a report by IDC, the APAC public cloud services market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.8% from 2025 to 2029, driven by AI and machine learning integration into digital infrastructure modernization [2]. Generative AI (GenAI) adoption in the region now ranks second globally, with companies prioritizing cost savings and revenue growth through AI scaling [3]. Governments are increasingly deploying AI-powered tools such as chatbots, predictive analytics, and machine learning to enhance citizen engagement, automate administrative tasks, and bolster public safety [4].

However, challenges persist. A Capgemini study reveals that only 21% of public-sector organizations in Asia possess the data readiness required to train and fine-tune AI models, a critical barrier to progress [4]. Despite this, 90% of these organizations plan to explore agentic AI within the next 2-3 years, signaling a long-term commitment to AI-driven governance [4]. The region’s strategic focus on AI infrastructure—exemplified by China’s AI Global Governance Action Plan and Japan’s flexible regulatory approach—further underscores its potential to reshape tech company valuations [1].

Gorilla’s Strategic Positioning and Market Implications

Gorilla’s AI Government Intelligence contract is emblematic of a broader trend: governments prioritizing AI for operational efficiency and national security. The company’s 5G AI Lawful Interception platform, previously deployed in the region, demonstrates its ability to deliver scalable, mission-critical solutions [4]. By offering GPU-as-a-Service, Gorilla addresses a key bottleneck in public-sector AI adoption—access to high-performance computing resources—while aligning with national strategies to build self-reliant AI ecosystems [1].

The financial implications for Gorilla are significant. As AI infrastructure demand surges, firms that provide specialized tools for data analytics, edge-cloud integration, and real-time decision support are poised to see valuation growth. Statista projects the global AI market to reach $244.22 billion in 2025, with a 26.6% annual growth rate through 2031 [5]. For Gorilla, this contract not only validates its technological capabilities but also positions it to capitalize on recurring revenue streams from long-term AI partnerships with government agencies.

Long-Term Valuation Drivers for Tech Firms

The APAC AI Outlook 2025 highlights a decisive shift in enterprise AI strategies, with ROI becoming the central metric for evaluating AI investments [3]. Public-sector contracts like Gorilla’s are particularly valuable because they often involve multi-year engagements and large-scale infrastructure deployments, providing stable revenue and high margins. Additionally, the Nimdzi 100 report notes that AI-driven services such as machine translation and generative AI are reshaping the language services industry, with AI capabilities now a key factor in M&A activity and business strategy [5].

For investors, the key takeaway is clear: tech companies that can bridge the gap between AI innovation and public-sector needs—particularly in data readiness, ethical governance, and scalable infrastructure—will see disproportionate valuation gains. Gorilla’s focus on GPU-as-a-Service and national model training aligns directly with these priorities, offering a blueprint for sustainable growth in an increasingly AI-centric world.

Conclusion

Gorilla Technology’s AI Government Intelligence win in Asia is more than a single contract—it is a harbinger of a larger transformation in public-sector AI adoption. As governments across the APAC region invest heavily in AI infrastructure to enhance governance, security, and efficiency, companies like Gorilla that offer tailored, scalable solutions will see their valuations rise in tandem. For investors, the lesson is straightforward: the intersection of AI innovation and public-sector demand represents one of the most compelling growth opportunities in the tech sector today.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 17:15:49.750868

I like to make something beautiful when I run.” Utility Global runs the same way.","The weather in Eugene, Oregon, in late September 1969 is unseasonably cold. Upper 40s, a sharp bite in the morning air. Fog lies heavy in the Willamette Valley, pressed down by a temperature inversion, cool air trapped beneath a warmer ceiling. The moisture condenses into a gray curtain, a veil between the runner and the world beyond. Out of this mist, Steve Prefontaine drives forward, all chest and fury, running not behind anyone but in front — a punishing pace, reckless to the cautious, inevitable to him. Too fast and you are a sprinter, burning out before the bell. Too slow and you are invisible, off the podium, forgotten. Pre chooses the only path that feels true: hammering through the fog, into the unknown, sustained not by strategy but by courage.

Fifty years later, hydrogen faces its own fog. The mist is not weather but confusion — over subsidies, policy roadmaps, and uncertain timelines. The pace is not a 5,000-meter race but the brutal search for the right scale, the right partners, and the right commercialization pathways. The wooded trails of Eugene become the backwoods of energy transition — brownfield sites, blast furnaces, and dairies where novel technology must prove itself under punishing conditions. Companies like ArcelorMittal want real decarbonization in this decade, not airy promises. But steelmaking is not built for speed, and hydrogen cannot be a sprint. It takes endurance, grit, and the willingness to run alone when others falter.

That’s where Utility Global appears out of the fog, built like a runner for the long race. The company’s edge begins with technology — its eXERO™ platform, a way to produce hydrogen from off-gases and water without electricity. From that technology flows commercial traction: projects in steel plants, biogas dairies, and mobility depots where the economics already work. From traction comes the partner edge: ArcelorMittal investing and testing in Brazil, Hanwha and Kunhwa backing projects in Korea, dairies in California signing up. And from technology, traction, and partnerships comes the final edge — a steady, deep-pocketed investor base, led by Ara Partners, that ensures the company can keep its punishing pace while others slow.

Edge One: Technology

For any endurance runner, lungs and legs come first. For Utility Global, the foundation is its eXERO™ / H2Gen® platform. Where most hydrogen technologies lean on grid electricity to split water, eXERO™ does something startling: it converts industrial off-gases and water into concentrated hydrogen and a pure stream of CO₂ — without using electricity.

In one compact reactor, blast furnace gas becomes high-purity hydrogen. Biogas from dairies or landfills is stripped down directly, with no need to upgrade to pipeline-quality renewable natural gas. Inert gases, methane slip, CO₂ slip — all handled in stride. The design is modular, scalable, low-pressure, and small-footprint. Like Pre’s stride, it looks punishing, but it works.

This is “electrolysis without electricity” — a simplification so radical it cuts both cost and complexity. It takes entropy streams — the messy gases industry discards — and turns them into persistence fuel. Just as Pre’s physiology let him run through the mist when others faded, Utility Global’s technology lets it run where others stumble.

Edge Two: Commercial Traction

Technology by itself is promise. Traction is proof. Utility Global has logged miles where many others haven’t.

Brazil: At ArcelorMittal’s Juiz de Fora plant, a FEED study is under way. Three tons per day of hydrogen will flow directly back into the steel process, displacing natural gas and lowering costs while the enriched CO₂ stream simplifies capture.

California: Small, stranded biogas streams are notoriously uneconomic. Utility Global’s first dairy project not only monetizes these flows, but is expected to set the lowest carbon intensity score ever recorded in the state: minus 875. That earns a $12.75/kg LCFS credit, but the project works even before counting incentives.

South Korea: With Hanwha and Kunhwa, the company is tackling mobility — converting landfill and wastewater gas into hydrogen for buses and trucks. South Korea’s roadmap calls for 300,000 hydrogen vehicles by 2030.

India: With more than 150 blast furnaces, India is a steel superpower. Utility Global is starting there, leveraging off-take certainty before pivoting to mobility and industrial biogas.

Each of these projects is a race in its own right, and Utility Global is not jogging. It is testing itself in steel furnaces, dairy lagoons, and chemical complexes, showing that endurance is not a metaphor but a business model.

Edge Three: Partner Edge

In Eugene, Pre was famous for forcing the field to run his race. Utility Global is doing something similar — turning partners into participants.

ArcelorMittal is not just a customer, but an investor and host. Its XCarb® Innovation Fund put capital into Utility’s Series C and opened its furnaces as proving ground. Hanwha and Kunhwa are not just Korean names on a slide deck — they’re committing to projects on the ground. California dairies are not just off-takers — they’re part of the economics.

This alignment is rare in hydrogen. Too many companies chase customers while begging for subsidies. Utility’s edge is that its partners are co-runners, buying in because the economics already clear. Pre once said he ran to make the other guy hurt first; Utility Global is running a pace that brings partners along because it works.

Edge Four: Investor Edge

Endurance also requires a sponsor, the deep pocket that carries the runner through training blocks and travel. For Utility Global, that role is played by Ara Partners, a private equity firm focused on industrial decarbonization. Ara has backed the company steadily, bridging from intellectual property to asset deployment.

Around Ara stand other heavyweights: OPG Pension Plan, ArcelorMittal, Aramco Ventures, Saint-Gobain. These are not momentum tourists. They are investors with patience and depth, aligned with the long race.

And then there is the team. CEO Parker Meeks came from commercial strategy, determined to build a company not dependent on subsidy. COO Derek Kramer scaled Archaea to a $4 billion BP acquisition. CCO Flagler Novak has decades at Chevron and GE. Together, they are the coaching staff — veterans who know endurance is about building a team, not just a technology.

Pratfalls Avoided, Endurance Secured

Hydrogen has been littered with pratfalls. Overbuilt electrolyzers chasing subsidies. Projects that penciled only on paper. Companies that sprinted on policy winds and collapsed in the headwinds of reality.

Utility Global has avoided those pratfalls by setting its own punishing pace. Technology first, traction next, partners next, investors last. It is not glamorous, but it is enduring.

From Cow Pasture to Cathedral

Hayward Field, where Pre ran, was once a cow pasture. Out of manure and mud came a cathedral of running. From those early mornings in Eugene mist, Nike was born.

Utility Global is taking a similar path. From dairy lagoons, from blast furnace gas, from refinery flares — it is building persistence out of waste. Hydrogen for industry, concentrated CO₂ for capture, a pathway to decarbonization that is both practical and enduring.

GTESI Signal Read: Utility Global

GTESI—the General Theory of Evolutionary Systems & Information—is a practical framework for understanding which systems persist, adapt, or collapse—and why.

Rooted in thermodynamics, information theory, and systems evolution, GTESI unifies insights from Shannon, Feynman, Einstein, and Ricardo to track how systems maintain coherence under pressure. It doesn’t replace spreadsheets—it explains why they sometimes stop making sense.

GTESI identifies the hidden architecture of persistence in technologies, policies, and organizations. It highlights failure points before collapse, and strengths before scale.

GTESI’s Four Vectors

Vector Description Utility Global Signal IPR – Inverse Persistence Ratio

“Value without memory”

Measures the gap between symbolic persistence (hype, valuation) and structural memory (plants, cashflow, execution). A high IPR warns of symbolic inflation—but a low IPR signals deep-rooted resilience others miss. Resilient (Low IPR). Utility Global anchors in brownfield deployments and on-site off-take. Cashflow from steel and dairies grounds the story in durable assets. SCD – Symbolic Compression Divergence

“When story breaks from system”

Tracks alignment between narrative and operations. Rising SCD means story and system drift apart. Aligned (Tight SCD). “Electrolysis without electricity” is not just a phrase — it’s what the reactor delivers. Narrative and operations move in lockstep. TRFI – Trust Ritual Friction Index

“Rituals keep systems sane”

Measures performance of symbolic trust behaviors (filings, roadmaps, continuity). Rising TRFI signals adaptive stress. Smooth (Low Friction). Partners like ArcelorMittal are both investors and customers. Pilots, FEED, and filings are being met — trust rituals intact. EED – Entropy Export Delta

“Adaptation stalls, pressure builds”

Captures how effectively a system offloads entropy—through growth, alliances, simplification. A low EED is a valve; a high EED risks rupture. Healthy (Strong Export). Converts entropy-rich off-gases into hydrogen and CO₂, with alliances in steel, dairies, and refining acting as pressure-release valves.

Closing Kick

“No one will ever win a 5,000-meter race by running an easy first two miles. Not against me.” Steve Prefontaine didn’t run to conserve. He ran to test who had the guts to endure a punishing pace — and then, at the end, punish himself even more. “It’s not who’s the best,” he said. “It’s who can take the most pain.” Pre turned running into creation: “Some people create with words or with music or with a brush and paints. I like to make something beautiful when I run.”

Utility Global runs the same way.

Technology without illusion.

Traction without subsidy.

Partnerships with weight.

Investors with endurance.

Hydrogen is not a sprint. It’s a marathon through fog and headwinds, where style is survival and endurance is art. Pre showed it on the track in Eugene. Utility Global is showing it now in steel mills, dairies, and refineries — lungs full, pace relentless, daring the field to keep up.",,N,,2025-09-08 15:16:33.627612

Company Description The Kraft Heinz Company (Parent) The Kraft Heinz is a packaged food company, incorporated on July 2, 2015, following the merger of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. and the H.J.","Deal Overview

On September 02, 2025, The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ: KHC, $27.29, Market Capitalization: $32.30 billion), a leading global packaged food company, announced its intent to spin-off its grocery business while retaining its high-growth condiments and sauces segment. Kraft Heinz has provisionally named its two entities as Global Taste Elevation Co. (RemainCo), focused on condiments and sauces, and North American Grocery Co. (SpinCo), centered on its grocery portfolio.

Post-separation, Global Taste Elevation Co. will retain Kraft Heinz’s iconic global brands and focus on high-growth platforms such as condiments, sauces, and flavor enhancers. With a strong international presence, Global Taste Elevation Co. aims to drive global expansion and elevate everyday meals through its products like Heinz, Kraft, and Philadelphia. In FY24, the Global Taste Elevation Co. segment generated $15.4 billion in revenue (59.7% of total revenue) and approximately $4.0 billion in Adjusted (Adj.) EBITDA (63.5% of total Adj. EBITDA).

The newly formed entity, North American Grocery Co., will be a dedicated North America-focused grocery business, built around trusted household staples including Kraft Mac & Cheese, Oscar Mayer, and Lunchables. With a streamlined portfolio and deep retail relationships, North American Grocery Co. will prioritize operational agility, consumer-centric innovation, and margin expansion in the dynamic US and Canadian markets. In FY24, the North American Grocery Co. segment generated $10.4 billion in revenue (40.3% of total revenue) and approximately $2.3 billion in Adj. EBITDA (36.5% of total Adj. EBITDA).

Kraft Heinz expects $300.0 million in dis-synergies from its business separation, divided equally across three areas. One-third will affect Cost of Goods Sold due to reduced purchasing power and inefficiencies in manufacturing and supply chains. Another third stems from IT-related expenses, including the setup of separate ERP systems, software licenses, and cybersecurity frameworks. The remaining one-third involves SG&A costs, split between restructuring sales and marketing operations and duplicating corporate functions such as finance, HR, and legal. Kraft Heinz was formed in July 2015 through a merger between Kraft Foods Group and H.J. Heinz Company. Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital led the deal to create a global packaged food giant. It combined Kraft’s grocery staples with Heinz’s condiments. Despite high hopes, the merger struggled due to shifting consumer preferences.

The company has been actively reshaping its portfolio to align with evolving consumer preferences for healthier, less processed foods. Recent initiatives include removing artificial dyes from US products and divesting underperforming brands. In May 2025, Kraft Heinz announced a strategic review aimed at unlocking shareholder value, and Berkshire Hathaway relinquished its board seats, signaling potential structural changes.

The separation is expected to be completed in the 2HFY26 and is intended to be tax-free for US federal income tax purposes. Completion is subject to several customary conditions, including final approval by Kraft Heinz Board of Directors, the filing and effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Centerview Partners is serving as financial advisor, and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP are acting as legal advisors.

Deal Rationale

Kraft Heinz’s decision to spin-off its grocery business is a significant step toward improving focus and performance. The move reflects a broader effort to recalibrate the business around its most promising assets and future growth drivers. The new grocery entity will include many of Kraft Heinz’s traditional staples, such as processed cheeses, lunch meats, boxed meals, and snack brands. Meanwhile, Global Taste Elevation Co. will focus on its premium condiments and sauces segment, which has demonstrated stronger growth, higher consumer engagement, and a broader global appeal. The separation allows each business to operate with strategies tailored to their distinct market dynamics, enabling the grocery unit to focus on cost efficiency and potential consolidation in the value segment, while the high growth condiment division can prioritize global expansion and targeted capital investment.

The spin-off also addresses operational inefficiencies that have plagued the company since its 2015 merger, which was driven by aggressive cost-cutting under 3G Capital’s zero-based budgeting model. That approach ultimately failed to deliver sustainable results, leading to a 62.6% fall in stock value since the merger. The operating margin fell to 6.5% in FY24 from 14.4% in FY16. The separation will enable Global Taste Elevation Co. to move forward in areas such as clean-label formulations, bold global flavors, and cross-border expansion, areas where consumer trends are clearly shifting.

Global Taste Elevation Co. will be well-positioned to drive industry leading growth across attractive categories and geographies, leveraging a proven go-to-market model and the brand growth system to deliver scale and performance. Approximately 20.0% of FY24 revenue is from Emerging Markets, and approximately 20.0% through Away from home, which are faster growth segments. Over the longer term, management expects revenue growth in the range of approximately +2.5-3.0%. For North American Grocery Co., management anticipates sales to grow at a very low single digit or LSD (appears around 1.0%) over the long term, but will have strong cash flow generation and margin opportunities.

While the market sees potential for significant value creation if Kraft Heinz’s North American division achieves a meaningful turnaround, the current low single-digit growth expectations suggest it may not justify the approximately $20 billion valuation being attributed to it. However, RemainCo could benefit from a valuation uplift, given its portfolio of high-growth businesses.

Kraft Heinz’s restructuring mirrors a broader industry shift, similar to Kellogg’s 2023 split into Kellanova and WK Kellogg, which helped both companies grow independently. Since then, Kellanova’s stock rose 50.7%, WK Kellogg gained 72.1%, while Kraft Heinz’s shares dropped by 17.5% during the same period. Kraft Heinz has already demonstrated a willingness to pare down its portfolio through the divestment of non-core units, such as its Italian infant nutrition division, signalling that the potential spin-off is part of a larger recalibration of its brand ecosystem. With both Berkshire Hathaway stepping back from board involvement and 3G Capital having exited its stake by the end of 2023, it becomes easier for Kraft Heinz to take a bold step, such as a spin-off.

The Kraft Heinz Company is a global leader in the food and beverage industry, known for its iconic brands. The company operates across three strategic geographic segments: North America, International Developed Markets, and Emerging Markets. Kraft Heinz delivers products that span eight consumer driven platforms, including Taste Elevation, Easy Ready Meals, Substantial Snacking, Desserts, Hydration, Cheese, Coffee, and Meats. These platforms are aligned with strategic roles to accelerate growth, protect core categories, and balance the portfolio.

With a strong presence in retail, e-commerce, and foodservice channels, Kraft Heinz leverages its scale and agility to meet evolving consumer needs. The company’s brand portfolio includes globally recognized names such as Kraft, Heinz, Oscar Mayer, Philadelphia, Velveeta, and Lunchables, supported by a robust intellectual property strategy and regional adaptations that ensure relevance across diverse markets.

North America

North America is the cornerstone of Kraft Heinz’s global operations, encompassing the US and Canada. This segment is home to many of the company’s most iconic brands, including Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Heinz, Philadelphia, Lunchables, Velveeta, Ore-Ida, Capri Sun, Maxwell House, Kool-Aid, and Jell-O. These brands are deeply embedded in American households and are central to platforms like Taste Elevation, Easy Ready Meals, and Meats. The segment focuses on delivering convenience, comfort, and quality through trusted products that span condiments, cheeses, snacks, beverages, and ready to-eat meals. The North America segment generated 75.6% of FY24 revenue.

Kraft Heinz continues to invest in digital transformation, supply chain modernization, and consumer insights to drive innovation and efficiency. The North America segment is characterized by strong retail partnerships, including Walmart, and a strategic emphasis on pricing agility, promotional effectiveness, and operational excellence. It also plays a key role in shaping the company’s sustainability agenda, with initiatives aimed at reducing packaging waste and improving nutritional profiles.

International Developed Markets

The International Developed Markets segment includes operations in Europe and the Pacific, where Kraft Heinz adapts its global brands to regional tastes and preferences. Key brands in this segment include Heinz, Golden Circle, Wattie’s, and Plasmon. The segment is known for its premium offerings in sauces, baby food, and beverages, and leverages the strong equity of the Heinz brand to expand across categories and channels. Regional innovation is a hallmark of this segment, with tailored products that reflect local culinary traditions and consumer expectations. The International Developed Markets segment generated 13.7% of FY24 revenue.

This segment is also focused on sustainability and digital growth, with increasing investments in e-commerce, data analytics, and environmentally responsible sourcing. Strategic partnerships and retail expansion are helping Kraft Heinz strengthen its footprint in developed international markets. The company is also recovering from prior-year disruptions, such as Cyclone Gabrielle in Australia and New Zealand, and is enhancing its supply chain resilience to better serve consumers across Europe and the Pacific.

Emerging Markets

Emerging Markets represent Kraft Heinz’s growth frontier, spanning Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. This segment includes a mix of global and locally resonant brands such as Heinz, Master, Quero, Kraft, and Pudliszki. The company tailors its offerings to meet diverse consumer needs, often through smaller pack sizes, localized flavors, and affordable formats. Platforms like Taste Elevation and Easy Ready Meals are adapted to regional preferences, enabling Kraft Heinz to build relevance and loyalty in fast-growing markets. The Emerging Markets segment generated 10.7% of FY24 revenue.

The segment is focused on expanding its reach through strategic investments in go-to market capabilities, brand building, and digital channels. Kraft Heinz is also streamlining operations through targeted divestitures, such as the sale of its infant nutrition business in Russia and its Papua New Guinea subsidiary. Despite macroeconomic challenges and currency volatility, Emerging Markets continue to offer significant long-term potential, driven by rising middle-class demand and increasing urbanization.

2QFY25

Total revenue fell by 1.9% YoY to $6.3 billion (+1.3% vs. consensus), primarily due to volume/mix declines in North America and International Developed Markets, especially in cold cuts, Lunchables, frozen snacks, and powdered beverages, partially offset by pricing gains and strong growth in Emerging Markets. North America segment revenue fell by 3.3% YoY to $4.7 billion, due to lower volumes in key categories like cold cuts, frozen snacks, and powdered beverages, and commodity inflation pressures that offset pricing and efficiency gains. Emerging Markets segment revenue improved 4.2% YoY to $698.0 million, driven by strong double-digit growth in the Heinz brand and successful execution of the go-to-market model, with gains from both pricing and volume/mix across Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Segment revenue from International Developed Markets increased by 1.4% YoY to $897.0 million, driven by a higher pricing in select categories, offset by input cost inflation, particularly in coffee. Adjusted operating profit fell 7.5% YoY to $1.3 billion (+5.4% vs. consensus), and the corresponding margin contracted ~122 bps to 20.1%, due to commodity cost inflation and unfavorable volume/mix, which outweighed pricing gains and efficiency initiatives. Adjusted net profit declined 12.8% YoY to $822.0 million (+8.1% vs. consensus), and the corresponding margin contracted ~162 bps to 12.9%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $0.69 (2Q24: $0.78), beating the consensus estimates by 8.2%.

FY24

Total revenue fell by 3.0% YoY to $25.8 billion (-0.4% vs. consensus), due to lower volumes from economic uncertainty and weak demand for key products like Lunchables and Kraft Macaroni & Cheese. Planned exits from low-margin businesses and a temporary plant closure also impacted sales. Emerging Markets segment revenue declined 4.3% YoY to $2.8 billion, due to continued softness in Brazil and China, which offset strong double-digit growth in other countries. North America segment revenue fell by 2.9% YoY to $19.5 billion, due to lower volumes and reduced demand. Segment revenue from International Developed Markets decreased by 2.4% YoY to $3.5 billion, due to volume pressure from customer negotiations and declines in non-core categories.

Adjusted operating profit grew 1.2% YoY to $5.4 billion (+0.1% vs. consensus), and the corresponding margin expanded ~85 bps to 20.7%, driven by higher pricing, lower variable compensation, and efficiency gains in procurement and logistics. Adjusted net profit grew 1.3% YoY to $3.7 billion (+2.2% vs. consensus), and the corresponding margin expanded ~60 bps to 14.4%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $3.06 (FY23: $2.98), beating the consensus estimates by 1.8%.

“Following today’s regulatory action by the Nevada Board of Pharmacy, CVS Pharmacy will ensure COVID-19 vaccinations are available as soon as possible at our pharmacies throughout the state,” a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement Friday.

CVS previously announced it would not offer the updated COVID vaccine in Nevada and two other states because they only allow pharmacists to administer drugs that have been approved by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. That panel has not approved this season’s COVID vaccine and now includes vaccine skeptics appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

According to The Nevada Independent, which first reported the new guidance, the Board of Pharmacy’s position is that pharmacists are allowed to widely administer vaccines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The Board of Pharmacy did not immediately respond to the Current on Friday afternoon. The board’s website, which typically lists regulations and announcements, is currently offline because it was impacted by the recent ransomware attack on the state’s information technology.

A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, who on Thursday called the state to take action as soon as possible to address vaccine access, said the legislative leader plans to review the new guidance “to determine whether this is a sufficient long-term fix or whether it’s just a temporary solution and further action may be needed.”

Recent data reveals that AI adoption has surged, with firms across sectors like finance, healthcare, and retail embedding machine learning models into their workflows. Yet, this enthusiasm comes at a cost, as AI systems demand vast amounts of energy for training and operation, contributing to rising carbon emissions and resource strain.

Executives, under pressure to stay competitive, are increasingly viewing AI as indispensable, even as evidence mounts of its ecological footprint. A study highlighted in a TechRadar article underscores this mindset, noting that many organizations believe the benefits of AI outweigh its environmental drawbacks. This perspective is echoed in reports from consulting giants, where leaders admit to sidelining sustainability metrics in favor of rapid deployment.

The Hidden Costs of AI Expansion

The environmental impact of AI is not abstract; it’s rooted in the infrastructure that powers it. Data centers, the backbone of AI computations, consume electricity equivalent to entire cities, with cooling systems alone guzzling water resources at alarming rates. According to insights from the Daily Star, a Capgemini report details how AI’s energy demands are skyrocketing, yet corporate investment in the technology shows no signs of slowing. This blind spot persists despite warnings from environmental groups about increased greenhouse gas emissions tied directly to AI workloads.

Compounding the issue, many companies lack the tools or incentives to measure AI’s full carbon footprint. Pre-trained models from third-party providers, used by over three-quarters of organizations, obscure transparency, making it difficult to track emissions. As noted in another TechRadar piece, only a small fraction of firms actively quantify their generative AI’s environmental effects, with sustainability often ranking low in model selection criteria.

Regulatory Pressures and Industry Responses

Big tech’s push for deregulation adds another layer of complexity. Companies are lobbying to ease environmental protections that hinder the construction of massive data centers, as reported by PBS News Weekend. This drive stems from the need for speed in AI development, but it risks exacerbating pollution and resource depletion in sensitive areas. The Trump administration’s apparent support for such easing has sparked debates among policymakers and environmentalists alike.

Meanwhile, some forward-thinking firms are exploring mitigation strategies, such as shifting to renewable energy sources or opting for smaller, more efficient AI models. However, these efforts remain piecemeal. A United Nations Environment Programme analysis emphasizes the need for global standards to address AI’s e-waste and fossil fuel dependency, warning that without intervention, the technology’s growth could undermine broader climate goals.

Balancing Innovation with Accountability

For industry insiders, the challenge lies in reconciling AI’s transformative potential with ethical stewardship. Uncertainty about emissions data, as discussed in a TechRadar commentary, is stifling sustainable innovation, forcing businesses to choose between blind advancement and potential backlash. Experts argue that accurate supplier transparency is key, yet many UK firms, for instance, doubt their ability to measure tech-related emissions reliably.

As AI integration deepens, the onus falls on corporate leaders to embed environmental considerations into their strategies. Ignoring the issue not only invites regulatory scrutiny but also reputational risks in an era of heightened climate awareness. Ultimately, the path forward demands a cultural shift: viewing AI not as a panacea exempt from accountability, but as a tool that must evolve in harmony with planetary limits. With reports like those from Capgemini signaling a slow awakening, the question remains whether companies will act before the environmental costs become irreversible.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-d4bfe211-1b61-48cd-89cd-5f23ed27019e.jpeg,N,,2025-09-08 14:20:30.568397

By Gianluca Lo Nostro

Sept 8 (Reuters) – Paris prosecutors opened a criminal probe into Philips PHG.AS in June over its recall of sleep apnea devices, probing possible charges including aggravated fraud and failure to report safety incidents that could cause death, they said on Monday.

The 2021 recall affected about 15 million machines worldwide, including 350,000 in France, after concerns emerged that degrading polyurethane foam could cause health problems ranging from headaches and respiratory irritation to potential cancer risks.

The Paris Public Health division confirmed on Monday that it had received 104 individual complaints, prosecutors said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

The judicial investigation was formally opened on June 12 after a preliminary inquiry by the Central Office for the Fight against Environmental and Public Health Damage (OCLAESP).

In response, a Philips spokesperson said this is not a new investigation.

“Ongoing proceedings launched in 2023 cover the alleged activities of Philips in the lead up to and during 2021 recall. The proceeding does not make allegations about the quality and safety of products currently marketed in France by Philips.”

The company will continue to engage constructively in the required court processes, the spokesperson told Reuters.

The fraud charges in the Philips case carry severe criminal penalties under French law. For aggravated fraud involving endangering human health, individuals face up to seven years’ imprisonment and fines of 750,000 euros, while corporations can be fined up to 3.75 million euros, prosecutors said.

The pilot plant is expected to capture around one tonne of CO2 per day.
Meanwhile, the US and Canada paper industry emits approximately 144 million tonnes of CO2 each year.
Finland’s forest industry, particularly its pulp and paper sector, is a major part of the national economy.","A new carbon capture pilot plant has come online at a pulp mill in Rauma, Finland, owned and operated by Finnish forest industry company Metsä Group.

The plant, which was supplied by technology company Andritz, will capture carbon dioxide emitted from the production of pulp to supply industries like paper and packaging.

The pilot plant is expected to capture around one tonne of CO2 per day. It is planned for a larger scale demo plant to be built at the site, capable of capturing between 30,000 and 100,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.

The captured CO2 could be used as feedstock for industries like chemicals and fuel and could replace fossil-based raw materials.

“Capture-related investments are large, and the market is underdeveloped, so we’re proceeding gradually,” said Kaija Pehu-Lehtonen, SVP Business Development and director of the project.

“In addition, the value chains from raw material to finished products are often new and complex, requiring close cooperation between the participants and an insight into industrial operations.”

According to SLB Capturi, Europe’s pulp and paper industry released 86.4 million tonnes of CO2 in 2023. Meanwhile, the US and Canada paper industry emits approximately 144 million tonnes of CO2 each year.

Between 75% and 100% of the CO2 emissions from a pulp mill come from biomass, depending on the fuel source for the power boiler and lime kiln.

Most of the CO2 is produced through chemical pulping processes like the Kraft process, which separate cellulose fibres from lignin – a polymer present in plants. Other sources of emissions at a pulp and paper plant include the lime kiln, where lime mud is heated to recover lime, and sometimes from a bark or auxiliary boiler.

Finland’s forest industry, particularly its pulp and paper sector, is a major part of the national economy. Much of this industry is fuelled by woody biomass, which accounts for as much as 70% of renewable energy in the country.

However, environmental organisations have raised concerns over the sector’s sustainability. Because woody biomass is the country’s fastest growing source of biomass energy, there has been a major increase in logging. This is linked to an increase in biomass burning in heat and power plants, resulting in the country’s land sector becoming a source of emissions rather than a sink.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/04/shutterstock_1326851294.jpg",N,,2025-09-08 14:19:52.982138

Janus Henderson is reportedly transitioning from State Street Alpha, a portfolio management and analytics platform first launched in 2019, to Aladdin. It is alleged that 50 people in Janus Henderson's UK back office team have been put at risk of termination (as is the process with layoffs in the UK) as part of this transition.

The firm has over 1,000 employees in EMEA, and hired 57 full-time employees in the region last year, according to its annual report. Janus Henderson declined to comment on the layoffs.

Workers in East London and Gqeberha will lose jobs as the company struggles with lost contracts worth billions.

This follows 134 jobs already cut when eyedrops factory closed earlier this year after contamination warnings.

Almost 1,000 Aspen workers now face losing their jobs. The pharmaceutical company announced 923 new cuts on top of 208 jobs already lost this year.

The company sent workers and unions a formal notice. General manager Branson Bosman said rising costs and lost contracts left them no choice.

This hits families in East London and Gqeberha hardest. Aspen employs more than 2,500 people in these cities.

The company lost a R2-billion contract. It also had to close its eyedrops factory in Gqeberha after US health officials warned about contamination risks.

Union organiser Karools Adams from Ceppwawu said they are still fighting the first round of job cuts. He accused Aspen of starting new cuts while the earlier dispute continues.

Workers and unions will meet at the labour court on 11 September. They want to stop the cuts or get better deals for families losing income.

Other big companies are also cutting jobs this year. Goodyear shut its Kariega factory and cut 900 jobs. Steel company ArcelorMittal, mining company Glencore and Ford also announced cuts.

Aspen spokesperson Shauneen Beukes refused to comment on the job cuts. Bosman told unions no date has been set yet. The final number depends on talks with unions and what the business needs.

By walking away from the planned Boardman, Oregon hydrogen production and storage complex, they’ve dealt a blow to the taxpayer-funded Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub (PNWH2 Hub).

Boardman Project Collapse

Remember that initial $27.5 million federal grant and the whisper of up to $1 billion in total funding? The PNWH2 Hub was supposed to ignite a wave of clean hydrogen via electrolysis. But after Mitsubishi Power’s exit and PGE’s announcement on January 8, 2025, things went quiet. Local partners—who were banking on Northwest hydropower and cheap renewables—are now left picking up the pieces.

Why It Fell Apart

Partner Withdrawal: Mitsubishi Power’s unexpected pull-out snatched away the engineering expertise and financial backing the project needed.

Economics Under Strain: Sky-high upfront costs, shaky utility rate impacts, and a shrinking window on hydrogen tax credits (set to expire end-2027) made any business case wobbly.

Federal Review: DOE Secretary Chris Wright ordered a department-wide audit of hydrogen hubs, flagging “low value” ventures for potential defunding.

“It’s not just this site—hydrogen projects worldwide are getting delayed or canceled thanks to slow demand and steep costs,” analysts point out.

Wider Implications

The Boardman pull-out sends ripples across the region:

Air Liquide had plans for a hydrogen liquefaction plant at Port of Morrow, tied to PGE/Mitsubishi’s supply. Now its timeline’s up in the air.

Atlas Agro and AltaGas—working on green fertilizer and hydrogen-for-industry schemes near Richland and Ferndale—are still pressing ahead but must first lock in huge renewable power deals.

First Mode exited the PNWH2 mix after filing for bankruptcy in late 2024.

These delays threaten jobs, stall new hydrogen infrastructure investments, and hamper regional efforts to decarbonize tough industries like heavy transport and fertilizer production.

Tech Snapshot

Green hydrogen through electrolysis splits water into H₂ and O₂ using renewable electricity—think wind, solar, and the region’s abundant hydropower. It’s a near-zero-emissions dream, but only if electricity stays cheap and plentiful.

Strategic Angle

With the hydrogen tax credit construction window slamming shut in 2027, developers face a classic crunch: race to build at higher capex risk, or stall and forfeit subsidies. Utilities like PGE dread passing extra costs to ratepayers, while shaky national policy has investors looking elsewhere. These financial headwinds threaten to stall wider hydrogen infrastructure and derail the region’s sustainable energy goals.

Maverick’s Take

Look, I’ve seen plenty of flashy hydrogen announcements, but the Boardman fiasco is a cold splash of reality. You can’t paper over tough economics or the need for rock-solid power. Sure, the Northwest’s hydropower edge is real, but if your numbers don’t pencil out, you’re sunk. And let’s be honest—a project that’s not on the DOE’s “approved” list might as well not exist.

So what’s next? Do regional players pivot to smaller, modular electrolyzers? Or shift to other decarbonization paths? That’s the million-dollar question.

For now, the Pacific Northwest’s hydrogen ambitions are on ice—until someone cracks the code on cost and policy certainty.

About the Companies

Portland General Electric, based in Oregon, is a leading regional utility pushing clean projects into the grid. Mitsubishi Power, part of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, brings turbines and hydrogen engineering solutions to the table.

What’s Next

Regional leaders—Senators Maria Cantwell, Ron Wyden, Jeff Merkley, and Patty Murray—are rallying to defend hub funding. But even staunch political backing only goes so far when the financials just don’t add up.

(Reuters) - Paris prosecutors opened a criminal probe into Philips in June over its recall of sleep apnea devices, probing possible charges including aggravated fraud and failure to report safety incidents that could cause death, they said on Monday.

The 2021 recall affected about 15 million machines worldwide, including 350,000 in France, after concerns emerged that degrading polyurethane foam could cause health problems ranging from headaches and respiratory irritation to potential cancer risks.

The Paris Public Health division confirmed on Monday that it had received 104 individual complaints, prosecutors said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

The judicial investigation was formally opened on June 12 after a preliminary inquiry by the Central Office for the Fight against Environmental and Public Health Damage (OCLAESP).

In response, a Philips spokesperson said this is not a new investigation.

""Ongoing proceedings launched in 2023 cover the alleged activities of Philips in the lead up to and during 2021 recall. The proceeding does not make allegations about the quality and safety of products currently marketed in France by Philips.""

The company will continue to engage constructively in the required court processes, the spokesperson told Reuters.

The fraud charges in the Philips case carry severe criminal penalties under French law. For aggravated fraud involving endangering human health, individuals face up to seven years' imprisonment and fines of 750,000 euros, while corporations can be fined up to 3.75 million euros, prosecutors said.

Last year, Philips agreed to pay $1.1 billion (937.5 million euros) to settle related litigation in the United States.

Philips shares were down 1% by 1400 GMT after they fell nearly 5% following reports of a new French criminal probe.

Full transcript - Barclays 23rd Annual Global Financial Services Conference:

Jason, Host, Barclays: Let me just join you, Vancannah’s comments from earlier, just welcoming everyone to our 23rd annual Global Financial Services Conference. I’m very pleased you could all make it. I can’t miss this opportunity. In the back is our kind of updated marketing deck and posters, so please make sure to grab them at some point over the next three days. We’re very pleased to have kicking off our kind of company sections, Huntington Bancshares, to start it off from the company of Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer, Brant Standridge, who runs Consumer and Regional Banking. They’re going to start off with a few prepared remarks. I’m not sure if you saw they posted some slides early this morning, and then we’re going to jump right into Q&A. As they kind of come up here, I’d just like to put up the first ARS question.

What we’re going to have throughout the three days in the conference, and we’ve done this every year since 2012, is just put up questions in front of you. You should have kind of clickers. They look like the 1998 BlackBerrys. To answer these, we’ll compile the data, publish it at the end. The first question is the same for every company. What is your current position in the shares? And then you characterize your positioning. We look at how that evolved over time, as well as kind of rank the banks at the end, it’s pretty neat. Throughout our conversation, we’re going to pull up questions to kind of poll the audience and kind of get management’s reactions when appropriate, kind of in real time, to the extent that it maybe differs from the current market view is.

I’ll pull up there, hand it over to these guys, and then we’ll be back.

Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer, Huntington Bancshares: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Thank you, Jason and Barclays, for hosting us. I am pleased to share an update on Huntington’s accomplishments in the third quarter and detail our progress toward our goals that we articulated at our Investor Day in February. Before we get started, please review slide two and three, which apply to forward-looking statements we will make today. Beginning on slide four, there are four key messages I want to share with you today. First, we continue to execute on our growth strategy, which remains primarily oriented toward organic initiatives in both our core and new markets. To accomplish this, we implement a proven playbook that enables us to deliver national-scale products and capabilities in a localized manner in our regions with outstanding results. Second, we’re driving strong profit growth from our combination of revenue expansion and positive operating leverage.

Third, strong credit quality remains a hallmark of Huntington. Our growth is occurring within our longstanding risk framework. Fourth, we are well positioned for outperformance through a range of economic conditions and interest rate environments by virtue of our disciplined approach to capital, liquidity, and credit management. Moving on to slide five, over the past five quarters, we’ve consistently delivered peer-leading loan and deposit growth, and we’ve expanded our key fee income streams while delivering positive operating leverage. Through the second quarter of this year, cumulative loan growth was 7.9%, or seven percentage points better than the peer median. In fact, quarter-to-date loan growth is tracking even better than we had expected, with $2.3 billion of net loan growth as of the end of last month.

NIM in Q3 is also performing very well and above our prior expectations, now trending at around 310 basis points or even higher for the third quarter and around a similar level for the fourth quarter. Our balance sheet remains relatively neutral to changes in the interest rate environment, and we expect NIM not only to trend with a stable trend in the back half of this year, but to then rise into 2026 and 2027, mainly driven by continued benefits from fixed asset repricing and the general upward sloping nature of the yield curve and how it’s evolving. This asset growth and resilient NIM is translating into strong spread revenue growth, and we expect this momentum to continue through the rest of the year and into 2026. We are also advancing a key priority by expanding our payments, wealth, and capital markets fee businesses.

These areas are growing robustly, powering solid overall fee income expansion. We are accomplishing this while sustaining positive operating leverage. We remain focused on our expense management approach, which is centered on delivering positive operating leverage supported by sustained re-engineering of baseline operating costs that creates outsized capacity to invest in revenue growth initiatives. We are on pace to deliver stronger operating leverage in 2025 than we had originally anticipated coming into this year. Turning to slide six, since 2023, our core franchise has been the engine that drives our growth. We are relentless in focus on growing primary bank customers, deepening our relationships with them over time, and continuing to win in the markets in which we have a strong legacy presence.

Within our core over the last two years, we have substantially increased our corporate, middle market, and consumer customers while expanding the breadth of the value-added services we provide them in areas like payments, wealth management, and capital markets. This success is evidenced in our outstanding consumer and business banking household growth and peer-leading loan and deposit growth. This operating and financial performance has enabled us to pursue strategic expansion opportunities from a position of strength. I would like to invite now Brant up to the stage to discuss our model for new market growth.

Brant Standridge, Runs Consumer and Regional Banking, Huntington Bancshares: Thank you, Zach, and Jason. Thank you so much for having us. Turning to slide seven, as Zach just articulated, our position of strength allows us to opportunistically invest in new initiatives. These initiatives take two forms. First, we’ve intentionally grown by adding several new national verticals. This expansion has increased the breadth of expertise available to our existing customers and expanded our reach to new markets and customers. Second, we’ve entered new geographies, notably North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas. As we entered these new geographies, we’ve leveraged the foundation created through our national specialty verticals and added locally focused teams, starting with middle market and regional banking. We believe local colleagues with local relationships integrated with national expertise are valued by customers. I want to take a moment and double-click over the next few slides into our unique and differentiated regional banking business model.

Turning to slide eight, the essential component of our approach is what we have fashioned our regional bank model to deliver. Local relationships, leveraging local relationships, this value proposition is a powerful competitive differentiator. While many banks have shifted towards specialty or vertical alignment, we’ve distinguished ourselves by delivering the full Huntington franchise through our trusted local bankers, creating a more holistic and personalized customer experience. In early 2023, we enhanced our local approach and combined our business bank with the lower middle market, creating a new regional bank segment that covers all business customers under $50 million in revenue, which, as you all know, make up the large majority of businesses in a market. Bottom line, we have the products and expertise of a large national bank, but deliver those through local relationships as an integrated team with the service and attention of a local community bank.

Turning to slide nine, leading this effort, we’ve assigned regional presidents for our 12 regions and empowered them with the enhanced decision-making capabilities and comprehensive P&L accountability. The regional president is responsible for integrating all the lines of business located within a region. This model brings us closer to the customer, differentiates us through greater focus on local, and creates alignment that enables us to go to market as one Huntington team, bringing all the key products and services to bear in a highly coordinated manner for each of our customers. We’ve also continued to invest in building deeper expertise across specialty verticals. These national commercial specialty verticals and our local teams complement each other. The expertise that the specialty teams provide enhances our value to locally managed customers, and the scale of our local teams creates a deeper market opportunity for our specialties.

Turning to slide 10, when we’re establishing a new regional market, we have a two-phase approach. We lead the expansion with our commercial bank and specialty business lines, recruiting talented bankers and credit risk leaders with long tenure and deep local relationships. This approach ensures we have a good client selection aligned to our risk parameters. It also creates an investment profile that drives a quick path to profitability. In fact, we achieve profitability within the first year of both our middle market launches in North Carolina and South Carolina, as well as Texas. Our success with our commercial and specialty business builds the local leadership and brand recognition that supports the opportunity to further expand with the rollout of the complete Huntington franchise, including our consumer business and the build-out of a branch network.

Turning to slide 11, perhaps the most powerful feature of this model is the fact that we’ve successfully implemented it across our regions at scale. This has proven to be a value proposition for our customers across all geographies. The proof points are everywhere. Across our footprint, we’re seeing solid continued growth in established core markets where we have deeply embedded local presence and enjoy high density. We’ve also driven excellent share gains with the newer core markets that came to us in the TCF acquisition and where we continue to expand rapidly and capture the revenue growth synergies we had expected. As we have discussed, we are driving excellent early results from the growth initiatives in our expansion markets. In North Carolina and South Carolina, our model has created a foundation from which we have launched our full franchise.

We’ve already opened the first three of the 55 branches we plan to open, and our early results are very promising. In Texas, our local middle market initiative has been doing exceptionally well. The acquisition of Veritex lines up perfectly with our focus on Dallas, Fort Worth, and Houston. It significantly advances our build-out in those markets and provides a springboard for accelerating growth in Texas over the next several years. Importantly, the regional bank model that I described earlier makes it seamless for us to integrate Veritex into Huntington. We will create two new regions in Dallas, Fort Worth, and Houston, and our operating approach there will be aligned to the way we go to market in other Huntington geographies.

Turning to slide 12 and to wrap up, we, as a management team, have been relentlessly focused on driving growth in both core and expansion markets, scaling our commercial verticals, and deepening customer relationships. Our regional banking model enables us to deliver national capabilities locally, and our disciplined approach ensures we’re building a durable, high-performing franchise that is managed within our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite and existing credit policies. We are energized by the opportunities ahead and confident in our ability to deliver sustained value for our customers, colleagues, and shareholders. Let me turn it to Jason for Q&A.

Jason, Host, Barclays: Thanks, guys. Pretty informative. Maybe we could just start big picture. You mentioned kind of this unique model you have. Just maybe talk to kind of what’s different about your model that allows you to outgrow peers. You showed that loan growth chart. Clearly, you’ve outpaced the industry. At the same time, your credit quality metrics have been probably better than the industry. Maybe just talking to that and I guess how comfortable can we be that you’re putting on this loan growth and we’re not going to see degradation looking out?

Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer, Huntington Bancshares: Sure. I’ll kick that off and then Brant will tack on. I think first and foremost, it starts in the foundational way that we run the business, which is to always be in a position of strength. From a credit perspective, having a very intentionally diversified portfolio, very rigorous upfront client selection, and an ongoing portfolio management approach. Secondly, in terms of liquidity, to make the foundational core deposit engine a critical element of the strategy and always focus on the strength of the liquidity, having the highest insured deposit level of any large bank, having one of the best liquidity profiles of any large bank, and then capital to always ensure that we’ve got the capital to support our customers and then capture new growth opportunities.

We augment that with a rigor and a discipline with how we manage the company where we’re holding accountability, having a strong line of sight to how these new initiatives are going. Lastly, as we’ve said all along, we’re focused on driving strong performance in the core. When we have opportunistically the opportunity to capture a new growth opportunity, we only do that when we know that the team is ready to execute, when they’ve got deep local knowledge and expertise of that segment of the geography, and when we’re prepared to execute in that business the same as we execute across the rest of our business.

Brant Standridge, Runs Consumer and Regional Banking, Huntington Bancshares: Jason, that’s a great question. It starts with the right bankers. This model really allows the bankers who’ve supported relationships for many years to continue to be the central point for those relationships. That’s frankly very attractive to those senior bankers. In each of these markets that we’ve entered with these new initiatives, we’ve done so with very, very experienced bankers who know their customers and know the markets. We’ve also been able to attract very senior local credit professionals. Those credit professionals, supported through our more central credit organization, know the market and know the individual customers, and allow us to manage risk within our stated risk appetite.

Those things combined really give us a lot of confidence that we can continue to grow with this model, but do so in a way that is very prudent and in keeping with where our company has been for many, many years.

Jason, Host, Barclays: I guess, Brant, you touched on it in your presentation, but last year at this conference, you guys kind of announced for the first time your expansion to the Carolinas with branches. Just maybe update us further on your progress there.

Brant Standridge, Runs Consumer and Regional Banking, Huntington Bancshares: Oh, it’s going quite well. The branch build-out has been so very successful. We’ve opened, as I mentioned earlier, the first three of those locations. We have a couple more opening this year. We’ve actually secured the vast majority of the sites already. We’ll have a very large and significant opening year next year. We’ve also continued to build out the entire franchise. We’ve added capabilities from a mortgage and home lending perspective. We’ve added capabilities from a wealth perspective. We’ve expanded the size of the regional banking platforms there. The reception that we’ve received from the market has been quite positive. It is a clear symbol to the market that we’re there to invest and that we’ll be there.

When you combine that with the work that we’ve been doing from a marketing perspective to share the Huntington story with the marketplace, we’re very pleased with our progress thus far.

Jason, Host, Barclays: Maybe we put up the next ARS question. It’s just thoughts on the audience’s thoughts on the Veritex acquisition. Brant, maybe I’ll just ask you, just how does that deal kind of fit into the broader picture of Huntington’s kind of growth strategy? Does it prohibit you from doing additional deals? What’s your thoughts on this strategy? Is an early foreclosure still on the table?

Brant Standridge, Runs Consumer and Regional Banking, Huntington Bancshares: We remain very, very committed that our primary strategy is organic growth. When you look at Texas, and obviously this group knows how important that market is, how fast it’s growing, and also how significant and large it is, the acquisition of Veritex really is a springboard for our organic growth in the state of Texas. As I mentioned earlier, we had already launched there from a middle market perspective. We’ve had a number of our specialty businesses that have been in Texas for a number of years. Veritex now gives us a significant share in the Dallas market, a real foothold in the Houston market, a list of really fantastic customers that we can now bring the entire franchise to. We view it really as a springboard for what would be a very strong organic opportunity in Texas.

Jason, Host, Barclays: I guess foreclosure seemed, I guess, one of the announcements seemed kind of quick relative to what maybe we saw in other administrations. Just your thoughts around that.

Brant Standridge, Runs Consumer and Regional Banking, Huntington Bancshares: We feel confident that we could potentially have an early foreclosure.

Jason, Host, Barclays: Sounds good. I guess you mentioned marketing in your kind of other answer. I was maybe a couple of weeks ago, Huntington put out an announcement, basically a brand relaunch, so to speak. How does that fit into the strategy? How do you measure that? Any kind of early signs of success?

Brant Standridge, Runs Consumer and Regional Banking, Huntington Bancshares: Interestingly, we shared this at Investor Day, but one of the things the company’s developed over really the last decade is a strong capability in performance or acquisition marketing. In fact, last quarter, 51% of our new consumer households are acquired digitally, and a lot of that’s driven through marketing. That marketing is most successful in the places where we have high levels of awareness. One of the things that we’ve been doing over the last couple of years is how do we expand our awareness in markets that were newer, like Colorado, like Chicago, like Minnesota, and now like the new expansion markets. We’re doing more with broad reach marketing. Just last year, we made the announcement that we would name the Cleveland Browns Stadium. That was obviously a small investment in our broader reach marketing.

We’ve done a number of things in North Carolina and South Carolina and also Colorado to expand our awareness there in ways that are very unique to the market. We had not updated our visual identity in 14 years, and there was an opportunity for us to do that. We added the word bank to our name as we think about expanding into newer markets. We also have launched a new brand campaign that is shot in a very modularized fashion. This allows us to take the same spot and make it much, much more local, which is not only just central to our strategy, but an advantage from a marketing perspective. We’ve begun to see really positive early results from that. Our aided and unaided awareness in Colorado and Chicago and the Carolinas has climbed steadily, and that translates into a significant growth in acquisition.

The month of July for us was the best month from an acquisition that we’ve had in our consumer acquisition in over 10 years. We’re really pleased with the work that we’re doing and how our marketing efforts are really translating into more customers.

Jason, Host, Barclays: All right, Zach, now we have to get into the financials. Maybe I usually don’t start here, but I’m going to start with expenses just because more recently that’s kind of been a big topic on investors’ minds. We talked about branch expansion. We talked about rebranding, organic growth. Obviously, all that does require expenses. Can you talk about just how you intend to kind of further scale organic investments? You’ve talked about positive operating leverage a bit at Investor Day and other forums. Just how you’re thinking about that, particularly as we enter kind of the 2026 budgeting season.

Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer, Huntington Bancshares: Sure. It’s an area that we spend a lot of time focusing on. The model for our expense management approach is very clear and foundational to the way we operate the company. First and foremost, as I noted in my prepared remarks, we drive for systematic re-engineering, ongoing sustainable reductions in baseline operating costs. Over the last five years, we’ve taken out each year roughly 1% incremental out of the cost base through automation and a lot of other foundational re-engineering capabilities. That allows us to, second, plow that back into investments. If you think about the offensive categories of expenses, digital technology development, marketing of the nature that Brant Standridge just highlighted, and then the ability to add new people to go and drive these new growth initiatives, that is an incredibly foundational capability.

Third, we manage the total amount of expenses, both the baseline and these investments, to be growing less than revenue. The last five years is a great, the last three years have been a great example of that. We’ve been growing overall expenses at about 5%, less than the growth rate of revenue, but investments within that are growing between 20% and 25%. When you see 10% revenue growth, there’s a linkage to that that makes a lot of sense. Ultimately, what we want to do is drive sustainable expansion and positive operating leverage and really support the profit engine of the business. This year is a great example. As I noted, now we’re seeing faster revenue growth this year, but also wider operating margin, even as investments are also somewhat higher as we stand today versus our original budget.

Jason, Host, Barclays: I guess you talked about in July 5% to 6% expense growth for this year.

Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer, Huntington Bancshares: Yes, very, very confident in that. I think we’ll see revenue growth, obviously, well north of that.

Jason, Host, Barclays: All right. We talked about loan growth a bit. You showed certainly good average loan growth quarter to date. I guess better than the guidance you gave last quarter. I think we were thinking 1% growth. You talked for third quarter now, it’s closer to 2%. Maybe just talk about kind of your expectations in the back half of the year into 2026 loan growth.

Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer, Huntington Bancshares: Loan growth continues to be powerfully solid and sustained expansion. It’s quite broad-based. Through the first half of the year, we saw about 60% of the growth from our core businesses, 40% from a lot of the new initiatives that Brant Standridge highlighted during his presentation. That’s where we’re continuing to see that mix of power into Q3, somewhere between 1.5% and 2.0% sequential growth into the third quarter. Pipelines for the fourth quarter continue to look very good. Q4 is typically a seasonal high for Huntington Bancshares in terms of loan production, and everything seems to be shaping up to see another solid amount of sequential growth into Q4. We’re not giving formal guidance for 2026 at this point, but my working assumption is somewhere between 1% and 2% sequential growth on a quarterly basis as we go into next year.

Jason, Host, Barclays: Interesting, because your guidance, I guess, for loan growth for the full year in July was 6% to 8%. You’ve already done 7% if I just take through August, and you’re looking for more growth into the fourth quarter.

Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer, Huntington Bancshares: Clearly, Jason, we’re setting ourselves up to be able to increase guidance as we go into our earnings call. Stay tuned. In all seriousness, it’s performing quite well. I think we’ll be sort of at the high end, if not above those ranges.

Jason, Host, Barclays: When you look at kind of the loan growth relative to the guidance, any particular pockets of surprising strength?

Brant Standridge, Runs Consumer and Regional Banking, Huntington Bancshares: No, I mean, it’s across the board. We’re seeing in our core markets, the capabilities that we’ve built with the national specialties allow us to do more for our existing customers. The new initiatives, whether it’s the national expansion of some of these verticals or the new geographies in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas, really provide a significant growth opportunity as well. We believe we can continue to grow substantially with the capabilities we’ve continued to build. It’s broad-based across the board.

Jason, Host, Barclays: Maybe shift gears to NIM. You know, Zach, you mentioned, I think, 3.10% for the third quarter. When we last spoke in July, you were saying 3.08% to 3.10%. A little bit better than that. Maybe just talk to how you’re thinking about funding costs, deposit betas. The Fed, I’m told, is going to cut next week. Just kind of, you know, where do you see the NIM playing out?

Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer, Huntington Bancshares: Yeah. I think, as I noted, seeing a very strong performance in NIM for the third quarter, coming in about the same as last quarter, which was 3.11, somewhere between 3.10 and 3.11 this quarter. We see about that same result again in Q4, then rising NIMs into 2026, rising further into 2027. It’s setting up to have a nice continued margin expansion for us. In the near term, the primary source of outperformance relative to even our own internal thinking for this quarter has been deposit pricing. The teams are performing exceptionally well, continuing to drive out costs of funding, even as we also continue to grow deposits. We’ll see deposits grow this quarter and feel pretty good about how the deposit growth trend will trend over the next number of quarters as well. We’re seeing very strong fundamental performance across the board, which is supporting that.

If you think about the kind of the longer-term trajectory of NIM and that upward bias toward it, as I noted earlier, fixed asset repricing, we continue to benefit from. We’re seeing something between 8 and 9 basis points of year-over-year improvement in NIM this year from fixed asset repricing. That should continue on with additional benefits into 2026, additional benefits into 2027. The general steepening of the yield curve certainly is helpful for us as well.

Jason, Host, Barclays: Got it. We just skipped to the fourth ARS question. After a little bit, you could put up the answer. I guess shifting gears, or maybe not shifting gears, let’s stay here. We talked about loan growth. We talked about deposit growth. We talked about net interest margin. Obviously, bringing it all together, we get to net interest income. Maybe just help us kind of frame it. I did some quick math, but I’d love to get yours. Just how do you see NII shaping up in the second half of the year? Maybe elaborate a bit. I don’t know if the Fed goes 25 basis points next week. Someone told me 50. Just how the rate environment influences that.

Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer, Huntington Bancshares: We do expect to see some sequential growth in NII dollars into the third quarter. We should see further growth into the fourth. As we go into next year, expecting to see a very solid continued revenue growth profile from net interest income as we go into 2026. Feel quite good about how that is shaping up. We’ve positioned the balance sheet to be effectively asset neutral right now. That was very intentional in order to maintain this stability in the face of what is clearly an uncertain environment. If we start to see some Fed rate reductions, we think we’re very well placed to be able to capture that in terms of additional lower deposit costs, even as we continue to power deposit growth from here.

Jason, Host, Barclays: I guess in the earnings call in July, you mentioned flat NII in Q3. Now we’re saying up NII in Q3, up again in Q4. I think at one point you’re talking up 8% to 9% for the year. You kind of keep on raising that as well.

Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer, Huntington Bancshares: Again, we will reset guidance more formally when we come to our earnings call in October. My expectations will be at the high end of that range, if not above that range, as we relook.

Jason, Host, Barclays: Thanks. Fee income has been a big focus of Huntington for the last several years. Just maybe how you think about fee income growth from here. I’d love you to touch on payments, wealth management, capital markets. That’s certainly.

Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer, Huntington Bancshares: You put a lot of investments there.

Brant Standridge, Runs Consumer and Regional Banking, Huntington Bancshares: Jason, I can start. There are three areas, three primary areas that we’ve been focused on: wealth, capital markets, and payments. You mentioned the three. Obviously, there’s bringing those capabilities to our existing installed customer base. Deepening those relationships with wealth capabilities, capital markets capabilities, and payments capabilities has been and is proving to be a really great opportunity for us. There are businesses specifically that we’ve been investing intentionally in. A disproportionate amount of that investment that Zach described, we’ve been pulling out of our operating expenses, goes to those three businesses. As a result of that, we’re seeing very strong growth in each of the three. I’ll highlight specifically our wealth business. That’s a business that’s doubled over the last five years. We announced at Investor Day we would intend to double it again over the next five years.

We have the number of advisory customers actually growing double digits. We’re seeing AUM grow double digits, and we would see that continuing. We’re very bullish about the opportunity in those three and other areas of fee revenue, and we’ll continue to disproportionately invest there.

Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer, Huntington Bancshares: Maybe I’ll just double-click into that. For the third quarter, seeing fee revenues essentially spot on our initial guidance in the quarter around $550 million on a core basis. As Brant noted, the real power drivers of that are our payments, wealth management, and capital markets. Those businesses collectively in the second quarter grew 11% year over year in terms of revenue growth. That’s about the profile that we’re expecting from them over the next several years.

Jason, Host, Barclays: Fees up 4% to 6% for the year. Still feel good about that.

Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer, Huntington Bancshares: Feel great about that.

Jason, Host, Barclays: Maybe to touch on credit quality for a second. You talked about it earlier, but just as you look out, any particular areas of concern that you’re raising an eye on? Consumer data has maybe been a little bit soft. There’s this tariff impact starting to hurt or affect the commercial side. Just maybe kind of talk to what you’re seeing, hearing from your customers.

Brant Standridge, Runs Consumer and Regional Banking, Huntington Bancshares: We still see credit quality as being quite strong. The consumer still is, our consumer is still quite strong. We’re seeing utilization rates that are still low. A number of our consumer-focused businesses, like our auto finance business, have had very strong summer months. We also see payments data that would say that our payments activity through debit has slowed slightly, but is still looking very good. We’ve been very focused on continuing to enhance our risk and underwriting in our small business area because that’s an area that was impacted by rising rates. We’ve seen that continue to stabilize, and I think we’ll potentially see some improvement there. Overall, we feel very good about where we are from a credit quality perspective, and we obviously manage that quite tightly and have been for a number of years.

Jason, Host, Barclays: Got it. Maybe capital. Just, I guess, how do we think about trajectory of capital ratios going forward? You talked about loan growth. You talked about organic expansion. Just, you know, Huntington has not bought back stock in quite a while. How do you think about potential share repurchase in the future?

Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer, Huntington Bancshares: Yeah, great question. I’ll take that one. You know, from a capital perspective, as we’ve noted on a number of prior occasions, we are primarily managing toward the adjusted CET1 ratio inclusive of AOCI. We have a target operating range for that metric of between 9% and 10%. As of last quarter, we were right at 9%, and that’s been growing steadily over the last two years. Our expectations will continue to see that metric rise, and we will drive that up into the middle of that operating range. What we’re obviously very fortunate is we’ve got a top-tier return on capital, which is allowing us to power and fund the high-return loan growth that we’re seeing come through and that we’re continuing to project out for quite a long time to come here, while also driving capital ratios higher and supporting a terrific dividend.

The expectation that we have is once we get through the Veritex acquisition, the opportunity to get back to more programmatic share repurchases will be there. Fundamentally, the model is working very well from our perspective. If you take a step back, management and the board is a top 10 shareholder of the company. Our interests are very much aligned. The way we really like the way the value creation model is setting up, we’re seeing high single-digit to low double-digit sustainable growth in tangible book value per share. As we noted on our Investor Day, we expect to see that level of growth in tangible book value per share through the end of the decade. Last quarter was 16% year-over-year growth in tangible book value per share. Very strong fundamental growth. Coupling that with a top-tier and growing return, we think is a really winning model for shareholder returns.

Jason, Host, Barclays: Early 2026 would maybe be a good guess, you know.

Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer, Huntington Bancshares: I think what we said is when we get through the Veritex acquisition, there could be some modest share repurchases this year, but I think more programmatic and normal amount as we go into next year.

Jason, Host, Barclays: Makes sense. Makes sense. I guess on Veritex, I think when it was announced, a lot of people understood the strategic rationale of it, with any dealers, obviously, interest creation risk and other risks. The financial impact seemed, I guess, very little, at least on the surface. As you spent a bit more time going through it and just kind of any updated thoughts in terms of creation, dilution, expense save opportunities, revenue synergies, and just maybe you know update us a few more months in.

Brant Standridge, Runs Consumer and Regional Banking, Huntington Bancshares: I think two months in, we’re even more encouraged about the strategic opportunity that Veritex offers. We believed in due diligence that the Veritex team had very good customers, and as we’ve dug in, that’s been obviously confirmed. We feel great about our opportunity to expand the relationships of their existing relationships. We also feel great about the people because ultimately, at the end of the day, local colleagues with local relationships. We’ve been able to work through the org structure and approach with all of the folks and feel great about where that has landed. That would be the second large component. Lastly, in working through this, we have a very good line of sight into the cost savings that we had projected as a part of the transaction. Two months in, we’re feeling very good about where we are.

Jason, Host, Barclays: Any questions from the audience? I see one in the front row. You just shout it out. I’ll repeat it.

Unidentified speaker: If I understand you, it’s founded over the years, but it’s grown for the.

Brant Standridge, Runs Consumer and Regional Banking, Huntington Bancshares: Yeah, we like the fact that you had a founder who’s been in the market in Texas for 40 years. We like the fact that you had bankers that were very experienced and tenured, and many of them had operated under a large bank credit organization and so had a good understanding of what would be required of us. We actually like where their retail locations are, even though the organization has not been retail focused. Veritex also brings a substantial amount of brand opportunity to us. Their locations are well placed. Their signage is well placed. It really creates an opportunity for us to expand the awareness of the Huntington brand in the market. All of those things were quite attractive.

In the due diligence, we had the opportunity to take a look at the customer base and the sponsors, and would it be folks that would fit into our customers that would fit into our credit appetite? We were very encouraged by that. All of those things, frankly, made it quite attractive. They also have a lot of density in Dallas. Dallas now becomes a top five city for Huntington. It makes Texas a top three state. Having an opportunity like that that has density in a very, very important strategic market made it quite attractive to us.

Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer, Huntington Bancshares: I would just tack on to that. I mean, just such not only a clear line of sight to the expense synergies, but also very well-defined revenue synergy opportunities. If you go back to the presentation, you know one of the things we tried to do in this morning’s materials was to show just how well now, three years on, we continue to power revenue synergies from the TCF acquisition, the same confidence we’ve got now here. If you think about rolling out our whole consumer franchise into those branch locations that Brant just mentioned, the ability to bring our value-added fee services and really penetrate treasury management, capital markets, wealth into their really high-quality commercial customer base. Then just the added heft and weight that we’ll have in the market, we believe will produce a meaningful lift in our own larger corporate commercial lending and deposit gathering activities.

I think it’s really, it’s a home run for us. As Brant said, we think the springboard that that will drive for long-term revenue growth in one of the most attractive states in the country is certainly going to be pretty exciting.

Brant Standridge, Runs Consumer and Regional Banking, Huntington Bancshares: I’ll add one more point. Another component of it that was encouraging to us is the operating model that you’ve heard me describe. That operating model really makes the integration of Veritex very, very much possible. It also is what creates the opportunity and the springboard for the future. Being able to take that customer base and those individuals and integrate them into a locally empowered model, but then also bring the expertise of the national specialties to their customer base, we viewed as a really great opportunity.

Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer, Huntington Bancshares: Great.

Jason, Host, Barclays: Brant.

Unidentified speaker: Even that, the Fed will stay back in the market for another acquisition relatively quickly.

Brant Standridge, Runs Consumer and Regional Banking, Huntington Bancshares: Our focus has and will be at our top priority to be organic growth. Obviously, these types of events are episodic. It’s a higher hurdle for us from a financial, strategic, and cultural component. Our focus is really on organic.

Jason, Host, Barclays: On that note, please join me in thanking Zach Wasserman and Brant Standridge for their time today.

Philips shares fell as much as 4.8% in Amsterdam before paring back losses.

The proceedings are the latest in a long-running saga for Philips’ respirators and relate to CPAP, BiPAP and mechanical ventilator devices recalled by the company in 2021. Disintegrating foam in some devices posed risks of cancer and respiratory issues.

The manufacturer has struggled to draw a line under that recall. It was ordered to suspend sales of sleep apnea devices and ventilators in the US last year after reaching an agreement with the Food and Drug Administration.

A spokesperson for Philips said this is not a new investigation.

“The proceeding does not make allegations about the quality and safety of products currently marketed in France by Philips,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

Dive Insight:

Zya speeds R&D, cuts costs, cuts risk and accelerates the market launch of bioplastics for packaging, according to Siddiqui.

Erthos launched seven years ago to develop biobased compounds as alternatives to plastics. The company initially built Zya as an internal tool for its R&D teams to accelerate the material development and customization work they did for brands. But then they realized the tool could be more impactful if brands directly accessed it, said Siddiqui.

“We've all recognized that we still have a lot of work to do when it comes to our plastic reduction goals. And the goal is really to look at Zya as almost a marketplace and a platform for all of the key players in the supply chain to be able to be a part of the process and develop their materials a lot quicker,” she said.

For months, the company searched for the right partner to co-develop the tool and improve its artificial intelligence capabilities. Bringing on Colgate-Palmolive as the first partner was appealing in part because “they come with a really interesting portfolio of products, where there's so many different plastic applications — from the flexible packaging to the rigids,” Siddiqui said. “And they have been very progressive in some of their sustainability goals, with the focus around next-generation and biobased materials.”

The collaboration started by looking at Colgate-Palmolive’s flexible packaging, including sachets and flexible films for coating and lamination applications for paper. Zya focuses on materials that are non-toxic, PFAS-free and still meet the standard performance requirements for multilayer packaging, Siddiqui said.

“It's really exciting to see that now we're able to predict properties like [water vapor transmission rate] and [oxygen transmission rate] — very specific packaging properties that are really difficult to test and build around right now,” she said. “Colgate has the ability to actually create new formulas with this database of ingredients that they haven't used before or aren't familiar with.”

The CPG company uses a number of platforms during its innovation process, including those with machine learning and AI capabilities, Greg Corra, senior vice president of global packaging and sustainability at Colgate-Palmolive, said via email. The company was interested in the Zya platform because “it’s anchored on materials science and gives our teams access to more comprehensive and actionable data to aid development,” he said.

“[W]e are strong believers in collaborative innovation,” Corra said. For packaging, “we are keenly interested in tools that can help us accelerate and scale solutions” that support the target to eliminate one-third of virgin plastic use, compared to a 2019 baseline, and to make all packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable.

Materials innovation is a critical aspect of eliminating plastic waste, which is one of the key actions in Colgate-Palmolive’s Sustainability & Social Impact Strategy, according to Corra. The company’s 2024 sustainability report shows it reduced virgin plastic tonnage by 25% compared with 2019, but it encountered challenges with getting to the one-third mark by 2025. Namely, it struggled with “the availability, quality and feasibility of recycled content,” according to the report.

Later this year, the partners plan to explore the use of Zya for other parts of Colgate-Palmolive’s packaging portfolio, such as rigids. Erthos also will continue to add platform features and further train the AI, then launch Zya next year for other CPGs to use.

“The goal is to really give them visibility into these materials and how to tap into their full potential,” Siddiqui said.

According to the report, nearly 6 in 10 organizations are expected to have AI as an active team member or a supervisor for other AI within the next 12 months – up from 44% currently.

Despite this, organizations admit they are not prepared for dynamic human-AI collaboration. Two-thirds of enterprises agree that they will need to restructure their teams to enhance human-AI collaboration, with most expecting their organizational structure to evolve.

The annual report, now in its third edition, finds that 30% of organizations are now fully or partially scaling Gen AI, up from 6% in 2023 – a fivefold increase in the last two years. A vast majority of organizations (93%) are exploring, piloting, or partially or fully enabling Gen AI capabilities in 2025.

Sectors like telecom, consumer products, and aerospace and defense organizations are leading the charge in Gen AI adoption, with core business functions such as customer operations, marketing, risk management, and IT remaining top areas of implementation.

Franck Greverie, Chief Technology & Portfolio Officer, Head of the Global Business lines and Group Executive Board Member at Capgemini, said, “Enterprise adoption of AI is scaling faster than almost any technology we’ve seen before, with companies experimenting with AI across all functions. But rapid adoption doesn’t necessarily translate into large scale deployment with tangible ROI. To succeed, enterprises must set up a solid data foundation, in a trusted environment that’s compliant, secure and ensures necessary privacy. This, along with a new operating model with a balanced human-AI chemistry, can ensure winning business outcomes.”

Gen AI investments continue to accelerate

As organizations seek to realize the benefits of Gen AI, investment is accelerating and eight in ten (79%) organizations say they are happy with the outcomes so far.

The report highlights that, in the past 12 months, nine in ten (88%) organizations have increased investment in Gen AI by an average of 9%, with 12% of the IT budget now dedicated to Gen AI. This trend is expected to continue, with 61% of organizations anticipating a further increase in Gen AI investments in the next year.

However, organizations report an unexpected surge in cloud consumption costs, with over half experiencing “bill shocks” triggered by the rapid expansion of Gen AI initiatives, as scaling efforts outpace initial projections. Enterprises are also increasingly turning to small language models (SLMs) for cost effectiveness.

AI agents and multi-agent systems gain momentum

The last year has also seen a steady rise in AI agents. This is set to increase, with most business functions likely to have AI agents handling at least one business process. Nine in ten executives from product design/R&D, marketing, and sales are optimistic about AI agents handling one or more business processes in their function in the next 3-5 years.

AI agent systems are becoming increasingly complex and interconnected, with multi-agent systems likely to be the next major development in AI. Of those organizations scaling AI agents, nearly 45% are also piloting or scaling multi-agent systems. Nearly four in ten (38%) believe AI agents will evolve into self-learning agents with minimal human supervision in the next 3-5 years.

Despite rapid adoption, the report finds that a majority (71%) of organizations said they cannot fully trust autonomous AI agents for enterprise use, highlighting that businesses must also overcome governance gaps to build trust in AI.

However, most enterprises still struggle with setting up guardrails and governance for AI. Only 46% have established governance policies for their AI systems, yet most seldom follow them.",https://mediabrief.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/6-in-10-organizations-to-adopt-AI-as-team-member.png,N,,2025-09-08 13:03:34.262268

A global coffee duopoly: Nestlé on one side, Global Coffee Co. on the other.","This Week’s Focus: A Global Coffee Colossus

Keurig Dr Pepper announced the acquisition of Dutch coffee giant JDE Peet’s in an $18B all-cash deal, spinning off the combined coffee business into “Global Coffee Co.” With expected annual sales of about $16B and projected reach across 100+ countries, it will be the world’s largest pure-play coffee company, rivaling Nestlé in a global duopoly. The big question: will this massive consolidation improve how the coffee business operates, or simply give the new giant more power to raise prices? Investors may cheer, but consumers could end up footing the bill.

Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP)—the beverage conglomerate behind Keurig single-serve coffee machines—has announced a deal to acquire JDE Peet’s, the Dutch coffee giant that owns Peet’s Coffee and other brands, in an all-cash merger worth about $18 billion. The transaction will create a behemoth dedicated solely to coffee: after the deal closes, KDP plans to spin off its coffee business as a new company called “Global Coffee Co.,” separate from its soda and beverages unit.

The new coffee-centric company is expected to have roughly $16 billion in annual sales, instantly (no pun) making it the world’s largest pure-play coffee company. Its reach will span 100+ countries, and it will hold a #1 or #2 market-share position in coffee sales in about 40 countries—truly a global coffee colossus.

This merger combines two of the industry’s biggest portfolios.

KDP dominates North America’s single-serve pod coffee through its Keurig machines, and also owns household names like Green Mountain Coffee Roasters and a stake in La Colombe Coffee Roasters.

Meanwhile, JDE Peet’s brings in an extensive stable of brands: from European supermarket staples like Douwe Egberts, Jacobs, and L’OR, to popular U.S. names like Peet’s Coffee (and its smaller specialty subsidiaries Stumptown Coffee Roasters and Intelligentsia). In total, JDE Peet’s manages over 50 coffee and tea brands worldwide, and the combined entity will control a broader family of labels across instant coffee, K-Cup pods, traditional ground beans, upscale “third wave” roasters and coffee logistics/trading arms.

It’s no exaggeration to call this the largest coffee merger ever.

The big question: Will this massive consolidation actually improve how the coffee business operates, or will it mainly give the new giant more power to raise prices?

Believe me… So many jokes are swirling in my head about both the current and future coffee quality of this merger. I dislike Keurig coffee just as much as any other obnoxious coffee snob. But KDP also has a stake in La Colombe, which I like; JDE owns Peet’s (which I also like); and Jacobs, which I grew up with. So no dad coffee jokes this time. Sorry.

Let’s see what’s brewing.

How Keurig Changed Coffee—For Better or Worse

To understand what this merger might mean for everyday coffee lovers, it’s worth looking at Keurig’s impact on coffee consumption over the past two decades. KDP’s coffee business today is built on the astounding success of the Keurig single-serve brewing system.

Introduced in the late 1990s and popularized in the 2000s, Keurig fundamentally altered how Americans brew coffee at home. Instead of a whole pot, Keurig enabled a convenient one-cup brewing system using its patented K-Cup pods—offering speed and consistency (if not gourmet quality).

This convenience caught on like wildfire: by the mid-2010s, one in three U.S. households owned a single-serve coffee machine.

One in three.

Today, Keurig remains the dominant player—as of 2023, around one-third of all coffee makers sold in the U.S. are Keurig or Keurig-compatible models. The company estimates nearly 40 million American homes now use a Keurig brewer, with potential to reach millions more. Keurig has entrenched itself as a fixture of American kitchens and offices, boasting over 90% brand recognition among consumers. In terms of market presence, that is a remarkable transformation of coffee habits in a relatively short time.

From a business perspective, Keurig’s single-serve system was quite revolutionary. It created an entire ecosystem (machines, pods, licensing deals with coffee brands) that turned coffee into a highly profitable consumer packaged good (much like soda cans or snacks). Keurig and its partners sold over $3.6 billion worth of K-Cup pods in 2015 alone and became the leading U.S. retail coffee seller by revenue. For its parent companies, Keurig delivered steady growth even when soda sales stagnated—providing, as one analyst put it, “a level of stability” to KDP as more Americans shifted from sugary drinks to coffee.

In fact, KDP’s decision to spin off a dedicated coffee company now is partly because coffee is seen as a robust growth category (a $400 billion global market and rising), especially compared to soft drinks. In short, Keurig turned coffee into big business on par with the Coca-Colas and Pepsis of the world.

Yet for all its convenience, Keurig has its share of detractors—and our user’s comment “I don’t like Keurig” resonates with many coffee aficionados.

One common critique is quality: coffee purists argue that K-Cups sacrifice flavor and freshness for convenience, delivering a sub-par brew compared to freshly ground, hand-crafted coffee. Keurig’s approach favors consistency and ease over the nuanced craft of coffee brewing, which can disappoint those who value a rich, complex cup.

Another major concern is environmental impact. Keurig’s disposable single-use pods have generated mountains of plastic waste. In the 2010s, as Keurig sales exploded, billions of non-recyclable K-Cup pods ended up in landfills each year. In 2014 alone, an estimated 9–13 billion K-Cups were thrown away, enough to circle the earth dozens of times if lined up end-to-end! The outcry grew so loud that even John Sylvan, Keurig’s inventor, publicly expressed regret for creating the K-Cup system, acknowledging the environmental cost: “I feel bad sometimes that I ever did it,” he told The Atlantic in 2015. Keurig did eventually respond by making all its pods recyclable by 2020, but skeptics note that “recyclable” isn’t the same as recycled—many municipal systems still don’t process the small polypropylene cups, meaning much of that waste still lands in the trash.

From a consumer-cost standpoint, single-serve coffee is not cheap. A K-Cup typically contains only ~10 grams of coffee, yet a pack of 12 pods can cost $8 or more, which works out to over $30 per pound of coffee—far higher than ordinary drip coffee grounds. Keurig users pay a premium for convenience and branding. Indeed, KDP and its partners have been able to command high margins on pods (and have not been shy about raising pod prices when needed).

All of this context helps explain why some coffee drinkers are wary of KDP’s expanding influence: Will a coffee mega-conglomerate prioritize efficiency and profit at the expense of coffee quality, affordability, and sustainability?

Do Big Mergers Perk Up Efficiency or Just Concentrate Power?

Whenever two giants combine, their executives tout benefits like cost savings, efficiency, and innovation. Some even use terms like economies of scale or synergies. Buzzwords galore.

KDP’s CEO Tim Cofer, argues that merging with JDE Peet’s will create a stronger coffee business than either company alone—“a case of one plus one equaling three,” as he put it. The companies estimate about $400 million in cost synergies (savings) within three years by streamlining operations and supply chains. With production spanning 40+ manufacturing facilities globally and a huge distribution network, the merged Global Coffee Co. could theoretically operate more efficiently and “rapidly scale next-generation coffee innovation” worldwide.

In other words, the new firm might brew up new products more quickly and cost-effectively—for example, by extending KDP’s Keurig single-serve technology beyond North America and using JDE’s global sourcing to maintain a steady flow of beans.

However, history suggests that such mergers often serve shareholders more than consumers.

Greater scale can indeed lower internal costs—but unless there’s strong competition, those savings might not translate into lower prices on the shelf. In fact, having fewer major competitors can give the merged company more pricing power. A recent example comes from JDE Peet’s itself: earlier in 2025, JDE Peet’s tried to hike its wholesale coffee prices significantly across Europe, blaming higher raw bean costs. Supermarkets pushed back, accusing JDE of demanding price increases “far more than necessary” even as the company enjoyed rising profits and dividends.

The dispute got so bitter (no pun) that some grocery chains temporarily pulled JDE’s brands (like Douwe Egberts, L’OR, and Tassimo) off their shelves rather than accept the steep hikes. In the end, several retailers had to relent and restock those coffees at higher prices, illustrating how market clout can squeeze consumers. This episode underscores a key risk of consolidation: a coffee titan controlling dozens of brands can pressure retailers—and ultimately consumers—to swallow price increases, especially when alternative suppliers are limited.

U.S. coffee drinkers have felt a similar pinch lately. Retail coffee prices have jumped dramatically—over 30% year-over-year—due to a mix of inflation, supply shortages, and yes, corporate pricing strategies. Even KDP has openly used price hikes to prop up sales. Facing a slight decline in coffee pod volumes, Keurig Dr Pepper “offset some declines with higher prices,” according to an AP report in August. In its most recent quarter, KDP’s coffee segment revenue dipped 0.2%, but raising K-Cup prices helped compensate.

All of this suggests that the new Global Coffee Co. might not rush to lower any prices; rather, it may use its enhanced scale to better weather cost pressures (like expensive coffee beans or tariffs) without sacrificing profit margins. Indeed, the merger announcement explicitly noted $400 million in savings would help the company handle challenges like rising costs and tariffs on coffee imports—again, beneficial for the company’s bottom line, but not necessarily for consumers.

On the positive side, a focused coffee company could invest more in product improvement than a diversified conglomerate. Once KDP splits, Global Coffee Co. will no longer compete internally for resources with sodas and juices; its management can single-mindedly focus on coffee category growth. Proponents say this focus might spur innovation: for instance, developing better home brewing tech, more sustainable packaging, or new coffee formats. KDP has hinted that the combined company will lead “the next generation of coffee innovation worldwide.” If true, coffee drinkers might eventually see new conveniences or varieties—perhaps improved single-serve machines, more café-quality drinks at home, or broader availability of beloved brands.

Still, such benefits are speculative and long-term. In the near term, the merger’s more tangible effect is the creation of a powerful coffee entity with over 20% of the global coffee market—roughly on par with Nestlé, the longtime world leader in packaged coffee. With essentially a duopoly of Nestlé and Global Coffee Co. looming, competition could actually decrease in many markets, which economists warn tends to reduce incentives to cut prices or improve service for consumers.

Scale Economies Are Weak in Coffee

Whenever a firm claims to have economies of scale, or utilize economies of scale, I am skeptical.

And indeed the data for both firms is not supportive of any such economies:

Figure 1. KDP: Net Sales (bars) and Operating Margin (line), 2018–2024.

Figure 2. JDE Peet’s: Net Sales (bars) and Operating Margin (line), 2020–2024.

As these graphs show, coffee, which is an enormous category, rarely behaves like a classic “bigger is cheaper” industry. Even at substantial scale, leading players struggle to turn incremental sales into sustainably higher margins.

Several forces explain this pattern.

First, commodity exposure is structural and persistent. Green coffee, packaging, energy, and freight are volatile. Companies can offset these shocks through price increases, but pass‑through typically lags: costs surge quickly while list prices and retailer negotiations take several quarters to adjust. The result is a recurring cycle of cost shocks, delayed pricing, and temporary margin compression that erodes operating leverage. The inflation shock of 2021–2023 effectively reset the baseline. Even after pricing “catches up,” labor, freight, and packaging seldom return to prior levels. The industry’s new steady state is characterized by structurally higher unit costs, so margin re‑expansion often stalls mid‑cycle.

Second, retailer counter‑power in core grocery channels constrains pricing. Consolidated European grocers and large U.S. chains can resist or delay increases, extract promotional funding, or temporarily delist SKUs. Suppliers may win nominal price increases only to suffer volume losses, adverse mix, or lower throughput. The combination blunts margin expansion even when headline sales look healthy.

And finally, product and channel mix dilute averages. Portfolios range from value offerings—instant and mainstream ground coffee—to more premium, such as capsules and specialty products. Growth often skews toward value formats or mass retail channels that boost revenue but compress overall margins. Premium segments can lift gross margin, but sustaining them requires continued brand and innovation investment, which show up in SG&A.

What Academic Research Tells Us About Mergers Like This

The Keurig–JDE Peet’s deal isn’t just big news for coffee—it’s also a classic case study in what scholars have long debated: Do mergers create real operational efficiencies, or do they mainly consolidate market power?

Efficiency vs. Market Power: Academic research generally finds that most mergers do not deliver the promised efficiency gains. A comprehensive review by Gugler, Mueller, and Weichselbaumer (2012) concluded that while some mergers do generate cost synergies, on average they tend to increase market power more than they improve productivity. Simply put, prices tend to rise faster than efficiency improves. This aligns with what antitrust economists call the “price effect”: reduced competition lets firms raise margins without necessarily passing savings to consumers.

Evidence from Consumer Goods and Beverages: Studies focusing on consumer packaged goods—to which coffee belongs—show similar patterns. Ashenfelter and Hosken (2010), examined U.S. food and beverage mergers, and found that many led to higher retail prices in affected product categories, with little evidence of consumer benefits. We’ve seen this dynamic before: Nestlé’s 2018 licensing deal with Starbucks created massive distribution synergies, but retail Starbucks-branded coffee remained premium-priced.

The Innovation Question: Another line of research asks whether consolidation stimulates or stifles innovation. On one hand, Schumpeterian theory suggests larger firms with deeper pockets can invest more in R&D. On the other hand, when competition shrinks, the incentive to innovate diminishes. Empirical work (Federico, Langus, and Valletti, 2017) finds that innovation often slows down after horizontal mergers in concentrated industries. For coffee, this raises the concern: will Global Coffee Co. truly innovate on brewing technology and sustainability, or will it coast on market dominance?

Global Supply Chains and Scale Economies: Operations research does point out that scale can stabilize fragile supply chains. A merged entity with sourcing across dozens of countries might better hedge against shocks like droughts in Brazil or tariffs on imports. The literature on supply chain risk management (e.g., Tang & Tomlin, 2008) highlights that diversification at scale can reduce shortages. But again, whether those benefits accrue to consumers depends on competitive pressure.

Taken together, the academic literature suggests a cautious outlook. Mergers in consumer goods often lead to stable supply and stronger firms, but rarely to lower prices or better products. Instead, the biggest winners tend to be investors. I’m not saying Global Coffee Co. won’t introduce new gadgets or expand specialty offerings—Keurig was once a disruptive innovator—but it does suggest that coffee lovers should temper expectations that this mega-merger will make their morning cup more affordable or fresh.

Kraft Heinz: A Mega-Merger Gone Sour

The coffee merger is coming at the same time that one of the biggest food mega mergers of the previous decade is being dismantled

When Kraft and Heinz merged in 2015, the immediate effect was a sharp boost in profitability. Kraft Heinz’s operating margin jumped from the mid-teens (Kraft Foods Group’s standalone operating margin was around 14% in 2014) to above 20% in the years right after the merger. By 2017, the combined company was running at a robust ~22% operating profit margin—clear evidence of achieved economies of scale through aggressive cost-cutting. The 3G Capital playbook of slashing expenses (zero-based budgeting, layoffs, plant closures) did indeed eliminate waste and drive short-term efficiency. For context, General Mills—a peer in packaged foods—had an operating margin of ~17% around that time. Kraft Heinz briefly outperformed on efficiency.

However, those gains proved unsustainable, mainly because Kraft Heinz achieved efficiency at the expense of innovation and agility. As NPR reported, “Kraft Heinz spent years slicing its costs, while rivals invested in new ideas to keep up with changing consumer tastes.” Competitors invested in product innovation (healthier options, fresh and organic foods, new flavors) while Kraft Heinz cut R&D and marketing. This left the company flat-footed as consumer preferences shifted away from processed pantry staples. Sales stagnated or declined—by 2019 Kraft Heinz was facing “lost sales” and had to take massive goodwill write-downs on underperforming brands.

Due to these impairments, operating income turned negative in 2018–2019, erasing years of paper profits. In early 2019, Kraft Heinz shocked Wall Street by writing down $15 billion of marquee brands like Oscar Mayer and Kraft, acknowledging those businesses were worth far less than assumed at merger. The bad news didn’t stop there: in 2025, Kraft Heinz took another $9.3 billion impairment charge amid sliding sales and shares, resulting in a net loss of nearly $8 billion for the first half. By mid-2025, their stock had lost about two-thirds of its value from post-merger peak—a brutal outcome for what was once touted as a food industry superpower.

What went wrong?

Cutting costs can boost margins, but only to a point. Kraft Heinz’s initial post-merger operating margin of ~21–23% proved fleeting; in recent years the margin settled back to the mid-teens, no better than many peers, as the company was forced to increase brand investment and face higher input costs.

Meanwhile, economies of scope never materialized as hoped—there was little synergy in selling cheese, ketchup, lunch meat, and coffee under one corporation beyond shared back-office functions. In fact, the sprawling portfolio became a liability. Management confessed that the complexity of managing 56 categories meant the new firm couldn’t focus enough on any single area.

Size did not equal innovation: smaller upstarts and private-label store brands nibbled away at Kraft Heinz’s market share in categories from cold cuts to boxed dinners, while the giant focused on internal belt-tightening. As a result, the merger that was meant to create a dominant one-stop food juggernaut ended up destroying value—a textbook case of how pursuing scale for scale’s sake can backfire in a changing market.

It’s telling that after a decade, Kraft Heinz is now breaking up into two companies (one focused on fast-growing products like sauces, and one on slower-growth grocery staples). Essentially, the firm is undoing the merger to regain focus. Warren Buffett himself admitted he “overpaid” for Kraft Heinz and was “wrong in a couple of ways,” acknowledging that putting Kraft and Heinz together “certainly didn’t turn out to be a brilliant idea.”

The Post-Merger Landscape: What’s in Store for Coffee Drinkers?

So what should we expect?

A global coffee duopoly: Nestlé on one side, Global Coffee Co. on the other. Together, they’ll decide which brands get shelf space, how much you pay, and which innovations see the light of day.

Investors will cheer the margins.

Supermarkets will grit their teeth.

And consumers?

We’ll keep paying more for the same caffeine hit—maybe in fancier pods, maybe with better packaging, but hardly cheaper.

And the lesson is (as Kraft Heinz realized): scale without innovation won’t make your morning cup better—just more expensive.

The real disruption in coffee will likely come from the outside, not from the giants.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!pZS3!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8514e514-ed0c-49ee-8049-325c2f31a3c1_1024x1024.png",N,,2025-09-08 22:09:14.167559

The growing collectibles market

In online marketplace eBay’s fiscal Q2 in 2025, collectibles were the largest contributor to GMV growth, its CEO Jamie Iannone told investors on an earnings call.

Within collectibles, trading cards stood out, marking a 10th consecutive quarter of GMV growth, Iannone said. Pokémon card sales grew in the triple digits for the second straight quarter, while Magic: The Gathering and sports cards also posted double-digit gains, he said.

Additionally, Fanatics is narrowing the gap between itself and Nike, the top retailer in the Apparel & Accessories category of the Top 2000 Database.

Fanatics has accomplished this growth in the 2020s through a variety of means, relevant to both its sports apparel and collectibles business. First, it has signed deals expanding its reach across leagues and fandoms. These have included professional player-, team-, and league-level agreements, in addition to working with apparel brands such as Lululemon and Nike. Moreover, it has made major acquisitions, including its 2022 Mitchell & Ness deal, the 2023 acquisition of the wholesaler Fexpro and others. It has also branched into livestream shopping with its Fanatics Live platform.

Now, one of Wix’s co-founders is leaving the firm to create a new AI tool for developing applications.

Nadav Abrahami is founding Dazl, and he appears to have the blessing of Wix as he departs with 30 employees and funding from Wix (as well as 40RTY Fund, which was an early investor in Wix).

Dazl claims that existing AI development tools don’t deliver the full product that developers are seeking, and it aims to fix that:

Dazl’s proprietary technology bridges the gap between creative and expressive intent and the final working product, nurturing a true partnership between the maker and AI. The result is a single platform where outputs are consistent, production-ready, and creators can build with confidence.

With $10 million in funding, it will be interesting to see how the team delivers on this.

Dazl is using dazl.dev for its website. Bank of New York Mellon owns Dazl.com. It previously used the domain for a financial platform.",https://domainnamewire.com/wp-content/dazl-logo-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-08 13:03:14.054726

The manufacturer had once been seen as a potential boon for Peoria.

PEORIA — NFW, formerly known as Natural Fiber Welding, will begin winding down all its operations following years of tumultuous performance and employee layoffs.

CEO Steve Zika confirmed to the Journal Star on Friday that the company's board voted to end operations at NFW.

""While we continue to explore all options, the Board has made the difficult decision to begin the orderly wind down of the Company’s operations,"" Zika said in a statement. ""This is not the outcome we want, but it is the most responsible path for our stakeholders at present.""

Peoria City Councilman Denis Cyr, whose 5th District was home to NFW, said he was disappointed by the news.

""It was a great company. I thought it had a good future, but they obviously lost some contracts over the last few years and with the economy and everything else ... I don't know, I am just disappointed,"" Cyr said. ""Unfortunately that's just the way it works in business. You have winners and losers and the first five to 10 years are the most difficult. I thought they were over the hump. I am just surprised, disappointed that they are closing the doors.""

NFW employed nearly 300 people in in 2022 but layoffs over the past two years drastically cut the size of the company. In May, NFW endured its fourth round of layoffs in the past two years. Last December, 91 people were laid off.

During its recent struggles NFW also changed its business model to focus less on manufacturing and more on being a player in the supply chain, working with other companies interested in using their technologies.

NFW had once been heralded as a major success story for innovation and manufacturing in Peoria. When the company began it was focused on manufacturing plant-based and environmentally friendly alternatives to synthetic fabrics. Those technologies landed it work with Ralph Lauren.

Chris Setti, the CEO of the Greater Peoria Economic Development Council, said had been a ""really good employer"" in Peoria that had a ""really amazing product.""

""But, it's a tough environment when you have an innovative startup to keep all of the different aspects of the company going before you can actually produce the thing you need to sell at quantity to prop up a business,"" Setti said. ""It's unfortunate, I don't know how to say it other than that, but I know a lot of people at NFW and I know how hard they've worked the past few years to build that company and I hope something emerges out of that.""

In 2022, former NFW CEO Luke Haverhals described NFW as ""computers in the '70s"" during an interview with the Peoria Journal Star. That same year, NFW won the ""Inventor of the Year Award"" from the Investment Property Owners Education Foundation.

Haverhals said at time that NFW was a company that could transform Peoria into a global innovation hub but said the city needed to ""look in the mirror"" about how it could incentivize businesses to stay in the area to avoid another departure like Caterpillar in 2018.

Peoria did eventually make major investments into the future of NFW, creating a new tax increment financing district and purchasing a large swath of land of Galena Road for nearly $1 million in an effort to create a $40 million business park with NFW serving as its anchor.","https://www.pekintimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/01/12/NJOS/72199839007-011124-galenatif-2.jpg?crop=5547,3120,x0,y187&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-08 13:07:10.969816

The cases involve a controversial type of mortgage on sale between late 1996 and mid-1998 and only available from the two banks.
The shared appreciation mortgages (Sams) were ostensibly aimed at helping “asset-rich, cash-poor” older people release some of the value locked up in their homes.
She took out a £33,750 loan on her home – 25% of its value at the time of £135,000.

The law firm Teacher Stern is bringing group actions against Barclays and Bank of Scotland in an attempt, it said, to win justice for two new groups of claimants comprising current and former customers and their next of kin.

One of those affected, Annie Galbraith, borrowed £33,000 from Barclays in 1998, but her debt to the bank is now estimated at about £660,000 and could rise further.

The cases involve a controversial type of mortgage on sale between late 1996 and mid-1998 and only available from the two banks.

The shared appreciation mortgages (Sams) were ostensibly aimed at helping “asset-rich, cash-poor” older people release some of the value locked up in their homes.

They typically allowed people to borrow up to 25% of the property’s value, and usually there were no repayments to make during the lifetime of the loan.

In return, borrowers were required to pay back the original amount plus a share of any increase in the value of their home when the mortgage was repaid, or when they died and the house was sold.

This share was usually worked out on a three-to-one basis – so if someone borrowed 25% of the value, they would be in line to hand over 75% of the future growth in value.

In the years since the Sam loans were sold, house prices have soared, leaving some who took them out facing huge repayments if they wanted to move – or bequeathing their offspring a costly headache after their death.

Both banks have previously reached confidential out-of-court settlements with some affected borrowers, which meant the fairness of the contacts was not tested in court.

Teacher Stern’s Barclays claimant group is made up of almost 80 people, including Galbraith, who is now in her 80s and took out a Sam mortgage on her home in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in September 1998. She formerly worked as a theatrical costumier to stars including Danny La Rue, who lived with her until his death in 2009.

Galbraith needs to downsize as she suffers from mobility problems and her property is a large, three-storey Victorian semi that has fallen into disrepair, according to the law firm and a close friend, Duncan Humber.

She took out a £33,750 loan on her home – 25% of its value at the time of £135,000. However, an estate agent valuation of the property carried out in late 2022 indicated it was worth between £950,000 and £995,000.

Based on the £995,000 figure, she would need to pay the bank £678,750 to redeem the loan. That comprises £645,000, which is 75% of the growth in the property’s value, plus the original loan.

Humber said: “She is trapped. She cannot sell her property as currently her Sam would take the lion’s share of all proceeds of sale, leaving her with insufficient funds to purchase even a one-bedroom bungalow in the area where she has lived her entire life.”

Teacher Stern has claimed Sams were “entirely unfair” products that had left borrowers trapped in their homes. Its case focuses on section 140 of the Consumer Credit Act, which gives the courts powers to intervene if the “relationship” between a company and a customer is judged to be unfair.

A Barclays spokesperson said Sam mortgages were “a historic product taken up by a relatively small number of customers which allowed people to borrow funds without the need to make any repayments during their lifetime. Customers have complete control over the timing of any sale and retain all of their original equity, as well as a share of any potential gain. We offer dedicated support for customers with a Sam that need to adapt their current home or move to a new one due to substantial hardship.”

They added that to ensure people fully understood the deal, “customers were required to seek independent legal advice that the terms of the legal charge and mortgage conditions had been fully explained to them. In addition, the product literature encouraged anyone interested in a Sam to discuss their intended borrowing with their family.”

A Bank of Scotland spokesperson said Sams were “a specialist type of mortgage … which were either interest-free or offered at a lower rate of interest in return for a share of any increase in property value”.

They added: “We recommended borrowers took financial advice to ensure they understood the product and that it was suitable for their needs, and all borrowers were advised by their own solicitor. We are unable to provide comment on individual cases but we do everything we reasonably can to help any customer facing financial hardship.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28f9412d0ca9d78078eec7ad3aa8e50d50dfe3fc/424_0_4410_3530/master/4410.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eba34fac7a25b3f03c6c04f5204754c5",N,,2025-09-08 13:03:03.544695

A new Walmart AI certification program, in partnership with OpenAI, is set to prepare U.S. frontline and office-based employees for AI-related tasks. The Walmart-OpenAI certification program is set to begin in 2026, included as a part of the company’s Live Better U education program.

With nearly $1 billion committed to skill training for employees next year, Walmart is certainly on the right track to doing more to upskill employees as the largest employer in the world.

The Walmart AI Certification Program Recenters Employee Training

Walmart is doing its best to hold on to its spot ahead of the competition, and adopting AI into its operations is just one of the many ways it’s set to stay ahead. The rise of AI has threatened workforces with layoffs, and Walmart has not been immune to job cuts this year either. However, the business has also announced a couple of different measures to support its workers. While the year-round worker discount on groceries is a very useful perk for employees to enjoy, additional support in terms of career growth is always a welcome addition for most.

“At Walmart, we know the future of retail won’t be defined by technology alone—it will be defined by people who know how to use it. By bringing AI training directly to our associates, we’re putting the most powerful technology of our time in their hands—giving them the skills to rewrite the playbook and shape the future of retail,” John Furner, CEO of Walmart US, said in a statement.

OpenAI is easily one of the biggest names in the artificial intelligence space, and Walmart is equally renowned as one of the largest retailers around. The collaboration between the two parties could be vital to encouraging other businesses to follow suit with AI training and employee certifications next year.

What We Know About OpenAI’s AI Training Program

In a recent update on the website, OpenAI announced that it was building an OpenAI Jobs Platform to meet business needs. The platform is expected to showcase candidates with different skill levels to make it easier for companies to find employees who fit the bill on the level of experience required for a role. “The jobs platform won’t just be a way for big companies to attract more talent. It will have a track dedicated to helping local businesses compete, and local governments find the AI talent they need to better serve their constituents,” the company wrote in the post.

Additionally, to help ensure that candidates on the platform are genuinely skilled with its AI tools, the business is also set to introduce OpenAI Certifications, which are expected to be an extension of the OpenAI Academy services launched earlier this year. The academy will offer certifications for “different levels of AI fluency,” using AI to teach AI.

The goal? To certify 10 million Americans by 2030. For this mission, Walmart is set to be one of its launch partners, helping the company prepare its employees while also boosting the AI platform as a top choice for AI literacy.

Understanding the Walmart-OpenAI Partnership

While the OpenAI certification program is a separate project meant for a wider audience, the Walmart-OpenAI partnership will allow employees to have access to a more tailored version of this certification program. The pilot phase is expected to launch around the end of 2025 or early 2026. Walmart’s AI training program is primarily designed to be beneficial to U.S. frontline and office-based employees, who are most likely to begin utilizing AI in their operations.

Walmart’s AI certification program is just one part of the changes being introduced at the retailer in preparation for an AI-powered future. The company has already introduced a conversational AI tool for employees to interact with and improve their efficiency. Back in July, Walmart also announced the release of four AI “super agents” into its company-wide framework to simplify tasks at various critical junctures of the organization.

Should You Follow Suit and Look Into Duplicating Walmart’s AI Training Program?

As Walmart trains employees on AI, its workers will certainly become more capable of handling the tools and technologies the company introduces in the future. Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon doesn’t believe that these AI tools are lifting their top-line sales just yet, but they remain excited for what lies ahead. While the quality and usefulness of Walmart’s AI certification program with OpenAI remain to be seen, the company does appear to be on the right track.

Instead of treading through unknown waters without a plan, Walmart is set to train workers on AI with the support of programs created by the AI makers themselves. This should make it easier for the training to touch on matters that are of relevance to employees, without relying on workers to independently figure things out on their own time.

AI experts are in high demand, and identifying the right talent on the market can be an arduous task. Instead, training workers who already have all the other requirements for the job can help with retention as well as internal circulation of talent, allowing everyone to walk away from the experience satisfied. Whether you follow in Walmart’s footsteps with AI certification programs from OpenAI or rely on your own resources to build these programs, upskilling and reskilling employees to keep up with the times can work in your favor in the long run.",https://www.thehrdigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Walmart-AI-certification.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 13:23:04.397641

Leslie G. Sarasin is the president and CEO of FMI — The Food Industry Association, a trade association advocating for a safer, healthier and more efficient consumer food supply chain.

Through leveraging technology, grocers and manufacturers are shaping the food industry of tomorrow with modern business operations and workforce solutions fueled by data analysis and artificial intelligence. Overall, the food industry is creating an innovative and customer-forward grocery shopping experience to meet the needs and desires of consumers with a convenience they can rely on.

A key area of investment is e-commerce, which is becoming a larger part of the overall food retail sales picture every day. The Food Retailing Industry Speaks 2025 report from FMI – The Food Industry Association found that the total share of grocery sales conducted through e-commerce increased from 6% in 2023 to 7.1% in 2024, and most grocers reported that their overall e-commerce business is profitable.

The food industry is determined to meet consumer demand for a more convenient shopping experience, whether that’s in-store, online or for pickup. Today, 85% of food retailers reported conducting online sales, a significant increase from the 50% who reported online sales prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The retailers engaged in e-commerce offered an average of more than 28,000 items online in 2024. Online transactions averaged 113,294 per week last year for food retailers, with the average purchase size totaling $108.

Investments in e-commerce impact business across grocery departments. Dry grocery remains the most frequently purchased online food variety. However, fresh or perimeter departments, along with frozen foods, represent almost half of online sales, largely concentrated in produce, meat and dairy.

From recent investments in refreshed assortments to new partnerships, ongoing efforts to strengthen e-commerce approaches are paying off for food retailers. These investments include increasing the allocation of staff to support e-commerce operations, growing the workforce for online fulfillment, offering additional products online and emphasizing the focus on fresh or perimeter departments.

In fact, the majority of food retailers with online sales saw an average 15.6% increase in these sales over the last year. This growth is most impressive when considering that, in 2023, most food retailers reported an average 11.3% decline in online sales. This represents a nearly 30-point year-over-year swing and demonstrates the impact of dedicated, thoughtful investments in areas where consumer demand is strong and growing.

Beyond e-commerce, most retailers and all suppliers surveyed for the Speaks report have incorporated data analytics for activities such as pricing and promotion to better serve value-conscious shoppers as well as for assortment planning and replenishment. Additionally, nearly half of grocers and almost all suppliers are employing AI to increase efficiency. Other technology investments include fraud protection assistance, mobile checkout systems, product traceability and planning for fresh inventory and demand or production.

All these investments have one common goal: improving efficiency so that grocers and manufacturers can focus on best serving customers, just as they did during the COVID-19 pandemic. When the world was met with the unpredictability of the pandemic, grocers responded with efforts to ensure that people in the U.S. remained fed amid supply chain shortfalls and adjusted to contact-free transactions during this unprecedented time. Investments in technology expanded into investments in people – retaining, recruiting and supporting those working within stores so retailers could meet customer demand during challenging times.

In 2022, most retailers and suppliers reported that recruitment and retention issues negatively impacted their business. The tumult of the pandemic caused similar challenges across many industries, and the grocery sector was not immune. To address these concerns and create a modern supermarket experience for consumers, the industry made investments in competitive wages, improved benefits, flex time, training and skill development.

In Speaks 2025, nearly all retailers and suppliers reported offering competitive wages and salaries as strategies to improve hiring and retaining full-time employees. Others reported retention efforts such as employee wellness programs, mental well-being resources and education programs and benefits.

In previous years, retailers reported challenges with workforce development and training due to the high costs associated with these programs, which can cost more than $600 per full-time employee. Nearly half of grocers predict these costs will remain constant in the year to come, while half expect an increase in costs for training programs. Despite the expense, grocers experienced fewer challenges with workforce development last year than in previous years.

In short, workforce development efforts have paid off.

Last year, the industry’s concerns about retention and recruitment significantly eased. About half of retailers and some suppliers still reported challenges, but overall, the sector saw a notable improvement in reducing employee turnover—bringing rates closer to pre-COVID-19 levels. In 2024, retailers reported a 48% employee turnover rate, down from the 2022 level of 65%. The turnover rate among suppliers is now at 13%.

Initiatives to onboard and retain employees have successfully bolstered retailers’ workforce. In 2023, the industry estimated there would be 500,000 job openings across all U.S. grocery stores in 2024. However, the industry reported approximately 200,000 job openings at the end of the year. That amounts to an average of 1.5 full-time and 2.8 part-time open positions per store nationwide.

Of course, there are still uncertainties ahead. While it is unclear how current immigration and trade policy changes may affect the industry, almost half of retailers and suppliers predict that immigration policy will impact pricing and supply chains. Whatever challenges arise, the food industry will continue to adapt and invest in the supermarket experience of the future.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/xJUr1ikipwS9VJ2ucnO3VUcQWvYoPmAA9HJCJhwUomU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzE3NjEwMzA2XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-08 13:01:45.969612

For those of us working in corporate social responsibility (CSR), this week offers a rare opportunity: a convergence of peers, partners, and potential collaborators all in one place. The networking corridors, side events, and shared coffees become fertile ground for forging new alliances—ones that can scale impact far beyond what any single company could achieve alone.

With companies trying to outpace one another, corporate social responsibility offers an opportunity for a different formula: The more we align, the more lives we reach.

Public-private partnerships

While every company has its own limits with philanthropic budgets, we can make those dollars stretch further through private-private partnerships—alliances where 1 + 1 equals 3. These partnerships allow companies to pool resources, expertise, and infrastructure in pursuit of shared values and social impact goals.

Take, for example, a 2023 collaboration between Kellogg’s and the Albertsons Companies Foundation to support Feeding America through the “Feed the Love” campaign. Kellogg’s provided a grant to the Foundation’s Nourishing Neighbors initiative, helping provide over 300,000 meals. Albertsons promoted the effort across its grocery network, engaging consumers in the shared mission. This alignment showcases how leading brands in food manufacturing and retail can unite resources, amplify reach, and drive progress toward hunger relief.

In early 2025, after wildfires scorched parts of Southern California, PepsiCo stepped up to supply food and beverages to affected families. Their strength was inventory—but distribution was the hurdle. By teaming with Amazon, PepsiCo’s Food for Good program accelerated relief delivery, turning shared logistics into life-saving outreach.

NBCUniversal has cultivated extended partnerships that amplify nonprofit storytelling and nurture future creative talent. Our Creative Impact Lab not only supports nonprofit marketing but also provides career-building experiences for emerging creatives.

Recently, the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth (the Center) joined forces with NBCU’s Lab to elevate the work of its grantee, Community Reinvestment Fund (CRF), a Chicago-based nonprofit that finances small businesses. The Center funded Free Spirit Media to create marketing assets, with NBCUniversal employees mentoring the young creators. The resulting PSA now airs in donated media time on Comcast and NBCUniversal platforms, giving CRF national visibility.

Similarly, The Estée Lauder Companies (ELC) collaborated with NBCU to spotlight Wide Angle Youth Media (WAYM), a Baltimore nonprofit focused on media arts education. Through this partnership, WAYM’s young creatives told their story—backed by funding, mentoring, and national airtime.

In both projects, the benefits were mutual: funding and a selection of deserving grantee organizations from ELC and the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, free airtime, and mentorship from NBCUniversal. Plus there were invaluable opportunities for rising creatives. These efforts created awareness for the nonprofits, while supporting the next generation of creative talent.

Shared values

And here’s the key: None of this could happen without shared values. It requires corporations willing to break silos, share missions, and treat CSR not as a checkbox, but a creative, collective force for good.

Looking ahead, I envision a CSR landscape where such partnerships are more routine. And, where industries of all stripes join forces to uplift the nonprofits working tirelessly to improve our communities. All it takes is cross-sector imagination and a commitment to thinking beyond turf.

Pampers on Sunday (Sept. 7) unveiled a new ad campaign and refreshed brand ethos that will underpin the marketing creative and products for the Procter & Gamble-owned diaper brand moving forward, per details shared with Marketing Dive.

“Behind Every Baby” launched with a 60-second anthem spot around the NFL’s opening weekend. The commercial aims to tug on the heartstrings as a rendition of “Stand By Me” shows the key role diapers play in every babies’ growth journey, concluding on a shot of a baby standing up and walking, presumably for the first time.

Pampers is supporting the campaign by partnering with influencers and content creators, including “Love is Blind” couple Lauren Speed-Hamilton and Cameron Hamilton, as well as running social activations targeted at parents to broaden its impact.

Dive Insight:

Pampers is embracing more cinematic, emotionally driven ads to better stand out from rivals that lean on product-led marketing. The P&G brand launched its latest effort, part of a larger revamp of its brand ethos, around NFL season kickoff, capitalizing on a destination TV viewing occasion for families.

The anthem spot for “Behind Every Baby” tracks tots in Pampers through several stages of growth and emotional ups and downs, from first being born to sleeping soundly in a crib and finally taking first steps. The ad underscores Pamper’s legacy of more than six decades in diaper innovation while spotlighting product offerings centered on comfort. PG One, Publicis Groupe’s bespoke unit for P&G, is behind the tear-jerking campaign, with creative spearheaded by Saatchi & Saatchi New York and PR headed up by MSL.

Pampers is extending the platform through influencers in another sign of how social-first strategies are becoming more important to legacy CPG brands. In Pampers’ case, it is angling to reach millennial and older Gen Z parents who are more digitally native and on the cusp of parenthood. Influencer content will focus on a mix of entertainment and how-to videos sharing practical advice. The Hamiltons, a couple who met on the Netflix reality TV hit “Love is Blind,” are expecting their first child soon.

On Sept. 9, Pampers will try to orchestrate the World’s Biggest Birth Announcement, asking parents of newborns to post photos of their child to TikTok for the chance to win a year’s supply of diapers. The sweepstakes, which will select 100 winning families, is timed to the day that sees the most births, on average, in the U.S.

In addition, Pampers hosted photo experiences for newborns at Wellspan Health in York, Pennsylvania, and The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio, to kick off the campaign’s social push.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/rXPIRt_fNVrp7w5CBVt_szr6nRijJYJBu4KdOgBSovI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9QYW1wZXJzX0JlaGluZF9FdmVyeV9CYWJ5XzEucG5n.webp,N,,2025-09-08 13:06:58.951872

The industrial sector alone contributes to more than 35% of GHG emissions, with Scope 3 representing 70% of this impact, according to Capgemini.

In Capgemini’s Building sustainable value chains report, it states that if unchecked, rising emissions could drive global temperatures up by 4.1–4.8°C by 2100, far exceeding the Paris Agreement’s 1.5–2°C target.

At the same time, sustainable transformation presents a unique opportunity for businesses to unlock cost efficiency, resilience and long-term competitiveness.

The challenges of decarbonisation

While sustainability is high on the corporate agenda, execution remains a persistent challenge.

Half of companies admit they are off-track on Scope 3 decarbonisation and 67% express low confidence in their ability to deliver mature roadmaps.

Barriers include:

Difficulty in making a strong business case for long-term sustainability investments

Complexity in tracking and accurately reporting carbon emissions

Obstacles in decarbonising supply chains

Limited scalability of low-carbon technologies.

Sectoral variations add further complexity.

For industries like cement, steel and mining, Scope 1 emissions dominate, whereas in chemicals, electronics and food, Scope 3 emissions are the key challenge, requiring deep collaboration with suppliers, manufacturers and consumer brands.

“Building a sustainable value chain is an iterative process,” says Cyril Garcia Group Executive Board Member and Head of Sustainability, Capgemini and Charlotte Pierron-Perlès Global Head of Intelligent Industry, Capgemini Invent in the report.

“It requires a balanced approach between short-term quick wins, such as energy efficiency and sustainable product design improvements and long-term action, such as strategising on the product portfolio, sustainable asset investment and supply chain re-design.”

The business case for sustainability

Despite these hurdles, the evidence for the benefits of sustainable value chains is strong.

Sustainable practices directly enhance cost efficiency by reducing energy consumption, lowering carbon taxes and optimising processes.

For example:

A packaging redesign using life-cycle assessment reduced product carbon footprints from 10 to 3 kgCO₂e – while also cutting costs.

An automotive project achieved 27% Scope 1 and 13% Scope 2 CO₂ reduction across 17 sites.

Circular business models in the water and automotive sectors have demonstrated material savings of up to 50% and cost reductions of 70%.

Digital twins and AI models enabled one heavy industry client to cut kiln energy use by 15% and reduce development cycles by 70%.

These examples prove that sustainability, when integrated across operations, delivers measurable business benefits alongside climate impact.

For instance, an automated product carbon footprint system allowed a manufacturer with 8,000 suppliers and 350,000 product references to build a comprehensive decarbonisation roadmap.

“Digital transformation and AI are a formidable opportunity to get faster and improve decision-making throughout this transformation, as they help achieve better designs, more productive assets and more flexible supply chains,” say Cyril and Charlotte in the report.

By leveraging such tools, companies can overcome complexity, build collaborative ecosystems with suppliers and partners and move from isolated strategies to end-to-end sustainable value chain management.

Sustainable value chains are not just a compliance requirement but a growth engine for businesses prepared to act.

They reduce environmental impact, drive cost efficiency and create resilience in the face of global uncertainty.

While many organisations remain off-track on Scope 3, those that embrace digital innovation, collaboration and circular practices will lead the way in shaping competitive, future-proof industries.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/f1253fa537d2419ea109e8dc9f7a8286:84fcac6d781659f435d0549f621b556d/capgemini-main.webp.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 13:03:38.930710

The bank isn't commenting, but we understand that a range of people in the London macro sales team have been promoted.

They include Ben Mabley, a Barclays managing director who joined from Goldman Sachs last year as head of rates and solutions sales and who's thought to have been elevated to run both EMEA and UK sales; Punitha Rajah, a director in rates sales who's been made head of UK real money sales; and Rumit Sawjani, who's thought to have been promoted as co-head of hedge fund and systematic sales with Gwen Jing.

The promotions are expected to help lock people in if Zorzoli attempts to hire them for his new team at Nomura.

Sawjani in particular is seen as a rising star on Barclays' macro sales desk. He joined Barclays in 2007 after graduating from Warwick Business School. His promotion follows what insiders say was an impressive speech at a Barclays hedge fund event last week. He didn't respond to a request to comment for this article.

As we've reported, Barclays has already suffered numerous losses from its macro trading team, including Noel Cochrane, who's gone to Deutsche Bank; James Armstrong, who's gone to Balyasny; Nico Huss, who's gone to Citi; Ankur Aneja, whose destination remains a mystery; Justin Firmino, who's also AWOL; and Nishant Singh who's gone to BlueCrest.

Barclays has been hiring, too. Bloomberg reports today that ""more than two dozen"" ""senior"" macro traders have arrived at the British bank. They include: Lucile Medori and Laura Brown, whose arrivals we reported last week; Tom Brennan, an MD from Nomura; Kin Hoe Yau, a mid-ranking trader from Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong and Bob Xu, an options trader who joined in June in Singapore. Further trading hires are expected.

The bank will need to hope that the recent promotions will be enough to keep existing staff happy amidst the flood of new arrivals. Improved bonuses might help as well.

Senseonics has struck a deal to retake control of the commercialization and distribution of its implantable continuous glucose monitors, the company said Wednesday.

Ascensia Diabetes Care is currently the exclusive worldwide distributor of the Eversense devices. That will change at the start of 2026, when Senseonics will resume responsibility.

BTIG analysts said in a note to investors that the move shows “Senseonics is doubling down on its view that the one-year sensor will finally enable an inflection in patient demand for the implantable glucose monitor.”

Dive Insight:

Senseonics entered into a collaboration with Ascensia in 2020. The arrangement freed Senseonics from the need to establish and maintain commercial infrastructure but also required it to pay a revenue share to Ascensia.

Under the new agreement, U.S. commercial operations will transfer to Senseonics at the start of 2026. Senseonics CEO Tim Goodnow discussed the rationale for the deal on a call with investors, explaining that it will enable a “clear focus and targeted resourcing” to build the Eversense brand.

“Through this standalone strategy, we will recognize margin expansion and recaptured revenue share, which we expect will enable us to make the necessary strategic investment to drive awareness and adoption to accelerate Eversense penetration and revenue growth,” Goodnow said.

Senseonics expects gross margins to expand from around 35% at the midpoint of the range for this year to 50% in 2026. The company sees margins expanding to 70% in the future. However, BTIG analysts said there are additional costs to consider.

“We wonder how much of these savings will be offset by the operating expenses needed to support the sales organization and commercial efforts,” the analysts wrote. “In our view, Senseonics will need a large, high-touch salesforce and marketing teams to be successful in taking meaningful share from legacy systems or to expand the CGM-using population.”

Brian Hansen, the president of CGM at Ascensia, will become Senseonics’ chief commercial officer. BTIG analysts said the majority of the Ascensia U.S. sales and marketing teams have committed to joining Senseonics “and should enable a relatively smooth transition.”

The transfer comes as Senseonics continues to roll out its one-year Eversense 365 CGM implant in the U.S. The company has identified the longer lifespan of the device compared to older Eversense models as a development that can help it win share in a market dominated by Abbott and Dexcom.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/1cfLDTGjxJcHcRCJXgblgBanf7uEtjgtueuKyjylGv4/g:nowe:205:854/c:3173:1792/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9FdmVyc2Vuc2VfMzY1X0NHTS5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-09-08 13:05:35.432720

Two Republican congressmen are investigating CVS over concerns that the company used confidential patient information to lobby against a Louisiana bill that would have forced it to break up its pharmacy business.

On Thursday, House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., and Federal Law Enforcement Subcommittee Chair Clay Higgins, R-La., sent a letter pressing CVS about its June text message campaign to patients, alleging it may have violated the HIPAA privacy law.

The letter requests information about CVS’ use of patient data for the purposes of political advocacy in Louisiana and other states over the past five years. A spokesperson for CVS confirmed that the company has received the letter and plans to respond, while defending CVS’ behavior as “consistent with the law.”

Dive Insight:

The letter stems from reports that on June 11 CVS sent a mass text message to thousands of customers in Louisiana using data that patients shared with the company for prescription drug services. The text threatened that local pharmacies would close and drug prices would rise if Louisiana were to pass H.B. 358, a bill that would prevent companies in the state from operating both pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacies.

The text urged recipients to contact their state representatives to oppose the bill, according to local reports.

CVS’ behavior appears to breach the HIPAA, the federal law protecting individuals’ personal health information, Comer and Higgins wrote in their letter to CVS CEO David Joyner.

“CVS Pharmacy routinely uses its mass text messaging system to notify patients about prescription updates and other individualized patient information,” the letter reads. “Therefore, it appears CVS Health’s use of protected patient information for the purposes of political advocacy may represent a violation of HIPAA.”

Louisiana’s attorney general Liz Murrill sent a cease-and-desist letter to CVS the day after the texts went out. CVS denied that its actions represented a violation of HIPAA to the state. Still, Louisiana filed an enforcement action against CVS in state court later that month, alleging that the text message campaign — and CVS’ ownership of both PBM Caremark and pharmacies — broke the state’s trade practices law.

CVS operates 119 pharmacies in Louisiana, along with one of the largest PBMs in the nation. That creates an inherent conflict of interest, according to critics of entrenched corporate power in the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain.

It’s a concern shared by antitrust regulators. The Federal Trade Commission has issued two reports highly critical of PBMs, including of their ownership of pharmacies, and is suing Caremark and two other major PBMs for allegedly driving up the cost of insulin in the U.S.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/mnhZTPreky_qY_ioL0XqKB7RQnLZq4-X_YE3RHwP92M/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xOTkzNzcxMTE2LmpwZ19yZXNpemUuanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-08 13:05:08.612106

That’s why another data point, emissions intensity, is an important “companion metric,” she said.
Walmart has cut its emissions intensity by 47.4 percent over the past 10 years, while growing revenue roughly 40 percent to $684 billion.
Emissions intensity decreased 3.7 percent.
“I think it’s important to consider that every banana we ship, every toaster that you buy from Walmart, the emissions footprint at that level is coming down,” McLaughlin said.","Walmart’s latest environmental report confirms what it warned of in December: the world’s largest retailer won’t meet its 2025 goal to cut the carbon footprint from its retail operations and energy consumption by 35 percent and looks unlikely to meet its pledge for a 65 percent reduction by 2030.

Yet, in its ESG report published Sept. 8, the company’s chief sustainability officer characterizes progress toward Walmart’s goal of reaching zero emissions by 2040 as “meaningful.” Why the optimism? Here are three highlights.

A big emissions intensity reduction

Walmart logged a 1.1 percent year-over-year increase in 2024 for its Scope 1 and 2 emissions to 15.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gases. On the bright side, the Bentonville, Arkansas, company has reduced that footprint cumulatively by 18.1 percent since 2015 — short of where it should be, but a significant cut from where it started.

“Progress isn’t always linear, especially for some of the longer-term goals that require partnerships across sectors, industries, communities and among different groups that have very different views about how to achieve outcomes,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, executive vice president and chief sustainability officer at Walmart.

That’s why another data point, emissions intensity, is an important “companion metric,” she said. It measures the ratio of operational emissions per million dollars of revenue, offering a different context for investors. Walmart has cut its emissions intensity by 47.4 percent over the past 10 years, while growing revenue roughly 40 percent to $684 billion. Emissions intensity decreased 3.7 percent.

It’s easier for a company losing market share to cut its footprint than for one meeting its business growth objectives to do the same. “I think it’s important to consider that every banana we ship, every toaster that you buy from Walmart, the emissions footprint at that level is coming down,” McLaughlin said.

Walmart also studies this metric for its much larger Scope 3 footprint, which reached an estimated 636.6 million metric tons in 2024. For that emissions category, intensity has been reduced 6.2 percent since 2022.

A clear rationale for short-term increases

Walmart’s decision to in-source more of its fleet operations two years ago resulted in a 19.6 percent increase in transportation-related emissions. That strategic shift was necessary to support growth in Walmart’s e-commerce business and will yield more efficiencies over time; in effect, those emissions were transferred from Scope 3, so that Walmart can influence them more directly.

For the next few years, that number is likely to keep increasing, as Walmart navigates investments for both last-mile and long-haul delivery methods. The three biggest contributors to address: Class 8 tractor trailers, refrigerated trucks and warehouse vehicles.

Walmart is piloting alternative technologies, including heavy-duty electric vehicles and forklifts that run on hydrogen fuel cells, and it opened a renewable hydrogen fuel plant in Latin America.

A strong link to stakeholder value

The Sustainability section of Walmart’s 113-page report, which starts on page 25, deliberately links its climate goals — including those for water stewardship, sourcing and energy — to business value creation.

“Talk about your strategies in a way that helps people understand why you’re pursuing topics, why you’re pursuing strategies, why it’s good for your business, as well as for stakeholders,” McLaughlin said. “As you know, sometimes different stakeholders will have different views about issues or different language that they use, take time to understand that.”

One example is how Walmart is handling the overhaul of the refrigerants used to keep its products and buildings cool, which accounted for 57 percent of its Scope 1 footprint in 2024. That was a 2.4 percent decrease over the previous year, due to ongoing investments that were built into the company’s financial models and capital allocations.

All Walmart stores in the U.S., for example, undergo preventive maintenance and the company has hired more than 600 refrigeration technicians. When stores are updated or new locations built, Walmart requires the installation of cooling systems with lower global warming potential where commercially possible. So far, about 410 U.S facilities have been updated; as of August, Walmart had slightly less than 4,600 locations.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AdobeStock_643187171_Editorial_Use_Only.jpeg,N,,2025-09-08 13:07:58.765059

ID36,Ralph Lauren,2025-09-08 13:59:41+00:00,the Guardian,Are US fashion brands at risk of growing anti-American backlash over Trump policies?,"Lauren Cochrane, www.theguardian.com",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/08/are-us-fashion-brands-at-risk-of-growing-anti-american-backlash-over-trump-policies,"Last week, in its UK accounts, Levi’s issued a warning that “rising anti-Americanism as a consequence of the Trump tariffs and governmental policies” could affect its sales in Britain.
The idea is not unique – attitudes towards Tesla in the UK and Europe deteriorated when Elon Musk was closely associated with Trump.
However, the Levi’s warning raises the question – could fashion become the latest sector affected by anti-American sentiment outside the US?
“The domestic markets for some of these brands absolutely blow their international sales out of the water,” Shuttleworth says.
Could a similar boycott happen with fashion brands in the UK?","An effortlessly cool Nick Kamen strolls into a launderette, strips to his boxer shorts and washes his jeans in front of a stunned clientele, soundtracked by Marvin Gaye’s I Heard It Through the Grapevine. The 1985 Levi’s 501 advert made a star of its model, and presented an image in keeping with the clothing brand’s all-American style.

But could that deep-seated association with the US prove an achilles heel? Last week, in its UK accounts, Levi’s issued a warning that “rising anti-Americanism as a consequence of the Trump tariffs and governmental policies” could affect its sales in Britain. The idea is not unique – attitudes towards Tesla in the UK and Europe deteriorated when Elon Musk was closely associated with Trump. However, the Levi’s warning raises the question – could fashion become the latest sector affected by anti-American sentiment outside the US?

Retail and brand experts are divided. Achim Berg, the founder of the Germany-based fashion and luxury thinktank FashionSights, was surprised by the Levi’s warning – he sees the company as a different case from something such as Tesla or Amazon, which are “directly associated with the US [government]”. This is in contrast to other companies. “I haven’t seen any reports about people holding back on Apple, holding back on Netflix. If you think about it, we are all using plenty of US products and services every day.”

However, Catherine Shuttleworth, a retail consultant and the chief executive of Savvy Marketing, does think there is a risk. “People are thinking twice about going on holiday to America and about buying some of those products,” she says. “If I was [a retailer of an] all-American product, I would be thinking about how I presented myself differently in terms of my advertising and marketing.”

Any sign of an anti-Americanism trend would cause a headache for an industry benefiting from the popularity of Americana and preppy looks.

Labels such as Hollister, Ralph Lauren and Brandy Melville are popular – the last opened a new store in London in June.

Hollister’s parent company, Abercrombie & Fitch, posted a 12% rise in profit in its Europe, the Middle East and Africa division in 2024 and searches for Polo Ralph Lauren increased 27% on the resale app Depop between July and August.

Alex Goat, the chief executive of the youth-focused creative agency Livity, says this look plugs into an idealised version of the US that is served in popular TV shows such as The Summer I Turned Pretty and My Life with the Walter Boys. “They are not reflecting the political issues that are going on in the States at the moment. They’re the same halcyon American days that we all probably thought about when we were growing up,” she says. “If that’s what you think America is, then where’s the challenge to buy from brands like that?”

Emma Davidson, the fashion features director of Dazed Digital, agrees this look is not a direct correlation with an all-American patriotism. “We call it preppy and varsity style but it feels one step removed from what it once stood for,” she says.

Experts do, however, agree that overt patriotism is unlikely to export well. “If you were Levi’s you wouldn’t be what you’ve been leaning into [stars and stripes],” Shuttleworth says. “You might use influencers that are not as American perhaps.”

Davidson points to a cultural example. “It surprised me that Beyoncé was plastered in stars and stripes throughout the Cowboy Carter tour,” she says. “It felt really out of step with what’s going on in the world.”

While these are global brands, appealing to US customers is an integral part of their business. “The domestic markets for some of these brands absolutely blow their international sales out of the water,” Shuttleworth says. “They will have to think strategically about who they appeal to in the short term.” With tariffs in place on imports, there is also an opportunity here – with consumers potentially shifting, as Trump hopes, to “buying American”.

Patriotic and conservative marketing can play out well with consumers who voted for Trump, as has been proven with American Eagle’s US campaign with the blond, blue-eyed Sydney Sweeney opining that she has “great genes”. With an outcry on social media, one TikTok user described it as “dog whistle to the rise of conservatism in this country”. True to form, Trump praised Sweeney on social media.

Rather than this having a negative impact on the brand, American Eagle’s share price increased 25% last week in the aftermath of an upbeat quarterly update – with sales decreasing only 1% compared with 5% in the previous quarter. Its chief executive, Jay Schottenstein, credited the Sweeney ad, arguing it helped “an uptick in customer awareness, engagement and comparable sales”.

In Canada, hostility towards US products is growing – with reports of shoppers turning American goods upside down on supermarket shelves so they can be avoided by fellow shoppers, and a slump in sales of Jack Daniel’s, a brand that has Americana central to its marketing.

Could a similar boycott happen with fashion brands in the UK? Shuttleworth is sceptical. “What cost are our principles?” she says. “We say one thing but we do another. I don’t like Donald Trump very much but if Bobbi Brown launches a new range of makeup tomorrow, don’t think I won’t buy it because it’s American. I’ll self-justify.”

Berg argues that consumer awareness around brands is less than the media suggests. “In my experience, customer reaction is typically not as direct and not as consequential and consistent as people tend to think,” he says. “You could see that during the ‘wokeness’ wave, during the sustainability wave. Despite a certain reputation, consumers were still in love with certain brands that were not famous for being very woke or being very sustainable.”

Goat says this is particularly true with young people. “It’s like ‘the world is burning, and I want to act on that but I still want to be able to buy clothes that are affordable.’” (She is quick to point out this is not the first generation of young people with such a paradox – “younger people are always more politically involved and still also want to look good and feel good and do that on a budget,” she says.)

While Goat does not totally rule out a distancing from American brands, she suggests that young people in the UK are more likely to boycott those with links to Israel because of its government’s actions in Gaza. “It’s a humanitarian crisis versus a very difficult political situation.”

If a significant boycott of US brands does materialise, Shuttleworth believes it would spread online. “It’s like: ‘How can we hurt Trump? Probably only in the economy,’” she says. “If enough people get behind it, it becomes a thing; social media can grow really quickly.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3da2444f2787aa45a12b66418bbbf8a637b53e41/1_13_3182_2546/master/3182.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3e621329a9f1c1ac591807150c601427",N,,2025-09-08 11:26:43.764954

Citi, BNY Mellon, U.S. Bank, UBS, Santander, and SMBC were all sanctioned for a range of shortcomings, from recordkeeping lapses to inaccurate reporting.

The penalties form part of the CFTC’s “enforcement sprint,” a program launched in March by Acting Chair Caroline Pham to help banks quickly settle lower-level compliance cases that don’t involve market abuse or harm to customers.

UBS faces the largest fine, at $5 million, for failing to adequately oversee trade surveillance systems over nearly a decade. The regulator said the Swiss bank’s systems left gaps in monitoring across a wide range of asset classes, including foreign exchange, metals, rates, credit products, and exchange-traded derivatives.

Citi was fined $1.5 million, though the amount was reduced due to what the CFTC described as “exemplary self-reporting and cooperation.” The bank’s issues included submitting inaccurate large-trader reports between 2015 and 2022 because of a programming error, and a separate failure to maintain required records for several weeks in 2023.

U.S. Bank will pay $325,000 to settle claims that it provided incorrect swap valuation data for some foreign-exchange and interest-rate products due to flaws in its methodology.

BNY Mellon, meanwhile, was penalized again for off-channel communications failings just months after paying $40 million to the SEC in a related case. As part of its settlement with the CFTC, the bank has been ordered to adopt the recommendations of an independent compliance consultant.

Santander must also carry out an internal audit of its electronic communications program for US staff and address any weaknesses uncovered.

The regulator emphasized that its enforcement sprint is designed to encourage firms to come forward with workable settlement proposals, signaling a more pragmatic approach to resolving compliance-related cases.",https://www.bankingexchange.com/media/k2/items/cache/d4d8b45b601b7384b5d17b2f5cb6c5cc_S.jpg?t=20250908_135037,N,,2025-09-08 11:25:30.906969

The findings appear consonant with recent brokers’ reports, which have suggested rates are softening in key marine insurance segments including cargo and hull and machinery (H&M).
Cargo hung on to its traditional standing as the biggest class, accounting for 56.7% of all marine premiums, with H&M second on 24.2%.
Cargo loss ratios – incurred losses and adjustment expenses divided by earned premiums – maintained their ongoing downwards trend, falling for the seventh year in succession.
In contrast to cargo, loss ratios are on the up, with increases in each of the past five years.","Global marine insurance premiums have hit an all-time high of almost $40bn, the International Union of Marine Insurance (Iumi) conference has been told.

The total top line for the niche increased 1.5% in 2024 to reach $39.92bn, according to a presentation given by the organisation’s in-house statistician, Veith Huesmann, at the event in Singapore on September 8.

However, the downside appears to be the rate of growth is slowing down markedly from the 5.9% recorded in 2023 and 8.3% the year before that.

The findings appear consonant with recent brokers’ reports, which have suggested rates are softening in key marine insurance segments including cargo and hull and machinery (H&M).

Cargo hung on to its traditional standing as the biggest class, accounting for 56.7% of all marine premiums, with H&M second on 24.2%. Offshore and energy brought in 10.9% of premiums and marine liability 8.2%.

Factors cited as determining premium trends include global trade activity and transaction levels; fluctuations in asset and commodity valuations; currency movements and exchange rate shifts; political and regional developments impacting stability; and supply-side dynamics including market capacity.

Broken down by region, Europe is still taking the largest slice of the premium pie, although its overall share is falling, in contrast to the growth experienced by the Asia-Pacific market, particularly by Chinese underwriters. Iumi assesses this as a long-term trend and does not predict sudden change.

The largest cargo markets by country are China on 17.6%; Lloyd’s on 9.7%; and the US on 6.9%; Brazil and Germany, both on 4.7%, do slightly better than the London companies market on 4.3%.

Asia was responsible for 60% of 2024 growth and the gap between Asia and Europe is closing.

Cargo loss ratios – incurred losses and adjustment expenses divided by earned premiums – maintained their ongoing downwards trend, falling for the seventh year in succession.

What seems to be happening is without one-off events, attritional losses are at a level that still attracts capital, bringing in both new players and returners. But the resultant overcapacity means increased competition in some markets.

The largest hull markets are the Nordic bloc on 12.9%, China on 11.6%, Lloyd’s on 8.7%, Singapore on 7.9% and London companies on 7.4%.

In contrast to cargo, loss ratios are on the up, with increases in each of the past five years.

Overcapacity led to the first signs of softening markets in 2024, with supply-side dynamics marked by the emergence of more managing general agents and by follow markets.

Rerouting – particularly marked as shipowners give the Red Sea a swerve and head round the Cape of Good Hope instead – has meant more weather damage.

Also exerting pressure are the increased age profile of the world fleet, as more owners opt to delay scrapping, and cost inflation, which is driving constructive total loss probabilities.

The state of protection and indemnity (P&I) is harder to assess, following the introduction of new reporting standards by the International Group of P&I clubs, which mean fixed-premium products are no longer included, making direct past year comparisons impossible.

However, market sources suggested an increase in mutual premiums of more than 3% between the 2023/24 and 2024/25 policy years.

The UK does maintain its dominance of the global offshore energy book, with London companies taking 31.6% and Lloyd’s 30%. Brazil and Mexico come in third and fourth, on 8.1% and 8% respectively. Loss ratios have been falling sharply since 2020.

Iumi highlighted a “significant uptick” in attritional losses, given the high demand and high use rates for offshore vessels. Continuing overcapacity is creating a soft market, with downwards pressure on premiums.

“Competition from conquests and evolving inventory dynamics reshaped consumer decision-making resulting in a higher rate of defections,” said S&P Global Mobility.
“Conquest opportunities are rebounding, particularly for luxury,” said Tom Libby, Loyalty Solutions and Industry Analysis Associate Director at S&P Global Mobility, in a statement.
Ford topped all brands at 58.9 per cent loyalty.
MINI currently leads the industry in loyalty growth after improving its loyalty rate by +4.6 percentage points YoY.","Automotive brand loyalty rates slipped during the first half of 2025 following a rebound last year, according to S&P Global Mobility’s analysis of new vehicle registration data through June.

In a news release, they said the industry’s brand loyalty rate through June was

51.1 per cent, which is 1.4 percentage points less than the same period in 2024. They said the decline marks a reversal from last year’s year-over-year gain, and highlights continued volatility in loyalty trends in a post-pandemic world.

“The loyalty rate shift this year reflects the balance between a steady return-to-market volume and strong competition among brands,” said Vince Palomarez, Associate Director of Loyalty Product Management at S&P Global Mobility, in a statement.

Palomarez added that households are returning to market, but many are “open to cross-shopping in ways we didn’t see during the height of pre-pandemic loyalty.”

S&P Global Mobility’s data shows both mainstream and luxury brands contributed to the decline: more than half of the brands tracked by the company

saw YoY loyalty declines of one percentage point or more. “Competition from conquests and evolving inventory dynamics reshaped consumer decision-making resulting in a higher rate of defections,” said S&P Global Mobility.

However, they also noted that conquest volume was up in the first half of 2025, with activity rising 7.6 per cent for mainstream brands and 6.2 per cent for luxury brands. This is compared with the same period in 2024.

“Conquest opportunities are rebounding, particularly for luxury,” said Tom Libby, Loyalty Solutions and Industry Analysis Associate Director at S&P Global Mobility, in a statement. “As loyalty softened, brands that executed competitive conquest strategies were able to capture households more effectively.”

Some of the mid-year highlights include: General Motors leading multi-brand OEMs with a loyalty rate of 68.1 per cent. Ford topped all brands at 58.9 per cent loyalty. MINI currently leads the industry in loyalty growth after improving its loyalty rate by +4.6 percentage points YoY.

Most AI spending has failed to show ROI because it doesn’t take into account the realities of store operations.
Consistently, customers have realized up to 60x ROI by addressing issues like waste, inventory accuracy, and store execution through focused, explainable solutions rather than hype-driven experiments.
The same applies to inventory productivity.
Retail Insight’s technology delivers actionable insights in real time, enhancing human judgment instead of overwhelming it with dashboards.","Margins have always been thin in grocery, but this year the compounding pressures of inflation, labor shortages, and supply chain volatility have pushed operators into survival mode. To protect margins, grocers are leaning harder on technology, allocating an average of 3.32% of revenue to AI – equivalent to $33.2 million annually. Yet much of that investment has failed to deliver. Instead of solving the everyday realities of brick-and-mortar operations, hype-driven AI projects have left associates drowning in dashboards, managers overwhelmed by KPIs, and billions still leaking through phantom inventory, fresh food waste, and inefficient markdowns.

Enhancing People, Products, and Places Through Intelligent Tasking

At its core, grocery operations come down to people, products, and places. Associates are being asked to do more with less, and their expertise and attention are finite. A store with 150,000 SKUs cannot expect staff to intuitively know where to intervene; they need real-time guidance that surfaces the next best action. When teams are directed to the right task at the right moment, such as correcting a phantom out-of-stock, clearing aging produce, or executing a markdown with accuracy, the result is measurable improvement in sales, shrink, and customer satisfaction. This frees employees to focus on higher-value tasks and improving overall store performance.

That is why “intelligent tasking” has emerged as a differentiator. Instead of analyzing more data, leading grocers are acting faster with prescriptive insights that prioritize what matters most. Unlike heavyweight digital overhauls that take years and major investment, lightweight solutions that sit on existing infrastructure can unlock value within weeks.

With a top U.S. grocer, our work layering actionable insights onto handheld devices associates already used produced immediate productivity gains, with millions saved through better availability, waste reduction, and improved execution. These tools created tangible wins, including increased shelf availability, reduced spoilage, and smoother operations, while also building trust and confidence in the technology. This feedback loop encourages employees to engage with the insights, creating a culture where success drives further success.

Technology for Real Results

Of course, we can’t have these conversations without addressing AI. It’s dominating headlines, demos, and investment roadmaps across retail. My advice: resist the temptation to chase hype cycles. The biggest wins are not coming from flashy projects but from what we call “quiet AI”: technology that quietly unlocks hours of productivity by embedding models into workflows that help stores make better day-to-day decisions. When AI sharpens a markdown decision, flags a hidden inventory gap, or eliminates hours of repetitive labor, it compounds quietly.

Most AI spending has failed to show ROI because it doesn’t take into account the realities of store operations. Black-box models quickly lose the trust of employees, who are the very people needed to execute on insights. At Retail Insight, we take a different approach. Through cognitive technology, we combine AI, advanced analytics, and deep retail domain expertise into hybrid solutions that augment (not replace) human judgment. This ensures insights are transparent, actionable, and trusted on the ground. It’s why our tools are already delivering tangible results to more than 50,000 stores worldwide. Consistently, customers have realized up to 60x ROI by addressing issues like waste, inventory accuracy, and store execution through focused, explainable solutions rather than hype-driven experiments.

Take waste, for example. Grocers must consider the right product in the right place at the right time, but the volume of fresh items and variability of demand make that a constant challenge. Our waste insight product uses predictive analytics to identify stock at risk of expiring and recommend effective interventions, combining machine learning with domain knowledge to help stores move perishable items faster, reduce shrink, and protect margins.

The same applies to inventory productivity. When AI highlights a phantom out-of-stock or flags a slow-moving SKU, it’s not enough to push an alert; the solution must guide staff to the next best action. Retail Insight’s technology delivers actionable insights in real time, enhancing human judgment instead of overwhelming it with dashboards. That’s why our customers consistently see measurable gains in shelf availability, reduced spoilage, and improved employee morale.

Speed to value is another differentiator. Large-scale digital transformations can take years to pay off, but our lightweight tools integrate with existing infrastructure and start showing results within weeks. Early wins build credibility with staff and confidence with leadership, setting the stage for long-term innovation rather than costly overhauls.

He also worked as executive vice president and chief operating officer of Tom Ford and as worldwide director of merchandising at Gucci.
According to founder Stella McCartney, his arrival will contribute to the next growth phase of the brand.
I know that Tom shares my vision for the brand and the ethical values that are part of our DNA,” said McCartney in a statement.
Mendenhall himself calls Stella McCartney “a powerful brand, led by a powerful and compassionate woman.","Tom Mendenhall has been appointed chief executive officer of Stella McCartney. He succeeds Amandine Ohayon, who is stepping down as head of the fashion house after nearly two years. The company reported this in a statement obtained by WWD.

Mendenhall brings extensive experience from the luxury sector. He was previously brand president of Polo and Double RL at Ralph Lauren. He also worked as executive vice president and chief operating officer of Tom Ford and as worldwide director of merchandising at Gucci.

According to founder Stella McCartney, his arrival will contribute to the next growth phase of the brand. “Tom’s extensive experience in all facets of luxury fashion will be invaluable in propelling the company forward and building a strong future. I know that Tom shares my vision for the brand and the ethical values that are part of our DNA,” said McCartney in a statement.

Mendenhall himself calls Stella McCartney “a powerful brand, led by a powerful and compassionate woman. I am honoured to now be working with her and her amazing team worldwide on the next phase of the company’s development.”

Ohayon’s departure, who had been CEO since late 2023, marks a new chapter for the fashion house. McCartney and the board thank her for her contribution to the transition to an independent corporate structure after the collaboration with LVMH. “I want to take this opportunity to thank Amandine for her great work and for the successes we have shared together. I wish her all the best in her future projects,” said McCartney.

McCartney bought back the minority shares that had been held by LVMH since 2019 earlier this year.",https://r.fashionunited.com/KTszd-GlQnQMEOgIoI_nrRbtj3Q97Zgyp7cqxe7lW-c/resize:fit:1200:630:0/gravity:ce/quality:70/aHR0cHM6Ly9mYXNoaW9udW5pdGVkLmNvbS9pbWcvdXBsb2FkLzIwMjUvMDMvMTAvc3RlbGxhLW1jY2FydG5leS1mMjUtMDUwLWx1YnRyOWVyLTIwMjUtMDMtMTAuanBlZw.jpeg,N,,2025-09-08 11:26:47.898591

The exchange has helped to attract 26 domestic and international reinsurance institutions to Lin-gang, including operation centers for 21 reinsurance companies, one branch of a reinsurance company, and branches of four insurance brokerages.
But under such circumstances, these overseas reinsurance companies cannot set up fixed operation venues in China.
Consequently, domestic insurers need to directly enter the international market and undertake the inward reinsurance business of Chinese companies in overseas markets as well as other international inward reinsurance.
The PBOC is now studying ways to introduce a new measure to facilitate overseas investment using overseas inward reinsurance income, he said.","Shanghai International Reinsurance Exchange traded nearly 4.4 billion yuan ($620 million) of insurance premium in its first eight months of operations, Chang Ming, assistant to the exchange's general manager, said on Monday.

In a further break down, the value of outward insurance, under which the insurer transfers the insurance to another insurance company, approached 94.6 billion yuan ($13.27 billion). The value of inward reinsurance, meaning the insurance company accepts insurance business ceded by another insurer, came to 9.5 billion yuan ($1.33 billion).

Officially unveiled in the Lin-gang Special Area of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone in October, the exchange has since seen 118 institutions register with the trading authority to date, out of which 90 are domestic and the rest from overseas. The exchange has helped to attract 26 domestic and international reinsurance institutions to Lin-gang, including operation centers for 21 reinsurance companies, one branch of a reinsurance company, and branches of four insurance brokerages.

According to Chang, such rapid development can be largely attributed to institutional innovation, the trading seats introduced at the exchange being one of them.

Chang added that overseas institutions are allowed to provide offshore reinsurance services to Chinese clients even if they have not got official operational approval from China's central regulators. But under such circumstances, these overseas reinsurance companies cannot set up fixed operation venues in China.

But the trading seats at the exchange can help these institutions reach their Chinese clients more conveniently, which can largely save the costs of conducting China-related businesses, he said.

So far, six overseas institutions from countries including Barbados, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United Kingdom have obtained trading seats at the exchange.

According to Chang, the exchange has also explored an overseas fleet insurance service mechanism with Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, PICC and Air Union Insurance Brokers, which would be aimed at facilitating the export of domestically produced commercial aircraft while securing Chinese companies' interests in overseas markets.

Feng Xiao, deputy general manager of the reinsurance department of PICC, said that Chinese companies' demand for insuring their overseas businesses has been rising amid the country's stable economic growth and the expansion of the Belt and Road Initiative.

Consequently, domestic insurers need to directly enter the international market and undertake the inward reinsurance business of Chinese companies in overseas markets as well as other international inward reinsurance. This is crucial for China to participate in global risk governance, he said.

Chang added that trading data at the exchange is transparent, true, traceable and controllable. Based on these merits, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's central bank, has provided facilitation for cross-border capital registered at the exchange and used for reinsurance trading via free trade accounts.

The PBOC is now studying ways to introduce a new measure to facilitate overseas investment using overseas inward reinsurance income, he said.

France's Axa Global Reinsurance officially opened its reinsurance operation center in Lin-gang in January.

According to Xue Fei, general manager of Axa International Reinsurance (Shanghai) Co, the collective financial infrastructure and policies introduced at the exchange, as well as the gathering of registration, clearance and information disclosure, can significantly improve trading efficiency and lower costs. This is conducive to improving companies' operational efficiency and competitiveness, he said.

The fact that more and more industry players are gathering in Lin-gang helps Axa talk to its peers more conveniently over the most up-to-date trends regarding health insurance, travel insurance and even businesses related to new energy vehicles, he said.

In February and May, the Lin-gang administrative committee released the negative lists and practice guidance for the cross-border data flow in the reinsurance industry.",http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202509/08/68bed48ea3108622d6413159.jpeg,N,,2025-09-08 13:02:19.873019

Conclusion Anthropic’s $1.5 billion settlement is more than a financial resolution—it’s a landmark turning point in the intersection of copyright law and artificial intelligence.
It underscores the responsibility AI companies carry in sourcing training data and elevates the importance of creative ownership in an increasingly digital future.","In a landmark development shaking the legal-tech world, Anthropic, the AI company behind the Claude chatbot, has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by a group of authors. This settlement marks the most significant copyright recovery in U.S. history related to AI and sends a resounding message about the ethical use of creative content in AI training.

What’s at Stake

The authors—thriller novelist Andrea Bartz, and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson—represented a broader class of creators who claimed Anthropic downloaded their works without permission, using them to train Claude. The lawsuit alleged the company sourced hundreds of thousands of books from pirate websites, including Books3, Library Genesis, and the Pirate Library Mirror.

In June, U.S. District Judge William Alsup delivered a mixed ruling: while training AI on legally obtained copyrighted books may fall under fair use, Anthropic’s storage of more than 7 million pirated books in a centralized “library” crossed the line. That portion could not be justified as fair use and was slated for trial.

What

Where

Key Terms of the Settlement

$1.5 Billion Fund: Estimated at $3,000 per infringing book, this figure covers roughly 500,000 titles—with potential increases if more works are identified.

Destruction of Infringing Copies: Anthropic must delete the downloaded pirated books.

No Liability Admission: The settlement includes no admission of wrongdoing by Anthropic.

Pretrial Resolution: By settling, Anthropic avoids a high-stakes December trial with potential damages reaching into the hundreds of billions of dollars.

This outcome stands as the largest publicly disclosed AI-related copyright settlement to date.

Voices from the Case

The authors’ legal team hailed the settlement as transformative. “This settlement sends a powerful message to AI companies and creators alike that taking copyrighted works from these pirate websites is wrong,” they stated, labeling it the largest copyright recovery in history and the first settlement of its kind in the AI era.

Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, an advocacy group, described the agreement as “a vital step in acknowledging that AI companies cannot simply steal authors’ creative work to build their AI.“

Why This Matters for JDJournal Readers

1. Copyright Law Meets AI Innovation

While AI models trained on lawfully acquired copyrighted content may enjoy fair use protection, this case highlights that how the data is obtained matters just as much. Storing pirated materials—even if intended as research—can lead to massive liabilities.

2. Precedent for the Entire Industry

Anthropic’s settlement sets a powerful precedent. Companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and Apple, already facing similar lawsuits, may reconsider their data practices—or face hefty settlements of their own.

3. Ethical AI & Fair Compensation

Authors are no longer being asked to quietly endure content scraping. This agreement signals a renewed emphasis on ethical AI development, where creative professionals must be recognized and compensated for their work.

Looking Ahead: What to Watch

Court Approval: Judge Alsup will review and must approve the settlement before it takes effect.

Expansion of the Class: Should further works be identified, the total payout may increase.

Future Lawsuits: With AI company behavior now under heightened scrutiny, additional litigation may arise—especially regarding data sourcing practices.

Conclusion

Anthropic’s $1.5 billion settlement is more than a financial resolution—it’s a landmark turning point in the intersection of copyright law and artificial intelligence. It underscores the responsibility AI companies carry in sourcing training data and elevates the importance of creative ownership in an increasingly digital future.",https://d1ew8vst3yq0j8.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Gemini_Generated_Image_na42xxna42xxna42-384x600.png,N,,2025-09-08 13:04:05.646186

... Global Canopy’s annual Forest 500 assessment looks at six human rights criteria closely associated with preventing deforestation. Three indicators are interconnected with deforestation as violations of these rights frequently happen around the point of forest loss. They are: Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC); zero tolerance for threats and violence against forest, land and human rights defenders; and customary rights to land, resources and territory.

Among them, zero tolerance is least likely to be addressed by companies: only 9% of the 500 companies assessed have a public commitment in place for at least one forest risk commodity. By comparison, 37% of companies have committed to FPIC, and 24% have commitments to respect the customary rights of IPLCs to land, resources and territory.

... Only 47 Forest 500 companies have commitments for zero tolerance. Companies in the palm oil (12%) and cocoa (12%) supply chains are more likely to have commitments. Commitments are scarce in the beef (7%), soy (9%) and timber (3%) sectors, although these industries are linked to abuses in Latin America.

HM Revenue and Customs is poised to agree a £14m contract with Gitlab UK that will allow the department to bring together siloed software systems used by multiple groups across the organisation.

The tax-collection agency said it needed a solution that can “develop, share and version control rigorously assured code to produce robust, reproducible analysis which can also allow for collaboration [and] internal transparency coupled with security”.

HMRC said the move would see groups using disparate software consolidated onto software-as-a-service (SaaS) based platforms.

“It is key that all groups in HMRC are on the same platform as other analysists, data scientists and coders in HMRC, to ensure integration and compatibility and therefore efficient use and reuse of analytical components across the department,” the department said. “This includes Gitlab Dedicated SaaS for 4,000 users, large infrastructure and management.”

Transparency documents show that the three-year contract, which could be signed as early as this week, is being made as a direct award to Gitlab because of the firm’s intellectual property rights.

“Gitlab is a key piece of software for the organisation as it is used for software development, allowing teams to plan, build, test, and deploy code collaboratively in a single application,” HMRC said. “Moving to an alternative solution would cause significant disruption and risk to the authority. This would create disproportionate technical and resource challenges that would impact business operations and not demonstrate commercial value or provide the most economically advantageous outcome.”

The contract value is £11,826,872.40 excluding VAT and £14,192,246.88 including VAT.

The automotive industry is undergoing a transformation as software becomes increasingly central to its business strategy and operations. According to a new report from the Capgemini Research Institute, ‘The software-driven mobility era: Beyond vehicles’, nearly all automotive organizations (92%) now anticipate that every automotive company will transition to a software company to support Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs) and software-driven mobility (SDM)[1] services. Over eight in ten believe that software-defined products and services, not just the physical vehicle, will become their core value proposition.

Advt

While decoupling hardware and software has emerged as crucial to enable faster innovation, drive improved scalability, and unlock new revenue streams, the survey shows that only one in ten original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) has made progress in this journey, with just over a quarter actively piloting new approaches.

“For decades, automotive leadership was driven by hardware but today consumers demand connected, digitally enhanced experiences. This calls for adoption of a software first approach across the value chain to enable holistic mobility solutions,” said Laurence Noël, Global Head of Automotive at Capgemini. “Forward–looking automotive organizations are already treating software as their core product and leveraging key partnerships to expand their ecosystem. While the ambition is high, it requires a complete organizational overhaul. Those that align their talent, platforms, and partnerships, while fostering trust and delivering an elevated customer experience, will stay ahead of the curve.”

Strategic partnerships and ecosystem collaboration are accelerating the shift to SDM

According to the report, automotive organizations are increasingly recognizing the value of broader collaboration, with nearly two in five partnering with big tech and hyperscalers for critical software, cloud, and data capabilities. While only a few have established joint ventures so far, a third plan to do so within three years. Up to 84% are exploring new supplier markets to build resilience, and nearly 70% are doubling down on in-house development of key components to retain control over brand-defining technologies. Organizations are also restructuring their supply chains for geopolitical resilience, by exploring new sourcing markets including India, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe.

Software-defined products and mobility services are also expected to become significant revenue contributors for OEMs. According to the report, their share of OEMs’ total revenue is projected to double, contributing to over 50% by 2035.

AI is driving a new era of innovation in the auto industry

The report highlights that a vast majority (85%) agree that AI is increasingly becoming an integral part of automotive software, embedded directly into software features and functions, from improving in-vehicle experiences to powering advanced safety features and cybersecurity.

Over three-quarters (77%) see AI integration into software development, in-vehicle functions, and mobility services as a critical competitive advantage that will reshape the automotive value chain. By reducing costs, boosting productivity and efficiency, and enhancing product quality, AI is propelling the industry into a new era of innovation. Notably, most surveyed organizations view AI integration for ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) and autonomous driving capabilities as extremely significant in their organization’s software-driven strategy.

Atlassian (TEAM, Financials) is making a $610 million bet on the future of browsing. The company said Thursday it will buy The Browser Company, a New York startup known for its Arc and Dia browsers, as it looks to expand into AI-driven workplace tools.

Is TEAM fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.

The purchase will be paid in cash, drawn from Atlassian's $2.5 billion balance sheet as of June. The deal is expected to close by the end of December, pending regulatory approval, and the company does not expect it to affect financial results in the next two fiscal years. Shares of Atlassian slipped about 2% after the announcement.

The Browser Company launched Dia earlier this year, pitching it as a workspace browser that uses AI to summarize information and connect tasks across different platforms. Atlassian said Dia will become its go-to browser for enterprise use, pulling together tools in the same way its collaboration products do today.

Competition in the AI browser space is already heating up. Microsoft has embedded Copilot into Edge, while Google Chrome still controls nearly 70% of the market. Startups like Brave and Perplexity, backed by Nvidia, are also chasing the same opportunity.

Founded in 2019, The Browser Company raised $50 million in a Series B last year at a $550 million valuation, according to Pitchbook. Atlassian's venture arm was an early investor, alongside Salesforce Ventures, Figma CEO Dylan Field and former Instacart CEO Fidji Simo.

For Atlassian, the deal signals a push to broaden its ecosystem beyond team collaboration software into the browser itself, where much of daily work already happens. Investors will be watching to see if the move helps the company carve out a role in the crowded enterprise browser market.

Despite finance apps being incredibly popular, almost one in four (23%) users only somewhat trust their finance apps, indicating a need for better trust-building measures.

According to the findings, nearly three in ten (28%) cite security concerns as the primary reason for not using finance apps.

With these concerns in mind, the team at Apadmi have asked users to specify their top feature or functionality they would like to see the most from finance apps. These are the results:

More security measures to tackle fraud - 30.76%

Rewards for loyal customers - 21.33%

Saving pots for different goals - 15.33%

Faster loading times - 14.36%

A better design and layout - 10.83%

More educational content within the app - 6.43%

Topping the list are more security measures to tackle fraud, with one in three (30.76%) respondents emphasising the need for heightened protection. This demand reflects growing concerns about cyber threats and the crucial role of robust security in fostering trust and confidence in finance apps.

A class-action lawsuit accuses CVS Caremark of denying medically necessary treatments by stopping coverage of Zepbound, Eli Lilly’s blockbuster weight-loss drug.

CVS Caremark stopped covering Zepbound on July 1 after reaching a deal with Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy.

The lawsuit says some 200,000 people were impacted by the decision.

CVS Caremark is facing a class-action lawsuit over its decision to stop covering Zepbound, Eli Lilly’s blockbuster GLP-1 weight-loss drug.

The suit was filed on behalf of two people who lost Zepbound coverage through their employer-sponsored health care plan, though the lawsuit says some 200,000 people were impacted by Caremark’s decision. Zepbound patients whose employers use CVS Caremark as a pharmacy benefits manager were told they’d have to switch to Wegovy, a similar drug that studies have shown is less effective than Zepbound for treating obesity.

Why is CVS Caremark being sued?

The lawsuit accuses Caremark, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, of denying medically necessary drugs in violation of federal law. CVS Caremark stopped covering Zepbound on July 1 after reaching a deal with Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy. As part of the deal, Caremark agreed to remove Zepbound from its formulary.

RELATED: Zepbound vs. Wegovy: Here's which weight loss drug worked best in first trial

The lawsuit claims Caremark cannot deny Zepbound as ""not medically necessary"" while approving Wegovy as a necessary treatment for the same condition, particularly when Zepbound has been proven to be more effective and has a lower list price than Wegovy. Wegovy’s list price is about $1,350 a month, while Zepbound’s is roughly $1,100 for a month’s supply. But both drugmakers offer it for about $500 a month to people without insurance coverage.

What they're saying

According to the lawsuit, one of the plaintiffs switched from Zepbound to Wegovy in August after exhausting all appeals to Caremark, then ""experienced a number of side effects, including the return of his Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, stomach pain, hunger, and, most notably, weight gain.""

""Because of their different methods of action, different clinical outcomes, and different side effects for individual patients, Zepbound and Wegovy are not clinically interchangeable,"" the lawsuit states.

CVS Caremark disagrees. A spokesperson told FOX TV Stations in May that despite what studies have shown, ""real-world evidence suggests that they are comparable in actual use.""

Wegovy-maker Novo Nordisk says that’s not true.

""The notion that all GLP-1s are the same and ‘interchangeable’ is not correct,"" Jason Brett, executive medical director for Novo Nordisk, said in a statement to CNN.

The other side

A CVS Caremark spokesperson told Bloomberg Law the lawsuit is ""without merit.""

""We’ll defend ourselves vigorously against those claims,"" the spokesperson said.

Big picture view

The lawsuit highlights ongoing issues with access and affordability as GLP-1 drugs become more popular. The medications still amount to around $500 per month for those without insurance, and even for people with insurance, some plans don’t cover the obesity medications at all.

Dr. Brett Osborn, a Florida neurosurgeon and longevity expert, called the medications ""the holy grail of modern medicine.""

""These medications don’t just treat obesity — they’re already showing promise in everything from cardiovascular disease to neurodegenerative disease to addiction,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: These are not amenities. They are the holy grail of modern medicine.""

Zepbound vs. Wegovy

Dig deeper

Zepbound and Wegovy are both GLP-1 drugs approved for weight loss, but Zepbound targets two hormones, GIP and GLP-1, while Wegovy only targets GLP-1.

According to a study funded by Eli Lilly and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, people taking Zepbound lost nearly 50% more weight than those using rival Wegovy.

Clinical trial participants who took Zepbound lost an average of 50 pounds over 72 weeks, while those who took semaglutide, or Wegovy, lost about 33 pounds.

Zepbound is also FDA-approved to treat sleep apnea in patients with obesity, while Wegovy is FDA-approved to treat cardiovascular disease.

How do GLP-1 drugs work?

The backstory

GLP-1s, a class of drugs that include semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro and Zepbound), were initially prescribed to treat Type 2 diabetes, but have soared in popularity because of weight loss. Wegovy and Zepbound are FDA approved for weight loss, while Ozempic and Mounjaro are approved for Type 2 diabetes.

The drugs work by mimicking the actions of hormones, found primarily in the gut, that kick in after people eat. The hormones help regulate blood sugar by triggering the pancreas to release insulin, another hormone, and slowing the release of sugar from the liver. People who are overweight or have obesity can become insulin-resistant, which means the body doesn’t respond to insulin properly.

The obesity drugs lower blood sugar and slow down digestion, so people feel full longer. They also affect signals in the brain linked to feelings of fullness and satisfaction, tamping down appetite, food-related thoughts and cravings.

Because people feel full longer, they eat less and lose weight.

However, it appears that if people taking the drugs stop, most regain the weight they lost — and the health problems that come with weight gain.

The meeting discussed the implementation of the MoU on economic cooperation, and agreed on the establishment of trade routes to improve bilateral trade.

The government has expressed deep concern over the implications of mass job cuts on the economy following retrenchment notices by a number of multinational corporations.

Last week, Glencore Operations South Africa revealed its intention to retrench employees at its Rustenburg ferrochrome smelter and vanadium operations, citing insufficient electricity supply and a general “lack of sustainable industry solutions.”

Companies who are considered intensive energy users have already sounded the alarm that the escalating costs of electricity could exacerbate job losses.

Similarly, ArcelorMittal South Africa announced preparations to close its long steel mills resulting in the loss of over 4 000 jobs, attributing its plight to delays in addressing structural problems that have plagued the firm and broader industry.

Ford South Africa also joined the ranks, notifying of impending job losses for more than 470 employees at its Silverton vehicle factory and Struandale engine factory, driven by a need to realign production capacities with fluctuating market demands.

This wave of layoffs sweeping through the country and impacting thousands of employees comes as 140 000 jobs were lost in the three months to June, raising the official unemployment rate by 0.3 of a percentage point from 32.9% to 33.2%.

Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition, Parks Tau, on Saturday said the government was working with captains of affected companies for a long-lasting solution to these problems.

“We are concerned about the announcements by a number of firms. These decisions are as a result of both domestic and international pressures including the changing trading environment and global restructuring of firms,” Tau said.

“We are engaging these firms and will work together with them to find solutions together.”

These companies are exporters of various products, and they also find themselves facing hefty tariffs when they ship their products to the United States market after the Trump administration imposed a 30% levy.

Tau on Saturday reiterated that the government had submitted a revised trade offer to the US government and that a team of negotiators was in Washington D.C. to engage with them.

“We have a senior delegation in Washington that is engaging counterparts in the US and will update the country in due course on progress with the US,” he said.

Tau was speaking on the sidelines of the Intra-Africa Trade Fair 2025 (IATF2025) taking place in Algeria. The IATF aims to increase intra-African trade and showcase the investment opportunities across the continent - which currently linger around 16% - and it is projected to translate into over $44 billion in trade and investment deals.

Tau said South Africa had set its sights on leveraging critical minerals for the future and emphasised that building regional value chains marks a pivotal moment in economic development.

“We are moving towards a path of growth and utilizing industrial instruments, further deepening our regional integration. This includes both SACU and SADC,” he said.

“We are exploring a number of tools including building regional value chains around our critical minerals linked to the battery value chain and other ideas such as cross border SEZs, which create ecosystems for shared prosperity. This we believe will boost regional growth and development.”

Speaking during the Auto Forum at the IATF2025 on Saturday, Stellantis South Africa CEO, Mike Whitfield, said automotive’s Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) see Africa as the last real frontier and a lot can be learned from the role that South Africa has played in developing the industry.

“Manufacturers are looking for a level playing field, clear legislative environment, incentives and protection for investors and penalties for those who break those laws. Without that in place, it's very difficult for a multinational to make an investment in an industry with very capital intensities,” Whitfield said.

“There needs to be partnership, there needs to be mutual respect and work between government, industry and labour. And if we look back on the South African auto industry, it's an incredible example of public-private partnership. And that agreement for over 60 years between governments, OEMs and labour has resulted in an industry that directly employs 115 000 people.”

South Africa produces more than 54% of the approximately 1.1 million new vehicle total production in Africa every year, and the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement could deepen the country’s dominance and contribution to value-chain.

“‘Let’s create smarter business’ is a fresh articulation of what IBM does best: understanding the real pressures business leaders face and helping them turn complexity into clarity and technology into lasting impact,” said Liz Taylor, global chief creative officer at Ogilvy.

“Creatively, we wanted to keep it smart, simple and charming. There’s a quiet cheekiness to it. We’re speaking into the disillusionment that’s crept into the AI conversation and making it clear that IBM sees exactly what’s going on – irony and all – and still knows how to build what matters,” she added.

The multi-platform effort includes three broadcast ads that illustrate the role of AI, hybrid cloud, and quantum computing in transforming business operations. Directed by Adam Heshemi for Reset, the ads feature voiceovers by seven-time Formula 1 World Champion and Scuderia Ferrari HP driver Lewis Hamilton.

The campaign also ties into IBM’s ongoing partnership with Scuderia Ferrari HP, where the company recently helped redesign the team’s mobile app using data and AI technologies to enhance digital fan experiences.

Similar applications, IBM noted, are being adopted by clients across industries to improve customer engagement, boost employee productivity, and support data-driven decision-making.

Jonathan Adashek, senior vice president for marketing and communications at IBM, said, “‘Let’s create smarter business’ communicates our ability to equip business leaders with the right perspective and products that will bridge the AI adoption gap and deliver meaningful technology-driven gains that relieve the pressure of unmet expectations. This is more than a campaign. It’s a philosophy that IBM is embracing to transform companies into smarter businesses.”

The ‘Let’s create smarter business’ campaign serves as a refresh and next step in IBM’s ‘Let’s create’ platform, first introduced in 2022.

Located in the Lyman area, the facility is engineered to handle and process fresh produce, eggs, dairy, meat and frozen products for distribution to 180 stores.

It is the third of five high-tech PDCs Walmart is opening nationwide which utilise advanced automation to handle more than double the volume that traditional distribution centres can process.

Walmart US supply chain executive vice-president Rob Montgomery stated: “The opening of our new high-tech perishable distribution centre marks a major step forward in how we get fresher products to customers faster — whether that’s in-store, delivered to their home or even restocking their refrigerator.”

Walmart's integration of tech within the facility is transforming the roles of associates by automating some of the most physically demanding tasks.

Robotics now take over the movement of cases on and off pallets, reducing the requirement for manual lifting.

Associates collaborate with high-tech systems to build store-specific pallets, ensuring that delicate items such as eggs and yogurt are positioned to minimise damage.

AI monitors each pallet to guarantee accuracy and freshness, streamlining the unloading process at stores and enabling store associates to dedicate more time to customer service.

The distribution centre employs 600 full-time employees.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster stated: “South Carolina continues to lead in innovation and logistics, and Walmart’s investment in Spartanburg County is driving that momentum forward.

“Through advanced supply chain technology and a strong commitment to local sourcing, we’re proud to partner with Walmart to deliver fresh, affordable food to communities across our state and the region.”

As part of the rollout, FVC will host PPDS Studio Hubs in its demonstration centres in Dubai and Riyadh. These facilities will serve as regional demo and collaboration spaces, allowing integrators and customers to experience PPDS technologies directly. They also form part of PPDS’ wider global initiative to create local points of engagement for partners and end users.

Jae O Choi Park, Head of Commercial EMEA at PPDS, says the Studio Hubs will facilitate deeper engagement. “These spaces connect local partners with our wider innovation network,” he says, referencing PPDS’ push to localise its support structure for integrators and resellers.

WASHINGTON: Microsoft announced on Saturday that some Azure users might experience higher latency because of multiple undersea fiber cuts in the Red Sea.

Azure users may experience increased disruptions when traffic from the Middle East originates in or terminates in Asia or Europe, the company said in a service health status update.

Multiple subsea fiber optic cables in the Red Sea suffered simultaneous cuts on September 6, 2025, disrupting global internet and communications traffic. While connectivity remains available, rerouting has resulted in increased latency and congestion on key routes.

""Undersea fiber cuts can take time to repair, as such we will continuously monitor, rebalance, and optimiSe routing to reduce customer impact in the meantime. We'll continue to provide daily updates, or sooner if conditions change,"" Microsoft said.

The UniCredit mandate further cements this role, particularly in Germany and Italy, where BNP Paribas now offers both local and global custody services [1].
BNP Paribas’ expertise in these areas, coupled with UniCredit’s regional footprint, creates a synergy that enhances resilience in securities services.
Conclusion BNP Paribas’ new custody mandate with UniCredit is more than a contractual agreement; it is a strategic alignment that reflects the evolving priorities of European financial institutions.
By leveraging BNP Paribas’ technological and regulatory expertise, UniCredit is poised to enhance its operational resilience while reducing costs.","The recent appointment of BNP Paribas as a key custody and settlement services provider for UniCredit Group marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of European financial infrastructure. This mandate, covering entities in Italy, Germany, and Luxembourg, underscores a broader trend of consolidation and digitalization in securities services, driven by cost optimization and regulatory demands. For investors, the partnership offers insights into how institutional players are reshaping the landscape to navigate macroeconomic volatility and geopolitical risks.

Strategic Rationale and Market Dynamics

UniCredit’s decision to centralize custody services with BNP Paribas aligns with its internalization program, launched in January 2025, aimed at streamlining back-office operations and reducing reliance on multiple providers. According to a report by Bloomberg, this move follows months of negotiations with BNP Paribas, Société Générale, and Caceis, with the latter’s existing Italian custody agreement set to expire in 2026 [3]. By consolidating services under a single partner, UniCredit aims to enhance operational efficiency and reduce costs—a strategy mirrored across European banks grappling with rising compliance and technological expenses.

BNP Paribas, meanwhile, strengthens its dominance in the European custody market. With a 64% corporate and institutional banking penetration rate in Europe—significantly higher than HSBC’s 49%—the bank has positioned itself as a critical infrastructure provider [1]. Its role in reopening bond markets during the early stages of the pandemic and its near-doubling of syndicated loan market share highlight its systemic importance. The UniCredit mandate further cements this role, particularly in Germany and Italy, where BNP Paribas now offers both local and global custody services [1].

Implications for Financial Infrastructure

The partnership reflects the growing emphasis on robust financial infrastructure amid digitalization and geopolitical uncertainty. As noted in a 2025 BAFT Europe Bank to Bank Forum analysis, technological advancements are critical for addressing challenges such as instant payments and digital trade finance [4]. BNP Paribas’ expertise in these areas, coupled with UniCredit’s regional footprint, creates a synergy that enhances resilience in securities services.

Regulatory compliance also plays a central role. The 2025 EU-wide stress tests, coordinated by the European Banking Authority (EBA), underscore the need for resilient capital structures and cross-border operational alignment [2]. BNP Paribas’ prudent risk management—evidenced by its 2023 sale of Bank of the West, which generated significant returns—positions it to meet these demands [1]. For UniCredit, the mandate aligns with its broader restructuring efforts, including a share buy-back program executed through BNP Paribas under a “riskless principal” model, ensuring independent execution [5].

Investment Opportunities and Competitive Dynamics

The BNP Paribas-UniCredit collaboration opens avenues for investors in several areas:

1. Digital Transformation: BNP Paribas Fortis’ recent launch of an enhanced Easy Banking App, which integrates real-time tracking and cross-platform functionality, signals a focus on digital innovation [5]. Such initiatives could drive adoption in wealth management and private banking, sectors where UniCredit Bank Austria reported a 14.2% profit increase in Q3 2025 [5].

2. Cross-Border Synergies: The mandate’s expansion into Spain and Poland highlights opportunities in Central and Eastern Europe, where UniCredit’s existing infrastructure as a top sub-custodian provides a competitive edge [2].

3. Regulatory Resilience: As the EBA’s stress tests emphasize capital adequacy, banks with strong balance sheets—like BNP Paribas, with a €2.7 trillion asset base—will likely outperform peers in volatile markets [1].

Conclusion

BNP Paribas’ new custody mandate with UniCredit is more than a contractual agreement; it is a strategic alignment that reflects the evolving priorities of European financial institutions. By leveraging BNP Paribas’ technological and regulatory expertise, UniCredit is poised to enhance its operational resilience while reducing costs. For investors, this partnership highlights the importance of infrastructure-focused players in a landscape increasingly defined by digitalization and geopolitical risk. As the EU’s financial ecosystem continues to adapt to these pressures, institutions that combine scale, innovation, and prudence—like BNP Paribas—are likely to emerge as key beneficiaries.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 13:07:36.129442

“The system at the time was managed by different vendors for each phase such as device manufacturer, implementation support and post-implementation help desk,” President Nishida explains.
As part of the implementation of the HP DaaS solution, the VJS help desk also transitioned to Comture Network Corporation, as it partners easily with HP.
And when it comes to devices, HP notebooks are both durable and light enough to carry with ease.
HP DaaS allows you to add or change services as needed, so you can always operate effectively in an IT environment matching your current situation.","Volkswagen Japan Sales (VJS) is an automobile company with 11 stores in the Tokyo metropolitan area, managed directly by Porsche Holding Salzburg, Europe’s largest automotive retail company. At VJS, employees use a range of devices to perform important tasks, from client management, quoting, ordering, vehicle management to parts management.

“Our stores are scattered across metro Tokyo, and with consideration to physical distance and the speed of information sharing, we would not be able to do our daily jobs without our devices,” says VJS President Akihiko Nishida. “However, information-storing devices face various problems such as server inaccessibility and freezing. Our IT staff had to go up against these unpredictable problems every day.”

President Nishida says time to repair is his highest priority: “We respond to failures remotely, and sometimes we had to go in blind and test multiple ways to fix the problem because we were unable to immediately find the cause. We’d be able to respond more quickly if only we were able to grasp the situation more clearly.”

With the end of support for Windows 7 and the transition to Windows 10, a rebuilding of the entire support system, including the introduction of devices, came under consideration. “The system at the time was managed by different vendors for each phase such as device manufacturer, implementation support and post-implementation help desk,” President Nishida explains. “As such, it was difficult to locate problems after the system was implemented. Not only that, two members of the IT team managed some 400 devices, and it was critical to visualize the entire system to reduce this burden.”

Creating a consolidated, easy-to-manage IT environment

There were key criteria selected as part of renovating the system, President Nishida explains. “The first point is the visibility of IT costs. Predictability of monthly and annual IT costs allows for more effective budget planning. The second point is the visibility of IT issues. We must identify the cause as soon as possible, increase response speed and reduce the burden on the IT team,” he says. “HP Services accurately provides proactive device health monitoring and analytics reporting.”

Implementing HP Device as a Service (DaaS) provided a complete solution, uniting devices, repair services and analytics into a single monthly agreement and provides a simple and easy-to-manage IT environment. President Nishida says the ease of management integrating HP Services proved critical: “With HP DaaS, we were able to combine the different vendors for each phase into one enabling a streamlined lifecycle management. For IT staff, this is a great advantage.”

HP TechPulse reporting resulting from proactive device monitoring drastically improves device management visibility, says President Nishida: “All device insights such as software performance, CPU/memory usage and device utilization can be viewed at a glance on the HP TechPulse dashboard. We can also immediately check the BIOS and Windows 10 update information for all devices, which helps us provide appropriate prompting updates and support to each employee,” he says.

With proactive device monitoring and analytics with HP TechPulse, President Nishida explains that IT can now not only rapidly respond to failures, but also predict and alleviate problems — such as a battery or disk failure — before they occur.

“We can take pre-emptive measures, such as backing up data or replacing a battery before performance declines. This type of intervention helps decrease stress for both employees and IT staff, and we can focus our abilities on more productive tasks,” he says. “And these hidden costs have greatly decreased.”

Business outcomes: Maintaining optimal device lifecycle

HP Services provides consistent service in all phases of the device lifecycle. The same goes for the help desk and support systems after implementation. As part of the implementation of the HP DaaS solution, the VJS help desk also transitioned to Comture Network Corporation, as it partners easily with HP.

“As a help desk, we receive support not only for devices, but also for Microsoft Office and other information systems in general,” President Nishida explains. “After implementation, there were very few inquiries made to the help desk. I believe this is because, in addition to the high quality of the HP devices, the help desk has visibility to the analytics reporting by HP TechPulse to take preventive measures.”

President Nishida says the result is a device management process that is scalable, secure and more streamlined: “Proactive device monitoring and data analytics through HP DaaS also created a robust support system including the help desk. We were able to streamline our operations. And when it comes to devices, HP notebooks are both durable and light enough to carry with ease. We have gotten closer to my ideal of streamlined devices and systems.

“Since our business is based on close cooperation with the headquarters in Germany and our Japanese subsidiaries, we cannot proceed with a system build on our own. We are, however, moving in the direction where all the necessary tools for the automotive business will be integrated into a single system to centralize information and extract the maximum benefit from the minimum number of devices.”

President Nishida says the engagement with HP DaaS reflects a broader shift of mindset within IT from ‘owning’ to ‘using’. “There is no doubt that the shift to cloud computing and subscriptions will continue to accelerate. Ideally, I’d like to be able to manage a minimal number of devices and build an IT environment with only a monthly fee base. HP DaaS allows you to add or change services as needed, so you can always operate effectively in an IT environment matching your current situation. This, in turn, is leading to better service.",https://www.cio.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4052755-0-13721700-1757320513-shutterstock_2642324337.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-09-08 08:12:36.755879

“Enterprise adoption of AI is scaling faster than almost any technology we’ve seen before, with companies experimenting with AI across all functions.","AI is on the brink of going from tool to teammate, according to new research from Capgemini, as firms race to integrate ‘autonomous collaborators’ within the next year, though most are severely underprepared to make the leap.

The latest Capgemini Research Institute report, Harnessing the Value of AI: Unlocking Scalable Advantage, found that six in ten organisations expect AI to be an active team member or supervisor to other AI in the next twelve months, a sharp rise from just 44% today.

AI agents could form the foundation of this strategic shift, with the last year seeing a steady rise in the deployment of AI agents as the technology gains momentum.

Capgemini found that most business functions are likely to have AI agents handling at least one business process in the near future, with 90% of executives in areas like product design, R&D, marketing, and sales optimistic about autonomous agents handling one or more business processes in their function by 2030.

These systems are becoming increasingly interconnected, with multi-agent processes likely to be the next major development in AI, according to the report.

Polling 1,100 executives from enterprise organisations scaling AI agents, Capgemini found that nearly 45% are also piloting or scaling multi-agent systems, with 38% believing AI agents will evolve into self-learning agents requiring minimal human supervision in the next 3-5 years.

But despite that rapid trajectory, the report found that 71% of firms still don’t fully trust autonomous AI agents for enterprise use. The report highlights that businesses are facing governance gaps, with only 46% having established robust policies for their AI systems, and even then, most seldom follow them to the letter.

With such basic elements of AI strategy either wilfully ignored or forgotten, it is unsurprising that most organisations are not prepared for dynamic human-AI collaboration.

Capgemini found that two-thirds of enterprises agreed they will need to restructure their teams to enhance human-AI collaborations, with most expecting their organisational structure to evolve to accommodate machines as co-workers.

Employees, however, may prove resistant to the idea, with recent research from Workday finding that although staff are willing to use AI agents, most draw the line at working for them.

Report: Hackers Are Targeting AI Agents and ‘Weaponising’ GenAI

Report: AI Agents Are Triggering Business Restructure

80% of Firms Say Their AI Agents Have Taken Rogue Actions

While that problem will come to a head, and no doubt soon, most enterprises are content with maxing out their AI investments in the meantime.

Capgemini’s study found that over the last year, almost nine in ten firms have increased their investment in genAI by an average of 9%, with 12% of IT budgets now dedicated to the technology. That trend is expected to continue, with 61% of organisations anticipating a further increase in genAI investments in the next twelve months.

“Enterprise adoption of AI is scaling faster than almost any technology we’ve seen before, with companies experimenting with AI across all functions. But rapid adoption doesn’t necessarily translate into large-scale deployment with tangible ROI,” said Franck Greverie, chief technology and portfolio officer at Capgemini.

“To succeed, enterprises must set up a solid data foundation, in a trusted environment that’s compliant, secure and ensures necessary privacy. This, along with a new operating model with a balanced human-AI chemistry, can ensure winning business outcomes.”",http://www.digit.fyi/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design-53-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 07:07:11.710788

The successful development and launch of new devices are dependent on strong cross-functional collaboration across clinical and medical affairs, R&D, marketing, market access, legal, regulatory, and quality. Matt Christensen, Senior Vice President of Global Clinical and Medical Affairs at Smith+Nephew highlights how the company strategically organizes clinical and medical affairs to optimize collaboration, product development, and improve patient outcomes.

Clinical teams are responsible for generating the necessary evidence to support a product’s safety and efficacy, while medical affairs teams act as a bridge between the company and the broader healthcare community, providing scientific and clinical insights. This alignment ensures that every step of the product lifecycle, from initial research to post-market surveillance, is supported with a unified strategy.

By working together, these teams can navigate complex regulatory landscapes, address market needs, and deliver innovative solutions to patients with greater speed and efficiency.

Taking an integrated approach

Smith+Nephew’s highly integrated organizational structure breaks down silos and allows the clinical and medical affairs functions to operate under a single, cohesive framework. Their clinical and medical affairs division is categorized into four distinct but interconnected groups:

Clinical strategy - overall strategy for evidence generation

Clinical operations - day-to-day execution of clinical trials

Evidence and claims - translating data into regulatory submissions and marketing materials

Medical affairs - external engagement with healthcare professionals and key opinion leaders

This integrated model provides clarity on each team’s responsibilities while ensuring that they are all working towards the same strategic goals. The structure allows for a holistic view of the product lifecycle, enabling the company to proactively address potential challenges and opportunities throughout the clinical trial.

Optimizing evidence generation

One of the most significant advantages of this integrated approach is the optimization of evidence generation. Christensen references a compelling example of introducing a new hip replacement device in Australia.

To meet local regulatory requirements, the team deployed a two-pronged strategy: 1) conduct a traditional, industry-sponsored clinical study to gather specific data on device performance, and 2) leverage data from the existing Australian national joint replacement registry to supplement long-term data on a broader sample of patients.

This registry provides a rich source of real-world evidence on the long-term performance of various devices. By combining these two data sources, Smith+Nephew was able to create a comprehensive data set that satisfied regulatory requirements while reducing the burden and cost associated with generating evidence.

Benefits of an integrated approach

The integration between clinical and medical affairs has enabled Smith+Nephew to maintain a more holistic clinical trial strategy. The partnership provides more visibility throughout a trial to address challenges and opportunities as they arise.

The Steel Rebar Companies Quadrant is a comprehensive industry analysis that provides valuable insights into the global market for Steel Rebar. This quadrant offers a detailed evaluation of key market players, technological advancements, product innovations, and emerging trends shaping the industry. The 360 Quadrant evaluated over 100 companies, of which the Top 12 Steel Rebar Companies were categorized and recognized as quadrant leaders.

Steel rebar, or reinforcing bars, are employed in concrete construction to form reinforced concrete. Typically featuring a ribbed surface to prevent slippage within the concrete, rebar offers several advantages, including significantly improving the structural integrity of concrete structures. While concrete possesses excellent compressive strength, it has relatively low tensile and torsional strength. Steel rebar compensates for these weaknesses by providing high tensile strength and helping to minimize the development and propagation of cracks that could compromise the entire structure.

Steel rebar refers to steel rods or meshes of steel wires used to reinforce concrete and hold it under tension. Because concrete excels under compression but performs poorly under tension, rebar significantly enhances its structural strength by reducing the risk of cracking and failure under stress. Generally made from carbon steel, rebar includes surface ridges or deformations that improve adhesion with concrete.

It is available in various grades, sizes, and coatings, such as epoxy-coated or stainless steel rebar, to meet specific construction needs, including protection against corrosion. Extensively used in buildings, bridges, highways, dams, and other infrastructure projects, steel rebar is essential in civil engineering for boosting the durability and load-bearing capacity of concrete structures. Its application is governed by industry standards across different regions.

The 360 Quadrant maps the Steel Rebar companies based on criteria such as revenue, geographic presence, growth strategies, investments, and sales strategies for the market presence of the Steel Rebar quadrant. Key players in the Steel Rebar market are actively investing in research and development, forming strategic partnerships, and engaging in collaborative initiatives to drive innovation, expand their global footprint, and maintain a competitive edge in this rapidly evolving market.

At its heart is Mercedes-Benz's latest generationof the AI-driven MB.OS, an in-house programmed built-in operating system which goes far beyond your average infotainment suite. Aside from customary features like Android and iOS connectivity, MB.OS handles all automated driving (ADAS), interior lighting, climate controls, seat functions, and all the charging prorocols aside from operating the vehicle's base functions.

Unlike systems of the past, MB.OS doesn't use vast arrays of decentralized sensors and processors to provide a top-tier luxurious driving experience. Instead, it consolidates the same functions into a single SoC capable of handling all vehicle systems at once. Thanks to a powerful DRIVE-series SoC from NVIDIA, such functionality is more capable and precise than ever.

Elsewhere, the new electric GLC hits the streets with a stunning 99.3-centimeter (39.1-inch) MBUX Hyperscreen infotainment suite. With 11 bespoke layouts and backgrounds to fit the needs of each driver, the system is configurable to a degree that could bring near desktop OS-levels of features. Apple Maps and Google Maps are present, but MB.OS provides its own thoroughly upgraded navigation system, which it touts as more intuitive than other OEMs.

Perhaps the MB.OS-equipped electric GLCs' biggest party trick is the adaptability of the charging system. Its 94 kWh lithium-ion battery pack can charge as much as 303 kilometers (188.3 mi) of range in just ten minutes with its 800-volt system. But thanks to MB's modular architecture, which can handle legacy charging systems in a pinch, you can just as easily fill up on a 400-volt platform at any charging station in Europe.

This is a welcome addition, as, according to a recent study by the Massachusetts-based Vicor Corporation, only around two percent of US and European charging stations are equipped to support 800-volt-capable vehicles. Inside the cabin, a fully revamped multi-source heat pump system ensures this EV's HVAC keeps you warm in the winter, contrary to what you've come to expect.

All around, the new electric GLC is designed to match or exceed offerings from BMW, Audi, and Lexus in comfort, charging, and AI integration. With competition all around, and not just from at home in Germany, Mercedes-Benz hopes the combination of a popular crossover form factor and the latest EV hardware they currently offer. Is it the ticket to a long-term presence in an emerging, lucrative market segment? The answer remains to be seen.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/mercedes-benz-reveals-bombshell-all-electric-glc-for-europe-flexes-ai-integrated-mbos-257071_1.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 08:12:41.889640

Key points:

Wildfire should be treated as a primary peril

Building codes greatly improve survival odds

Reinsurance models underestimate tail risk

New research commissioned by AXA XL from the Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies (CCRS) reveals the hazard is worsening; urbanisation is pushing more people into danger zones, more people are choosing to live in the ‘Wildland Urban Interface’, and recovery after a major event can be slow.

“It’s a primary peril in that it can do as much damage as a major hurricane or earthquake, but without the same rigour in modelling” Jonathan Gale, CUO at AXA XL Reinsurance, told Monte Carlo Today.

According to the research it is clear that this peril is changing for the worse in terms of hazard, driven by a changing climate and exposure, and the increase in number of structures in high hazard areas. While improved building codes and vegetation management can offset some risks, CCRS’s research paints a picture of a hazard and exposure growing faster than mitigation measures can keep up.

Wildfire is a global phenomenon, but California “stands apart”. The research completed by CCRS examines how climate change is contributing to the hazard change intersected with the state’s rapid urban expansion into fire-prone areas. “The only way to grow these cities, San Diego and Los Angeles in particular, is to grow into hazardous areas,” Gale explained. But this creates a difficult trade-off: urban development versus heightened fire risk.

The CCRS analysis shows a sharp post-2017 escalation. Compared with the previous 36 years, California has seen a 16-fold increase in area burned, a 15-fold increase in the number of properties damaged, and 50 times the economic loss.

Events such as the 2018 Camp Fire, which destroyed the town of Paradise, left Butte County’s GDP 20% lower seven years later, with a lasting population decline. Using satellite night-light data, researchers also found parts of Los Angeles affected by the 2018 Woolsey Fire had not fully recovered after two years. As with most disasters, poorer areas fare comparatively worse than more affluent areas.

“Getting money into a disaster area as soon as the loss happens gives communities a greater chance of getting back on their feet quicker and in a better state,” Gale highlighted. Yet in these case studies, the rebuilding and employment didn’t materialise.

Wildfire combines “the intensity of a tornado” with “a broader footprint and longer duration”, and Gale explained that the right building codes could make a big difference. A study cited by CCRS suggests properties built to the California Building Code (CBC) Section 7A and surrounded by well-managed vegetation are almost three times more likely to survive a blaze.

This has a socio-economic angle, too. Poorer communities are often more vulnerable because meeting code requirements and maintaining natural vegetation costs money. Insurance penetration outside of earthquakes is high in California and it will be interesting to contrast the reconstruction of the Eaton and Pallisades fires over time.

Our industry needs to think about this peril more strategically

Reinsurance blind spots

For Gale, the biggest takeaway for the industry is that wildfire is wrongly labelled. “It’s considered, and treated like, a secondary peril, and it’s not. It can do as much damage as a major hurricane or earthquake.”

Treating wildfire as a secondary peril has consequences, and Gale pointed to exhausted reinsurance programmes in both nationwide and regional contexts, sometimes by a multiple of limit purchased. Not having enough limit puts enormous strain on boards and managements and can result in reinsurance disputes at the very time a client needs the certainty of cover. The models, he argued, were “deficient in terms of the extent of the extreme or tail risk” and underestimate what could happen in a truly severe event as we have seen in January – which could have been worse. Beyond pricing, Gale worries about the system’s ability to deliver on insurance’s fundamental role: fast, effective and reformative recovery. The growth of California’s FAIR Plan and the Excess & Surplus market for homeowners signals a retreat from the admitted market. “If your market of last resort is becoming your biggest insurer, it’s a sign,” he noted.

The CCRS work combines proprietary research using Cal Fire and disaster database records with scientific literature to measure losses and understand the pathways to resilience by tracking post-event economic performance and testing how mitigation measures perform in real-world fires.

For reinsurers meeting at the Rendez-Vous de Septembre, the message from Gale is unambiguous: wildfire needs to be elevated in risk models, priced accordingly and backed by strong mitigation strategies. “Our industry needs to think about this peril more strategically.”

In a sign of optimism, over two in five businesses (43 %) expect to increase investment as a result of the budget, with this rising to 58 % among large businesses and 53 % among medium-sized businesses.
In a period of global uncertainty, three quarters of businesses (73 %) feel that business tax cuts will increase confidence in business success.
Matt Hammerstein, Chief Executive of Barclays UK Corporate Banking, said “It’s encouraging to see an intent to invest from UK businesses, with many turning that into action.
Abdul Qureshi, MD of Barclays Business Banking, said: “Despite economic and energy challenges, UK businesses are pushing ahead with AI and skills investment to unlock productivity and growth.","Nine in ten businesses (89 %) are looking to solve business problems with AI (Artificial Intelligence) over the next two years, with improving data analysis, forecasting or business intelligence, enhancing customer experience and reducing operational costs cited as the main opportunities according to new research by Barclays.

Over the past year, businesses have already invested, on average, £235,600 on AI and emerging technologies, with 68 % planning to increase this in the next 12 months. Investment is more pronounced for large corporates of more than 250 employees who have invested an average of £400,000, compared to £225,500 from medium enterprises (50-249 employees) and £125,250 small businesses (10-49 employees).

Whilst AI is a key investment priority, businesses are also planning to increase overall investment by 5.5 % over the next 12 months, up by 1.7 percentage points from Q1. The main areas of focus for investment are staff training and development (42 %), improved digital products (37 %) and R&D (37 %).

This wave of investment comes in response to a significant workforce gap, with business leaders identifying AI and digital technology skills as the most in-demand. Four in 10 (39 %) cited this as the greatest area of skills shortage in the UK workforce. These gaps are especially pronounced in financial services (52 %) and IT & telecoms (48 %) with the tech sector itself (51 %) also experiencing significant technical skills shortages.

Reflecting growing demand for AI skills, collectively almost a third either have already (11 %) or are currently (21 %), hiring for AI-focused roles, with 42 % of businesses planning to do so.

The data is part of the Q2 Barclays Business Prosperity Index, which combines anonymised, client data from over one million Barclays business clients, with survey data from 1,000 business leaders, alongside analysis from the Centre for Economics and Business Research.

Among those already using AI, the reported benefits were clear. Almost one third (32 %) have seen improved idea generation and innovation, 31 % cite better decision-making driven by data or AI models, 30 % have seen improved customer experience or services, and a further 30 % have reduced operational costs.

Demonstrating support for the UK’s technological innovation, seven in 10 business leaders (72 %) believe the UK can be a global AI leader, with 19 % believing the UK already is.

According to business decision-makers, who don’t believe the UK is already an AI leader, the most important enablers include: clear and innovation-friendly AI regulation (27 %), support for regional AI training centres and skills hubs (25 %), sustained public and private investment in AI research and startups (24 %), and stronger partnerships between business and education (24 %).

Business leaders remain confident in the prosperity of their own business (89 %), with 65 percent confident in both the UK and global economy, although this has softened slightly since Q1 2025 (67 % and 67 % respectively). However, concerns around inflation (33 %) and increased utility costs (22 %) persist and are seen as the biggest barriers to growth.

Barclays’ anonymised client data comparing Q2 2024 and Q2 2025 also indicates a resilient, but muted landscape of business activity showing that cash inflows fell slightly, by 0.8 % year on year. Current account cash balances declined slightly (-0.4 %) whilst businesses increased overdraft usage (+3.3 %). WHilst lending remained subdued (-5.9 %) on average for the typical business, but firms have borrowed £9bn of the Barclays Business Prosperity Fund in H1 2025

Meanwhile, 75 % of leaders haven’t borrowed to invest in the past 12 months, with 40 % considering it, but deciding not to proceed. Of those who have decided against borrowing, 31 % cited high interest rates, 27 % uncertainty in the economic outlook and 25 % said they planned to hold off on borrowing until there were signs of greater stability.

Businesses are also looking ahead to the Government’s Autumn Budget, with over half (55 %) delaying investment decisions while awaiting further clarity. In a sign of optimism, over two in five businesses (43 %) expect to increase investment as a result of the budget, with this rising to 58 % among large businesses and 53 % among medium-sized businesses.

The research data also shows that among the 55 % that currently have investment plans on hold, the top four decisions being postponed includes: Facility upgrades or expansions: 37 %, Research or development of new or improved products: 36 %, New equipment, machinery or vehicles: 35 % and Staff training plans: 34 %.

Business tax cuts top the list of desired measures businesses would most like to see from the Budget (45 %). This is especially important for small businesses (51 %) and micro businesses (51 %). Other priorities include investment incentives (37 %), public infrastructure investment (36 %), and support for workforce training and upskilling (36 %).

In a period of global uncertainty, three quarters of businesses (73 %) feel that business tax cuts will increase confidence in business success. Two in three (65 %) say that investment incentives would increase confidence, while others reflect that measures to reduce the regulatory burden (63 %) and increased funding for regional business development (63 %) would also increase confidence if included.

Matt Hammerstein, Chief Executive of Barclays UK Corporate Banking, said “It’s encouraging to see an intent to invest from UK businesses, with many turning that into action. Against a backdrop of global uncertainty, there’s more to do to build confidence in the UK as a place for businesses to grow and scale.

“Our research suggests that AI is becoming a key tool to drive innovation, encourage investment and upskilling to lift productivity and build confidence in the UK as a global business hub.”

Meanwhile, energy costs continue to weigh heavily on business growth. Of the four fifths (84 %) of businesses saying they have been impacted by energy prices, nearly two in five (39 %) say they have needed to adjust budgets due to rising prices. In response, many businesses are investing in energy efficiency (42 %), switching to renewable energy sources (33 % ), or passing higher costs onto customers (26 %).

Abdul Qureshi, MD of Barclays Business Banking, said: “Despite economic and energy challenges, UK businesses are pushing ahead with AI and skills investment to unlock productivity and growth. Firms are showing resilience by adapting quickly to new technologies and equipping their people with the tools they need to thrive.”",https://www.credit-connect.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Article-Image-Jake-1024x646.png,N,,2025-09-08 08:12:17.620448

Questions & Answers What are the two new companies that will be formed from the Kraft Heinz split?
The two new companies will be Global Taste Elevation Co and North American Grocery Co, each specializing in different areas of the food industry.
Who will lead North American Grocery Co?
Carlos Abrams-Rivera, who currently leads Kraft Heinz, will become the CEO of North American Grocery Co once the separation is complete.","The Kraft Heinz Company recently announced its comprehensive strategy to divide its current operations into two independent companies. This decision is aimed at enhancing functionality and reducing operational complexity.

The Plan for Separation

The company’s board has given its approval for this plan, which will result in the formation of two separate, publicly traded entities through a tax-free spin-off.

The first of these entities will be Global Taste Elevation Co. This company will focus on spices and shelf-stable meals, boasting net sales of approximately US$15.4 billion and an adjusted EBITDA of $4 billion in the previous year. Its brand portfolio will include well-known names like Heinz, Philadelphia, and Kraft Mac & Cheese. Notably, sauces, spreads, and seasonings will make up 75% of its sales.

The second entity, North American Grocery Co, will have net sales of $10.4 billion and an EBITDA of $2.3 billion. This firm will oversee brands such as Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles, and Lunchables.

Expected Outcomes

The division is expected to grant each new company greater strategic and operational focus. This will allow them to allocate resources appropriately, streamline operations, and distribute capital based on their individual strategies.

Miguel Patricio, the board’s executive chair for Kraft Heinz, noted that while their brands are celebrated and iconic, the current structural complexity impedes effective capital allocation and prioritization of initiatives. The split into two companies will enable the unlocking of each brand’s potential, driving improved performance and long-term shareholder value.

Carlos Abrams-Rivera will maintain his leadership role at Kraft Heinz during the separation, transitioning to become the CEO of North American Grocery Co once the process is complete. Meanwhile, the board is collaborating with an executive search firm to find suitable CEO candidates for Global Taste Elevation Co.

Kraft Heinz has no plans to relocate its current headquarters. The board has also created a Separation Committee, led by Vice-Chair John Cahill, to supervise the spin-off’s execution.

The company expects to finalize the separation by the second half of next year. It also anticipates dis-synergies of up to $300 million, with clear opportunities to offset a significant portion of these in the near term.

The tribunal found that Capgemini had failed to meet its legal duty to make reasonable adjustments, including: Failures to provide achievable and realistic tasks.","A recent employment tribunal ruling has revealed the nuances of reasonable adjustments for neurodivergent employees. Ms Khorram worked at technology services company Capgemini as a cloud technologist with over 25 years of experience. After a series of probation meetings, she told her employer that she was on ADHD medication, which was affecting her ability to perform her day-to-day tasks.

In response, the company arranged an occupational health assessment that recommended the team undertake a training seminar on working with individuals with ADHD. However, the seminar was not implemented after Ms Khorram expressed her discomfort with the company insisting she attend.

The company also failed to implement coaching sessions aimed at enhancing communication between HR at Capgemini and Ms Khorram. These oversights were deemed by the tribunal to constitute a failure to make reasonable adjustments, resulting in Ms Khorram being partially successful in her claim.

Following this tribunal decision, you may be questioning what constitutes reasonable adjustments and how businesses can ensure that neurodivergent employees are supported effectively.

Below, we answer these queries, share best practices and examine where Capgemini went wrong.

Who qualifies for reasonable adjustments?

The Equality Act 2010 recognises that there are varying degrees of neurodiversity and aims to protect those with a ‘significant impairment’ who would be recognised as having a ‘disability’. To qualify, the individual must have a mental impairment that has a substantial and adverse effect on their ability to perform their day-to-day life activities. As a result, employers have a duty to consider ‘reasonable adjustments’ for employees who are protected under the Equality Act.

Reasonable adjustments aim to help and support neurodiverse colleagues navigate the demands of a modern working environment

What is the aim of reasonable adjustments?

The goal of making ‘reasonable adjustments’ is to support an employee with, in this instance, a neurodivergent disability. It’s about ensuring the affected individual does not suffer any disadvantage compared to their neurotypical colleagues.

Employers put such measures in place to remove or minimise barriers, strengthen existing coping strategies or develop new ones, and provide individuals with the tools to thrive at work.

By doing so, the organisation recognises that while an employee may struggle in some areas, they still have strong capabilities in others. They may simply require additional support to perform effectively in the workplace.

Most importantly, reasonable adjustments aim to help and support neurodiverse colleagues navigate the demands of a modern working environment, while reducing any stress or challenges they may encounter.

What reasonable adjustments are commonly made for ADHD or neurodivergent employees?

Some common reasonable adjustments employers might consider for employees with ADHD or other neurodivergent conditions are:

Additional reminders for upcoming deadlines, particularly if the employee has multiple due in a short period of time.

Extended time to complete deadlines.

Awareness of the affected employee’s existing workload when allocating tasks to help avoid multitasking, as many people with ADHD struggle with time management.

Allowing frequent breaks to leave the office space.

Sensitivity around social scenarios outside of the workplace, such as informing the employee about an upcoming event before the rest of the team.

Providing sessions between the manager and employee to create an open forum for productive communication.

Standing desks to promote increased focus and reduce restlessness.

Where Capgemini failed to make reasonable adjustments

In the case of Ms Khorram, she was recognised by the tribunal to have a substantial disadvantage due to her difficulties with multitasking and observing deadlines, caused by her ADHD.

The tribunal found that Capgemini had failed to meet its legal duty to make reasonable adjustments, including:

Failures to provide achievable and realistic tasks.

Neurodiversity or ADHD awareness training.

Coaching sessions focused on time management and coping strategies.

Neurodiversity awareness should be part of the workplace culture, not just a reactive measure with little value.

Undiagnosis, disclosures and confidential conversations

Employers should attempt to support all neurodivergent colleagues by understanding their needs, encouraging open communication and implementing measures that enhance workplace performance.

Many employees may be undiagnosed or choose not to disclose their diagnosis. Employers must respect this autonomy and avoid pressuring individuals into uncomfortable discussions, which could feel like an interrogation.

To establish trusting relationships, some businesses find that encouraging individual conversations can foster an environment where employees may feel more comfortable and confident to disclose their conditions. This enables employers to better support affected individuals.

Confidential conversations can also provide a sensitive response to cases where performance concerns have arisen and may be causing wider issues in the workplace.

Charity support, occupational health assessments and coaching

Alternatively, employers can also seek guidance from neurodiversity-focused charities to better understand signs of neurodivergence and approach conversations with empathy and discretion.

For employees who do disclose their conditions, an occupational health assessment can provide professional advice on what supportive measures an individual may need. Its purpose is not to investigate, but rather to advise and guide employers on appropriate workplace adjustments.

In Ms Khorram’s case, the occupational health report identified her difficulty in consistently meeting deadlines due to her ADHD, yet she was still assigned additional objectives. This meant she was forced to multitask, which she had already expressed difficulties with.

HR representatives also failed to follow up on the report’s recommendations for additional coaching sessions. The employment tribunal deemed the lack of understanding and engagement to be a key failure in the implementation of reasonable adjustments. This result highlights the importance of employers to not only commission assessments but also act sufficiently on the guidance provided.

Creating a truly inclusive workplace requires proactive – not just reactive – support. Employers must go beyond ticking boxes.

Investing in neurodiversity training

To create a psychologically safe environment for neurodiverse employees, educating whole teams often prevents misinformation and fosters awareness of neurodivergent conditions. Incorporating this education into broader diversity training helps ensure that any neurodiverse employees are not at the center of, or the reason for, the training.

Ms Khorram and Capgemini’s HR team both agreed that neurodivergence training, recommended by the occupational health report, could have been a constructive step. However, Ms Khorram declined to attend because it was made clear that the proposed session was prompted by her diagnosis. As a result, the training never took place, and the tribunal found this constituted a key failure to make reasonable adjustments.

This case highlights the importance of designing training that is inclusive by default. Neurodiversity awareness should be part of the workplace culture, not just a reactive measure with little value.

Becoming truly neuroinclusive

Creating a truly inclusive workplace requires proactive – not just reactive – support. Employers must go beyond ticking boxes and consider tailored adjustments and consistent, effective communication.

As seen in Ms Khorram’s case, failure to act sensitively and follow recommendations without good reason can lead to legal consequences and erode trust.

Team-wide education can also foster understanding and embed neurodiversity into broader inclusion efforts that help create a psychologically safe culture where all employees can thrive.",https://hrzone.com/app/uploads/2025/09/9010542-e1756998255657-1024x576.png,N,,2025-09-08 04:04:32.209490

The stakes are high for the Danish state-controlled firm, which was once celebrated as a trailblazer in offshore wind but is now struggling to stave off a potentially crippling credit rating downgrade.
At the heart of the current drama are Orsted’s U.S. projects Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind.
The rights issue is critical for Orsted’s survival and its ability to avoid a further credit downgrade.
Norwegian energy firm Equinor, a 10% shareholder in Orsted, said it would invest up to 6 billion crowns ($941.2 million) into the rights issue.","Offshore wind developer Orsted won shareholder approval on Friday for a $9.4 billion emergency rights issue to help fund U.S. projects thrown into uncertainty by President Donald Trump’s opposition to the renewable energy source.

The stakes are high for the Danish state-controlled firm, which was once celebrated as a trailblazer in offshore wind but is now struggling to stave off a potentially crippling credit rating downgrade.

Orsted, previously an oil producer under the name DONG Energy, transformed itself into a global renewables leader, increasing its market value five-fold between its 2016 IPO and 2021.

But supply chain disruptions, surging interest rates, project delays, and Trump’s anti-wind policies have battered the offshore wind sector, sending Orsted’s share price tumbling by 85% from that 2021 peak.

At the heart of the current drama are Orsted’s U.S. projects Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind.

Two-thirds of the new capital is earmarked for Sunrise Wind, a project that saw potential co-investors flee after the White House ordered Norway’s Equinor to halt a neighbouring wind farm in April.

Last month, U.S. officials also issued a stop-work order for the nearly completed Revolution Wind facility, prompting the joint venture running the project to sue the administration.

Orsted CEO Rasmus Errboe told Reuters the company is incurring weekly costs of nearly 100 million Danish crowns ($15.7 million) for its 50% stake in Revolution Wind, co-owned with Skyborn Renewables.

“We have extensive dialogue with all stakeholders in Washington and at the state level,” CEO Rasmus Errboe told Reuters.

He warned that costs could rise significantly by October if specialised vessels contracted to install the remaining substation and cables are no longer available within their contracted period, forcing Orsted to re-enter the market at potentially much higher rates.

The stop-work order has also driven up costs for Sunrise Wind by 60 million to 70 million crowns per week, as Orsted uses the same vessel to install turbines for both projects.

Adding to Orsted’s troubles, low wind speeds in July and August and a delay to a project under construction off Taiwan prompted it to cut its 2025 operating profit outlook on Friday.

The rights issue is critical for Orsted’s survival and its ability to avoid a further credit downgrade.

Ratings agency S&P Global, however, warned that the equity raise might only buy the company three to six months of relief before construction delays trigger renewed pressure.

“It’s going to be a long, tough journey to reerect Orsted,” company chair Lene Skole told shareholders.

S&P already downgraded Orsted to BBB-, the lowest investment-grade rating, in August. Any further downgrade would push it into junk territory, complicating future financing.

Norwegian energy firm Equinor, a 10% shareholder in Orsted, said it would invest up to 6 billion crowns ($941.2 million) into the rights issue.

Recently, Pearson’s stock has been trading at 1,045.5 GBp, reflecting a marginal price change of -0.01%.
As the world increasingly pivots towards digital education, Pearson’s investments in virtual schools and online programme management services could serve as a catalyst for future growth.
For investors, Pearson plc presents a complex but potentially rewarding opportunity.
Its global footprint, coupled with a strong portfolio of educational products, positions it to navigate the evolving educational landscape.","Pearson plc, a stalwart in the educational publishing and services sector, stands as a significant player in the global education market. With a history dating back to 1844 and headquartered in London, the company has evolved into a multifaceted provider of educational courseware, assessments, and services. As a constituent of the Communication Services sector, Pearson’s reach extends across the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, the Asia Pacific, and other European countries, offering a comprehensive suite of educational solutions.

Recently, Pearson’s stock has been trading at 1,045.5 GBp, reflecting a marginal price change of -0.01%. This places it within a 52-week range of 1,013.50 GBp to 1,379.00 GBp, indicating some volatility in its trading pattern. Despite these fluctuations, the company’s market capitalisation remains robust at approximately $6.75 billion.

Investors may find Pearson’s valuation metrics intriguing, albeit unusual. The absence of a trailing P/E Ratio and a staggering forward P/E of 1,493.42 are notable, potentially reflecting market anticipations of future earnings growth or one-off accounting adjustments. Furthermore, traditional metrics such as PEG, Price/Book, and Price/Sales are not available, which might prompt investors to consider alternative analyses or focus on other aspects of the company’s financial health.

From a performance perspective, Pearson’s revenue growth has experienced a slight decline of -1.80%. However, the company’s return on equity is a healthy 11.95%, suggesting efficient management of shareholder funds. The net income figure is currently unavailable, but the company reports an earnings per share (EPS) of 0.65, which may provide some reassurance to investors regarding profitability. Additionally, Pearson boasts a free cash flow of £809.5 million, a critical indicator of financial flexibility and capacity for future investments or shareholder returns.

Dividend-seeking investors might be attracted by Pearson’s dividend yield of 2.33% and a moderate payout ratio of 36.81%, indicating a sustainable approach to dividend distribution. This payout strategy could be appealing to those looking for steady income amidst uncertain market conditions.

Analysts present a mixed view of Pearson, with four buy and four hold ratings, and no sell recommendations. The target price range varies from 1,120.00 GBp to 1,490.00 GBp, with an average target of 1,267.50 GBp, suggesting a potential upside of 21.23%. This optimistic outlook might resonate with investors inclined towards growth opportunities.

Technical indicators reveal that Pearson is currently trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, at 1,071.88 GBp and 1,190.94 GBp respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 34.43 suggests that the stock is nearing oversold territory, which could signal a potential buying opportunity for value-oriented investors. However, the negative MACD of -4.16, compared to a positive signal line of 0.39, warrants a cautious approach, highlighting potential bearish momentum.

Pearson’s broad array of offerings spans several segments, including Assessment & Qualifications, Virtual Learning, English Language Learning, Workforce Skills, and Higher Education. This diversification positions the company well to capitalise on the growing demand for educational technology and online learning solutions. As the world increasingly pivots towards digital education, Pearson’s investments in virtual schools and online programme management services could serve as a catalyst for future growth.

For investors, Pearson plc presents a complex but potentially rewarding opportunity. Its global footprint, coupled with a strong portfolio of educational products, positions it to navigate the evolving educational landscape. However, careful consideration of its financial metrics and market conditions will be essential in assessing the potential risks and rewards associated with this legacy education giant.",https://www.directorstalkinterviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-uk-broker-ratings-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 00:05:20.875425

Scott will be replaced as COO by current global CEO of the Ogilvy agency, Devika Bulchandani.
In September 2022, she was promoted to global CEO of Ogilvy.
Bulchandani’s elevation to WPP COO left an opening to lead Ogilvy, which will be filled by Laurent Ezekiel.
Stepping into his shoes as leader of WPP Open X is Floriane Tripolino, a former CEO of Publicis Groupe in Japan who joined WPP in 2020.","WPP has a series of new senior leaders in the wake of its chief operating officer Andrew Scott stepping down, and new CEO Cindy Rose beginning her post last week.

Scott first joined WPP back in 1999 as director of corporate development, and went on to hold various roles over the years, including COO of the Europe operation, and then global COO from 2018 onwards. Last week, on the first day of new CEO Cindy Rose’s tenure, he announced he would step down at the end of the year.

Scott will be replaced as COO by current global CEO of the Ogilvy agency, Devika Bulchandani.

Bulchandani had been president of McCann New York before joining Ogilvy in March 2021 as global president as well as CEO for its North American business. In September 2022, she was promoted to global CEO of Ogilvy.

WPP said, during her tenure leading Ogilvy, Bulchandani had cemented its position as one of the world’s leading creative networks, strategically strengthened and modernised its core capabilities, diversified the network’s client roster, and consistently delivered creative ideas that were groundbreaking and solved complex business challenges for clients.

Bulchandani’s elevation to WPP COO left an opening to lead Ogilvy, which will be filled by Laurent Ezekiel.

Ezekiel joined WPP in 2019 as chief marketing and growth officer. In 2021, he became CEO of WPP Open X, the holding group’s creative, media, social, influencer, commerce, PR, data and technology outfit specifically created to support The Coca-Cola Company’s marketing transformation. The Coca-Cola Company renewed its partnership with the bespoke agency in May.

Stepping into his shoes as leader of WPP Open X is Floriane Tripolino, a former CEO of Publicis Groupe in Japan who joined WPP in 2020. Most recently, she has been leading the group’s account for global food and beverage giant Nestlé.

Rose, WPP’s new CEO who took over from Mark Read this month, said the three appointments underscore WPP’s commitment to delivering unparalleled value and innovation.

“Devika’s deep obsession with helping our clients grow and win will help us accelerate our growth across the entire WPP landscape. Laurent’s close, successful partnership with The Coca-Cola Company and creation of WPP Open X gives him valuable insight and experience to help navigate the needs of our largest clients, many of which are housed in Ogilvy.

“These leaders embody the strategic vision and creative excellence that define WPP. Their collective expertise will play a crucial part in helping me drive WPP to our next phase of growth and ensuring our clients continue to win in a rapidly evolving market,” she said.

Bulchandani added: “I have been the luckiest person in the world, to have the best job in the world as Ogilvy’s CEO – and I’m immensely proud of what we’ve achieved together as a team. Having partnered closely with Laurent, I’ve seen firsthand his unparalleled ability to drive growth and champion creative excellence. I can’t think of a better leader to partner with Liz Taylor, our chief creative officer, and our leadership team to guide Ogilvy to even greater heights.

“As we all begin this next chapter at WPP, I’m energised by the immense potential ahead. I truly believe that when we seamlessly bring together WPP’s world-class capabilities, we become an invincible force – one that unlocks unparalleled value for our clients. I look forward to collaborating with Cindy and leaders across WPP to amplify that impact and drive even greater success for our partners.”",https://mumbrella.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Laurent-Ezekiel-Cindy-Rose-and-Devika-Bulchandani-of-WPP.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 03:05:58.828096

AI agents and multi-agent systems gain momentum The last year has also seen a steady rise in AI agents.
Of those organizations scaling AI agents, nearly 45% are also piloting or scaling multi-agent systems.
Nearly four in ten (38%) believe AI agents will evolve into self-learning agents with minimal human supervision in the next 3-5 years.
Only 46% have established governance policies for their AI systems, yet most seldom follow them.","The latest Capgemini Research Institute report published, ‘Harnessing the value of AI: Unlocking scalable advantage,’ suggests that generative AI (Gen AI) is rapidly moving into the mainstream, with enterprise adoption and investment accelerating at pace. According to the report, nearly 6 in 10 organizations are expected to have AI as an active team member or a supervisor for other AI within the next 12 months – up from 44% currently. Despite this, organizations admit they are not prepared for dynamic human-AI collaboration. Two-thirds of enterprises agree that they will need to restructure their teams to enhance human-AI collaboration, with most expecting their organizational structure to evolve.

The annual report, now in its third edition, finds that 30% of organizations are now fully or partially scaling Gen AI, up from 6% in 2023 - a fivefold increase in the last two years. A vast majority of organizations (93%) are exploring, piloting, or partially or fully enabling Gen AI capabilities in 2025. Sectors like telecom, consumer products, and aerospace and defense organizations are leading the charge in Gen AI adoption, with core business functions such as customer operations, marketing, risk management, and IT remaining top areas of implementation.

“Enterprise adoption of AI is scaling faster than almost any technology we’ve seen before, with companies experimenting with AI across all functions. But rapid adoption doesn’t necessarily translate into large scale deployment with tangible ROI,” said Franck Greverie, Chief Technology & Portfolio Officer, Head of the Global Business lines and Group Executive Board Member at Capgemini. “To succeed, enterprises must set up a solid data foundation, in a trusted environment that’s compliant, secure and ensures necessary privacy. This, along with a new operating model with a balanced human-AI chemistry, can ensure winning business outcomes.”

Gen AI investments continue to accelerate

As organizations seek to realize the benefits of Gen AI, investment is accelerating and eight in ten (79%) organizations say they are happy with the outcomes so far. The report highlights that, in the past 12 months, nine in ten (88%) organizations have increased investment in Gen AI by an average of 9%, with 12% of the IT budget now dedicated to Gen AI. This trend is expected to continue, with 61% of organizations anticipating a further increase in Gen AI investments in the next year.

However, organizations report an unexpected surge in cloud consumption costs, with over half experiencing “bill shocks” triggered by the rapid expansion of Gen AI initiatives, as scaling efforts outpace initial projections. Enterprises are also increasingly turning to small language models (SLMs) for cost effectiveness.

AI agents and multi-agent systems gain momentum

The last year has also seen a steady rise in AI agents. This is set to increase, with most business functions likely to have AI agents handling at least one business process. Nine in ten executives from product design/R&D, marketing, and sales are optimistic about AI agents handling one or more business processes in their function in the next 3-5 years.

AI agent systems are becoming increasingly complex and interconnected, with multi-agent systems likely to be the next major development in AI. Of those organizations scaling AI agents, nearly 45% are also piloting or scaling multi-agent systems. Nearly four in ten (38%) believe AI agents will evolve into self-learning agents with minimal human supervision in the next 3-5 years.

Despite rapid adoption, the report finds that a majority (71%) of organizations said they cannot fully trust autonomous AI agents for enterprise use, highlighting that businesses must also overcome governance gaps to build trust in AI. However, most enterprises still struggle with setting up guardrails and governance for AI.

India Aug. total vehicle retail sales 1.96m units: FADA

New Delhi, September 2, 2025 - India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman unveiled significant tax cuts for hundreds of consumer items, including vehicles, set to take effect from September 22. The changes, part of the biggest overhaul of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), aim to stimulate economic growth and boost consumer spending.

The new tax regime will feature two key rates: 5% and 18%, down from the current four rates. A new 40% tax slab will apply to high-end goods, with all additional levies above this rate abolished, reducing effective tax rates on mid-size and big cars. The government estimates these cuts will result in a revenue loss of 480 billion rupees ($5.5 billion), significantly lower than economists' estimates of 1 trillion to 1.8 trillion rupees [1].

The tax cuts are expected to lift sales of fast-moving consumer goods firms and lower costs for farmers. Notably, GST on vehicles has been reduced, which could boost sales during the upcoming festival season. Carmakers such as Maruti and Toyota, and manufacturers of consumer appliances like LG Electronics and Sony, are set to benefit immediately from the new rates. The effective tax for big cars has been lowered to 40% from as much as 50%, making luxury cars from Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and BMW more attractive. GST on electric vehicles (EVs) remains at 5%, providing relief to carmakers such as Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra [1].

The tax cuts on fertilizers and tractors are also expected to help lower costs for farmers, who have been in the spotlight due to recent trade talks between India and the United States. The government has also cut taxes on items such as cars, TVs, and cement, which could boost sales during the festival season.

However, not all sectors will benefit from these cuts. GST has been raised to 18% from 12% on apparel and clothing accessories costing more than 2,500 rupees, which could hurt global brands such as Marks & Spencer, Levi Strauss, and Zara [1].

The total vehicle retail sales in India for August 2025 stood at 1.96 million units, according to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA). This figure is expected to rise with the implementation of the new GST rates, as consumers and manufacturers alike benefit from the reduced tax burden.

From climate-tech to AI-native platforms, companies that strategically align stakeholders, technologies, and value chains are outpacing competitors by creating scalable solutions that deliver both environmental and financial returns. This shift is not a passing trend—it's a fundamental redefinition of competitive advantage in the 2025 economy.

The Rise of Ecosystem Orchestrators

The most compelling examples of ecosystem-driven innovation come from firms that act as orchestrators—entities that lead, integrate, and scale networks of partners to create value. Consider Tesla, which has transformed from an electric vehicle manufacturer into a vertically integrated ecosystem linking EVs, energy storage, and renewable infrastructure. By 2025, its fully solar- and wind-powered Supercharger network has avoided 30 million tons of CO₂ emissions, while its market value surged 150% since 2023. Tesla's success lies in its ability to orchestrate partnerships with startups and suppliers, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of innovation.

Similarly, Standard Chartered has embedded climate action into its core operations, generating $982 million in sustainable finance revenue in 2024 alone. Its Transition Plan—a 29% reduction in oil-and-gas facilitated emissions by 2030—has boosted ESG ratings by 18% year-over-year, attracting ESG-conscious capital and solidifying its leadership in green finance. This case underscores how ESG integration is no longer a compliance checkbox but a direct revenue driver.

Operational Efficiency and Circular Models

In traditional industries, innovation ecosystems are unlocking dual benefits of cost savings and sustainability. Delta Air Lines reduced fuel burn by 1% in 2025 through lightweight cabin kits and optimized flight paths, saving $110 million while cutting carbon emissions. This low-cost, high-impact strategy demonstrates how operational efficiency can be a strategic lever within broader ecosystem frameworks.

Meanwhile, H&M Group has redefined fast fashion through a circular economy model. By incorporating 29.5% recycled materials and reducing Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 41% by 2025, H&M has positioned itself as a leader in the $460 billion circular economy market. Its ecosystem includes partnerships with recycling startups and suppliers, illustrating how cross-sector collaboration can drive long-term value creation.

Emerging Ecosystems and AI-Native Platforms

The global innovation map is shifting, with emerging markets and AI-native ecosystems gaining prominence. São Paulo has emerged as Latin America's top innovation hub, attracting record early-stage funding and producing 10 unicorns in 2025. Government support and a focus on climate-tech and fintech have fueled this growth, offering investors high-potential opportunities in regions often overlooked by traditional capital.

In parallel, Shenzhen has leveraged state-backed infrastructure and AI-native startups to become a global competitor in frontier technologies. Meanwhile, cities like Boston, Silicon Valley, and London are leading the AI-Native Transition, where AI startups now account for a significant share of total tech funding. Firms like Amazon and Google have built interconnected AI platforms that reduce coordination costs and accelerate R&D, outpacing traditional competitors by creating ecosystems that enable broader industry transformation.

Strategic Frameworks and Investment Implications

Academic and industry frameworks, such as the Lingens-Gassmann model and the Integrated Interconnected Business Ecosystem Framework, emphasize three pillars: structural, relational, and dynamic alignment. Firms that integrate these elements—like Tesla's governance of its energy ecosystem or Standard Chartered's stakeholder collaboration—achieve faster R&D cycles and scalable solutions.

For investors, the key is to identify ecosystem orchestrators—companies that lead, scale, and integrate ecosystems. These firms typically exhibit characteristics such as:

- Scalable partnerships: Tesla's collaboration with energy startups.

- Data-driven governance: Standard Chartered's ESG metrics.

- Sustainability integration: H&M's circular economy model.

Emerging markets and AI-native platforms offer particularly high-growth opportunities. The Rise Ahead Pledge—a $277 million commitment by 25 corporations to social innovation—exemplifies how public-private partnerships can build resilient ecosystems. Similarly, ecosystem exchanges like Greentown Labs' Ecosystem Exchange connect startups from Norway and Australia with Houston's energy sector, accelerating climate solutions through trust-based partnerships.

Conclusion: The Future Belongs to Ecosystems

The past three years have confirmed that innovation ecosystems are central to competitive advantage. Companies like Standard Chartered, Tesla, Delta, and H&M have demonstrated how aligning ecosystems with sustainability, operational efficiency, and technological leadership unlocks disproportionate value. For investors, the path forward lies in backing firms that design and lead these ecosystems, particularly in emerging markets and frontier technologies.

As the global economy becomes increasingly interconnected, the ability to orchestrate innovation ecosystems will define the next generation of industry leaders. The question for investors is no longer whether to invest in ecosystems but how to identify the orchestrators shaping the future. The answer lies in data-driven governance, cross-sector collaboration, and a relentless focus on scalability.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 05:04:55.698369

Unilever CEO Fernando Fernandez plans to replace about 25% of the company’s top 200 managers as part of a sweeping performance overhaul of the consumer goods group.

THE DETAILS Speaking at the Barclays Global Consumer Staples Conference, Fernandez criticized Unilever’s performance culture as inconsistent and its structure as “bloated.” Since taking over in February, he has overseen an 18% reduction in white-collar roles over the past 18 months and is accelerating a restructuring agenda originally outlined by former CEO Hein Schumacher.

Key measures include spinning off Unilever’s ice cream unit — which owns brands such as Magnum and Ben & Jerry’s — by November, and divesting underperforming businesses to concentrate resources on higher-growth divisions. The board removed Schumacher earlier this year, citing dissatisfaction with the speed of change.

The study finds that nearly six in ten organisations expect AI to function as an active team member or supervisor for other AI systems within the next year, compared to 44% today.

Despite this surge, most firms admit they are unprepared for such close human-AI collaboration. Two-thirds of organisations say they will need to restructure teams to support new modes of interaction between employees and AI systems.

From experimentation to scale

The report highlights that 30% of enterprises are now fully or partially scaling Gen AI, up from just 6% in 2023. Today, 93% are either piloting or enabling Gen AI across business functions, with telecom, consumer products, and aerospace among the frontrunners. Customer operations, marketing, risk management, and IT remain the most common areas of implementation.

“Enterprise adoption of AI is scaling faster than almost any technology we’ve seen before, but rapid adoption doesn’t always mean large-scale deployment with measurable returns,” said Franck Greverie, Chief Technology & Portfolio Officer at Capgemini. He emphasised the need for trusted, secure data foundations and balanced human-AI operating models.

Rising investments and cloud costs

Organisations are backing their ambitions with capital. Nearly nine in ten firms increased Gen AI spending in the past year, dedicating on average 12% of their IT budgets to the technology. More than 60% expect further increases next year.

But the rush has also triggered unexpected costs. Over half of enterprises reported “bill shocks” from cloud consumption as AI pilots scaled faster than projected. To contain costs, many are exploring small language models (SLMs) as alternatives to large AI systems.

The rise of AI agents and multi-agent systems

AI agents, software systems that handle business tasks independently, are gaining traction. Most executives in functions like R&D, sales, and marketing believe agents will manage at least one process in the next three to five years.

Of those scaling AI agents, 45% are already piloting multi-agent systems, where interconnected agents coordinate tasks. Nearly four in ten leaders expect these systems to evolve into self-learning agents needing minimal human supervision.

The research house estimates the company's earnings momentum in 1H26, particularly from the completion of two substation extension projects worth RM92mil and ongoing substation engineering projects worth RM170mil and RM180mil. Phillip Research maintains a ""buy"" rating and a target price of RM1.82.

Brown & Brown's Wholesale Brokerage Segment has been a significant driver of earnings growth for the company, demonstrating resilience and adaptability in the volatile insurance industry. In Q2 2025, the segment achieved 14.5% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth, reaching $182 million, and maintained a robust EBITDAC margin of 34.1% [1].

The segment's success can be attributed to its diversified revenue streams, including commissions and investment income, which provide stability amid market volatility. This multi-layered revenue structure insulates the business from the volatility of any single market condition. For instance, in Q2 2025, the segment achieved 14.5% YoY revenue growth, with EBITDAC rising to $62 million (34.1% margin), even as it navigated rate declines and property renewal seasonality [1].

The segment’s adaptability is further underscored by its ability to balance growth across commercial and personal lines. While open brokerage segments face competition in personal lines, the Wholesale Brokerage’s focus on excess and surplus insurance—often for complex or high-risk clients—creates a niche less susceptible to commoditization [2]. This strategic positioning has allowed the segment to maintain 3.9% organic revenue growth in Q2 2025, despite broader market headwinds [2].

Historically, the segment has also expanded through strategic acquisitions and organic growth. As of December 2020, it employed 1,578 professionals, reflecting its operational scale and capacity to execute long-term strategies [3]. Management’s forecast of 8.4% organic growth in 2025 further highlights confidence in the segment’s ability to sustain momentum [1].

The Wholesale Brokerage Segment’s margin resilience is a standout feature of its financial performance. In Q4 2024, adjusted EBITDAC margins expanded to 32.9%, up from 31.0% in the same period of 2023 [1]. For the full year, margins reached 35.2%, compared to 33.9% in 2023 [1]. This improvement reflects disciplined cost management and operational efficiency, even as the company’s total operating expenses rose by 12.57% in 2024 [2].

The segment’s ability to maintain margins during periods of rate compression—such as in CAT property insurance—demonstrates its value proposition. By leveraging its independent agent and broker network, Brown & Brown can scale operations without proportionally increasing overhead, a critical advantage in a cyclical industry [2]. This model not only preserves margins but also enhances cash flow stability, which is essential for reinvestment and shareholder returns.

As the insurance market continues to evolve, Brown & Brown’s Wholesale Brokerage Segment stands out as a strategic asset. Its diversified revenue streams, margin resilience, and adaptability position it to outperform during both upturns and downturns. For investors, this segment represents a compelling case study in how strategic business design can mitigate cyclical risks while driving sustainable growth.

These facilities leverage automation to process more than double the volume of a traditional distribution centre. For example, robotics now handle the movement of cases on and off pallets, reducing the need for strenuous lifting.

Associates at the facility work alongside the systems that build store specific pallets, ensuring fragile items like eggs and yogurt are placed toward the top, to minimise product damage. AI tracks every pallet to ensure accuracy and freshness. This technology also makes unloading at stores faster and easier, allowing store associates to spend more time helping customers.

2025 RTIH INNOVATION AWARDS

Automation will be a key focus area at the 2025 RTIH Innovation Awards.

The awards. which are now open for entries, celebrate global tech innovation in a fast moving omnichannel world.

Our 2024 hall of fame entrants were revealed during an event which took place at RIBA’s 66 Portland Place HQ in Central London on 21st November, and consisted of a drinks reception, three course meal, and awards ceremony presided over by comedian Lucy Porter.

In his welcome speech, Scott Thompson, Founder and Editor, RTIH, said: “The event is now into its sixth year and what a journey it has been. The awards started life as an online only affair during the Covid outbreak, before launching as a small scale in real life event and growing year on year to the point where we’re now selling out this fine, historic venue.”

He added: “Congratulations to all of our finalists. Many submissions did not make it through to the final stage, and getting to this point is no mean feat. Checkout-free stores, automated supply chains, immersive experiences, on-demand delivery, next generation loyalty offerings, inclusive retail, green technology. We’ve got all the cool stuff covered this evening.”

“But just importantly we’ve got lots of great examples of companies taking innovative tech and making it usable in everyday operations - resulting in more efficiency and profitability in all areas.”

The National Employers’ Association of SA (Neasa) says poor economic conditions and unaffordable wage rates have cut membership in the engineering sector to 1,500 firms employing 55,000 workers.
There have been more job losses this year, with steel maker ArcellorMittal SA (AMSA) announcing it was shutting down, resulting in 3,500 people becoming unemployed.
Another 3,000 employees at Glencore Operations SA face job cuts after the company issued two Section 189 notices at its Rhovan mine and head office.
Swart said: “The dismissal of 3,500 employees, due to the closure of AMSA’s steel business, is concerning.","Ten thousand people lost their jobs in SA’s engineering sector in the past six years – an average of five employees a day.

The National Employers’ Association of SA (Neasa) says poor economic conditions and unaffordable wage rates have cut membership in the engineering sector to 1,500 firms employing 55,000 workers.

This is down from 1,800 businesses employing 65,000 people six years ago.

There have been more job losses this year, with steel maker ArcellorMittal SA (AMSA) announcing it was shutting down, resulting in 3,500 people becoming unemployed.

Tyre producer Goodyear’s closure in June led to the loss of 900 jobs.

The Ford Motor Company of SA has also announced plans to cut 474 jobs at two of its plants – 391 operator positions at the Silverton assembly plant in Pretoria, 73 at the Struandale engine plant in Gqeberha, and 10 administrative roles at both facilities, according to the employment and labour department.

“This decline can be attributed to poor economic conditions, unaffordable wage rates and high input costs such as high steel prices and electricity,” said Neasa’s national manager, Jaco Swart.

Another 3,000 employees at Glencore Operations SA face job cuts after the company issued two Section 189 notices at its Rhovan mine and head office.

Swart said the association has been in contact with numerous businesses that have indicated that they have had to reduce their number of employees or close down completely due to their “inability to compete with imports of finished products which attract no duty, while duties are imposed on steel imports”.

Glencore employees said they were facing difficult times as they did not know if they would still be employed at the end of the Section 189 notices, which serve as the formal start of the retrenchment process.

A 39-year-old woman who has been working for the company for 11 years said she was anxious.

“We look after our families, but now with this notice, it raises a lot of questions about what we are going to do. Even if you stay behind, it doesn’t look like there is a future. Now we are all confused, but we are trying to stay positive,” she said.

The single mother of four said the father of her children was also employed by the company.

“We have all our eggs in one basket. There is no certainty for the future, and it needs major intervention from the government,” she said.

“The notice [to retrench] is causing a lot of divisions among us because everyone just wants to save their own jobs. People are saying they should be the ones to stay behind. The people affected mostly are the young generation.”

Another Glencore employee said: “Most of us are not marketable outside this company. Even if the company lets us go, it won’t be easy for many of us to find new employment. I spoke to my wife and my family, and they were in shock. I warned them to be prepared for something of this magnitude. I could see they were affected – they weren’t themselves.

“The medical benefits, for example, are a huge concern. I’ve told my wife many times that if I lose these benefits, I won’t be able to afford private healthcare. I feel aggrieved. I’m not happy. I’m not hopeful.”

Another employee said he was shocked the company was opting to retrench even while there are ongoing talks with unions. The 30-year-old man has been with Glencore for six years.

“We are parents and responsible for many mouths to feed. It [the announcement] is affecting me negatively and emotionally because it is going to lead to a financial burden.”

The father of two children, aged three and seven, said while he has not received a letter of retrenchment yet, he feared he would.

Swart said: “The dismissal of 3,500 employees, due to the closure of AMSA’s steel business, is concerning. Any job loss is a tragedy, but we cannot risk the survival of an entire sector simply to keep one actor alive.”

On Tuesday, the employment and labour minister Nomakhosazana Meth said the department has ongoing efforts with key stakeholders to mitigate job losses at AMSA.

She said R416.8m had been allocated from the Unemployment Insurance Fund under the temporary employer/employee relief scheme to support 2,982 employees at AMSA. However, the company was adamant about closing its operations. – Additional reporting Koena Mashale

Who would think to put Chipotle in Urban Outfitters?","Then, in subsequent months, Urban Outfitters rolled out a collaboration with Chipotle, held a dorm makeover contest with HGTV and created a collection of $500-and-under dorm or apartment essentials called “Design Your Dorm.” It’s now planning college pop-ups for the fall, building on efforts it rolled out last year.

Urban Outfitters isn’t new to home; the brand has sold items like bedding and chairs for decades. But the brand is focused on staying competitive in the space, especially as Gen Z has no shortage of brands or channels for buying things like comforters, desks or bean bag chairs. Dorm decoration is also a hot topic on social media, especially when it comes to TikTok and Instagram, and Urban Outfitters looks to users’ videos to both source inspiration and see if its products are resonating.

The home category is key to Urban Outfitters’s parent company, which oversees Nuuly, Anthropologie and Free People, in addition to Urban Outfitters. According to Urban Outfitters, Inc.’s 10-K from April, home accounted for 16% of net sales in fiscal 2025, compared to 66% for apparel and 13% for accessories. Urban Outfitters doesn’t break out sales by home, but it does marry the section with the rest of its assortment. “It’s very common for us to take a textile print and do it in pajamas or do it in accessories,” Cahill said.

Modern Retail spoke with Cahill to learn more about the brand’s plans for the home space. Below are highlights of the interview, which have been edited for length and clarity.

A three-pronged approach to home products

“I often reference [our approach] as the ‘3Fs.’ There’s an element of functionality that we want to provide with home — making things easier and useful and workable for our customer and their living space. It 100% has to be fun, and that’s what you see come through in every single thing. … And you want it to evoke this feeling of either delight — which everyone needs, because there’s so much stress in the world — or comfort.

A perfect example of where this trifecta came into play was Catwala [a water bottle with Owala that has a cat collage on it]. Function[-wise], we all need to hydrate, right? But how fun to put cats on it. … The tumbler was one of our best sellers, and it sold out that day [it was released]. … [The partnership with] Chipotle was also unexpected cleverness. Who would think to put Chipotle in Urban Outfitters? But it also makes so much sense, because the two really intersect with Gen Z, and they’re both fan-favorite brands.”

On maintaining momentum, year-round

“We really [have a] Gen-Z focus, but there are different lifestyles and life moments within. … For someone who is in high school, they’re thinking of that dorm [experience]. And then for college [students], it’s that first year, but they might be doing another move outside of the dorm or cohabitating. Then, for a post-grad, maybe they’re moving to New York and a small space. So, we are constantly thinking of the journey of the three, which is sometimes the same, sometimes not.

When it comes to bedding and furniture, these are typically very seasonal. The good news is that furniture, bedding, textile and decor are very important, but we also have this whole other amazing business in gifting and novelty, whether it’s Hello Kitty or Pop Mart stuff. These are the daily glimmers of delight that are always on 24/7.

Hydration has also been a huge trend, … and gathering is important, whether you’re playing games or inviting someone over to your first apartment for charcuterie or a mocktail or a cocktail. Valentine’s Day has turned into Galentine’s Day, and Thanksgiving has turned into Friendsgiving. It goes back to: The answer is with the customer. If we know what they’re doing, we can give them the tools to help that moment be even more amazing.”

Getting inspiration from Gen Z

“It does start with the customer, and [head of brand marketing and communications] Cyntia [Leo] and her team go very deep into our group of ambassadors, doing surveys and focus groups. I actually don’t kick off a season of product unless I am looking at the work Cyntia provided. Recently, Cyntia and her team went out and did a closet raid. What are they wearing? Why? How are they describing it? What words are important to them? That, coupled with just a healthy education of market research and social media, really provides great answers for how we speak to our customers.

Sometimes, retailers can be kind of isolated and think, ‘Oh, here’s what we think the answer is.’ The answer is always with the customer. … This is actually a fun story: On Friday nights, [my family] will go to this restaurant near Villanova [University], where all the kids go before they go out. At one point, I was like, ‘Man, they’re all on their phones.’ But that was for a few minutes, and all of a sudden, [a group] pulled out cards and started playing question games. I was like, ‘Oh my God, I love this.’ I brought that back to the home team and said, ‘This is a fun thing to get after to help them enjoy each other more and their gathering more.’ … Now, the cards are coming. They’re on the way. … The world can be tough, and there’s a lot going on, but if we can provide that little glimmer of joy, we’re doing our job.”

Holiday plans for 2025

“Gifting is huge for us, and home is really at the center of that. What will feel different this year versus last year is that gifting will amplify. This came from customer insights, but there’s gifting for others, and then there’s self-gifting. … And I think we’ve done that, both in apparel and in home.

There’s going to be some great novelty coming. That’s something we do so well, but [it will be] amplified and beyond the norm of the actual item. We’re having fun with things like Owala [water bottles] and HydraMini [speakers]. And there are going to be some fun things happening in scent, which is so important and such a giftable item.

One of the messages that the marketing team brought [to the merchandising team] was, ‘Small gifts, big impact.’ … Gone are the days of the generic gift card or what have you. I think we’re going to offer a great experience to the customer, and they’re going to be delighted. So, there’s lots happening. Our gift shop goes live at the end of September.”",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/09/2507_HOME_DORM_DOMINANCE_OK_JULYWK110905-MHFav.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 01:07:59.625242

Kraft Heinz has over 20 major brands in its portfolio, with eight brands generating over $1 billion in sales each.
The Kraft Heinz downsizing gives retailers permission to finally act on that reality.
The Divestiture Domino Effect Don’t think this is just about Kraft Heinz.
The grocery retailers who recognize this shift and adapt accordingly will find themselves in a stronger position than ever.","The End of the Megabrand Era

For nearly a century, American consumers have operated under a simple cultural assumption: Bigger is better, more choices equal more freedom, convenience foods have no limit, and zillions of national brands represent quality and reliability. Kraft Heinz, with its sprawling portfolio of household names from Oscar Mayer to Jell-O, embodied this philosophy perfectly. But that era is ending, and retailers need to prepare for what comes next.

Kraft Heinz has over 20 major brands in its portfolio, with eight brands generating over $1 billion in sales each. The splitting of the company separates brands including Heinz, Philadelphia Cream Cheese and Kraft Mac & Cheese into one company (temporarily and bizarrely called Global Taste Elevation Co.) while Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles, Lunchables, Maxwell House and Capri Sun will form the other company called North American Grocery Co. — for now.

The proposed divestiture of brands isn’t happening in a vacuum. It reflects a profound shift in consumer behavior that smart retailers have been tracking for years. Today’s shoppers—particularly millennials and Gen Z—don’t want endless grocery aisles with a mind-boggling variety of processed foods. They want authenticity, transparency, well-being, and purpose. They’d rather have three exceptional hot sauce options instead of 30 mediocre ones; a philosophy that ALDI has paid attention to and proven with increased sales and customer count.

The Retail Reality Check

Here’s what this means for grocery retailers: The center store is about to get a lot less crowded, and that’s actually good news for everyone except the CPG giants and their brand managers who are still clinging to the old model.

Let’s talk shelf space economics. My guess is that Kraft Heinz will likely shed 20 to 30 percent of its portfolio, and retailers will suddenly find themselves with prime shelf real estate that’s been tied up for decades. Smart grocers will use this opportunity to continue to expand their own-brand offerings, fill their shelves with more local and regional brands, or—and this is my personal hope—create more experiential shopping zones.

I’ve been saying for years that the traditional grocery store layout is obsolete and irrelevant. The Kraft Heinz downsizing gives retailers permission to finally act on that reality. Having to walk past 40,000+ items to select the 20 or so items consumers have on their shopping list is just ridiculous and helps fuel the growth of online grocery shopping. Instead of 60 feet of me-too salad dressings, clever retailers will reimagine how to use that space for more service departments, fresh foods and prepared foods that make their stores more human and exciting.

A Cultural Shift: From Abundance to Curation

What we’re really witnessing is the end of what many call “the paradox of choice“—the uniquely American belief that having fewer choices somehow diminishes our quality of life. The pandemic taught consumers that they could live quite well with less variety and forced many brands to reduce their SKUs to be able to meet demand and operate their production facilities more efficiently. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for food at home prices from March 2020 to March 2024 increased by 24.7 percent and food inflation has reinforced for many shoppers the value of making more intentional purchasing decisions.

This cultural evolution favors retailers who understand curation over accumulation. The grocers who will thrive in this new environment are those who can tell a story about why they chose particular foods, something Trader Joe’s has mastered for decades in their Fearless Flyer and podcast. The grocers who strive to just offer the most options are those who face extinction.

The Divestiture Domino Effect

Don’t think this is just about Kraft Heinz. Every CPG company should be watching closely, and many will follow. Unilever, Nestle, Conagra, Mondelez and General Mills are already trimming their portfolios. What we’re seeing is the industrialization of food production reaching its natural conclusion—and now the pendulum is swinging back toward specialization.

This downsizing of America’s food choices isn’t a loss—it’s a liberation. Consumers are tired of decision fatigue. They want to trust that the products on grocery shelves are there for good reasons, not just because they’ve always been there.

The grocery retailers who recognize this shift and adapt accordingly will find themselves in a stronger position than ever. They’ll have more control over their assortments, better margins on their products, and form closer relationships with their customers.

The grocery industry is about to become more dynamic, more local, and more responsive to actual consumer needs rather than corporate me-too-isms, line extensions and promotional efforts. For grocery retailers willing to embrace this change, the future has never looked brighter.",https://therobinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/The-Downsizing-of-America-Kraft-Heinzs-Breakup-Is-Just-the-Beginning.png,N,,2025-09-08 01:08:04.477245

Ready-built factories reshape industrial landscape According to Cushman & Wakefield, Vietnam’s supply of ready-built factories reached about 11 million square metres by the second quarter of 2025, with an occupancy rate above 85%.
Leading locations include Ho Chi Minh City (3 million sq.m), Dong Nai (2.2 million sq.m), Bac Ninh (1.6 million sq.m) and Hai Phong (2.2 million sq.m).

Not only conventional manufacturers but also high-tech firms are turning to ready-built factories with strict technical and ESG standards.","Hanoi (VNA) - Foreign direct investment (FDI) is pouring into Vietnam at a rapid pace, reinforcing the country’s position as a rising hub on Asia’s industrial map. Amid supply chain shifts, ready-built factories are emerging as a strategic draw for international capital.

FDI momentum driven by manufacturing

Vietnam continued to shine as an attractive investment destination in the first seven months of 2025, with registered FDI reaching 24.09 billion USD, up 27.3% year on year. Disbursed capital stood at 13.6 billion USD, an increase of 8.4%.

Manufacturing remained the dominant sector, accounting for 56.5% of total FDI, or nearly 11.97 billion USD, in the first half of the year. Of 759 newly licensed manufacturing projects, up 40% from a year earlier, some 410, or 54%, opted to lease ready-built facilities rather than land, marking the first time factory leases outnumbered land deals in terms of project numbers.

The north retained its lead, attracting 54% of total capital and more than 380 projects, with Bac Ninh alone accounting for 13% of total FDI and 115 projects. The central region doubled its share to 6%, buoyed by lower costs and improved logistics, while the southern region remained a key player, with Dong Nai and Ho Chi Minh City gaining investors' attention.

Ready-built factories reshape industrial landscape

According to Cushman & Wakefield, Vietnam’s supply of ready-built factories reached about 11 million square metres by the second quarter of 2025, with an occupancy rate above 85%. Leading locations include Ho Chi Minh City (3 million sq.m), Dong Nai (2.2 million sq.m), Bac Ninh (1.6 million sq.m) and Hai Phong (2.2 million sq.m).

Analysts said the boom is driven by speed and flexibility. Leasing a ready-built facility can cut project timelines by months or even years compared with purchasing land, securing permits, designing and building from scratch. This accelerates deployment by as much as 12 to 18 times - critical in fast-moving global supply chains.

The model also reduces upfront costs. With monthly rents averaging 4–6 USD per sq.m in the northern region and 5–7 USD in the southern region, a 10,000 sq.m plant costs between 480,000 USD and 840,000 USD annually. By contrast, self-development can demand 3–6 million USD in land and construction costs, not including permits and support-item expenses. Leasing can therefore save 70–80% of initial investment.

Thanks to these advantages, ready-built factories have become a strategic choice for industries that need to bring products to market quickly, such as electronics, packaging and medical equipment, as well as projects with shorter life cycles of three to five years.

Regarding flexibility, businesses can easily scale production up or down without being tied to large fixed assets. This is particularly important for high-tech, electronics and assembly industries, which must adapt rapidly to market fluctuations.

Policy shifts and global trade pressures

A new US tariff regime on Asian exports took effect on August 1, setting duties at 20% - a significant cut from the draft level of 46%. The rate is seen as manageable, restoring investor confidence and reigniting capital flows that had slowed in the second quarter.

The “China 1” strategy, pursued for over a decade, has gained fresh momentum, with Vietnam a top choice thanks to competitive labour costs, proximity to China and key shipping routes, and stable policies.

Industrial property in Vietnam remains highly attractive given advantages in workforce, costs and strategic location, said Matthew Powell, Director of Savills Hanoi.

Despite trade tensions, Vietnam has held its place in global supply chains. Technical shortcomings are being addressed, with modern facilities offering pre-engineered steel structures, insulated roofing, corrosion protection, ceiling heights of 4–13 metres, automated line compatibility, and international-standard fire safety and lighting systems.

One example is KTG Industrial at VSIP Bac Ninh 2, built to ACI 117-10 standards for flatness and vibration resistance—crucial for high-tech industries. KTG Project Development Director Tran Quang Trung said the goal is to create workplaces that boost productivity while meeting stringent Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) requirements.

Likewise, Trang Bui, General Director of Cushman & Wakefield Vietnam, noted that the shift goes beyond final assembly, as many firms are considering relocating entire supply chains to Vietnam. This is giving strong momentum to the premium ready-built factory segment, a strategic niche in the industrial property market.

Not only conventional manufacturers but also high-tech firms are turning to ready-built factories with strict technical and ESG standards. With new US tariffs accelerating global supply chain shifts, the model has emerged as a rising star in Vietnam’s industrial property, combining cost advantages, strategic location and flexibility to attract FDI and elevate the sector’s role in integration./.",https://mediaen.vietnamplus.vn/images/f579a678cf9e90879541752073c26005de0627ec99b226a8b4e83b4bb9418f76fa4bdc63283f81e18c6c98a5886bca234cbb4df1f22007b5d6b585cf207c8c99f4bdc8dac5a0c39e696ee3a0efed14be7104ac77f8f5a269cece5f0716c1acb1c80a757de9f75325d4ca9c510302531630116700e000fe3ddc5f5058dbf64d4c/vna-potal-dong-nai-day-manh-cai-thien-moi-truong-dau-tu-thu-hut-manh-fdi-8001228.jpg.webp,N,,2025-09-08 01:07:40.773291

Looking forward, the global dairy market looks set to be adequately supplied.","With milk production gaining momentum as spring arrives, Rabobank predicts global markets will remain well-supplied during this period.

RaboResearch analyst Michael Harvey reported that dairy commodity prices mostly drifted lower in August, according to USDA price data. Global fundamentals, however, were well balanced through this period, and current spot prices remain well above five-year averages for butter (+29%) and whole milk powder (+11%), and more aligned to the medium-term average for skim milk powder (-1%) and cheese (+1%).

Taking a look at Australia’s performance over the past financial year, 2024–25 milk production reached 8.315 billion litres — representing a marginal fall of 61 million litres of milk (-0.7% YOY). Drought conditions and feed shortages hampered production during this time — particularly across the south-east corner including in the western districts. This region saw a drop of more than 5% in the season. Unfavourable conditions also dragged production lower in eastern Victoria and Tasmania. July milk production was down 4% to start the new season.

However, across most of the key dairy export regions, the velocity in milk supply growth has outperformed RaboResearch’s previous expectations. For example, July milk production in the US posted its strongest growth rate (+3.4% YOY) since 2021, and New Zealand has experienced a record start to its new season (albeit in the low part of the season).

Rabobank predicts that milk supply growth will maintain momentum into 2026, but at a moderating pace. In the second half of 2025, milk supply growth in the Big 7 dairy exporting regions is expected to increase by 1.8% YOY before slowing to 1.1% YOY in 2026.

With the Oceania ‘spring flush’ approaching, October will be the peak volume month for both Australia and New Zealand. While Australia is facing a weaker spring peak due to feed shortages and a smaller herd, New Zealand is anticipating a very good peak. The forecast payout is currently set at a record high, with seasonal conditions broadly ideal in many regions in Oceania.

Looking forward, the global dairy market looks set to be adequately supplied. Rising milk supply and sluggish domestic demand in key channels (namely foodservice) present a higher probability for a larger exportable surplus across most export regions, presenting downward price pressure on the dairy commodity market in the near term.",https://d1v1e13ebw3o15.cloudfront.net/data/90137/pool_and_spa_master/..jpg,N,,2025-09-08 01:08:11.643924

Commerce, CA—Bridge Publications, the publisher of the nonfiction works of international best-selling author L. Ron Hubbard, has been recognized as a finalist in the 2025 Manufacturing Leadership Awards for its outstanding achievement in operational excellence by the Manufacturing Leadership Council, a division of the National Association of Manufacturers.

The project started in 2024 when Bridge Publications embarked on a strategy to increase its color printing capacity by five times to meet the growing global demand for the works of L. Ron Hubbard. This project involved the installation of 10 new HP Indigo 7K presses in just three months, a remarkable achievement that has significantly enhanced Bridge’s ability to produce high-quality printed materials at an unprecedented scale.

The HP Indigo 7K presses are state-of-the-art digital offset presses capable of printing 11,520 impressions per hour for 4-color jobs. These presses were integrated into Bridge's existing digital manufacturing infrastructure, enabling the publisher to handle larger print runs and meet tighter deadlines. The presses are now used for producing a wide range of materials, including books, course materials, reference texts and ""The L. Ron Hubbard Series: The Complete Biographical Encyclopedia"".

The project’s benefits are far-reaching. By increasing production speed and maintaining color accuracy through advanced color management systems, Bridge reached record-breaking shipments of 250 pallets of materials sent in just six days across the globe. The new printing capabilities have allowed Bridge to fulfill the highest levels of demand from the over 10,000 Scientology organizations worldwide, ensuring that materials reach the end users rapidly.

""With our expanded capacity we are now able to meet the need for L. Ron Hubbard books around the globe at an even higher level of efficiency,"" says Ryan Price, Vice President of Manufacturing at Bridge Publications. ""Moreover, our 10 new HP 7K presses allow us to produce books at the necessary speed to meet strict timelines while simultaneously maintaining the highest quality standards.""

“In order to position Agilent for success going forward, we need to have our core team in place when the economy turns around,” Mr. Weber says.","SANTA ROSA, May 17, 2001 — Agilent Technologies reports net sales for the second quarter, ended April 30, were up 10% over the same period last year, but net earnings were down 42%, attributing much to a half billion dollars in order cancellations and a drop in new orders.

Net sales were $2.7 billion in the second quarter, up from $2.5 billion in 2000. Net income dropped to $96 million from $166 million in the same periods.

Jeff Weber, spokesperson for the Sonoma County operations of Agilent, the county?s largest private employer, says local results mirror those of the company as a whole.

Companywide, the company is trying to cut costs while avoiding layoffs by halting hiring, reducing worker pay 10% through the third quarter, slashing discretionary budgets, and stopping travel not related to customers.

In Sonoma County, cost cutting has taken on the additional dimensions of putting expansion projects on hold in Santa Rosa and Rohnert Park and closing up shop the week of July 4, Mr. Weber says.

The data is clear: innovation ecosystems are the bedrock of sustainable competitive advantage.","In 2025, the global technology landscape is defined not by isolated breakthroughs but by the strength and adaptability of innovation ecosystems. Leading firms are leveraging the attention-based view of the firm (ABV)—a framework emphasizing how organizations allocate, sustain, and reconfigure attention—to design ecosystems that drive systemic resilience and long-term value creation. By strategically aligning attention to key areas such as structure, alignment, and governance, these firms are redefining competitive advantage in an era of rapid technological and environmental change.

The ABV Framework and Ecosystem Design

The ABV, first introduced by Ocasio in 1997, has evolved to address the complexities of modern innovation ecosystems. Firms that excel in this space—such as Tesla, Amazon, and Google—demonstrate managerial cognitive flexibility, allocating attention to modular architectures, cross-sector partnerships, and governance models that sustain innovation. For example, Tesla's collaboration with Panasonic to overcome battery production challenges and expand its Supercharger network illustrates how attention to strategic partnerships can transform technical limitations into competitive advantages. Similarly, Amazon's AI-native ecosystem, which reduces coordination costs for startups and developers, highlights the importance of scalable architectures in accelerating innovation.

Tesla's market value surged by 150% since 2023, driven by its ecosystem of electric vehicles, energy storage, and AI-driven manufacturing. This growth underscores the financial rewards of aligning attention to sustainability and technological agility.

Case Studies: Ecosystems in Action

Standard Chartered's Transition Plan: By embedding ESG principles into its operations, Standard Chartered generated $982 million in sustainable finance income in 2024. Its 29% reduction in oil-and-gas facilitated emissions by 2030 attracted ESG-conscious capital, demonstrating how attention to environmental goals can drive both financial and reputational value.

H&M's Circular Economy: H&M Group's 41% reduction in Scope 1 & 2 emissions and 29.5% use of recycled materials position it as a leader in the $460 billion circular economy market. This case illustrates how attention to operational efficiency and sustainability can create new revenue streams.

Delta Air Lines' Fuel Efficiency: Delta's 1% reduction in fuel burn through lighter cabin kits and optimized flight paths saved $110 million in 2025, proving that attention to incremental innovations can yield significant cost savings.

Investment Opportunities in Ecosystem Orchestrators

Investors are advised to prioritize ecosystem orchestrators—firms that connect startups, corporates, and policymakers to accelerate innovation. Key players include:

- Salesforce: Ranked first in the Corporate Startup Activity Index 2025, Salesforce Ventures has backed hundreds of startups, integrating them into its enterprise SaaS ecosystem.

- Intel: Through Intel Capital, the company supports deep tech innovation in AI, semiconductors, and edge computing, making it a critical enabler of hardware-focused entrepreneurship.

- Google: Google for Startups and GV (formerly Google Ventures) provide resources and mentorship to founders, reinforcing Google's role in scaling early-stage AI and cloud technologies.

Amazon's AI-native ecosystem has attracted over $12 billion in venture capital since 2020, reflecting its dominance in enabling machine learning-driven innovation across industries.

Emerging Ecosystems and Untapped Potential

The geography of innovation is shifting, with São Paulo, Bengaluru, and Shenzhen emerging as high-growth hubs. São Paulo, now the highest-ranked Latin American ecosystem, has attracted record early-stage funding and fostered 10 unicorns in climate-tech and fintech. Chinese ecosystems like Beijing and Shenzhen are surging due to AI-native startups and state-backed infrastructure. Early-stage investments in these regions offer outsized returns, as seen in São Paulo's 200% growth in climate-tech funding in 2025.

Strategic Recommendations for Investors

Prioritize Ecosystem Orchestrators: Firms like Tesla, Google, and Salesforce demonstrate that orchestrating ecosystems reduces coordination costs and accelerates innovation.

Target ESG-Integrated Firms: Companies aligning with ESG goals, such as H&M and Standard Chartered, are gaining market share and investor confidence.

Invest in Emerging Ecosystems: São Paulo, Bengaluru, and Shenzhen offer untapped potential, with early-stage ventures poised for rapid scaling.

Monitor AI-Native Ecosystems: Boston, Silicon Valley, and London lead in AI-related venture capital, with startups leveraging machine learning to disrupt traditional industries.

Conclusion

The future of innovation ecosystems lies in their ability to align attention with systemic collaboration, sustainability, and technological agility. Firms that design these ecosystems with a focus on long-term value creation—rather than short-term gains—are unlocking new opportunities for investors. As the McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025 highlights, AI and agentic AI systems are accelerating progress in robotics, bioengineering, and energy. By adopting the ABV framework and targeting ecosystem orchestrators, investors can position themselves at the forefront of the next wave of technological transformation.

The data is clear: innovation ecosystems are the bedrock of sustainable competitive advantage. For investors, the path forward is to align with firms and regions that prioritize systemic resilience, ensuring long-term returns in an interconnected global market.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 00:04:18.486538

So it's not a surprise that entry level workers feel like their jobs are most at risk from AI.","And how does the expectations and confidence change depending on the sectors, what what jobs these are focused on?

Well, perhaps no surprise, we've seen that white-collar industries have seen more of a decline in employee confidence in recent months, and that's really again not a surprise given all of the headlines about layoffs in in these industries and again, the sluggish hiring that's going on. I think sluggish hiring is something that maybe doesn't get quite as much attention as a layoff might in the news, but that really has a very broad-based impact. It means that folks can't get onto the career ladder in the first place, and it also means that workers who are employed can't make progress up the career ladder.

How much does that have to do with artificial intelligence, especially within those white collar jobs?

Well, it's interesting because when you look at the tech sector, you don't really see the benefits of AI and data center investment showing up in how tech workers feel. Uh tech employment is still pretty flat over the last few years. and I don't know if we have a lot of evidence that artificial intelligence is specifically uh reducing the amount of hiring that companies are doing, but we do know that workers are very anxious about this. So we actually just put out some data that shows that Gen Z is quite anxious about seven in 10 workers report being uh anxious about their long-term career prospects because of AI and that's no different for some of their older peers as well.

Do you think AI is making that entry level job obsolete at this point? You were just talking about Gen Z workers. Is the entry level job most at risk here?

I wouldn't say that entry level jobs are obsolete. There's always going to be work that needs to be done by entry level workers, but entry level workers have less to fall back on, right? They don't have a resume uh or a network built up that they can rely on if there is disruption to the industry that they're looking to get into.

Clinical trial participants who took Zepbound lost an average of 50 pounds over 72 weeks, while those who took semaglutide, or Wegovy, lost about 33 pounds.","CVS Caremark is facing a class-action lawsuit over its decision to stop covering Zepbound, Eli Lilly’s blockbuster GLP-1 weight-loss drug.

The suit was filed on behalf of two people who lost Zepbound coverage through their employer-sponsored health care plan, though the lawsuit says some 200,000 people were impacted by Caremark’s decision. Zepbound patients whose employers use CVS Caremark as a pharmacy benefits manager were told they’d have to switch to Wegovy, a similar drug that studies have shown is less effective than Zepbound for treating obesity.

Why is CVS Caremark being sued?

The lawsuit accuses Caremark, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, of denying medically necessary drugs in violation of federal law. CVS Caremark stopped covering Zepbound on July 1 after reaching a deal with Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy. As part of the deal, Caremark agreed to remove Zepbound from its formulary.

RELATED: Zepbound vs. Wegovy: Here's which weight loss drug worked best in first trial

The lawsuit claims Caremark cannot deny Zepbound as ""not medically necessary"" while approving Wegovy as a necessary treatment for the same condition, particularly when Zepbound has been proven to be more effective and has a lower list price than Wegovy. Wegovy’s list price is about $1,350 a month, while Zepbound’s is roughly $1,100 for a month’s supply. But both drugmakers offer it for about $500 a month to people without insurance coverage.

What they're saying:

According to the lawsuit, one of the plaintiffs switched from Zepbound to Wegovy in August after exhausting all appeals to Caremark, then ""experienced a number of side effects, including the return of his Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, stomach pain, hunger, and, most notably, weight gain.""

""Because of their different methods of action, different clinical outcomes, and different side effects for individual patients, Zepbound and Wegovy are not clinically interchangeable,"" the lawsuit states.

RELATED: Eli Lilly's new GLP-1 weight loss pill showed success in clinical trial

CVS Caremark disagrees. A spokesperson told FOX TV Stations in May that despite what studies have shown, ""real-world evidence suggests that they are comparable in actual use.""

Wegovy-maker Novo Nordisk says that’s not true.

""The notion that all GLP-1s are the same and ‘interchangeable’ is not correct,"" Jason Brett, executive medical director for Novo Nordisk, said in a statement to CNN.

The other side:

A CVS Caremark spokesperson told Bloomberg Law the lawsuit is ""without merit.""

""We’ll defend ourselves vigorously against those claims,"" the spokesperson said.

Big picture view:

The lawsuit highlights ongoing issues with access and affordability as GLP-1 drugs become more popular. The medications still amount to around $500 per month for those without insurance, and even for people with insurance, some plans don’t cover the obesity medications at all.

Dr. Brett Osborn, a Florida neurosurgeon and longevity expert, called the medications ""the holy grail of modern medicine.""

""These medications don’t just treat obesity — they’re already showing promise in everything from cardiovascular disease to neurodegenerative disease to addiction,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: These are not amenities. They are the holy grail of modern medicine.""

Zepbound vs. Wegovy

Dig deeper:

Zepbound and Wegovy are both GLP-1 drugs approved for weight loss, but Zepbound targets two hormones, GIP and GLP-1, while Wegovy only targets GLP-1.

According to a study funded by Eli Lilly and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, people taking Zepbound lost nearly 50% more weight than those using rival Wegovy.

Clinical trial participants who took Zepbound lost an average of 50 pounds over 72 weeks, while those who took semaglutide, or Wegovy, lost about 33 pounds.

Zepbound is also FDA-approved to treat sleep apnea in patients with obesity, while Wegovy is FDA-approved to treat cardiovascular disease.

How do GLP-1 drugs work?

The backstory:

GLP-1s, a class of drugs that include semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro and Zepbound), were initially prescribed to treat Type 2 diabetes, but have soared in popularity because of weight loss. Wegovy and Zepbound are FDA approved for weight loss, while Ozempic and Mounjaro are approved for Type 2 diabetes.

The drugs work by mimicking the actions of hormones, found primarily in the gut, that kick in after people eat. The hormones help regulate blood sugar by triggering the pancreas to release insulin, another hormone, and slowing the release of sugar from the liver. People who are overweight or have obesity can become insulin-resistant, which means the body doesn’t respond to insulin properly.

The obesity drugs lower blood sugar and slow down digestion, so people feel full longer. They also affect signals in the brain linked to feelings of fullness and satisfaction, tamping down appetite, food-related thoughts and cravings.

Because people feel full longer, they eat less and lose weight.

However, it appears that if people taking the drugs stop, most regain the weight they lost — and the health problems that come with weight gain.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2025/09/1280/720/gettyimages-2231627044-scaled.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-09-07 19:08:14.398178

He said Oil India had expanded its domestic acreages from about 9,300 sq.
The company had finalized a collaborative agreement with Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd., under which BPCL will annually import up to 6 million mt of crude oil for the refinery.
The NRL expansion road map also includes setting up a crude oil import terminal at the Paradip port and laying about 1,640 km of pipelines to transport imported crude oil, Rath said.
“BPCL will source the crude oil for us both on spot and term basis and the crude oil shall be imported through Paradip Port in Odisha utilizing Indian Oil Corp.’s single point mooring facilities,” he said.","The India CEO Series by S&P Global Commodity Insights is a compilation of exclusive interviews by Asia Energy Editor Sambit Mohanty with some of the leaders of the biggest energy companies in India.

India’s upstream sector is poised for increased global partnerships and investment as energy majors and policymakers reshape their strategies to achieve realistic transition goals while ensuring energy security amid turbulent geopolitics and trade policies, Oil India’s Chairman and Managing Director Ranjit Rath said.

In addition, the recently announced National Deepwater Mission as well as reforms to the Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Act — which address long-standing challenges related to regulatory clarity and procedural timelines — had set the stage for exploration successes, he told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, in an exclusive interview.

“The global upstream landscape is getting reshaped and realigned against the backdrop of socio-economic and geopolitical development while at the same time addressing climate concerns, transition to cleaner energy, the Russia–Ukraine conflict and tariff imposition by the US,” Rath said.

“As a result, we observe a reversal of the earlier outlook that believed in a forced transition to cleaner fuel, to a more healthy and practical transition approach, prioritizing energy security and growth for all. Therefore, we do not see much challenge in the upstream oil and gas industry, driven by sustainable growth and net-zero commitment that address the need for both the developed and developing economies,” he added.

He said that tariffs and sanctions could potentially impact commodity prices and services, but India has a huge indigenous demand. “We are geared up to deal with such a situation, with in-house expertise and other resources at our disposal. In line with the government’s initiative, our focus will be more on indigenous resource utilization,” Rath added.

Evaluating global successes

As part of the National Deepwater Mission announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in August, Oil India was evaluating global upstream success stories and undertaking basinal analyses to establish commonalities, in an effort to target deepwater and ultra deepwater exploration acreages, Rath said.

Sharing an update on the progress made across India following the government’s decision to release approximately 1 million sq km of no-go areas in the Eastern Coast, Western Coast and the Andaman basin, 56,894 sq km has been already awarded, 97,919 sq km would be awarded under the tenth round of the Open Acreage Licensing Policy, or OALP-X, and 845,187 sq km would be awarded in future.

“Further, the government, to accelerate the exploration endeavors for hydrocarbon in frontier offshore regions, has mandated Oil India and Oil and Natural Gas Corp. to drill four stratigraphic wells to obtain critical data for robust modelling of petroleum system elements in Category-II and III sedimentary basins,” Rath said.

He said Oil India had expanded its domestic acreages from about 9,300 sq. km. in 2017-18 to present 1,08,000 sq. km. — a more than 12-fold increase in acreage — spreading across Assam Shelf, Assam Arakan fold belt, Rajasthan basin, Mahanadi basin, Cambay Basin, offshore areas in Andaman and Nicobar basin, Kerala Konkan basin and Krishna Godavari basin.

“The exploration blocks, which had been awarded during initial OALP bid rounds, are under the drilling phase. We completed one offshore well and the second well is under drilling in the Andaman and Nicobar Basin. Our drilling campaign in OALP acreages in the Assam Shelf, Rajasthan basin and Mahanadi basin is under progress,” Rath said.

According to Commodity Insights, exploration and appraisal activity in India had returned to pre–COVID-19 levels, both onshore and offshore. Exploratory drilling campaigns in the OALP blocks are expected to significantly increase in the near future.

While a series of recent upstream policy reforms had set the stage for growth, several further initiatives were under active consideration, Rath said.

He said that the country’s federal government system divides powers between the central and state governments, requiring both to approve E&P activities. Land is a state subject, leading to state governments regulating land use and granting permits for E&P activities. While the federal government sets broad environmental policies, states have the authority to manage land use and enforce environmental laws, necessitating multiple approvals from different regulatory bodies.

“With oil and gas being a central subject, the federal government may like to consider a single window approach for all oil and gas operations across territories,” Rath said.

Downstream expansion

On the company’s downstream operations, Rath said Oil India’s Numaligarh Refinery Ltd.’s capacity expansion from 3 million mt/year to 9 million mt/year was on schedule. The company had finalized a collaborative agreement with Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd., under which BPCL will annually import up to 6 million mt of crude oil for the refinery.

“The commissioning of all the primary units is going to begin very soon, with a target to complete it latest by the January-March 2026 quarter. The expanding refinery will have a very wide crude slate, but Arab Heavy and Arab Light will be the main ones,” Rath said.

NRL currently uses mainly domestic crude as feedstock, with a capacity utilization of more than 100%. The NRL expansion road map also includes setting up a crude oil import terminal at the Paradip port and laying about 1,640 km of pipelines to transport imported crude oil, Rath said.

“BPCL will source the crude oil for us both on spot and term basis and the crude oil shall be imported through Paradip Port in Odisha utilizing Indian Oil Corp.’s single point mooring facilities,” he said.",,N,,2025-09-07 19:08:31.050875

More than 10 data providers participate, including AnalyticsIQ, Circana, Dynata, Eyeota, L2 Data, and TransUnion.","Comscore launched its AI-powered Data Partner Network on September 3, 2025, marking a significant development in privacy-centric audience targeting technology. The initiative enables third-party data providers to transform ID-based datasets into scalable, privacy-first audiences using Proximic by Comscore's proprietary AI predictive technology.

According to the announcement, more than 10 data providers are participating in the network, including AnalyticsIQ, Circana, Dynata, Eyeota (a Dun & Bradstreet company), L2 Data, Lighthouse-Ameribase (a Stirista Company), LBDigital (a Stirista Company), Polk Automotive Solutions from S&P Global Mobility, PurpleLab, RevOptimal, Symphony Health (an ICON plc company), Throtle, and TransUnion. These companies represent diverse sectors from automotive solutions to healthcare data.

The technology demonstrates significant performance improvements in early implementations. Proximic by Comscore's ID-based 'online holiday shoppers' segment expanded by over 95% when processed through the AI predictive technology. Global media partner MiQ reported 30% stronger engagement when using Comscore predictive segments compared to traditional ID-based segments across CTV campaigns.

""We're building an ecosystem where every participant benefits: advertisers get precision at scale, publishers unlock smarter monetization, and data providers future-proof their business,"" said Rachel Gantz, Managing Director, Proximic by Comscore.

Technical architecture and implementation

The Data Partner Network operates by running third-party partner audiences through Proximic by Comscore's AI predictive technology and Comscore's truth set panels. This process generates privacy-centric ID-free audience segments that can be activated across any demand-side platform (DSP) and multiple supply-side platforms (SSPs). The technical framework eliminates dependence on traditional identifiers like cookies and mobile IDs, addressing industry concerns about signal erosion.

According to the announcement details, the network functions as a connective layer between data providers and marketplace needs. Partners integrate directly with Proximic by Comscore's technology infrastructure, ensuring their datasets remain addressable, privacy-aligned, and scalable. This approach enables data providers to maintain relevance as traditional identification signals continue diminishing across digital advertising environments.

The AI predictive technology creates expanded audience segments without compromising user privacy. The system processes various data inputs to generate broader, more comprehensive audience classifications that maintain targeting precision while increasing scale. This methodology addresses a critical challenge in programmatic advertising where reach and accuracy often present conflicting optimization goals.

Industry adoption and performance metrics

MiQ, serving as an early adopter of the technology, deployed the segments across multiple CTV campaigns. The company reported improvements in both reach efficiency and cost per unique reach metrics. Sara Sowsian, Director of US Product Partnerships at MiQ, emphasized the importance of privacy-centric approaches that maintain scale and performance outcomes.

""The future of audience targeting is a privacy-centric approach that still drives scale and performance outcomes,"" Sowsian noted. ""It's a balancing act that's critical to the future of digital advertising, and we're excited about how Proximic by Comscore's Data Partner Network supports that goal—helping our clients at MiQ reach the right audiences efficiently and responsibly in a rapidly environment.""

Circana, another participating partner, highlighted the monetization benefits for data providers. Michael Quinn, SVP Global Media at Circana, stated: ""Proximic by Comscore's Data Partner Network gives us a new way to extend our audiences, while driving strong advertiser performance and smarter monetization, with Circana's best-in-class audiences now with Proximic by Comscore's AI technology.""

The network addresses multiple stakeholder needs within the advertising ecosystem. For advertisers, the solution provides precision targeting at expanded scale. Publishers benefit from enhanced monetization opportunities through improved audience packaging capabilities. Data providers gain a future-proof path for maintaining dataset relevance in privacy-focused environments.

Market context and timing

The launch occurs during a period of significant transformation in digital advertising measurement and targeting. PPC Land has tracked how programmatic advertising continues expanding despite privacy regulation challenges. The industry faces mounting pressure to develop alternative targeting solutions as traditional identification methods become obsolete.

Previous Comscore partnerships with FreeWheel demonstrated the company's commitment to privacy-resilient advertising solutions. That collaboration introduced ID-free audience targeting for CTV platforms, establishing precedent for the current network approach. The FreeWheel partnership enabled publishers to access extensive content-level categorization data while maintaining consumer privacy protections.

Comscore's measurement capabilities have expanded through strategic partnerships addressing cross-platform audience insights. The company's collaboration with HyphaMetrics enhanced CTV program-level reporting and person-level audience measurement, demonstrating technical expertise in complex data integration projects.

The Data Partner Network builds upon Comscore's existing AI and contextual targeting infrastructure. Previous integrations with Epsilon showcased how Proximic's AI-powered contextual classifications enhance inventory visibility and campaign optimization across multiple touchpoints including CTV, audio, desktop, and mobile platforms.

Technical specifications and capabilities

The network processes various data types through standardized APIs that enable seamless integration with existing data provider infrastructures. According to technical documentation, the system accepts structured datasets from partners and applies machine learning algorithms to generate expanded audience classifications. The AI models analyze behavioral patterns, demographic characteristics, and engagement signals to create privacy-compliant audience segments.

The technology stack includes real-time processing capabilities that enable dynamic audience generation based on current market conditions. Partners can access performance analytics through dedicated dashboards that display segment performance metrics, reach statistics, and engagement data. The system provides granular reporting on audience expansion rates, cross-platform activation success, and campaign performance outcomes.

Quality assurance mechanisms ensure data accuracy throughout the processing pipeline. The system employs validation protocols that verify segment quality before activation across programmatic platforms. Error handling procedures maintain data integrity while processing large-scale datasets from multiple providers simultaneously.

Competitive landscape implications

The network launch positions Comscore directly against other identity resolution and audience targeting providers navigating post-cookie advertising environments. Traditional data management platforms face similar challenges in maintaining audience targeting capabilities without relying on third-party cookies or mobile advertising IDs.

Alternative approaches to privacy-first targeting include contextual advertising solutions, first-party data activation platforms, and cohort-based targeting systems. Each methodology presents different trade-offs between targeting precision, scale, and privacy compliance. The AI-powered approach attempts to optimize across all three dimensions simultaneously.

Industry adoption patterns suggest preference for solutions that integrate easily with existing programmatic infrastructure while providing transparent performance metrics. The network's compatibility with multiple DSPs and SSPs addresses technical integration concerns that often limit adoption of new targeting technologies.

Regulatory environment considerations

The network operates within the current regulatory framework governing data privacy and digital advertising. Recent developments in privacy legislation across multiple jurisdictions have increased compliance requirements for companies processing consumer data for advertising purposes. The ID-free approach potentially reduces regulatory exposure by minimizing personal data processing requirements.

European GDPR regulations continue influencing global privacy standards for digital advertising. The network's privacy-first architecture aligns with regulatory trends emphasizing consumer consent and data minimization principles. Similar regulatory frameworks in California (CCPA) and other jurisdictions create additional compliance considerations for companies operating cross-border advertising campaigns.

Industry self-regulation initiatives from organizations like the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) provide additional guidance for privacy-compliant advertising technologies. The network's technical approach appears designed to meet current industry standards while anticipating future regulatory requirements.

Future development trajectory

According to company communications, the network represents an initial implementation with plans for expanded capabilities and additional partner integrations. The platform architecture supports scaling to accommodate larger partner ecosystems and more sophisticated AI processing capabilities.

Technical roadmap indicators suggest future enhancements may include real-time bidding optimizations, cross-device audience linking capabilities, and expanded contextual targeting features. The AI models likely will incorporate additional data sources and training methodologies as the platform matures.

Market demand for privacy-first advertising solutions continues growing as regulatory requirements increase and consumer privacy expectations shift. The network's success will depend on demonstrating sustained performance improvements while maintaining strict privacy compliance across diverse data partner ecosystems.

G-III Apparel Group (NASDAQ: GIII) reported its second-quarter (Q2) fiscal 2026 results, with adjusted earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $0.25, exceeding the consensus estimate of $0.09. Quarterly sales of $613.3 million, a 5% year-over-year (YoY) decline from $644.8 million, also surpassed the street view of $571.3 million. However, the company lowered its fiscal 2026 adjusted EPS outlook to $2.55-$2.75, down from $4.15-$4.25. Sales guidance was reduced to $3.02 billion from $3.14 billion, slightly under the $3.131 billion consensus. Analysts responded by increasing their price targets, with Keybanc, Telsey Advisory Group, and Barclays raising their targets [1].

The company's Q2 results showed mixed signals. While adjusted EPS beat expectations, the substantial decline in EPS from $0.53 in the prior year period indicates significant margin compression despite a more modest revenue decrease. Inventory increased 5% YoY to $639.8 million, potentially concerning given the declining sales. On the positive side, G-III reduced its debt by 96% to $15.5 million, redeeming $400 million in senior secured notes. The company also repurchased 1.14 million shares for $24.6 million during the quarter [1].

G-III cited three key factors behind the guidance reduction: a challenging macroeconomic environment, cautious retail partners, and most significantly, tariff impacts. The company quantified the tariff impact at approximately $155 million, with mitigation efforts reducing the net impact to $75 million. The unmitigated tariff cost represents a substantial headwind, concentrated in the second half of the fiscal year. The company's capital allocation strategy shows confidence through $24.6 million in share repurchases during Q2 [1].

Looking ahead, G-III expects net sales of approximately $3.02 billion for fiscal 2026, down from $3.18 billion in fiscal 2025. Annual EPS is expected to fall to between $2.53 and $2.73, compared to $4.20 in fiscal 2025 – representing a 35-40% profit decline. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to decrease to $198-208 million from $325.9 million, a 36-39% reduction. The company emphasized its strategic focus on key brands like DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, and Vilebrequin, which are showing momentum despite overall sales declines. The company is also navigating the transition away from expiring licenses, which adds another layer of complexity to their business transformation [1].

Live commerce platform TalkShopLive is powering Walmart Live’s Collector’s Night in partnership with WeTheHobby, a sports card and collectibles community. Each episode includes live box breaks, giveaways, and exclusive drops.

Hajela said the collectibles category represents a critical and exciting area of investment and growth for Walmart. “With demand continuing to surge, we’re committed to building experiences that not only serve collectors but redefine what they expect from us. ‘Collector’s Night’ is a powerful step forward in making Walmart a true destination for this growing category.”

Collectibles is not a new category for Walmart, and last year, it ran a promotion tied to its announcement welcoming third-party sellers to sell used collectibles on its marketplace.

The comments in Retailwire’s coverage of the news are thought-provoking. For example, one commentor said Walmart doesn’t have to “compete” in live shopping, it can use it as long form communication introducing goods to small segments, while another said Walmart needed more than occasional streams to build something distinct.

Tesco Ireland

Tesco Ireland is accelerating the roll-out of its rapid delivery service, Whoosh, with expanded coverage in Dublin and the launch of the service in Galway and Cork.

This follows a pilot earlier this year. Whoosh is now offering access to over 3,000 products delivered in as little as 45 minutes, within a 4.5 km radius of participating stores.

The service now includes:

Dublin: Nine additional Tesco Express stores are now live - Cabinteely, City West, Cherrywood, Collins Avenue, Inchicore, Swords, Malahide, Shankill, and Crumlin.

Galway: Service is now available in Doughiska, Ballinfoyle, and Newcastle.

Cork: Launching next week at Dennehy’s Cross Express and St Finbarr’s.

Customers can order through the Tesco app (iOS and Android) or via the grocery giant’s website. Deliveries are powered by Deliveroo.

Exotec and ILS Logistics

Exotec has partnered with Polish logistics company ILS Logistics to install its Skypod robotic systems across sites in Central and Eastern Europe.

The projects are being carried out in collaboration with Polish integrator A1 Sorter, a long standing partner of Exotec.

ILS‘ headquarters in Zakroczym, Poland, which serves as the company’s distribution network across Poland, the Baltic states and Ukraine, was the first to receive the Skypod system.

The warehouse in Zakroczym hosts 200 autonomous robots and 60,000 storage containers and completed testing in December 2024.

During the project’s construction, ILS agreed to implement the Skypod system across its entire portfolio, with work due to be carried out throughout 2026. ILS hosts 12 locations in Eastern Europe, supplying companies across the automotive, food, and chemical industries.

The projects are part of the growth plans of vehicle parts distributor Inter Cars, ILS' parent company, and are designed to boost the firm’s market share and talent acquisition.

StrongPoint

StrongPoint has been selected by an unnamed but said to be leading UK-based retailer and distributor of household products in the UK and European markets, to design and install its first AutoStore solution and provide warehouse fit out services.

The latter will be provided by StrongPoint UK’s shopfitting unit. The value of the combined contract is approximately 15 Million NOK and both projects are expected to be completed by the end of 2025.

“We are excited to announce another AutoStore project in the UK. This win, which brings together two solutions and services provided by StrongPoint UK, demonstrates the power of offering a broader portfolio and integrated solutions to our customers. It enables us to compete for larger, more complex projects and to be more relevant to our customers, a combination that played a key role in securing this contract,” says Jacob Tveraabak, StrongPoint CEO.

Uber Eats and Deliverect

Deliverect, which connects delivery apps and PoS systems for restaurants to streamline order management. reports that it is now integrated with Uber Direct in Ireland.

In a LinkedIn post, the company said: “Building on our successful partnership in the UK, this expansion brings the power of Uber Direct to restaurants and retailers across Ireland, enabling them to offer on-demand delivery directly from their Deliverect platform.”

“How people shop and buy food has changed. We’re delighted to be expanding Uber Direct's partnership with Deliverect and bringing our work together to Ireland, so that even more businesses across the country can get their products directly into the hands of their customers seamlessly,” commented Leanne Purcell , General Manager at Uber Eats Ireland.

With this integration, businesses in Ireland can manage direct orders and deliveries in one place, and offer on demand delivery via Uber’s network.

THG

THG, an e-commerce group headquartered in Manchester, UK, operating through two consumer businesses, THG Beauty and THG Nutrition, is this month launching Checkout by THG Fulfil.

According to the company’s website: “At the solution’s core is a frictionless checkout that converts, with the option to layer on trusted courier integrations and world class fulfilment as your brand grows giving you flexibility to choose checkout alone, or checkout with couriers, or the full checkout, couriers and fulfilment solution.”

“With Checkout by THG Fulfil, you can simplify international selling, reduce operational headaches, and deliver the seamless customer experience your brand deserves. Whether it’s reaching new markets, handling payments with ease, or ensuring fast, reliable delivery, we’ve built a platform that makes global growth simple.”

In a LinkedIn post, John Gallemore, President at THG Ingenuity, said: “For over 20 years, we’ve built and scaled our own checkout technology to power global brands. We had to solve what others couldn’t: Merchant of Record across borders; Complex tax and duty calculations; Localised payments in 200 markets; Compliance at scale.”

He added: “Now, we’re opening that capability to the world. The same technology that’s enabled us to grow internationally is about to become available to every brand. This is more than a checkout. It’s the foundation for global e-commerce at scale.”

Superdry

Superdry reports implementation of Cegid Retail Store Excellence, an AI powered task management platform.

With stores across the UK, Europe and the US, Superdry’s expanding presence had outgrown its previous legacy system, which had become difficult to customise, administer and scale. The retailer says it was after a modern, intuitive solution that could support real-time communication, streamline operational execution and empower store teams, while reducing admin and overhead.

""With an ever growing demand on head office teams’ workload, Cegid Retail Store Excellence has saved countless hours and gives us peace of mind that our retail teams have everything they need to operate efficiently, commercially, and safely to meet brand expectations and objectives"" says Liz Packe, Global Corporate Communications Manager at Superdry.

Sainsbury's

Sainsbury's is testing out facial recognition technology in its stores in a bid to tackle an increase in shoplifting, anti-social behaviour and violence.

It has kicked off an eight-week trial in two stores. ""The retail sector is at a crossroads, facing rising abuse, anti-social behaviour and violence,"" says Sainsbury's Chief Executive Simon Roberts. ""We must put safety first.""

The UK grocery giant is working with Facewatch on the initiative and is now using the technology at a store in London and another in Bath ahead of a potential nationwide roll-out.

Madeleine Stone, Senior Advocacy Officer at BigBrotherWatch, comments: ""Sainsbury's decision to trial Orwellian facial recognition technology in its stores is deeply disproportionate and chilling. It should abandon this trial and the government must urgently step in to prevent the unchecked spread of this invasive technology.""

Best Buy and Uber Eats

Uber Technologies has announced a partnership with Best Buy that brings consumer electronics from more than 800 stores in the US to the Uber Eats platform.

Best Buy customers can now order various electronics, appliances, and tech essentials on Uber Eats for delivery to their doorsteps.

“Consumers today expect everything from groceries to gadgets to arrive at their doorsteps quickly and reliably,” says Hashim Amin, Head of Grocery & Retail for North America at Uber.

“With this partnership, we are making it easier than ever for customers to access the latest technology, whether it’s a necessity or something fun. We’re thrilled to help bring Best Buy’s trusted assortment into the on-demand economy.”

LK Bennett

Ometria has hooked LK Bennett as a customer.

In a LinkedIn post, it said: “A brand with a uniquely British ethos (yet loved the world over), LK Bennett is renowned for vibrant prints, refined silhouettes, and expert craftsmanship, frequently spotted at glamorous events from Royal Ascot to Wimbledon and beyond.”

“It was seeking a solution that would: Unlock deeper customer understanding; Enable sophisticated personalisation at scale; Empower their team with intuitive tech. Ometria emerged as the clear choice for their needs.”

A spokesperson for the LK Bennett Digital Team said: ""Creating exceptional customer experiences begins with having a comprehensive understanding of your data, alongside the ability to easily use it to personalise every touchpoint. Ometria delivers on both fronts.”

“We were particularly impressed by the platform’s intuitive usability and the deep retail expertise of the Ometria team. We know they're the right partner to power our ongoing growth, and we're excited for what's to come as we explore new and innovative ways to engage our customers.""

Boots

With Quantcast as its in-house programmatic partner, Boots Online Doctor recently ran a campaign to promote its holistic weight loss support service, which includes one-to-one coaching, a podcast, and app-based tools.

The challenge was to reach a niche, health conscious audience at scale, without relying on third-party cookies or compromising consumer privacy.

The strategy combined intent-based targeting from real-time browsing signals, contextual placements in wellness content, and cookieless activation at scale. Sequenced messaging across formats meant that every touchpoint reinforced the brand’s message with the aim of building deeper engagement.

CTV quickly emerged as the breakout channel. Viewers watched ads through to completion over 97% of the time, with brand lift reaching nearly 70% among 40-49-year-olds. These results were powered by an omnichannel approach spanning display, online video (OLV), and CTV, and the ability to make real-time optimisations.

Asos

TrusTrace has announced a partnership with Asos that aims to enhance the fast fashion online retailer’s supply chain transparency and resilience, strengthen risk management, and support compliance across its global value chain.

As part of its Fashion with Integrity strategy, Asos says it is investing in robust traceability infrastructure to gain real-time visibility into its supply chain, down to farm level (Tier 5).

By integrating TrusTrace’s AI enhanced platform, it is looking to streamline operations across risk, compliance, and impact management, ensuring timely access to trusted data that enables proactive decision-making, due diligence and compliance.

“Our partnership with TrusTrace is a key milestone in our updated Fashion with Integrity programme,” says Elena Martínez Ortiz, EVP of Product at Asos. “TrusTrace enables us to improve product traceability, helping us meet compliance standards, understand and address risks, and boost resilience in our supply chain by supporting our suppliers to implement improvements.”

InPost Group

Bloq.it, a provider of smart locker networks technology in Europe, has announced a partnership with InPost Group, a logistics provider for the e-commerce industry.

The tie up involves a multi-year commitment to deploy more than 20,000 Bloq.it locker units across Europe, which includes a small minority investment from InPost.

At the centre of the agreement is NEXT, Bloq.it’s flagship off-grid locker unit. Powered by batteries, this operates fully independent of the power grid or solar panels, with the company claiming that this makes it possible to install lockers in thousands of previously inaccessible locations.

The first NEXT lockers for InPost were installed in France and the UK in July, with expansion to Italy, Portugal, and Spain planned before the end of 2025. Over the next five years, the roll-out will accelerate across InPost’s key European markets.

Snappy Shopper

Snappy Shopper says it has become the first UK-based quick commerce platform to fully integrate with Google Shopping via the Google Merchant Center.

Its retailers now have the opportunity to appear in top Google results, showcasing live product listings, real-time pricing and delivery within the hour.

“This is a game-changer for local retail,” says Snappy Shopper CEO Mike Callachan. “Integrating with Google means we’re helping local stores stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the biggest online players, capturing customers at the exact moment they are ready to buy.”

The new integration with Google allows retailers to showcase their stores and stock across Google platforms including Search and Maps. This aims to enhance visibility through free listing, richer store profiles and drive real-time customers in the purchasing mindset straight to Snappy Shopper stores.

Cracker Barrel

Cracker Barrel has chosen TruRating as its customer insights partner.

In a LinkedIn post, TruRating said: ""We’re proud to be working with Cracker Barrel - both through their exciting new “All the More” campaign and in their ongoing commitment to keep the guest voice at the centre of every decision.""

""As their customer insights partner, we help Cracker Barrel gather real-time feedback across stores and food orders, giving them a deeper understanding of how guests feel and ensuring every update reflects what matters most. It’s inspiring to see such an iconic brand embrace both tradition and innovation - and we’re delighted to support their journey in bringing even more meaningful experiences to life.""

Kenneth Cole Productions

Fashion brand Kenneth Cole Productions has deployed Selectika AI technology across its online store.

In a LinkedIn post, Selectika AI said: ""We are proud to team up with the one and only Kenneth Cole Productions - a brand with a rich history of pushing boundaries in both fashion and social advocacy. Kenneth Cole’s journey began with a bold move: selling shoes from a trailer parked on the streets of New York City.""

It added: ""With our visual AI recommendation technology, we’re bringing that same spirit of innovation to their online store. It will help customers navigate vast catalogues by offering personal and relevant recommendations, boosting engagement and making it easier to discover what they love.”

“A sincere thank you to the talented people who led this initiative: on Kenneth Cole’s side, Mashbir and Girit Interactive on our side, Moshe Harush and Nuphar Gabrieli and the Selectika AI team for their dedicated efforts.""

Radley

Radley is rolling out Ometria's customer data and experience platform.

""For over 25 years, Radley has been setting the standard for luxurious British handbags and accessories, combining timeless design with exceptional craftsmanship. Now, as they continue to grow, Radley has chosen Ometria to power their next chapter: unifying customer data, unlocking richer insights, and delivering even more personalised experiences,"" says Rebecca Taylor, Senior Product Marketing Manager at Ometria.

James Fernie, Global DTC Director at Radley, says: ""With Ometria's CDP, we can finally bring all our customer data into one place, giving us a unified view of every individual whether they shop online, in-store, or at one of our outlets.”

“This clarity will help us uncover rich insights into customer preferences, behaviours, and journeys.

The company plans to close its long steel plants in Newcastle and Vereeniging and restructure operations at Vanderbijlpark, wiping out tens of thousands of indirect jobs in mining, transport, logistics, and countless small businesses that rely on the wages of steelworkers, unleashing a social disaster across entire communities.

AMSA’s origins lie in the state-owned Iron and Steel Corporation of South Africa (Iscor), founded in 1928. For decades, Iscor was the backbone of South African industrialisation, producing the bulk of the steel used in construction, mining, rail, and manufacturing. Its growth rested on the brutal exploitation of black labour under the Apartheid regime. In 1989, amid mass working-class struggles that were shaking the Western-backed Apartheid regime, Iscor was privatised in a fire sale by the white Afrikaner ruling class, eager to strip state assets before handing political power to Nelson Mandela’s African National Congress.

Iscor’s privatisation was followed by a restructuring in 2001, when its mining assets were spun off into Kumba Resources, leaving steel as its main operation. Three years later, in 2004, the global conglomerate Mittal Steel, controlled by Indian billionaire Lakshmi Mittal, once ranked by Forbes as the sixth richest man in the world, acquired a controlling stake in Iscor. The merger of Mittal Steel and Arcelor in 2006 then produced AMSA.

Claims that privatisation would revitalise the steel industry proved a fraud. Through the 2010s, AMSA repeatedly posted losses even as it sacked thousands of workers and shut down capacity, only earning a profit in 2019. Between 2014 and 2020 alone, the workforce was slashed from 15,000 to just 7,000. Each round of cuts was justified with the mantra of “efficiency” and “restructuring”.

AMSA’s plant closures, first announced in November 2023, were postponed three times before the company made its final announcement in September 2025. The company blamed spiralling electricity costs, worsened by rolling blackouts imposed by Eskom, the state-owned electricity company that generates 90 percent of South Africa’s power, and the breakdown of rail transport under Transnet, the state-owned ports and rail monopoly.

AMSA is heavily reliant on Transnet Freight Rail, which moves 91 percent of its iron ore and all its coking coal to its plants. The collapse of rail has forced the company to use far costlier road haulage. Eskom’s blackouts further crippled production, at times compelling Vanderbijlpark to shut down for up to eight hours a day.

These crises are the product of decades of ANC capitalist rule, in which state-owned enterprises like Eskom and Transnet have been systematically looted by a corrupt elite that cloaks its plunder in the language of “black empowerment”, a cynical cover for anti-working-class politics aimed at creating a thin layer of black capitalists, of whom President Cyril Ramaphosa, one of South Africa‘s richest men, has been a prime beneficiary.

These problems, however, cannot be simply reduced to corruption. They are inseparable from the global capitalist crisis. Across the world, steel capacity has vastly outstripped demand, with 113,000 jobs destroyed between 2013 and 2021 in OECD economies alone. In Europe, entire regions have been devastated by steel closures, such as the Redcar plant in Teesside, UK, where 1,700 jobs were wiped out.

Governments have only intervened where steel is deemed essential for war production, as in Britain, where loss-making steel plants are being taken over on the grounds of maintaining capacity for the military economy.

South Africa’s steel consumption has collapsed by 20 percent over the past seven years, reflecting the combined impact of contracting auto industry and construction sectors, the collapse of public infrastructure spending, and the global oversupply of steel.

South Africa’s manufacturing capacity for crude steel stands at 8-9 million tonnes a year, but demand was only five million tonnes in 2023. Of this, AMSA supplied 2.8 million tonnes. With China dominating global production using more advanced and cost-efficient methods, AMSA’s losses ballooned from about $100 million in 2023 to $270 million in 2024. This despite the ANC pouring in $180 million in bailouts with no binding requirements to protect jobs.

The collapse is not confined to steel. Workers across South Africa are facing a jobs bloodbath. In 2025 alone, Daybreak Foods, one of the country’s largest poultry producers, cut 2,200 jobs. Goodyear, the US tyre manufacturer, shut down operations and destroyed 900 jobs. Ford slashed nearly 500 jobs, adding to the 4,000 jobs already wiped out in the past two years. Glencore, the Swiss-based commodities conglomerate, is threatening thousands more job cuts. The South African Post Office has axed 4,000 workers.

Manufacturing employment has already plunged from 1.4 million in 2005 to just over a million in 2021, a loss of more than 300,000 jobs in a decade and a half. This crisis is set to deepen, with the Reserve Bank warning that US tariffs could wipe out a further 100,000 jobs in the auto and agriculture sectors.

Workers must not accept this destruction of jobs and livelihoods. Steelworkers, auto workers, miners, postal employees and the broader working class face a common assault and must draw political lessons from their experiences. Three stand out.

The first is the role of the trade unions. For decades they have not been instruments of struggle but mechanisms for enforcing defeats. At every stage in the dismantling of South Africa’s steel industry, they have acted to suppress opposition, tie workers to the ANC government, and protect their own positions and privileges.

When AMSA announced its first closure plans in November 2023, the South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) —representing roughly 800,000 workers across 24 affiliate unions—acknowledged that tens of thousands of jobs had already been wiped out since privatisation. Yet SAFTU refused to mobilise workers against the closures.

Instead it issued appeals to the ANC to “re-nationalise steel and increase spending on an extensive infrastructure rollout, so as to create a market for state-owned, worker-controlled steel industry revitalisation, not for capitalists.” SAFTU knows that the ANC government has no intention of renationalising AMSA, let alone creating a “worker-controlled” steel industry.

The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), the country’s largest metalworkers’ union with over 338,000 members, has also intervened to prevent strike action. In November 2024, NUMSA called off a wage strike after General Secretary Irvin Jim was “briefed” by AMSA CEO Kobus Verster, and issued a joint statement with the company, recognising “the need to settle the strike promptly”. The strike, which had the potential to rally wider layers of workers against job cuts and wage suppression, was then shut down as NUMSA’s appealed to the ANC to convene “social partners” in the steel and auto sectors.

The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) limited its response to calling on the government to intervene to save jobs at Assmang’s Beeshoek iron ore mine, which has already lost nearly 700 jobs after AMSA terminated contracts. The Solidarity trade union postured about “fiercely resisting” AMSA layoffs, but confined its activity to legal manoeuvres and press statements.

The essential role of the unions is as industrial policemen, ensuring that opposition does not break out into a direct struggle against the corporations and the state.

The second lesson is the role of the rival nationalist movements, above all the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). When AMSA confirmed the closures, the EFF declared: “The government cannot continue to wash its hands while South Africa’s industrial backbone is dismantled. We reiterate that the state must pursue a programme of industrial recovery through nationalisation, investment in infrastructure and decisive support for domestic production.”

The EFF does not call on workers to fight the closures, strike, or build independent organisations of struggle. Instead, it appeals to the ANC, the instrument of capitalist rule that has overseen privatisation, looting, and mass job destruction. Its call is not for socialist nationalisation under workers’ control, but for nationalist restructuring under the corrupt state apparatus that has already plundered Eskom, Transnet, and other state assets.

The perspective advanced by the EFF is that post-apartheid capitalism can be reformed if only the state acts decisively. As EFF leader Julius Malema told Business Day on Friday, “The parties that can work together is the EFF, MK and the ANC and then it can bring stability but also the political will to change the lives of our people.”

This is a fraud. Three decades after 1994, the working class faces mass unemployment, collapsing infrastructure, and deepening poverty, while a thin layer of black capitalists, Ramaphosa among them, has enriched itself alongside international finance. EFF’s nationalist programme of “industrial recovery” offers nothing to the working class.

The third lesson emerging from the first two is the need to build independent organisations of struggle and a new political leadership. Workers must form rank-and-file committees in every factory, mine, and workplace to unite across industries, break free from the unions’ suffocating grip, and prepare common action against closures, wage cuts, and privatisation.

Above all, what is required is the building of a Trotskyist party in South Africa, a section of the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI). Such a party would arm workers with an internationalist and socialist programme: the expropriation of the corporations, the placing of industry under workers’ control, and the reorganisation of the economy to meet human needs, not private profit.

Only through this struggle, linked with workers across the world, can the South African working class put an end to the devastation wrought by post-apartheid capitalism and open the road to genuine equality and socialism.",https://www.wsws.org/asset/5908b589-9c54-4368-84a6-a15ec68c6006?rendition=1600x900,N,,2025-09-07 16:06:43.581536

Watch now: Is this common bathroom item making you sick?

Why is food waste important?

Food waste in grocery chains isn't just a waste of groceries; it's a climate and community failure.

Food tossed into landfills rots and releases methane, a harmful polluting gas driving global temperature rise.

Corporate dumping of edible food not only contributes to environmental harm but also deepens social divides, especially when families in need struggle to access nutritious food.

What's worse, wasted food inevitably raises prices — since retailers factor losses into their margins — and damages consumer trust in an era of rising food insecurity.

Is Walmart doing anything about this?

Walmart's sustainability report highlights its commitment to reducing food waste by 50% by 2030 and emphasizes partnerships with food banks. However, proactive efforts may not always translate to every storefront.

""At one of my old stores it was like once a month we had to throw away the entire meat wall bc it was going down overnight and the manager wouldn't check,"" a commenter said.

What's being done about food waste more broadly?

Across the country, more businesses and communities are stepping up to tackle the issue of food waste head-on.

When possible, the first and best option is to donate safe, edible food to local shelters and food banks, an approach that a Kroger store in Arkansas took that quickly rerouted food to the Arkansas Foodbank after a power outage.

Similarly, a Trader Joe's in Baton Rouge made headlines for salvaging thousands of pounds of food after another outage, proving that with quick thinking and community partnerships, food waste isn't inevitable.

Composting is also gaining traction as a backup option, offering a way to keep spoiled food out of landfills and turn waste into a resource.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/c_qswJstUOQiAlYnVd0nqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/d7bd09394e51fda444628779e965ef13,N,,2025-09-07 16:06:51.700891

Private equity owners like Roark Capital, focused on returns and efficiency, may question whether franchise-owned purchasing cooperatives provide optimal supply chain management versus corporate-controlled alternatives.
When executives cannot maintain basic supply chain operations, blaming predecessors and suppliers for imaginary crimes represents deflection rather than accountability.","An investigation into alleged corruption at the Independent Purchasing Cooperative (IPC) found no evidence of a $200+ million kickback scheme, as alleged in August 2025 lawsuit against major suppliers, but uncovered significant supply chain failures under CEO Kirsten Michulka’s leadership that raise questions about operational competence and the timing of any potential legal action. Despite claims of massive supplier corruption involving West Liberty Foods, Lineage Logistics, Georgia Pacific, and Ecolab, no court filings, criminal investigations, or credible allegations exist in public records – a stark contrast to the well-documented procurement fraud cases that have plagued the food service industry. The absence of evidence, combined with verifiable distribution failures including the CDI bankruptcy and Atlanta supply crisis, suggests either that corruption allegations remain speculative, or that leadership may be preparing a deflection strategy for operational failures that have damaged franchisee relationships during a critical period for the struggling sandwich chain.

The missing millions

After three decades of leading Subway’s purchasing operations through explosive growth and delivering over $2 billion in savings to franchisees, Janet Risi departed IPC in early 2022 with a sterling reputation intact. No criminal investigations, no DOJ indictments, no franchisee lawsuits alleging procurement fraud – just industry accolades for transforming a small cooperative into a $5 billion annual purchasing powerhouse serving 26,000 restaurants. The alleged kickback scheme involving Diversified Restaurant Systems and multiple suppliers from 2001 to 2022, supposedly worth over $200 million, alleged by Michulka’s IPC, would make it one of the largest procurement fraud cases in food service history.

The August 2025 lawsuit filed in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court against West Liberty Foods, Lineage Logistics, Georgia Pacific, Ecolab and other suppliers similarly appears to be a desparate move. In an era where major commercial litigation generates immediate media coverage and regulatory scrutiny, the suit raises fundamental questions about whether this lawsuit exists or represents wishful thinking about deflecting blame for operational failures.

What makes this absence particularly striking is the contrast with actual procurement fraud cases in the food service industry. When U.S. Foodservice executives orchestrated their $700 million vendor allowance scheme, the SEC filed detailed charges, criminal prosecutions followed, and extensive documentation entered public records. When McDonald’s faced supplier corruption in Hong Kong, criminal convictions resulted with specific kickback amounts and prison sentences handed down. The chicken industry’s price-fixing conspiracy generated $203 million in settlements with detailed court filings tracking every defendant’s involvement. Yet for allegations of this magnitude involving a major QSR brand, there exists a complete documentary void.

Supply chain chaos under new leadership

While corruption allegations remain unsubstantiated, Kirsten Michulka’s tenure as IPC CEO since January 2022 has produced verifiable operational failures that have damaged franchisee operations and raised questions about leadership competence. The most dramatic failure occurred in October 2024 when multiple Subway locations across Atlanta were forced to close for two weeks after a new distributor failed to deliver promised supplies, leaving franchisees without inventory during peak business periods and forcing IPC to scramble for alternative distribution arrangements. More recently, Michulka’s mishandling of another distribution partner, Troyers in Indiana, led the company to exit the Subway business with days notice. Michulka has gutted IPC distribution team, depriving franchisees of decades of experience in managing a system with nearly 70 distribution partners across the U.S. and Canada.

The CDI (Customized Distribution LLC) bankruptcy represents another significant failure in supply chain management under Michulka’s watch. CDI, a Georgia-based logistics company integral to IPC’s distribution network, began unraveling in June 2024 when it closed its Jacksonville facility, laying off 107 employees. By March 2025, CDI filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, citing “challenging market conditions” and breach of distribution agreements by customers – diplomatic language that masks a catastrophic breakdown in a critical supply chain relationship that IPC should have managed proactively.

Before assuming leadership at IPC, Michulka spent nearly three decades in supply chain management, including senior positions at Restaurant Supply Chain Solutions for Taco Bell and leadership roles at HAVI managing McDonald’s supply chain. Her credentials appeared impeccable, with degrees from Florida State and George Washington University plus executive education at Northwestern’s Kellogg School. Yet the contrast between her resume and operational performance raises questions about whether she possessed the specific expertise needed to manage Subway’s unique franchise-driven purchasing model, which differs significantly from corporate-controlled supply chains at Taco Bell or McDonald’s.

The timing of any potential lawsuit against suppliers becomes suspect when viewed against this backdrop of operational failures. Filing corruption charges against long-standing supplier partners who have received multiple excellence awards from IPC could serve as a convenient deflection from management failures that have directly harmed franchisees. The timing of the lawsuit filing, with claims of massive corruption, suggests this may be more a panicked Hail Mary than leadership. Alleging racketeering against a founder and key partners is unprecedented in the industry.

David versus Goliath: The defendants who could crush IPC

If IPC is to pursue litigation against its major suppliers, it would face adversaries with combined annual revenues exceeding $38 billion and access to the most sophisticated legal teams money can buy. West Liberty Foods, the farmer-owned cooperative that once supplied over one million pounds of sliced meat weekly to Subway restaurants, generates $442 million in annual revenue and had been Subway’s largest meat supplier for decades. The company’s strategic importance to Subway operations and its clean litigation history make it an unlikely target for credible corruption allegations.

Lineage Logistics, fresh off the largest real estate IPO in history raising $5.1 billion, operates 480 temperature-controlled facilities across 19 countries with 26,000 employees managing critical cold chain logistics for Subway’s supply network. The company received IPC’s Innovation Award and Excellence in Customer Service Award in 2016, helped develop new bread products for Subway, and maintains investment-grade credit ratings that provide virtually unlimited resources for legal defense. Any litigation against Lineage would pit IPC’s relatively modest resources against a publicly-traded behemoth with institutional backing and top-tier legal representation.

Georgia Pacific brings the ultimate corporate firepower as a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary backed by Warren Buffett’s empire. With $17 billion in annual revenue and 35,000 employees, the packaging giant invested $2 billion in operations in 2023 alone. Its legal department routinely handles complex commercial litigation, and any sustained legal battle would tap into Berkshire’s essentially unlimited financial resources. Ecolab, the $15.74 billion hygiene and sanitation giant, operates in 170 countries with 48,000 employees and maintains critical relationships across the entire QSR industry through its Kay Chemical division.

The mismatch in resources becomes even more pronounced considering IPC’s structure as a franchisee-owned cooperative with annual revenues between $35 million and $209 million depending on accounting methods. While IPC manages billions in purchasing volume, its operational budget and legal resources pale in comparison to any single defendant, let alone a coordinated defense by multiple suppliers. Previous food industry corruption cases demonstrate that well-funded defendants can extend litigation for years, exhausting plaintiffs’ resources while protecting their reputations through aggressive public relations campaigns.

When corruption meets reality: Lessons from food service scandals

The food service industry’s extensive history of procurement fraud provides a roadmap for how actual corruption cases unfold – and why the absence of evidence in the IPC situation appears so anomalous. The U.S. Foodservice case, which involved creating shell companies to inflate promotional allowances and corrupt audit processes, generated immediate SEC charges, detailed criminal indictments, and $700 million in documented fraud that became part of permanent public records. The scheme’s complexity required years of investigation, but once exposed, the evidence trail was comprehensive and undeniable.

McDonald’s multiple supplier corruption cases offer another instructive contrast. When executives in Hong Kong accepted HK$2.5 million in kickbacks from corn suppliers, criminal convictions followed with specific documentation of payment flows, conspirator communications, and systematic preferential treatment. The 2014 China expired meat scandal involving altered expiration dates created immediate operational impact with sales dropping 7.3% in affected regions, supplier relationships severed, and new compliance protocols implemented across the system. Even the McDonald’s Monopoly fraud from 1989-2001, orchestrated by a marketing company insider who stole $24 million in game pieces, generated extensive FBI investigation records, organized crime connections, and ultimately $16.6 million in settlements.

The recent wave of meat industry price-fixing cases demonstrates how modern procurement fraud gets exposed and prosecuted. The chicken industry conspiracy involving 19 producers controlling 95% of the broiler market resulted in $203 million in class action settlements, with Tyson Foods alone paying $10.5 million. These cases featured extensive documentation including confidential witness testimony, data analytics showing coordinated pricing patterns, and email communications demonstrating conspiracy. The beef and pork industries face similar litigation with Smithfield’s $42 million settlement and JBS’s $52.5 millionpayment establishing clear precedent for damages in systematic price manipulation.

What makes these cases instructive is not just their outcomes but their documentation patterns. Major procurement fraud inevitably leaves traces in financial records, generates whistleblowers seeking protection and rewards under the False Claims Act, creates patterns visible to data analytics, and ultimately produces criminal investigations that become public even when underlying evidence remains sealed. The complete absence of any such indicators in the alleged IPC corruption scheme suggests either unprecedented operational security by conspirators or, as likely, that no such conspiracy existed.

The franchise pressure cooker

Subway’s broader challenges provide essential context for understanding why corruption allegations might surface now, even without substantive evidence. The chain closed over 600 locations in 2024 as franchisees struggled with declining traffic, increased competition, and rising operational costs. Individual franchise bankruptcies have accelerated, creating desperate circumstances where franchisees seek explanations for their economic distress beyond market forces. The sale to Roark Capital in 2023 added private equity pressure for performance improvements that may not align with franchisee interests. One of Michulka’s first moves was stripping an important services revenue stream from franchisees, simply handing it over to Subway.

The timing of alleged corruption claims coinciding with demonstrable supply chain failures under Michulka’s leadership fits a familiar pattern in corporate crisis management. When operational competence fails, external enemies provide convenient explanations that preserve management credibility while deflecting accountability. Franchisees facing closure might find comfort believing they were victims of supplier corruption rather than market forces or management incompetence. Leadership facing criticism for distribution failures might prefer discussing historical corruption rather than current operational deficiencies.

The contrast with legitimate franchise system procurement scandals proves instructive. When Quiznos faced allegations of forcing franchisees to purchase from preferred suppliers at inflated prices, extensive litigation followed with detailed documentation of markup schemes, forced purchasing requirements, and systematic wealth transfer from franchisees to corporate entities. The litigation produced specific evidence of price differentials, comparative market analysis, and testimony from hundreds of affected franchisees. No such evidence exists in the IPC situation despite claims of even larger-scale corruption.

Industry precedent suggests that $200 million in systematic kickbacks would require elaborate documentation systems, multiple conspirators across organizations, sophisticated financial mechanisms to disguise payments, and ultimately would create patterns visible to routine audits. The major accounting firms that audit public companies like Lineage, Georgia Pacific, and Ecolab would face liability for missing corruption of this scale. The absence of any audit exceptions, restatements, or regulatory investigations involving these suppliers’ relationships with IPC undermines claims of systematic corruption.

The operational reality behind the lawsuit

CDI’s bankruptcy illuminates the actual challenges facing IPC that have nothing to do with supplier corruption. The distribution company’s collapse, attributed to “customers in breach of their distribution agreements,” suggests fundamental failures in contract management and relationship oversight that fall squarely within IPC’s operational responsibilities. When a critical distribution partner fails, citing customer breaches as a primary cause, it raises questions about IPC’s vendor management, payment practices, and strategic planning that anticipated market conditions. Michulka’s reign knee-capped IPC capability to monitor distributor performance, cutting staff and marginalizing internal expertise.

The Atlanta distribution crisis where Subway restaurants ran out of supplies for two weeks represents an even more fundamental failure. Distribution contingency planning constitutes basic supply chain management, yet IPC allowed a single point of failure to shut down franchisee operations in a major market. The scramble to find alternative suppliers and the extended closure period suggest inadequate backup systems, poor crisis management protocols, and failure to maintain redundant distribution capacity – all basic requirements for managing a multi-billion dollar supply chain.

These operational failures carry real costs for franchisees who depend on IPC for their survival. Lost sales during the Atlanta closure, increased costs from emergency supply arrangements, reputational damage from inability to serve customers, and competitive disadvantage versus other QSR chains with functioning supply chains create tangible harm that franchisees won’t forget. When evaluating IPC leadership, franchisees will weigh these demonstrated failures against unsubstantiated claims of historical corruption that, even if true, didn’t prevent IPC from delivering $2 billion in savings during Risi’s tenure.

Following the money that isn’t there

Financial analysis provides another lens for evaluating corruption claims. IPC’s role as a purchasing cooperative means it operates on relatively thin margins, negotiating volume discounts that get passed through to franchisees. A $200 million kickback scheme over 21 years would require approximately $10 million annually in hidden payments – a significant amount that would need accounting treatment somewhere in the financial ecosystem. Public companies like Lineage (now publicly traded), Georgia Pacific (Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary), and Ecolab (NYSE: ECL) face stringent financial reporting requirements that make hiding systematic bribery extremely difficult.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, implemented in 2002 following corporate accounting scandals, requires CEO and CFO certification of financial statements with criminal penalties for false certification. Senior executives at public suppliers would face personal criminal liability for participating in or concealing systematic kickback schemes. The absence of any financial restatements, SEC investigations, or executive departures at these suppliers related to IPC relationships suggests clean financial relationships rather than hidden corruption.

Modern procurement analytics make large-scale kickback schemes increasingly difficult to conceal. Benchmarking tools compare pricing across customers, industries, and regions, making systematic overcharging visible to data analysis. Subway franchisees, as independent business owners, have visibility to alternative suppliers for comparison shopping and would quickly identify systematic overpricing. The franchise association structure provides collective intelligence that would surface suspicious pricing patterns across the system. Yet no franchisee groups have produced evidence of systematic overcharging despite the economic pressure that would motivate such investigation.

The legal battlefield

If IPC possessed credible evidence of $200 million in supplier kickbacks, the legal strategy would follow established patterns from similar cases. First would come preservation notices to maintain electronic records, followed by sealed qui tam filings under the False Claims Act if government contracts were involved. Private litigation would begin with detailed complaints specifying conspiracy elements, RICO predicates if applicable, and damage calculations based on economic analysis. Discovery would produce document requests, depositions of key executives, and forensic accounting to trace payment flows.

The defendants named – West Liberty Foods, Lineage, Georgia Pacific, Ecolab – maintain normal operations with no disclosed litigation reserves, no executive departures, and no strategic changes suggesting major legal exposure. Public companies must disclose material litigation risks to investors, yet none have mentioned IPC disputes in recent filings. Credit rating agencies, which evaluate litigation risk in their assessments, maintain stable outlooks for these companies without mentioning procurement fraud exposure.

Legal precedent from food service corruption cases establishes clear patterns for how these cases develop. The U.S. Foodservice case took years to investigate but produced immediate market impact once exposed. The chicken price-fixing litigation generated hundreds of pages of detailed allegations with specific evidence of coordination. Even failed corruption cases like dismissed claims against major food distributors produce extensive documentation of allegations, legal arguments, and evidentiary disputes.

Industry implications of a scandal that wasn’t

The damage to Subway’s brand from even unsubstantiated corruption allegations could prove significant in an industry where trust drives franchise relationships. Potential franchisees evaluating QSR opportunities compare corporate support systems, and supply chain reliability represents a critical evaluation factor. If IPC cannot maintain basic distribution operations while floating corruption claims against suppliers, prospective franchisees might reasonably question the system’s stability and leadership competence.

Existing franchisees face more immediate concerns. Supplier relationships built over decades don’t recover quickly from corruption allegations, even if ultimately disproven. West Liberty Foods’ million pounds of weekly meat supply, Lineage’s cold chain logistics network, Georgia Pacific’s packaging systems, and Ecolab’s sanitation protocols represent irreplaceable components of Subway’s operations. Antagonizing these suppliers through legal action could create supply vulnerabilities that competitors would eagerly exploit.

The franchise model depends on trust between corporate leadership, purchasing cooperatives, and independent operators. When that trust breaks down, systems fail regardless of legal outcomes. IPC’s credibility, already damaged by operational failures, would face further erosion if corruption allegations prove unsubstantiated. Franchisees might reasonably question whether leadership that cannot manage basic distribution and invents corruption conspiracies deserves continued support.

The broader industry watches these dynamics carefully. Other franchise systems evaluating purchasing cooperative models will note IPC’s challenges as cautionary lessons. Suppliers considering long-term contracts with QSR chains will factor litigation risk into pricing and terms. Private equity owners like Roark Capital, focused on returns and efficiency, may question whether franchise-owned purchasing cooperatives provide optimal supply chain management versus corporate-controlled alternatives.

Accountability in the absence of evidence

The investigation into alleged corruption at the Independent Purchasing Cooperative reveals a more mundane but equally troubling reality: operational failure masked by phantom conspiracies. The absence of evidence for a $200 million kickback scheme is relatively troubling considering the damage done to the Subway brand. What does exist – documented distribution failures, the CDI bankruptcy, and franchisee harm from supply disruptions – points to management incompetence rather than supplier corruption.

The contrast between Janet Risi’s 28-year tenure delivering billions in savings without a single corruption allegation and Kirsten Michulka’s three years marked by operational failures and unsubstantiated corruption claims speaks volumes about leadership quality. When executives cannot maintain basic supply chain operations, blaming predecessors and suppliers for imaginary crimes represents deflection rather than accountability. The franchisees who depend on IPC for their survival deserve better than distribution failures explained away by phantom conspiracies.",https://north-denver-tribune.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/07101929/IMG_1437-1024x863.jpeg,N,,2025-09-07 14:06:36.955633

The Dual Foundations of Innovation Ecosystems

Academic research underscores two dominant paradigms in ecosystem design: the platform approach and the territorial approach. The platform model, as articulated by Adner and Kapoor (2010), emphasizes a central orchestrator—such as a tech giant or industry leader—that coordinates complementary actors to deliver cohesive solutions. This model thrives on open innovation, modular architectures, and digital integration. In contrast, the territorial approach, grounded in economic geography, highlights the role of localized clusters where universities, governments, and regional industries co-create value. Both frameworks are converging in today's innovation landscape, where digital platforms and geographically embedded networks increasingly intersect.

Real-World Case Studies: From Ecosystems to Earnings

Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) exemplifies the platform approach. By building a self-reinforcing ecosystem around electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage, and AI-driven manufacturing, Tesla has created a flywheel of innovation. Its Supercharger network, for instance, not only enhances customer retention but also drives demand for its vehicles and energy products. Since 2023, , reflecting investor confidence in its ecosystem-driven strategy.

Standard Chartered (STAN.LN) illustrates how financial institutions can leverage ecosystems to align sustainability with profitability. By embedding climate action into its core operations—such as its Transition Plan to reduce oil-and-gas emissions by 29% by 2030—the bank has attracted ESG-conscious capital. In 2024, , demonstrating that ESG integration can be both a moral imperative and a financial catalyst.

Delta Air Lines (DAL) and H&M Group (HMb.ST) showcase the power of low-cost, high-impact innovations within ecosystems. , . These cases highlight how operational efficiency and sustainability can coexist as drivers of competitive advantage.

The Investment Case: Orchestrators and Emerging Ecosystems

For investors, the key lies in identifying ecosystem orchestrators—firms that connect startups, corporations, and policymakers to scale innovation. These orchestrators often exhibit traits such as:

1. Cross-sector collaboration: Partnerships that span technology, policy, and civil society.

2. Scalable infrastructure: Platforms that reduce coordination costs and accelerate value creation.

3. ESG integration: Measurable sustainability targets that align with investor priorities.

Emerging ecosystems in cities like São Paulo, Shenzhen, and Bengaluru offer high-growth opportunities. São Paulo, for instance, has attracted record early-stage funding and now hosts 10 unicorns, driven by government support and a focus on climate-tech and fintech. Similarly, AI-native ecosystems in Boston and Silicon Valley are reshaping industries through machine learning, with startups leveraging these hubs to disrupt healthcare, logistics, and finance.

Strategic Recommendations for Investors

Prioritize Ecosystem Leaders: Invest in firms that act as connectors within ecosystems, such as Tesla, Google, or Amazon, which leverage AI and cloud infrastructure to reduce coordination costs.

Target Emerging Markets: Allocate capital to ecosystems in São Paulo, Shenzhen, and Bengaluru, where policy support and venture capital are fueling innovation.

Embrace ESG-Integrated Models: Favor companies with transparent sustainability targets, such as Standard Chartered or H&M, which align with global decarbonization goals.

Monitor AI-Native Ecosystems: Track regions with high AI startup density, as these hubs are likely to drive the next wave of technological disruption.

Conclusion: Beyond the Firm, Toward the Ecosystem

The future of innovation—and the returns it generates—will increasingly depend on the ability of firms to design and navigate ecosystems. These systems, whether platform-driven or territorially embedded, enable resilience, adaptability, and systemic value creation. For investors, the lesson is clear: success lies not in betting on isolated stars but in backing the constellations that connect them. As the academic literature and real-world cases demonstrate, the most compelling investment opportunities are those that align with the principles of ecosystem-driven innovation—where collaboration, sustainability, and strategic design converge to unlock long-term value.

By focusing on these principles, investors can position themselves at the forefront of a transformative era, where the boundaries between technology, sustainability, and economic growth blur into a single, interconnected vision.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 17:09:28.946283

Walmart, Target, Kroger, and other top companies may find themselves paying if they don't make changes.

About two million shopping carts are stolen every year, according to findings from the Good L Corporation.

There are multiple reasons for this, including shoppers living in urban areas with no vehicle using the shopping carts to take groceries home and then abandoning them out of convenience.

Some residents who are unhoused also use them to carry personal belongings and are later dumped in vacant lots or alleys.

Currently, it costs US retailers around $175 million a year in replacement and repair costs, per The Food Marketing Institute.

Some cities in California, like Eureka, located about five hours due north of San Francisco, have had enough of abandoned shopping carts being found astray by city workers.

As such, a new law has been implemented that requires any business in Eureka whose cart is found abandoned to pay fines up to $80 per incident, according to The Times-Standard.

The stray shopping carts became a real issue in recent years, and officials had trouble finding ways to hold stores accountable, but that changes with the fines.

Brenden Reilly, a Eureka chief building official, told the outlet that the legislation ""allows us to keep a paper trail and be transparent"" along with being ""able to account for what we will be billing businesses for.""

City workers will now take a photo of the carts that are seized and details about where they were found will be uploaded to a specific database for officials.

Walmart has a supermarket location in Eureka, and there's also a Target and Costco location.

Lawmakers in the city passed it on a three-to-two vote split, with the fine covering pickup and delivery costs for the shopping cart.

Eureka isn't the only city with plans recently put in place for abandoned shopping carts.

Dave Cortese, a state senator in San Jose, also introduced a bill that would have city workers return abandoned carts directly to retailers.

This was an alternative from the previous rule, which would require that they were held for 30 days first.

SHOPPING HAZARD

""Abandoned shopping carts are more than just an eyesore, they create safety hazards, block sidewalks, pollute our creeks, and cost cities time and taxpayer money to clean up,"" Cortese said in a statement.

Large retailers like Walmart, Target, Costco, and Kroger were also encouraged to make policy changes in San Jose to prevent abandoned carts.

Many have taken steps already, having wheel-locking mechanisms attached that will trigger if a cart is taken too far away from the store.

There's also coin-lock systems, like at Aldi, that prevent stolen carts.

Another California city, Brawley, located about two-hour drive due east of San Diego, also unanimously approved the first reading of an ordinance that would address the issue of abandoned shopping carts earlier this month, per a local news outlet.

""They become potential health hazards and really interfere with some of the pedestrian and vehicular traffic within our city,"" Brawley police chief Jimmy Duran explained.

""I think we've all seen them from time to time.""

CHANGES CONTINUE

Under the law, businesses would be required to secure their carts and retrieve any that were left abandoned, a little different than the other laws in Eureka and San Jose, as city workers would collect them.

Retailers in the city are allowed a 30-day window to create compliance plans and submit them, and afterward, violations would be a $50 fine per cart each day it's left abandoned.

In Stockton, about 45 miles from Sacramento, officials also amended a longstanding ordinance, requiring stores to better prevent abandoned shopping carts through citations and fees.

Duarte, Glendale, and Fortuna are making changes as well.

Several cities in Texas, New Mexico, New York, Georgia, and Maryland are doing the same.

COSTS HANDED OFF?

Dominick Miserandino, CEO ofRetail Tech Media Nexus, also told The US Sun that these costs for replacing carts and the fines could very well be passed onto shoppers.

The carts aren't cheap, going for about $100 to $500 each depending on the model.

Retailers have to find some way to make up the losses.

Shoppers in nine states also face fines up to $2,500, but there are three ways to avoid them.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/09/jwabandonedcart-op.jpg?1757010099&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-09-07 13:13:25.215574

Denim jeans are experiencing a major resurgence as a dominant force in the apparel market, according to a Yahoo Finance report. Major retailers are reporting strong sales and significant stock gains driven by consumer demand for new styles.

Data from the IndexBox platform supports this trend, indicating a shift in the US denim market. The market is expected to grow at a mid-single-digit rate in the coming years, a notable acceleration from the low-single-digit growth observed between 2019 and 2024, when total sales were between $20 billion and $22 billion.

Retailers are crediting successful marketing campaigns for the boom. American Eagle's (AEO) campaign with Sydney Sweeney generated 40 billion impressions and contributed to record-breaking new customer acquisition, leading to a nearly 40% stock rise. Similarly, Gap's (GPS) new campaign has garnered over 16 million views on YouTube. Target (TGT) reported a 28% increase in same-store sales for women's denim, driven by new styles and silhouettes.

The trend is marked by a consumer move away from skinny jeans toward wider, fuller cuts like barrel and baggy jeans. This shift has impacted pricing, with wider cuts often retailing closer to $90 per pair, while skinnier styles around $70 are subject to steeper discounts. The resurgence has come partly at the expense of the athleisure category, as seen in Lululemon's (LULU) recent stock decline following a cut to its profit outlook.

Is investing in nuclear weapons truly compatible with “sustainable finance”?","The acronym ESG — environmental, social, and governance — has long been associated with solar farms, wind turbines, and corporate ethics policies. Yet new data suggests a striking turn: an increasing share of ESG equity funds in Europe are now channeling money into nuclear weapons manufacturers.

According to Bloomberg, funds that claim to “promote” ESG or hold an explicit ESG “objective” are no longer shying away from defense investments. The rationale is less paradoxical than it first appears. Arms makers are often classified as suppliers of components, logistics, and security systems — not solely producers of weapons. That definitional ambiguity, coupled with surging geopolitical instability, has opened the door for defense to be rebranded as a pillar of sustainability.

Defense Outperforms Clean Energy

The performance data is equally telling. Over the past year, the S&P Global 1200 Aerospace & Defense Index has significantly outpaced the S&P Global Clean Energy Transition Index, leaving even the broader S&P 500 behind. While clean energy stocks have struggled under rising interest rates, supply chain pressures, and political uncertainty, defense stocks have benefited from robust government spending and escalating security priorities.

The chart is unambiguous: by mid-2025, defense equities were delivering double-digit gains while clean energy lagged near flat. For asset managers under pressure to deliver returns, the appeal of “green-labeled” funds with exposure to defense has become irresistible.

ESG’s Shifting Narrative

This evolution raises critical questions about the integrity of the ESG framework. Is investing in nuclear weapons truly compatible with “sustainable finance”? Or are asset managers bending definitions to align capital flows with market performance rather than principles?

Proponents argue that in an era where national security underpins economic stability, defense can be considered part of the ESG agenda. Critics counter that allowing nuclear arms into ESG portfolios dilutes the very purpose of responsible investing, turning it into a marketing label rather than a guiding philosophy.

The Bigger Picture

This pivot underscores a broader theme: ESG is not static. Its boundaries evolve in response to political pressures, investor demands, and global crises. What was once excluded as morally unacceptable may now be reframed as strategically indispensable.

For innovators and policymakers, the lesson is clear: the definition of “sustainable finance” is contested territory. And as long as returns in defense eclipse those in renewables, expect the ESG landscape to remain blurred.",https://www.finextra.com/finextra-images/member_photos/thumb_137871_sergei_artimenia_68.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 12:27:05.401695

1

Walmart is introducing next-day shipping to select cities.

In a bid to compete with Amazon and other e-commerce platforms, Walmart announced that it plans to introduce next-day delivery services in New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and other major metropolitan areas, Bloomberg reports.

The change involves partnering with more third-party sellers through Walmart Marketplace to fulfill orders on popular products using Walmart Fulfillment Services (WFS). Customers can expect improved delivery speed as more cities adopt the system.

2

Walmart is adding a new streaming perk.

As of September 15, Walmart members can also take advantage of a new streaming perk at no extra cost.

In celebration of its fifth anniversary, Walmart+ will soon allow customers to choose between ad-supported Peacock and Paramount+ plans, the latter of which has been on offer since 2022. Members can switch their service of choice every 90 days. A news release says this new offering will further enhance “the value and flexibility” of membership.

Walmart is embracing AI.

Walmart will embrace artificial intelligence as a means of keeping costs down for customers amid inflation.

At its recent Retail Rewired innovation event, the company rolled out four “super agents” designed to “save time and effort for both workers and shoppers,” CNBC reports. Tailored to meet the varying needs of sellers, suppliers, and shoppers, they unveiled four main agents with an “Associate Agent” to streamline the experience.

Additionally, Walmart will now use spatial AI technology, which allows machines to perceive and interact with three-dimensional environments (you know, the real world). A new Digital Twin System—essentially a computerized copy of physical retail environments—will now help Walmart recognize maintenance and management problems weeks sooner.

Walmart is offering employees a discount on groceries.

Sometimes Walmart shoppers are also Walmart staff—which is why the company is now offering a 10 percent employee discount on groceries. A previous policy covered general merchandise as well as fresh produce, so the change marks an expansion of the retention scheme.

Effective immediately, this will cut costs for Walmart’s 1.6 million U.S. employees after their first 90 days of working with the company. Thanks to the expansion, 95 percent of regularly priced items at the store will now be eligible for the discount.",https://bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/2669159077_4939_featured.jpg?quality=82&strip=all,N,,2025-09-07 11:06:33.777009

Textile exports in 2025: Signs of resilience Despite global trade headwinds, India’s textile and apparel exports have held steady.
Samuel noted, “For us, ready-made garments dominate our textile and apparel cargo profile.
From our key hubs in Asia (Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and India) Chapman Freeborn handles approximately 1,200 tonnes of textile and apparel exports annually on our operated charters,” added Gilliard.","While buying a T-shirt from an authorised retailer of a global sports brand in India, I noticed something curious—the label read Made in Bangladesh. The product was being sold in India, yet it was produced elsewhere. A similar experience struck me during my visit to Qatar in 2022 for the FIFA World Cup. At a supermarket, I wanted to pick up a few souvenir T-shirts to gift my friends back home in India. To my surprise, most of the shirts carried a Made in India tag. It felt rather odd to buy a “Made in India” T-shirt in Qatar only to gift it to friends in India. After some searching, I finally found a few T-shirts labelled Made in Turkey.

This isn’t an isolated observation. Years earlier, one of my college professors recounted how, during a trip to the US around 2010, he came across two nearly identical caps—yet one was priced significantly higher than the other. The only real difference? One cap carried a Made in USA label, while the other said Made in China. These experiences highlight a fascinating truth of global trade: no matter where you shop, the product in your hands may have been manufactured thousands of miles away.

Just as the UK dominates Scotch whisky exports, Norway leads in salmon, and China continues as the world’s largest textile exporter—followed closely by Bangladesh, Vietnam, Turkey, and India—global supply chains shape what we buy and where it comes from.

Clearly, textile production is no longer concentrated in a single geography. As Reto Hunziker, President-Europe at Chapman Freeborn, mentioned during an interview at Transport Logistics and Air Cargo Europe in Munich in June 2025, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and India have emerged as key complements to China in the textile trade.

According to Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association, Vietnam’s textile and garment sector recorded a sharp rebound in July 2025, with export turnover estimated at $ 4.45 billion—an 8.2% increase over June and 21% higher than the same month last year. For the first seven months, exports stood at USD 26.33 billion, up 9% compared to the same period in 2024, underscoring a strong recovery after a phase of slowdown.

However, this growth comes against significant challenges: rising competition from rival producers, stricter global demands for sustainable and eco-friendly standards, and uncertainty in the world economy and trade flows—most notably the US decision to impose a 20% reciprocal tariff on Vietnamese goods. How the industry adapts and innovates in response will be critical in determining its resilience going forward.

On the other hand, James Gilliard, Vice President Cargo Sales - Europe, Chapman Freeborn mentioned, “Historically, China dominated textile airfreight, accounting for about 70% of volumes versus 30% from South Asia and Southeast Asia. Since COVID, however, that balance has shifted closer to 60/40 in favor of India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Cambodia, as production footprints diversify.”

According to Gilliard, Bangladesh has seen the strongest growth, now a major source for global retailers. Vietnam contributes more to footwear and high-tech goods (north) and a mix of clothing/footwear (south). But, he also mentioned Cambodia is steadily expanding as manufacturing relocates. Further, “India and the subcontinent are increasingly important but remain rate-sensitive, relying heavily on ocean, sea-air (via Dubai World Central), and lower-deck lift, with full charters mainly in peak seasons (Oct–Nov),” added Gilliard.

In India’s case, cotton remains one of its most influential exports, with the country supplying fabrics and apparel to some of the most reputed foreign retailers and brands worldwide. Names like Tommy Hilfiger, Walmart, Levi Strauss, Macy’s, Metro Group, Nike, Reebok, Carrefour, Gap, H&M, JC Penney, and Marks & Spencer are among those sourcing from the Indian cotton industry, underscoring the country’s significance in the global textile supply chain.

For India, this is both a story of history and of present-day resilience. The country’s textile heritage stretches back millennia, from ancient cotton monopolies to today’s billion-dollar export economy.

Cotton: A legacy of centuries

India’s tryst with cotton dates back thousands of years. As per the Government of India, the subcontinent held a global monopoly on cotton manufacturing for nearly 3,000 years—from 1500 B.C. to 1500 A.D.—with cotton fabrics widely traded across Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, often serving as barter currency.

Today, India is the world’s largest cotton producer, contributing 23% of global output. Cotton production in 2024–25 is estimated at 302.25 lakh bales (170 kg each), following 32.5 million bales in 2023–24, 33.6 million in 2022–23, and 31.1 million in 2021–22. Total supply until September 2025 is projected at 357.44 lakh bales, with exports pegged at 18 lakh bales for the 2024–25 crop year.

India ranked as the third-largest exporter of raw cotton in 2022, with an 11% global share. Cotton exports were valued at $ 6.78 billion in FY24, rising to Rs 73,233 crore ($ 8.48 billion) in FY25 (till December 2024). Export volumes stood at 2.8 million bales in 2023–24 and 3.0 million in 2022–23.

Key buyers in FY25 included the United States (27% share), Bangladesh (21%), Sri Lanka, the UK, Germany and China. For yarn, China led imports in 2020–21 with 275 million kg, followed by Bangladesh (225 million kg), Vietnam (56 million kg), and Peru (53 million kg).

To support the sector, the Government of India has waived all customs duties on raw-cotton imports from 19 August to 30 September 2025, removing the 5% Basic Customs Duty, 5% Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess, and 10% Social Welfare Surcharge—an effective 11% duty relief.

The CBIC-notified decision aims to reduce input costs across yarn, fabric, garment, and made-up segments, ease supply constraints, and boost export competitiveness. Textile associations have welcomed the move for stabilising cotton prices, supporting SMEs, and providing relief to manufacturers and consumers.

Silk: An ancient thread woven into modern markets

If cotton represents India’s economic might, silk embodies its cultural and artisanal heritage. Sericulture in India dates back centuries, making the country one of the few in the world to produce all four commercial silk varieties—Mulberry, Tasar, Eri, and the rare golden-hued Muga silk, unique to Assam. Today, India is the world’s second-largest silk producer, with the sector employing nearly 9.76 million people across 52,500 villages.

In FY24, silk production stood at 38,913 tonnes, followed by 30,614 tonnes during April–December FY25. Exports were valued at $244.27 million in FY24, while April–December FY25 saw shipments worth $215 million. Karnataka remained India’s silk hub, contributing 32.3% of total output in FY24.

Fletcher Samuel, Senior Lead Cargo Business at Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL), highlighted the logistics dimension of this sector. He said, “BLR Airport is strategically located to serve South India’s textile and apparel clusters, including Tirupur and Coimbatore, making it a natural gateway for India’s fashion exports. By offering specialised handling, express cargo terminals, and India’s largest domestic cargo terminal, we are enabling faster time-to-market for high-value and fast-fashion products.”

Before textiles and garments can take off from BLR Airport, they must first reach the airport by road—underlining the importance of multimodal connectivity. DHL plays a crucial role here, not only moving textile shipments, e-commerce parcels, and fashion products by air but also enabling efficient road transport. Even though DHL did not comment directly on textile shipments, the company announced earlier this year an investment of €3.43 million in a new 17,900 sq. ft. service centre at the AISATS Bengaluru Logistics Park, expanding its footprint at the airport to over 130,000 sq. ft. Equipped with telescopic conveyors, wheel sorters, and logic-based sequencing, the facility is designed to cut processing times and boost throughput for future growth.

With regards to multimodal transport, Samuel pointed to BIAL’s initiative Logi-Connect: “Our flagship initiative, Logi-Connect, is a dedicated air–road multimodal logistics programme designed to streamline cargo movements from hinterland hubs directly to BLR Airport. With scheduled daily trucking services connecting key industrial clusters such as Tirupur, Coimbatore, Erode, and Ambur, exporters benefit from time-definite uplift to over 24 international destinations ex-BLR.”

“Textiles and apparel are one of the fastest-moving categories at BLR Airport. On average, we handle close to 690 metric tonnes every month, adding up to around 8,300 metric tonnes annually.”

Fletcher Samuel, Bangalore International Airport

He added, “Textiles and apparel are one of the fastest-moving categories at BLR Airport. On average, we handle close to 690 tonnes every month, adding up to around 8,300 tonnes annually. This represents nearly 5% of BLR Airport’s total export cargo throughput in FY25. While the percentage may seem modest, the category plays a crucial role in terms of frequency, value, and sensitivity.”

According to Samuel, the top five export destinations for textile shipments from BLR are New York (JFK), Chicago (ORD), Amsterdam (AMS), London Heathrow (LHR), and Frankfurt (FRA)—reflecting strong demand from both the U.S. and European fashion markets. On the import side, China’s Shenzhen (SZX) leads as the main source, supplying fabrics, trims, accessories, and semi-finished materials for India’s garment production.

India’s global textile trade prospects received a boost in July 2025 with the signing of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with the UK, granting zero-duty access to 99% of Indian exports. This move is expected to enhance competitiveness in one of India’s key overseas markets.

From the air chartering perspective, Chapman Freeborn plays an important role in connecting textile flows into Europe. Gilliard, the company’s Vice President – Cargo Sales Europe, explained: “The vast majority of textile cargo Chapman Freeborn moves into Europe consists of ready-made garments, as European manufacturing of garments has largely ceased. These are finished goods, ranging from high-turnover, lower-end fashion items destined for fast-fashion retailers, through to mid-tier brands.”

Gilliard also pointed out that while a smaller share of luxury shipments move into Europe, much of the high-end finishing remains centered in Italy. Beyond Europe, there are also flows of raw materials from India into China and Vietnam for further production, though these are regional rather than Europe-bound.

Chapman Freeborn also uses airports strategically located near textile hubs across Asia. Gilliard noted, “The main airports we use for textile and apparel shipments in Asia are Hanoi (HAN), Dhaka (DAC), and Chennai (MAA), chosen because they are located close to major production centers, which helps streamline supply chains and reduce transit times.” The company is also eyeing new opportunities in Cambodia with the opening of Phnom Penh’s new airport.

Regional competition also shapes trade flows. A significant portion of Bangladesh’s textiles once moved through India for uplift via Kolkata or Delhi airports, but restrictions introduced earlier this year have ended that model. Instead, Bangladeshi exporters increasingly rely on Dhaka Airport for direct exports, as also highlighted by the Chapman Freeborn spokesperson.

“From our key hubs in Asia (Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and India) Chapman Freeborn handles approximately 1,200 tonnes of textile and apparel exports annually on our operated charters. ”

James Gilliard, Chapman Freeborn

In terms of trade policy, Bangladesh recently secured relief from the United States, which reduced tariffs on its apparel exports to 20%—down from the initially proposed 37%. This aligns Bangladesh’s rate with other exporters such as Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Pakistan, and Indonesia. By contrast, India, which has yet to conclude a deal with Washington, will face a higher 25% tariff, putting its exporters at a relative disadvantage in the U.S. market despite progress with the UK.

Textile exports in 2025: Signs of resilience

Despite global trade headwinds, India’s textile and apparel exports have held steady. According to an official release by the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence & Statistics (DGCIS), exports of major textile commodities stood at $3.10 billion in July 2025, a 5.37% rise over July 2024. For April–July 2025, cumulative exports stood at $12.18 billion, up 3.87% from the same period last year.

Even for Bangalore Airport, readymade garments dominate the textile and apparel cargo segment. Samuel noted, “For us, ready-made garments dominate our textile and apparel cargo profile. This includes both fashion apparel and utility wear, destined for global retail chains and e-commerce platforms. The prominence of ready-made garments is natural, given their time-sensitive nature, buyers in the US and Europe often operate on ‘fast fashion’ cycles, where lead times are short and demand fluctuations are frequent. Air freight plays a critical role in bridging this demand, helping Indian exporters meet order timelines while ensuring that goods reach store shelves and online distribution centres in sync with international retail calendars.” Interestingly, IATA classifies textile as general cargo and doesn’t need any special handling.

Gilliard observed that volumes are highly seasonal, peaking ahead of summer and winter demand, but fast fashion has created a more consistent, year-round uplift. “Operationally, Chapman Freeborn supports these movements with a range of aircraft, from smaller types such as A330s to full 747 freighter charters. On average, we move the equivalent of five to six 747 loads per month, translating to 500–600 tonnes of garments monthly, not including the significant additional uplift tied to the fast-growing e-commerce segment, which also includes textiles and apparel. From our key hubs in Asia (Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and India) Chapman Freeborn handles approximately 1,200 tonnes of textile and apparel exports annually on our operated charters,” added Gilliard.

As the industry gears up for its $100 billion export target by 2025–26, the “Made in India” label will continue to travel far and wide. And just as a shopper in Qatar or New York may unknowingly buy Indian-made apparel, India’s legacy in textiles will remain deeply stitched into the fabric of global commerce. Adding to that, BIAL’s Samuel added, “Looking ahead, our vision is to be the most preferred cargo gateway in India. Growth opportunities are especially strong in Europe and the UK, with Free Trade Agreement (FTA) discussions underway. An FTA with the UK and the EU could significantly reduce trade barriers, giving Indian apparel exporters an edge in these high-value markets. BLR Airport is positioning itself to capture this momentum with investments in infrastructure, technology, and global connectivity.”",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2025/09/07/85896-blrcargoairsidefreightershoot-78-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 13:13:10.282403

As executive vice president and chief people officer at Walmart, Morris oversees the largest private workforce in the US. She interviews leaders looking to join Walmart or transition within the company. That includes a wide range of positions such as merchants, tech leaders, product leaders, and HR executives.

She told Business Insider she likes this question because it's open-ended.

""You can't really rehearse for it, even if you knew the question,"" Morris said.

The reason why, she explained, is because the candidate's response naturally leads to a larger discussion. Morris, who spent more than 17 years at Adobe before joining Walmart, said once the candidate answers, she probes them further to find out more about how they position themselves in the workplace and interact with others.

""Are they really a team player? Are they self-aware? Is there humility built into that?"" Morris said.

The premium wear segment, which makes up around 18% of India’s US $ 70 billion apparel industry, has been growing rapidly, fuelled by an expanding base of brand-conscious and affluent young consumers, according to market research firm Datum Intelligence.

Under the new tax regime, garments priced below Rs. 2,500 (US $ 29) will now attract a reduced levy of 5%, while apparel above that price point will be subject to an 18% tax. The change will affect international players such as PVH Corp, Marks & Spencer, Gap Inc, Under Armour, Nike, H&M and Uniqlo, as well as domestic brands selling in the premium category. Industry executives have warned that the move could dampen sales, as aspirational consumers in India often view premium fashion as a lifestyle upgrade but remain highly price sensitive.

The Clothing Manufacturers Association of India described the higher levy as potentially sounding the “death knell for the industry”. It noted that products priced above Rs. 2,500 (US $ 29) are widely purchased by middle-class consumers, not just the wealthy. The group added that the measure would compound pressures already faced by domestic garment makers, whose exports to the US are struggling under tariffs of 50% imposed during the Trump administration.

On Superdry India’s website, the majority of its 875 new arrivals fall under the higher tax bracket, with jackets retailing for upwards of US $ 170 and shirts priced around US $ 60.

Indianapolis, IN (WorkersCompensation.com) - Officials said an attack on an Indiana Walmart employee by a group of customers was caught on video that has since gone viral.

According to a video posted to Facebook by user Kind Butler, the fight occurred in the checkout aisle of an Indianapolis Walmart on August 29. In the four-and-a-half-minute video, a crowd of approximately eight people crammed into a checkout aisle. Someone within the crowd yells slurs at the worker while other store customers nearby watch.

The video shows one woman throwing several punches at the worker as other employees try to pull the two apart. At least three people appear to be punching and hitting the employee, and up to two Walmart associates attempting to help the employee as she falls to the ground.

One of the attackers, a woman in pink, is seen stomping and punching the employee. Other customers hold the two women apart as some of the other members of the attackers’ party continue to punch and kick the employee on the ground.

""Where you at b---,"" can also be heard repeatedly shrieking by one of the people engaged in the fight.

At one point, the fight is momentarily broken up and the employee is able to get to her feet after being attacked for about a minute, but one of the crowd, who is holding a toddler can be seen throwing something that appears to be a lint roller at the employee.

At that point, the employee charges at the woman in pink and the melee starts again until more employees are able to intervene and separate all of the parties involved. After about 20 seconds of yelling from separate areas, the violence starts again with the attackers and their group attempting to find the employee, who was secured within the customer service area.

""The violence that occurred at our store on Friday was unacceptable,"" Walmart said in a statement. ""We appreciate the police for acting quickly.”

Police reports identified the employee at Tikerra Hicks.

The customer who filmed the attack, Kind Butler, told Fox 59 he visits the Walmart nearly every day to stock his rental properties. He said he heard that the group was the family of an alleged rape victim that was trying to find someone who may have been involved in the attack. The attack on Hicks started without warning, he said.

“There wasn’t any questioning, no anything,” he said. “Just as soon as they saw the girl, the whole family came over and started beating her up.”

Hicks told the police she had been getting calls about an incident involving her friend, but she had no indication the violence would spill into her work. She said she had just come back from the bathroom when she was ambushed.

“I just hear, ‘There she go’ and then boom on the side of my head I feel somebody hitting me,” Hicks said.

Hicks is named as an “other person” in a Beech Grove police report documenting a rape investigation, but she insists the allegations are made up.

Hicks said she’s been suspended from Walmart following the brawl. The whole situation remains a shock to both her and Butler, who said private problems shouldn’t be handled so publicly.

“I’m just glad everyone was OK, and hopefully they solve the issues,” Butler said.

No arrests have been made following the fight. Members of the management teams at the Walmart where the fight took place indicated that they are not allowed to talk about the situation.

Local media said the location of the fight was known to the Indianapolis Metro Police. Last year, IMPD was called to the location 65 times. Of those, two calls were for fights or disturbances.

Police said this year they’ve been called 59 times so far and eight of those calls were for fights or disturbances.

""This remains an open investigation referencing a verbal argument and a physical altercation,"" the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement on Monday, Sept. 1. ""There have been no arrest(s) at this time.""",https://www.workerscompensation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cropped-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 11:06:45.246485

Kang Hoon-sik, chief of staff for President Lee Jae Myung, said that South Korea and the U.S. had finalized negotiations on the workers’ release. He said South Korea plans to send a charter plane to bring the workers home as soon as remaining administrative steps are completed.

U.S. immigration authorities said Friday they detained 475 people, most of them South Korean nationals, when hundreds of federal agents raided Hyundai’s sprawling manufacturing site in Georgia where the Korean automaker makes electric vehicles. Agents focused on a plant that is still under construction at which Hyundai has partnered with LG Energy Solution to produce batteries that power EVs.

South Korea’s Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said that more than 300 South Koreans were among the detained.

The operation was the latest a long line of workplace raids conducted as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda. But the one on Thursday is especially distinct because of its large size and the fact that state officials have long called the targeted site Georgia’s largest economic development project.

The raid has stunned many in South Korea because the country is a key U.S. ally. It agreed in July to purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy and make a $350 billion investment in the U.S. in return for the U.S lowering tariff rates. About two weeks ago, U.S. President Donald Trump and Lee held their first summit talks in Washington.

Lee had called for “an all-out response” to the raid, saying that rights of South Korean nationals and economic activities of South Korean companies must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement procedures. South Korea’s Foreign Ministry separately issued a statement to express “concern and regret” over the case and sent diplomats to the site.

Video released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Saturday showed a caravan of vehicles driving up to the site and then federal agents directing workers to line up outside. Some detainees were ordered to put their hands up against a bus as they were frisked and then shackled around their hands, ankles and waist.

Most of the people detained were taken to an immigration detention center in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida state line. None has been charged with any crimes yet, Steven Schrank, the lead Georgia agent of Homeland Security Investigations, said during a news conference Friday, adding that the investigation is ongoing.

He said that some of the detained workers had illegally crossed the U.S. border, while others had entered the country legally but had expired visas or had entered on a visa waiver that prohibited them from working.

Kang, the South Korean presidential chief of staff, said that South Korea will push to review and improve visa systems for those traveling to the U.S. on business trips for investment projects.",https://www.sidneydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/OIP2.png,N,,2025-09-07 10:09:02.658668

According to Agence France Presse, the LVMH group, which already has a strong presence in the French media landscape, is about to enter into discussions to buy Challenges magazine. This title, which focuses on politics and economics, is currently majority-owned by Claude Perdriel, founder of the Les Nouvelles Editions indépendantes group.

LVMH already owns 40% of Éditions Croque Futur, the publisher of Challenges. The group is now looking to acquire the entire capital. A meeting between representatives of the luxury group and Claude Perdriel is scheduled for September to confirm the deal, according to Pierre-Henri de Menthon, the magazine’s editorial director.

A growing press portfolio

This potential acquisition is part of a clear strategy to consolidate the media influence of Bernard Arnault’s group. Over the past year, LVMH has acquired several titles, including Paris Match, L’Opinion and L’Agefi, in addition to media already in its fold, such as Les Echos and Le Parisien.

This reinforcement raises questions: how does the world’s leading luxury goods group, headquartered in Paris, intend to increase its influence in public debate? While Challenges retains its editorial independence, its line could be influenced by the group’s strategic interests.

What’s at stake for Paris?

With this operation, Paris confirms its status as a stronghold of the economic and political press. The possible integration of Challenges into LVMH could shake up the Parisian media ecosystem, which is already in the process of restructuring. This concentration of titles in the hands of powerful private players also raises questions about the plurality of information, particularly during election periods.

More broadly, this strategic move shows how luxury groups are no longer just investing in fashion, but also in content. LVMH seems to want to shape opinion as much as trends, a high-risk gamble for its reputation.",https://www.parisselectbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A-31.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 12:26:59.992597

(The Center Square) — The world’s largest retailer says it’s doing everything it can to keep prices low as its costs increase each week due to the tariffs at the center of a high-profile legal challenge.

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors that the company could be forced to raise prices further due to tariff pressure.

“With regard to our U.S. pricing decisions, given tariff related cost pressures, we’re doing what we said we would do,” he said. “We’re keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can.”

However, not even the Arkansas-based retail giant can entirely blunt the impact of the highest tariff rates in nearly a century.

“But as we replenish inventory at post-tariff price levels, we’ve continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters,” McMillon said during the company’s most recent earnings call.

Some small businesses and Democrat-led states filed suit in April challenging Trump’s tariff authority.

Trump’s Solicitor General, D. John Sauer, asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case on an expedited schedule this week. The administration fears unwinding Trump’s trade deals will lead to an “economic catastrophe.”

Trump used a 1977 law that doesn’t mention tariffs to reorder global trade through tariffs to try to give U.S. businesses an advantage in the world market. Using tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Trump hit nearly every nation with import duties of at least 10%. Some countries face higher rates, up to 50%.

Two lower courts have already said the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act doesn’t give the president unbounded tariff authority.

Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed a previous lower court ruling, but said Trump’s tariffs could remain in place while the administration appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court. In the 7-4 decision, the majority said that tariff authority rests with Congress.

Sauer asked the Supreme Court to decide by Sept. 10 whether to take up the case. He also asked for “expedited consideration of the merits to the maximum extent feasible.”

Sauer’s proposed schedule – which the high court has yet to agree to – calls for briefs to be filed in the case by Oct. 20 and oral arguments set for the first week of November.

New tariffs raised $58.5 billion in revenue between January and June of this year before accounting for income and payroll tax offsets, according to an analysis of federal data from the Penn Wharton Budget Model. The study found that the average effective tariff rate increased to 9.14% in June from 2.2% in January, when Trump returned to office.

Trump has said he wants to use tariffs to restore manufacturing jobs lost to lower-wage countries in decades past, shift the tax burden away from U.S. families and pay down the national debt.

A tariff is a tax on imported goods paid by the person or company that imports the goods. The importer can absorb the cost of the tariffs or try to pass the cost on to consumers through higher prices.

Robert Greensted, director at Standard and Poor’s (S&P), explained that acquisition activity such as this in the reinsurance market has been very quiet for the past three to four years, meaning that Sompo’s announcement came as “a bit of a shock”.
He continued: “[The deal] was a bit of a shock because we hadn’t really had to deal with a lot of M&A consolidation in recent years.
He said: “You might see more M&A around can we acquire capabilities, not just scale?
The company announced that it had agreed to acquire Sydney-based reinsurance broker Steadfast Re.","After Sompo International Holdings’ announcement on 27 August that it would buy Aspen Insurance Holdings for $3.5bn (£2.6bn), market commentators are debating whether Sompo’s “shock” news marks the start of an M&A footrace – where transactions are tools for reinsurers to achieve scale, capabilities and diversification.

Sompo’s purchase, expected to close in the first half of 2026, strives to support the (re)insurer’s plans to diversify both its property and casualty (P&C) portfolio and geographic locations, to give the insurer more clout outside of its native Japan.

According to Sompo, Aspen fulfils this goal by providing access to specialty business lines – such as cyber, credit and political risk, inland marine, UK property and construction and US management liability – reinsurance classes, a Lloyd’s syndicate and broker relationships.

The firm also has a footprint in Bermuda, the US, the UK, Canada, Singapore and Switzerland.

Sompo additionally expects Aspen to bolster its financial standing, revenue streams and capital management options – the overall business has $4.6bn (£3.4bn) of annual gross written premium (GWP), $2bn (£1.1bn) of assets under management and 80% of fee income in 2024 generated from non-catastrophe, long-tail lines of business.

Robert Greensted, director at Standard and Poor’s (S&P), explained that acquisition activity such as this in the reinsurance market has been very quiet for the past three to four years, meaning that Sompo’s announcement came as “a bit of a shock”.

He continued: “[The deal] was a bit of a shock because we hadn’t really had to deal with a lot of M&A consolidation in recent years. The market has consolidated a lot in the past, [which means] more limited opportunities going forwards.”

But is Sompo’s transaction a sign of things to come in the reinsurance sector, or a one-off deal amid a dry spell?

Size matters

For market commentators chewing the fat ahead of the Rendez-Vous de Septembre conference in Monaco over the next four days, many feel Sompo’s purchase – and any other potential market-wide acquisitions – are driven by a desire for scale.

“We think that scale is very important,” noted James Eck, vice-president and senior credit officer at Moody’s Ratings.

Describing the return of a reinsurance acquisition “after things being pretty quiet on the M&A front for a long time” as “an interesting situation”, Eck continued: “The most likely targets would be that sub $5bn (£3.7bn) of equity type companies that, for whatever reason, maybe if we’re entering an underwriting environment that’s not as attractive and [a firm does not] have that scale, [it needs] to find a larger partner to continue to earn adequate returns for shareholders, so we may see that.”

Eck’s colleague, Salman Siddiqui, associate managing director at Moody’s, added: “When we look at this underwriting cycle, we talk about market softening. One of the indicators for that is increased M&A because companies will say ‘what accounts generate organic growth or organic returns?’

“[M&A is one method] to deploy capital to increase scale and therefore get economies of scale to maintain a return.”

Although obtaining scale is one advantage of M&A, continued Siddiqui, adding new capabilities is a further plus point that reinsurers should look to tap into – he believes this is evident in Sompo’s recent purchase.

He said: “You might see more M&A around can we acquire capabilities, not just scale? Can we acquire capabilities that we don’t have – whether that’s technology, artificial intelligence (AI) or people that are doing something different – or can we acquire distribution capabilities that we don’t have?

“Sompo got access to Aspen’s Lloyd’s platform and it also got access to its insurance-linked securities (ILS) fund. Aspen generates quite a lot of fee-based income that Sompo didn’t really have and we think that also adds to the attractiveness.”

Meanwhile, Simon Ashworth, head of analytics and research – insurance at S&P Global Ratings, suggested that perhaps M&A from Japan-based firms, such as Sompo, should not come as such a surprise due to this territory’s continued “interest in expansion overseas”.

He explained: “We’ve seen lots of dynamics in [the] Japanese insurance market in terms of interest in expansion overseas and that’s coming from a variety of different places, for a variety of different reasons – not least because a lot of Japanese insurers have been forced to sell strategic equity holdings in Japanese corporates [because of] anti cartel like pricing investigations from the Japan regulator.

“They’ve got excess capital that they’re looking to deploy. We actually saw the seeds of that planted over a decade ago with Japanese insurers doing a lot of heavy research on which types of businesses to buy.”

Too much hype?

Broker Gallagher Re, however, is unconvinced that Sompo’s purchase is going to open the floodgates to more reinsurance M&A, with chief executive Tom Wakefield commenting that the firm is “a way off advising clients to worry about [a] lack of choice [in the reinsurer market], especially with the growth of the alternative capital [and the] ILS sector”.

The broker boss did concede though that due to the “excess of capital that’s in the industry” at the moment, it “would be no surprise if there was further consolidation” confirmed in the coming months.

Andrew Newman, Gallagher Re’s president, added that alongside hard and soft market cycles, there is also a cyclical nature to whether organic or inorganic growth is preferred by businesses.

However, he is “not convinced” that a period of focused acquisitional growth “is necessarily looming right now” for reinsurers.

He said: “If you look at the past, in the non-life and particularly the commercial line space, there’s a point at which organic growth creates these massive changes and results in performance. Growth is not only possible, but desirable.

“[When that] phase comes to [a] natural end and organic growth becomes challenging, what follows – but not necessarily immediately – is a period where inorganic growth becomes both possible and desirable. I’m not convinced that period is necessarily looming right now.

“If you look at the momentum the industry has in terms of underlying pricing and profitability, I wouldn’t see a rush for people to say ‘oh my gosh, there’s no possible opportunity here. Let’s try and achieve scale by buying more people’. We’re some way away from that.”

Adding ‘strength and scale’

Although Wakefield and Newman remain muted in their views as to whether M&A activity in the reinsurer market will start to gain greater traction again following in Sompo’s footsteps, Gallagher Re, meanwhile, confirmed a brand new purchase itself on 2 September 2025 – ahead of its pre-Rendez Vous de Septembre briefing in London that same day.

The company announced that it had agreed to acquire Sydney-based reinsurance broker Steadfast Re.

Addressing trade press attending its briefing session earlier this week, Wakefield said: “The deal is due to close in the fourth quarter of 2025.

“We’re really excited about this opportunity to welcome the team, which will enhance our ability to support a range of clients, including MGAs and mutuals, and will boost our local team in terms of strength and scale.

“There’s particularly strong cultural alignment with our team and I know that both parties cannot wait to get started.”",https://dbt7a3rwdhupy.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/4/8/2/117482_gettyimages1315600064_926384.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 12:27:10.268045

Conclusion Société Généale’s 2026 strategic turnaround is a compelling case study in European banking’s evolution.
While its financial metrics show promise, the bank must navigate operational inefficiencies and ESG execution risks to meet its goals.","Société Générale’s 2026 strategic plan has positioned the bank as a test case for European banking’s dual challenge: balancing profitability with ESG ambitions. With a roadmap targeting a 13% Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under Basel IV, a cost-to-income ratio below 60%, and a return on tangible equity (RoTE) of 9–10%, the bank has made bold financial commitments. Simultaneously, its ESG goals—such as an 80% reduction in upstream oil and gas exposure by 2030 and a €1 billion transition investment fund—reflect a broader industry shift toward sustainability. But can these targets be credibly achieved, and what risks loom over their execution?

Financial Targets: Progress, But Lingering Risks

Société Généale’s Q3 2024 results suggest momentum. The bank’s RoTE surged to 9.6%, up from 3.8% in Q3 2023, and net income quadrupled year-on-year to €1.367 billion [1]. These figures align with its 2026 RoTE goals and underscore the success of cost-cutting measures, including €1.7 billion in savings since 2022 through operational efficiency and retail-banking network consolidation [1]. A CET1 ratio of 13.2% as of Q3 2024 also exceeds the 13% target, bolstering confidence in capital resilience [1].

However, skepticism persists. The bank’s 2022 €3.3 billion loss from exiting the Russian market and underperformance in its French retail-banking division highlight operational vulnerabilities [1]. Analysts caution that the French retail segment, despite layoffs and cost reductions, remains a drag on long-term profitability [1]. While the stock price has risen from €20 to €27 since August 2024, reflecting investor optimism, execution risks—such as macroeconomic headwinds or regulatory shifts—could derail progress.

ESG Commitments: Ambition Meets Complexity

Société Généale’s ESG agenda is arguably its most transformative pillar. The bank aims to reduce upstream oil and gas exposure by 80% by 2030 (50% by 2025) and has launched a €1 billion transition fund to support energy and nature-based projects [1]. These goals align with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and position the bank as a leader in sustainable finance, with a €500 billion target for ESG-linked lending between 2024 and 2030 [3].

Yet execution risks are significant. Reducing oil and gas exposure in a sector still critical to global energy markets requires navigating political and economic trade-offs. For example, while the bank has cut its own carbon footprint by 50% since 2019, decarbonizing its corporate lending portfolio—particularly for energy-intensive clients—remains a complex task [3]. The transition fund’s impact will also depend on the scalability of green projects and the bank’s ability to avoid “greenwashing” accusations.

Third-party recognition, such as inclusion in the MSCI Low Carbon Leaders Index and the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, signals progress [1]. However, specific ESG ratings from MSCI or Sustainalytics remain elusive. A Sustainalytics search for 2025 notes the bank is “not yet rated,” though its Q1 2025 results cited an “excellent rating of 15.4” from the same agency [4]. This inconsistency raises questions about the transparency and consistency of its ESG reporting.

Credit Ratings and Market Confidence

Credit ratings provide mixed signals. Fitch affirmed Société Généale’s long-term rating at “A-” with a stable outlook in 2024, citing its strong CET1 ratio and cost discipline [1]. S&P similarly maintained an “A” rating, reflecting confidence in the bank’s capital position [2]. These ratings suggest that investors and analysts view the bank’s financial strategy as credible, at least in the short term.

However, ESG-related risks could pressure these ratings. For instance, if the bank fails to meet its oil and gas reduction targets or faces controversies over green project efficacy, its ESG credibility—and by extension, its credit profile—could suffer. The bank’s “moderate” controversy level on Sustainalytics (as of August 2025) hints at unresolved risks [5].

Implications for European Banking

Société Généale’s 2026 plan reflects a broader trend in European banking: the convergence of financial and ESG strategies. If successful, it could set a precedent for how banks balance profitability with sustainability. However, its execution risks—particularly in ESG—highlight the challenges of aligning with global climate goals while maintaining shareholder returns.

For investors, the bank’s progress in Q3 2024 is encouraging, but caution is warranted. The retail-banking struggles and ESG reporting gaps underscore that the path to 2026 is far from guaranteed. As one analyst noted, “Société Générale’s plan is ambitious, but ambition alone won’t close the gap between targets and reality” [1].

Conclusion

Société Généale’s 2026 strategic turnaround is a compelling case study in European banking’s evolution. While its financial metrics show promise, the bank must navigate operational inefficiencies and ESG execution risks to meet its goals. For now, the jury is out on whether it can deliver on both fronts—but the stakes for European banking’s future have never been higher.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 12:27:13.019282

Denys Denya, senior executive vice president at Afreximbank, shared how the institution is deploying targeted interventions to drive industrialisation, facilitate intra-African trade, and strengthen the continent’s economic resilience.

Since its inception, Afreximbank’s leadership has been focused on transforming Africa’s export profile, shifting away from raw material exports towards value-added production. Denya shared a personal anecdote: “When I joined, my former boss, who I see in the audience, introduced the Africa Cocoa Initiative. It was designed to stop the export of raw cocoa beans and instead promote value addition. Today, Côte d’Ivoire has the largest cocoa grinding capacity in the world. So, we are making progress.”

The strategy has extended to other commodities. “We have expanded this to cotton. Clothes are now being manufactured in Togo, Benin, and Zimbabwe. But all these initiatives require financing,” Denya explained.

Afreximbank began by assessing its own capacity. “We asked: are we fit for purpose? To access international markets, we got rated. Industrialisation needs long-term capital, but Africa’s capital markets are underdeveloped. So, we started issuing bonds globally in Japan, China, the U.S., and beyond. This has enabled us to mobilise the financial resources needed.”

Still, the challenges remain enormous. “The trade finance gap alone exceeds half a billion. Infrastructure funding needs are just as pressing,” Denya noted. To help address this, Afreximbank has worked to strengthen African financial institutions. “Under President Jean-Louis Ekra’s leadership, we supported institutions to obtain credit ratings from agencies like GCR, enabling them to raise their own capital.”

When international banks like Société Générale and BNP Paribas began retreating from Africa, Afreximbank stepped in. “We helped African entrepreneurs acquire and consolidate these banks, ensuring continued financing for value-added businesses.”

Standardisation is another core focus. Working with the African Union and AfCFTA Secretariat, Afreximbank is helping harmonise product standards across sectors such as pharmaceuticals and manufacturing. “An Egyptian pharmaceutical company can now sell in South Africa or Zimbabwe without repeating testing, this is a game-changer,” Denya said.

To address information asymmetry, the Bank has developed a digital platform that provides trade and regulatory data to help businesses explore and enter new markets. “Many traders don’t know what their neighbors produce. This tool changes that.”

Physical trade barriers are also being tackled. “We’re modernising border posts in partnership with regional blocs. The South Africa–Zimbabwe border has been completed. Work is underway on the Mozambique–South Africa–Zimbabwe corridor, and others including Zambia,” Denya said.

Transit inefficiencies are being resolved too. “Three months ago, I launched the COMESA Transit Bond in Nairobi. With one bond, goods can now cross multiple borders. We aim to roll this out continent-wide.”

On the infrastructure front, Afreximbank is investing in industrial parks through a partnership with ARISE IPP—15 have already been developed. The Bank is also spearheading a battery precursor project at the Zambia–DRC border, along with UNECA. “But we want to go further using lithium from Zimbabwe, manganese from South Africa, and graphite from Mozambique to produce not just precursors, but full batteries locally.”

This local production reduces emissions, curbs youth unemployment, and improves foreign exchange earnings. “Currently, we export raw materials to China and re-import finished products. That’s neither sustainable nor efficient.”

Denya emphasised that industrialisation also requires technology and skills development. “For us, the case for industrialisation is a no-brainer. Afreximbank is pulling every lever, financing, facilitation, and investment guarantees to make it happen.”

During the plenary session, the moderator asked what should be prioritised to accelerate progress: infrastructure, market knowledge, or something else?

“In reality, it’s not just one thing,” the speaker responded. “We must tackle several challenges in parallel.”

Power infrastructure is key. “To build factories, we need electricity. The continent faces power shortages. We must build stations, ports, rail, and road networks.”

Trade financing remains a critical gap. “We’re working to establish trading companies, modeled after Japan’s, to help informal traders pool and sell goods across borders efficiently.”

Standards are essential too. “We’re setting up quality assurance centers to cut costs and reduce the risk of export rejection.”

Payments are another bottleneck. “Most intra-African trade still relies on U.S. dollars or euros. That’s not sustainable. Afreximbank has developed a platform for trade in local currencies. we act like a central bank, settling transactions to boost intra-African trade.”

He said the challenges are complex and interconnected. But Afreximbank’s multi-pronged strategy from mobilising finance to improving infrastructure, standardising trade, and enabling local production is helping to lay the foundation for a more integrated, industrialised, and resilient African economy, he said.",https://cdn.businessday.ng/2022/07/Afrexim-Bank.png,N,,2025-09-07 12:27:15.861084

“This is not only illegal, but it will also hurt consumers by leaving them with higher prices and fewer alternatives,” James said.
These appointees allegedly engaged in private meetings, made secret side agreements, and fired internal attorneys who opposed the deal.

On Friday, James and 17 other attorneys general sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and a federal court in California urging a formal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the merger’s approval.

“This is not only illegal, but it will also hurt consumers by leaving them with higher prices and fewer alternatives,” James said. “Big corporations cannot use their money and power to make backroom deals that let them evade the law.”

Allegations of corruption and undue influence

The coalition argues that the DOJ’s original antitrust lawsuit raised serious concerns — including projected price increases of up to 14% for consumers. Yet the settlement reached with HPE reportedly failed to address any of those concerns.

According to recent reports and statements by former DOJ staffers, senior officials in the DOJ’s Antitrust Division were overruled by political appointees who had personal ties to consultants hired by HPE. These appointees allegedly engaged in private meetings, made secret side agreements, and fired internal attorneys who opposed the deal.

One former DOJ official called the process a “scandal” and accused the department of operating under the “Rule of Lobbyists” instead of the “Rule of Law.”

Legal challenge under the Tunney Act

James and her fellow AGs argue the DOJ may have violated the Tunney Act, a post-Watergate law requiring court approval of antitrust settlements to ensure they serve the public interest — not corporate insiders.

They’re asking the court to hold hearings, investigate the alleged misconduct, and reject the merger settlement if the corruption claims prove true.

You can download it here.

One of the frameworks for leading through change that we cover in the playbook is known as “adaptive leadership” and has deep relevance for the deployment of AI in organizations. Developed by Harvard senior lecturer in public leadership Ronald Heifetz with Riley Sinder and former Harvard professor Marty Linsky, it distinguishes between “technical” challenges and “adaptive” challenges.

With technical problems, the solution is known and the manager needs to just successfully apply it. With adaptive problems, the right approach isn’t actually known yet and managers need to lead teams through the uncertainty that brings, projecting confidence, and also endorsing the experimentation required to find the best solutions.

AI is a clear adaptive challenge—we don’t yet know how the technology will evolve or how it is best applied to specific roles or organizations. You can read Heifetz’s extended advice for leaders today in the playbook. As a preview, here are select excerpts, edited for space and clarity:

In times of adaptive challenges like with business use of AI, what do the best leaders do?

When you’re facing an adaptive challenge, you need a lot of micro adaptations to micro environments throughout a large company through its different functions, product lines, service offerings, interfaces with different locations and so forth. To generate all those micro adaptations or local adaptations to local environments, you want to generate a leadership that’s generating more leadership and that cascades down through the organization.

What that means culturally is a bit of a shift from a highly efficient machine where direction comes from the top and then cascades down with clarity in terms of direction all the way down to the front line so that everybody knows what they’re supposed to be doing and everybody has their weekly meeting judging the metrics and the proxies to control for efficiencies all the way down the line.

When you’re facing an adaptive challenge, you have to shift from that mode of operating to the support of experimentation because to develop the local adaptation to a local environment requires that local person to engage in experimentation. Because it may take moving through lots of iterations before you build what can become a routine process.

The question then becomes, what’s the latest experiment you’ve run? Tell me what’s failed? What’s your next iteration going to look like? Which is a different conversation than the control conversation that would be more sensible in a more efficiency-prioritizing control model in which you’re asking a person for readouts” ‘How can you get your readouts up?’

Readouts are things like how you’re tracking against your targets?

Exactly. I’m thinking of an IKEA or a Best Buy—two companies that I’ve worked with—trying to unleash the leadership at the store level so that each store can have its own local variation because it’s located in a different neighborhood than a store maybe two miles away or 2,000 miles away. But unleashing that local leadership to generate that local adaptation is a little bit unnatural to the cultural DNA of a highly efficient organization that has in the past made it in the marketplace because of its capacity to create a cookie-cutter model where you have consistency down through the line.

Are there other common mistakes that you see in adaptive situations like we are with AI?

I’ve worked with a lot of authority figures and there’s a spectrum. Some people are comfortable speaking with a voice of authority without having answers. They can speak with a voice of authority where they’re raising questions and stating uncertainties. They can speak with the voice of authority saying, ‘Here’s my risk analysis. Here are the uncertainties. Here are the questions we need to answer. And I hope we aim to answer these questions within X amount of months, but I’m going to come back to you because it’s a moving target.’

Other people don’t feel comfortable speaking with that voice of authority unless they actually have those answers. With different people, I have to work with them to get more comfortable not having the answers without losing their voice of authority. For other people—particularly people who are new to authority positions, which often includes women—it’s how to speak with a voice of authority where you’re simply stating questions and facts and have to speak with confidence even when you might be really very nervous inside because the uncertainties are so real.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/charter-heifetz.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1,N,,2025-09-07 12:26:24.830993

That's as damning as you can get from Buffett, who generally keeps his specific stock opinions to himself. The market reaction, which was a swift drop in the stock price, also made it pretty clear what investors generally thought of the idea of a corporate split-up. Technically speaking, it will be a spinoff, with investors getting shares in a new company.

As is often the case, management is saying that both of the new businesses will benefit from having focused management teams. There's a certain logic to that, since the separation will simplify the business structure.

However, two struggling businesses aren't necessarily better than one, which is Buffett's big takeaway. It's hardly clear that this fixes anything and looks more like corporate engineering than anything else.

Investors should tread with caution

If bringing Kraft and Heinz together couldn't unlock value, why would separating them create value? That's the question you need to ask yourself as you consider Kraft Heinz's latest move. Buffett is pretty clear in his opinion that the company's problems run too deep for a split-up to turn either of the resulting businesses around.

Does that make this decision a mistake? The answer has yet to be determined, of course. But what's almost certain is that the company's near-term priorities are likely going to be focused more on the split than on fixing its underlying business. Kicking the can down the road, which is what this decision looks like, rarely works out well for anyone.

At least one prominent investor isn't pleased with this decision, though.

That investor, Warren Buffett, is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -1.26%) (BRK.B -1.40%), which happens to be Kraft Heinz's largest shareholder, and his opinion is a big deal.

Is Kraft Heinz making a mistake?

The saga of Kraft Heinz

Kraft Heinz is one of the world's largest consumer staples companies. It owns a portfolio of iconic packaged foods brands that most people know, including Kraft Mac & Cheese and Jell-O, among many others. Since food is a life necessity, companies like Kraft Heinz are generally considered reliable businesses that hold up well, regardless of the economic or market environment.

That said, even iconic brands get tired, so packaged-food companies like Kraft Heinz are always looking for ways to reinvest themselves and keep costs in check. This is where the story really begins, because the merger that created Kraft Heinz brought together Kraft and Heinz with the main goal of cost-cutting. Berkshire Hathaway supported that merger and is the combined company's largest shareholder as a result of the pairing.

There's just one problem -- the merger didn't go as well as hoped for. Yes, there was corporate bloat that needed to be eliminated. But originally, the focus was so heavy on cost-cutting that investing in brands took a back seat. When it became clear that Kraft Heinz was falling behind its competition, the board of directors changed the company's leadership. The new CEO started investing more heavily in innovation and marketing and sold off brands that were no longer seen as desirable.

This is typical behavior in the packaged-food space, as companies try to adjust along with consumer tastes. However, it wasn't enough to fix the problem. Kraft Heinz still had a lot of brands that weren't resonating with consumers.

The final solution?

This leads to the recent turn of events, in which the company appears to be throwing up its hands and giving up on the Kraft Heinz merger. Splitting the company in two, as is the plan, is not going over well with investors, and that list includes Warren Buffett.

The Oracle of Omaha had already labeled the Kraft Heinz deal a mistake, having previously stated that he overpaid for the investment. But now, his comments are even more notable, as he believes the split won't actually solve the problems the company faces.

That's as damning as you can get from Buffett, who generally keeps his specific stock opinions to himself.

J&J has argued that patients do not want to use toxic chemotherapy in a first-line setting and that using it in the first line can complicate subsequent treatment options.
In Flaura2, patients had a long chemo-free period, as the median exposure time to pemetrexed was just 8.3 months versus 30.5 months for Tagrisso.
By comparison, patients in the Tagrisso monotherapy arm stayed on the EGFR inhibitor for a median 21.2 months.
J&J is working on improving the drug’s profile by developing a subcutaneous version of the intravenous infusion and by introducing prophylactic regimens to reduce certain dermatological and cardiovascular adverse reactions.","Facing increased EGFR competition from a new drug combination by Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca has come up with its own solution to prolong the lives of patients who take the company’s decade-old medicine Tagrisso.

The method involves pairing Tagrisso with chemotherapy. The combo significantly reduced the risk of death by 23% compared with Tagrisso alone in patients with previously untreated EGFR-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer, an updated analysis of the phase 3 Flaura2 trial has found.

Patients who received Tagrisso and chemo lived a median 47.5 months, versus 37.6 months for the Tagrisso monotherapy group, according to data presented at the 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer in Barcelona, Spain.

The latest data drop helps re-level the playing field for Tagrisso after J&J’s combination of Rybrevant and Lazcluze recently became the first regimen to demonstrate an overall survival benefit against Tagrisso in first-line EGFR-mutated NSCLC.

In the phase 3 Mariposa study, the Rybrevant-Lazcluze pair led to a statistically significant 25% reduction in the risk of death versus Tagrisso, extending patients’ projected median survival time by at least one year based on the investigators’ estimate.

The J&J regimen’s data appear to be better in terms of both magnitude of death risk reduction and median survival time improvement. However, the difference is narrow, especially considering the intrinsic flaws of cross-trial comparison.

J&J has argued that patients do not want to use toxic chemotherapy in a first-line setting and that using it in the first line can complicate subsequent treatment options. Pemetrexed and platinum-based chemo were Tagrisso’s combo partners for Flaura2.

“When patients express not wanting chemotherapy to be part of their treatment, what we understand that they’re really talking about is not wanting to go into an infusion center [...] and talking about not wanting to have a toxicity profile that they associate with chemotherapy,” AZ’s oncology business chief, David Fredrickson, said in an interview with Fierce Pharma.

In Flaura2, patients had a long chemo-free period, as the median exposure time to pemetrexed was just 8.3 months versus 30.5 months for Tagrisso. Importantly, the reason for half of pemetrexed discontinuations was side effects. Pemetrexed was supposed to be used together with Tagrisso in the maintenance phase.

By comparison, patients in the Tagrisso monotherapy arm stayed on the EGFR inhibitor for a median 21.2 months.

To Fredrickson, the combo’s ability to extend patients’ exposure to Tagrisso makes a compelling case to doctors.

“Those data will be particularly compelling for physicians to be now thinking about who can tolerate the addition of chemo, who has the ability to take a little bit less convenience because they’re able to come into the office,” Fredrickson said. “But if you’ve got patients that fit that criteria, I think that Flaura2 becomes a very attractive opportunity.”

Among patients who discontinued Tagrisso because of disease progression, 69% in Flaura2’s experimental arm received subsequent treatment. Within that subgroup, 44% patients were re-challenged with platinum-based chemo, whereas 30% received other types of chemo. In the Tagrisso monotherapy arm, the rates were 77%, 72% and 3%, respectively.

Again, the proportion of patients who were able to receive a subsequent treatment following disease progression was not materially different for J&J’s Rybrevant-Lazcluze combo, at 74% in Mariposa.

Whatever changes the use of chemo in the first line may introduce to subsequent treatment plans, investigators noted that the Flaura2 regimen’s overall survival benefit was clear against standard Tagrisso monotherapy followed by chemo.

Besides, although a chemo-free option, Rybrevant has its own tolerability issues. J&J is working on improving the drug’s profile by developing a subcutaneous version of the intravenous infusion and by introducing prophylactic regimens to reduce certain dermatological and cardiovascular adverse reactions. Even though the under-the-skin formulation significantly reduces the time of administration, patients still need to go to a healthcare facility to get the drug.

To further complicate physicians’ treatment decision-making process in the real world, Rybrevant plus chemo is approved as a second-line option for patients who have progressed on Tagrisso or other EGFR inhibitors.

So far, there are no direct data on whether using Rybrevant upfront is a better idea than saving it for the second line. Mariposa didn’t allow crossover in the control arm, and the majority—if not all—of the control arm patients in Flaura2 didn’t get Rybrevant as their second-line treatment.

Rybrevant and Lazcluze have been gaining traction since their first-line approval about a year ago. In the second quarter, the pair delivered $179 million in global sales for 26.5% sequential growth.

During an investor call in July before AZ announced Flaura2’s positive overall survival readout, J&J’s chair of innovative medicine, Jennifer Taubert, noted that Rybrevant-Lazcluze was the top regimen that doctors said they intend to prescribe for front-line patients.

But AZ is not seeing many signs of repeated use of the competitor regimen, according to Fredrickson. The AZ exec also suggested that academic centers tend to be more open to newer regimens with unfamiliar side effect profiles, whereas in the community setting, where the lion’s share of lung cancer patients are treated, doctors are more comfortable with the established profiles of Tagrisso and chemotherapy.

Even before the positive overall survival readout from Flaura2, the Tagrisso-chemo regimen has seen the fastest growth in the combo space, Fredrickson said. “I have every reason to believe that that momentum should only strengthen with the presentation of these data.”",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/AstraZeneca_5.jpg?VersionId=Zn.jKHSMGqnpus0Oc7mi4cBIm2L.7mIM,N,,2025-09-07 06:04:37.425762

Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, expressed his disappointment over Kraft Heinz's decision to split into two companies, reversing the $31 billion merger he helped orchestrate in 2015. The move, announced on Tuesday, has drawn criticism from Buffett, who called it a reversal of his investment mistake [1].

The merger, which combined Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz, has been a source of contention for Buffett, who has publicly acknowledged that the deal did not turn out to be a brilliant idea [1]. Despite the setbacks, Buffett has remained a steadfast shareholder, owning a 27.5% stake in the company [1].

The split, scheduled for 2026, aims to separate Kraft Heinz into two entities: one focusing on global sauces, condiments, and shelf-stable products, and the other centered on North American staples like Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles, and Lunchables [2]. The decision to split the company was driven by years of sluggish performance and a 70% drop in the company's stock price since the merger [2].

Buffett's comments, made to CNBC, highlighted his disapproval of the split, stating that dismantling the company is unlikely to fix its deeper problems [1].

Buffett did not rule out the possibility of selling Berkshire's stake in Kraft Heinz but indicated that any sale would require the same offer to be made to other shareholders unless someone is willing to buy the entire company [1].

The split has been met with mixed reactions from analysts and investors. While some believe it could address long-standing issues around efficiency and allow for more focused strategies, others have expressed concerns about the potential challenges for both new companies [3].

A new study shows that while overall brand loyalty has dipped in the first half of 2025, General Motors managed to take the top spot among multi-brand manufacturers. Ford, meanwhile, secured the highest loyalty rate of any individual brand.

The numbers suggest the auto industry is continuing to find its footing after the disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic, even if some of last year’s loyalty gains have already begun to fade. They also show how customer loyalty is splintering, with some brands climbing while others lose ground.

Data from S&P Global reveals that during the January-June period, GM led all multi-brand manufacturers with a loyalty rate of 68.1 percent. The Ford, Toyota, Hyundai, and Honda groups followed in the rankings, while the Volkswagen Group trailed the field at 43 percent.

While the study did not provide a breakdown of the loyalty rates for each individual brand under the GM umbrella, it did reveal that the Chevrolet Equinox ranked as the single model loyalty leader at 42.7 percent. Evidently, those who own an Equinox are very happy to get behind the wheel of another one.

Standouts Among Brands

Looking at individual marques, Ford ranked first with a loyalty rate of 58.9 percent. Close behind were Chevrolet, Toyota, Tesla, and Honda, though Tesla’s score slipped more than 12 points to 56 percent. Ford’s performance was bolstered by models such as the F-series, Expedition, and Bronco Sport, each earning loyalty rates above 60 percent.

Mini posted the strongest growth, lifting its loyalty rate by 4.6 percentage points year over year. At the other end of the spectrum, VinFast experienced the sharpest decline, tumbling nearly 34 points to 36 percent. Fiat trailed the entire market with a loyalty rate of just 4.3 percent.

The study shows that through the first six months of this year, average brand loyalty across the car industry was sitting at 51.1 percent. This represents a 1.4 percent fall from the same period in 2024, but is slightly higher than the 50.6 percent through the first half of 2023 and the same 50.6 percent in the first half of 2022. However, it is down from 52.7 percent in H1 of 2021 as well as 54.8 percent through the first half of 2020.

Competition and Cross-Shopping

According to S&P, about half of all brands saw loyalty drop by at least one percentage point year over year. Both mainstream and luxury segments were affected.

Vince Palomarez, associate director of loyalty product management at S&P Global Mobility, explained the shift: “The loyalty rate shift this year reflects the balance between a steady return-to-market volume and strong competition among brands. Households are returning to market, but many are open to cross-shopping in ways we didn’t see during the height of pre-pandemic loyalty.”

As buyers have become less likely to stick with the same brand, conquest activity has picked up.

New vision for stores

CEO Corie Barry told CNBC that the company is implementing ""significant changes"" to store formats, opening smaller locations in new markets, and investing in new experimental stores in major cities.

""This is an evolution, and I like these layouts,"" she noted.

""We are working on a smaller store that can fit well into markets like Miami or Atlanta, where we've seen significant growth, or enter a new market.""

""We just opened a new store in Bozeman, Montana, as this is a format that can really work in a smaller setting.""

Meanwhile, Best Buy plans to implement bright flagship stores designed to impress customers.

""We are working on genuine experimental stores with all the modern conveniences in partnership with our suppliers,"" Barry added.

New technologies and challenges

These changes come against the backdrop of the company's growth in areas related to artificial intelligence, health technology, and computer updates — categories that, according to Barry, are ensuring steady demand.

""Computing technology has been growing for six consecutive quarters,"" she explained, adding that updates related to artificial intelligence and Windows 10 will sustain high demand.

Best Buy is also not shying away from challenges such as tariffs. Barry emphasized that their team is monitoring costs while diversifying supply and organizing product assortment.

For customers, this means an expanded selection.

""If we have something for you and your budget, that is our main goal,"" Barry stated.

Performance and forecasts

She also noted that sales are approaching the upper limits of expectations after a successful quarter, while expressing caution due to ""high volatility among consumers.""

Gaming and computing technologies are leaders in growth, while sales of home appliances and home theaters are declining, reflecting global trends as consumers shy away from large expenditures on home projects.

Health technology remains a ""very important"" component of the business, particularly in light of the popularity of devices such as Apple Watch and Oura ring, as well as technologies promoting comfortable aging at home.

""Every ounce of investment is aimed at improving healthcare management,"" she emphasized.

Regarding tariffs, Barry noted that ""the effective tariff rate is currently about 16 percent,"" but emphasized that Best Buy has managed to keep the impact on customers ""materially lower"" through careful supplier selection and assortment.

This retailer is one of the most beloved stores, but with the pressure that many retailers have to deal with, some cannot continue to fight. However, it is always a massive surprise if it is supermarkets that are closing stores. It may not be the retail giants like Walmart or Kroger, but it will have a significant impact on consumers.

The story behind store closures

Over the past few months, many retailers, grocery chains, and supermarkets announced several store closures. Now, one of the popular supermarkets is planning to close four stores by mid-October 2025. Some of the big names that have been closing stores in the retail industry in 2025. Examples of these big retail names are Kroger, Rite Aid, and At Home.

In some cases, the store closures go hand-in-hand with bankruptcy that the companies may experience. Also, the retail industry has seen several big names file for Chapter 11 in recent years. Below is a list of some of these big names retailers that used to be consumer favorites such as:

Party City

Joann

Forever 21

Claire’s

Big Lots

In addition, this influx of bankruptcies and store closures does not come as a surprise at all. Especially given the economic conditions these past few years, and now that the companies are burdened with high tariff rates on imported products.

Affected locations

There is always a reason why Shoppers Food is such a beloved supermarket in the Baltimore-Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. This grocery chain is known for its daily low prices and affordable store brands, but also quality products. In addition, Shoppers Food is also a big supporter of being active in the local communities. It is doing amazing work such as often sponsoring school initiatives and providing assistance to stock food banks.

However, just like many other grocery chains and supermarkets, Shoppers Food finds itself making difficult decisions in the context of its store footprint. The company recently made and announcement where it announced its plan to close four store locations by October 11, 2025. Below is the list of the four locations that will be affected.

Location – 2286 Middlesex, 1200 Eastern Blvd., Essex, MD

Location – 2339 New Carrollton, 7790 Riverdale Rd., New Carrollton, MD

Location – 2349/2414 Waldorf, 1170 W. Smallwood Dr., Waldorf, MD

Location – 2374 Westminster, 551 Jermor Ln., Westminster, MD

The reason behind the supermarket closures

One would have thought that the time when consumers decided to make thorough decisions when it comes to consumer spending, retailers and supermarkets would try their best to shine. After all, it was the decision of consumers to start being more selective when it comes to their spending. The reason for this is the increase prices of products due to the high tariff rates.

In addition, consumers have been and is still going to start cutting back on nonessential spending due to the cost of the economy. Consumers are apt to swap restaurant meals for ones they believe they can prepare at home. They are also going for much cheaper products and looking for alternative to what they have always been used to.

However, many supermarkets encounter their own unique challenges in the current state of the economy. Some of this challenge includes important aspects such as:

Higher product costs

Higher food costs

Increased competition

Also, it is important to note that the latter may be hurting smaller chains especially. In addition, the company did not provide a specific reason for these store closures. Instead, it made the following statement, “We’re constantly working to optimize our footprint, which includes investing in stores as well as closing stores where necessary so we can operate as effectively and efficiently as possible.”",https://www.eldiario24.com/us/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/retailer.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 03:05:00.650711

Many unhappy consumers took their frustration to social media and shared what these two retailers have been doing. Both retailers have allegedly instructed employees of their respective stores to remove the tags from several in-store clothing and consumers have been making noise about this.

Torn-off price tags on clothing items

Both Walmart and Target started this around the same time. The consumers and employees of these retailers have been sharing their unhappiness with what is going on in stores on social media. They have been posting several pictures and videos where it is evident that the price tags of certain clothing items are torn off.

These videos posted on social media show that employees are removing the bottom portion of the price tag, and consumers have also discovered ripped tags in stores. Other posts indicate whole displays of clothing for brands like Walmart’s Wonder Nation and Target’s Auden at stores across the country that has altered tags.

The reason for this behaviour

Many believe that this is a strategy for the retailers to adjust the prices of the products. The price tags on the items are removed, so that the retailer can increase the price when the consumer pays for it. As a result, this price paid for at checkout significantly differs from that of the signs showed in the store.

The social media posters claims that the removal of the prices tags will allow retailers to remove the prices more easily. This whole situation might be because of the pressure that came with the high tariff rates that was enforced on retailers by the United States of America’s President, Donald Trump.

This may be a response to tariffs, since retailers have been forced to increase the prices of imported products. These are the moves made by the retailers, that have garnered criticism from their respectively employees. These employees stated that their shifts have been dedicated to this task. Also, consumers have been criticising them as well, and they believe the retailers are trying to conceal price increases.

Feedback the retailers provided to Retail Brew

Retail Brew is a platform focusing on bring the latest retail news to consumers. It paid a visit to a New York City Target location on August 21 and 22, 2025. A significant number of prices tags that were removed were found by Retail Brew. These tags were specifically found amongst the retailer’s private-label brands such as Auden, All in Motion, and A New Day.

In addition, many of these clothing items were not re-stickered and it also had no indication of the price. It has also been found that one of the items was not recognized by Target’s app when Retail Brew scanned its barcode. On the other hand, at an Auden underwear display it was found that most price tags were removed.

Retail Brew identified a handful of tags that has been untouched, and that the scanned barcodes indicated prices that are $1–$2 higher than the priced printed on the tag. Therefore, it can be argued that some of these products had been re-stickered with higher prices, which had increases of $2–$5.

In as similar case, one of the TikTok videos that was posted on social media, was recorded in the retail giant, Walmart. This location indicated stray unaltered price tags, which were different and higher on-rack pricing signs. When asked about this, Jaeme Laczkowski the Walmart director of media relations, responded to Retail Brew. He stated that the price tags changes at the retailer came after the retailer enacted a new labeling process across all brands. This occurred in its fashion department in May 2025, and it led to instructing employees to remove select perforated price tags,",https://www.eldiario24.com/us/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walmart-target.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 01:04:25.377874

The Intellectual Property Office is seeking views from independent creators, luxury brands, and other professionals. With around 80,000 businesses and nearly 2 million jobs, the sector is a critical driver of growth.

From the runways of London Fashion Week to British automotive engineering excellence, British design sets international trends and drives economic growth. Spanning everything from traditional craftsmanship to cutting-edge digital design, British creativity helps shape the world, Intellectual Property Office said in a release.

“From Mini to Burberry and the London Underground map, British design is renowned worldwide for its creativity and innovation. These reforms will help remove barriers and make it easier for designers of all shapes and sizes to protect their creations - cementing our position as one of the world’s leading destinations for design investment and innovation,” Feryal Clark MP, Minister for Intellectual Property said in a release.

The consultation addresses key challenges: a patchwork of overlapping rights causing confusion, abuse through dishonest filings, post-Brexit complications, and outdated rules failing to protect modern digital and AI-created designs.

Proposals include fighting design theft through enhanced search and examination powers, stronger bad faith provisions, and the rejection of filings that lack novelty.

Another focus is on streamlining processes by harmonising procedures, consolidating unregistered rights, providing clearer guidance, and introducing deferment provisions for up to 18 months. The proposals also aim to resolve Brexit-related issues by offering practical solutions for designs that lost automatic UK–EU protection.

In terms of enforcement and justice, a new small claims track within the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court is suggested to enable affordable resolution of design disputes. Finally, to modernise for digital innovation, the proposals recommend accepting CAD files and video evidence, updating definitions, and reviewing the scope of protection for AI-created designs.

“Design is at the heart of everything we do as a creative nation. However, protecting brilliant design ideas has become unnecessarily complex. If you’re a small business or start-up with an innovative idea, you shouldn’t need extensive legal expertise just to navigate the system. That’s why we’re consulting on simplifying our designs framework. We want to remove the barriers that hold back creators and make protection straightforward and accessible. Because when we get this right, we’re not just supporting individual designers – we’re building the foundation for the next wave of British innovation that will drive growth right across the country,” Chris Bryant MP, Minister for the Creative Industries, said.

Officials say these changes could deliver the most significant reform in decades, ensuring Britain’s designers are equipped to compete globally. Consultation responses will help shape final policy options for Ministers.

“The UK Fashion & Textile Association welcomes this consultation and is committed to working with the IPO to ensure robust design rights and effective protection mechanisms that support UK creatives and help build a world-class design rights framework,” Paul Alger MBE, international business director, UK Fashion and Textile Association, said.

“The British Retail Consortium welcomes the Government’s consultation on modernising the UK’s design protection system. Design is fundamental to retail success - from innovative packaging and store layouts to digital interfaces that enhance the customer experience,” noted Helen Dickinson OBE, CEO of the British Retail Consortium.

The Government has launched a 12-week consultation to modernise the UK's design protection system, worth £100 billion (~$135.08 billion) annually and supporting 2 million jobs. Proposals target design theft, simplify complex rights, resolve post-Brexit challenges, and strengthen digital and AI protections. Running until November 27, 2025, the review invites input from designers and legal professionals.

September 5, 2025

The nation’s largest retail pharmacy chain now plans to offer the updated COVID vaccine in Nevada, the Current confirmed Friday.

CVS confirmed the Nevada Board of Pharmacy issued new guidance Friday and as a result the vaccines will be made available, though they offered no timeline on when people can expect to receive them.

“Following today’s regulatory action by the Nevada Board of Pharmacy, CVS Pharmacy will ensure COVID-19 vaccinations are available as soon as possible at our pharmacies throughout the state,” a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement Friday.

CVS previously announced it would not offer the updated COVID vaccine in Nevada and two other states because they only allow pharmacists to administer drugs that have been approved by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. That panel has not approved this season’s COVID vaccine and now includes vaccine skeptics appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

According to The Nevada Independent, which first reported the new guidance, the Board of Pharmacy’s position is that pharmacists are allowed to widely administer vaccines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The Board of Pharmacy did not immediately respond to the Current Friday afternoon. The board’s website, which typically lists regulations and announcements, is currently offline because it was impacted by the recent ransomware attack on the state’s information technology.

A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, who on Thursday called the state to take action as soon as possible to address vaccine access, said the legislative leader plans to review the new guidance “to determine whether this is a sufficient long-term fix or whether it’s just a temporary solution and further action may be needed.”

AXA XL Reinsurance leans on scenario planning.
For AXA XL Reinsurance, capital allocation is always tied to client needs, but robustness comes first.
AI is already helping AXA XL Reinsurance process unstructured data and free up underwriters and claims handlers for higher-value tasks.
Renaud Guidée is the chief executive officer at AXA XL Reinsurance.","Wildfires used to be treated as secondary peril. Not any more, says AXA XL’s Reinsurance chief executive Guidée. As insured values climb in exposed areas and fires become systemic, he argues the industry must put prevention and mitigation at the top of its agenda – or risk falling behind fast-changing realities.

Key Points:

Wildfire risk no longer a secondary peril

Reinsurers must earn cost of capital

Balanced portfolios drive robustness

For Guidée, wildfires illustrate a broader reality; losses are not driven by hazard alone, but by exposure and vulnerability. In regions such as the wildland urban interface or amenity rich but fragile areas such as Lake Tahoe geography and limited escape routes amplify the threat. “How we mitigate our vulnerability is a key feature on which the industry, public authorities and the broader community should work,” he said in an interview with Monte Carlo Today.

That focus on resilience runs through all Guidée’s thinking. Reinsurers, clients and regulators talk about it often, but he treats it as the industry’s ultimate test – the ability to withstand climate volatility, systemic shocks and new technological risks without leaving clients exposed.

AXA XL Reinsurance’s approach to systemic risks is rooted in vigilance and preparation. The group stays “constantly on alert”, Guidée explained, by investing in expertise both internally and through academic partnerships, including its collaboration with the Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies. Knowledge and people, he stressed, form the first pillar of resilience.

“You don’t want your ultimate backstop to be fragile. ”

The second is data. Decades of accumulated experience must be used wisely, balanced against new evidence. “You want to make sure that you can capture shifting patterns or emerging trends while not falling into the trap of recency bias,” he said.

AXA XL Reinsurance leans on scenario planning. Structured stress-tests, he argued, provide a sturdy framework for preparing for systemic shocks and managing uncertainty.

That mindset also informs his market view ahead of the 1/1 renewals. Conditions are improving, he believes, but discipline must hold. “Reinsurers must earn their cost of capital,” he said, pointing out that for many years the sector failed to do so, leaving the ecosystem dangerously exposed.

“You don’t want your ultimate backstop to be fragile,” he added, reminding us that financial resilience underpins the industry’s social function, as well as its commercial one.

He said with four quarters of strong earnings and capacity rebuilding, the balance between supply and demand looks more stable. In the US, ceded premiums have been rising in high single-digit to low-teen percentages, reflecting both demand and rate movements.

For AXA XL Reinsurance, capital allocation is always tied to client needs, but robustness comes first. A balanced portfolio across geographies and product lines underpins resilience. That diversification, Guidée argued, ensures the ability to stand by clients when shocks hit.

Reinsurers also serve a social purpose by extending capacity to underserved regions, enabling insurance cover that which may otherwise not exist.

Technology is another area where Guidée sees opportunity but also limits. AI is already helping AXA XL Reinsurance process unstructured data and free up underwriters and claims handlers for higher-value tasks. But it is no silver bullet. “We are, and we will remain, a client-centric organisation,” he said. “AI is an enabler, not a replacement.” Human judgment, he insists, will remain central to the business.

As Monte Carlo turns its attention to resilience, capacity and innovation, Guidée’s message is that the industry cannot afford fragility. “You need robust reinsurers for the whole system to work,” he concluded.

With its recent strategic moves, conference engagements, and financial resilience, this company is positioning itself as a critical player in the evolving energy landscape. But can its participation in high-profile events like the Barclays 2025 CEO Energy-Power Conference translate into meaningful institutional exposure and a re-rating of its stock? Let’s break it down.

Strategic Acquisitions and Operational Gains: The Foundation of Growth

Flowco’s acquisition of 155 high-pressure gas lift (HPGL) and vapor recovery unit (VRU) systems from Archrock in Q2 2025 is no small feat. These assets directly bolster its high-margin rental fleet, which already generates robust cash flow. For context, the company reported and in Q2 2025, driven by strong demand in HPGL and VRU solutions [1]. This isn’t just about scale—it’s about securing a recurring revenue stream in a sector where producers are increasingly prioritizing cost efficiency and methane abatement [3].

The acquisition also aligns with Flowco’s vertically integrated manufacturing platform, reducing reliance on third-party suppliers and enhancing margins. As one analyst put it, “Flowco is building a moat around its production optimization solutions, and the Archrock assets are a key brick in that wall” [2].

Conference Participation: A Stage for Institutional Engagement

Flowco’s decision to present at the Barclays 2025 CEO Energy-Power Conference on September 3, 2025, isn’t just a box-ticking exercise—it’s a calculated move to amplify its visibility among institutional investors. Barclays’ event is a magnet for energy-sector stakeholders, and Flowco’s management team will have the chance to highlight its strategic roadmap, including its Texas-based supply chain and digital monitoring tools [5].

What’s more, the company’s dual listing on NYSE Texas—announced in August 2025—signals a commitment to its home state’s energy ecosystem, which could resonate with regional investors and ESG-focused funds [5]. While no post-conference partnerships were immediately disclosed, the mere act of participating in such a high-profile event often sparks follow-up conversations with asset managers and hedge funds [4].

Earnings Miss vs. Stock Resilience: A Tale of Two Narratives

Here’s where it gets interesting. . , . Why? Because investors are starting to separate the noise from the signal.

Flowco’s and “GREAT” Financial Health Score [1] suggest operational discipline, even in a tough macro environment. Moreover, , especially given its exposure to non-discretionary services like methane capture. As one market observer noted, “Flowco’s earnings miss was a blip, but its long-term value proposition remains intact” [3].

Institutional Buy-In and Re-Rating Potential

The institutional angle is critical. Post-Q2, Flowco attracted new investments from heavyweights like Vanguard Group and T. Rowe Price [4], signaling confidence in its capital-light business model. Meanwhile, its participation in Barclays’ conference could unlock further interest, particularly as energy transition themes gain traction.

Analysts’ price targets ($26–$34) imply a potential from its current level [1], but re-rating hinges on execution. Flowco’s recent dual listing on NYSE Texas and its focus on U.S.-based manufacturing are tailwinds, but the company must continue delivering margin expansion and fleet growth to justify higher multiples.

The Bottom Line: A Buy for the Long Game

Flowco isn’t a short-term trade—it’s a long-term bet on the convergence of energy transition and production optimization. Its strategic acquisitions, conference visibility, and financial discipline position it to capitalize on industry tailwinds. While the Q2 earnings miss is a speed bump, the broader narrative—strong cash flow, institutional buy-in, and a clear path to margin expansion—remains compelling.

If Flowco can maintain its operational momentum and leverage its Barclays presentation to deepen institutional relationships, a re-rating isn’t just possible—it’s probable. For investors with a multi-year horizon, FLOC offers a unique blend of defensiveness and growth in a sector that’s anything but static.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 03:04:49.854470

The Risks and Rewards of Founder Ethos While founder-led companies offer resilience, they are not without risks.
Founder-led companies with adversity-driven mental models are outperforming peers by engineering volatility into their strategies.","In an era of geopolitical turbulence, AI-driven disruption, and economic cycles that test even the most seasoned investors, a quiet revolution is unfolding in the stock market. Founder-led companies—those guided by leaders who treat adversity as a catalyst rather than a setback—are outperforming their peers by a staggering margin. These firms, rooted in grit and long-term mission, are not just surviving volatility; they are engineering it into their DNA. For investors, the question is no longer if to prioritize founder ethos, but how to identify the undervalued gems where resilience meets innovation.

The Mental Models of Adversity-Driven Founders

The resilience premium begins with a founder's mindset. Consider Chung Ju-Yung of Hyundai, who transformed a postwar South Korea into a global automotive powerhouse. His mantra—“use both sides of a sheet of paper”—embodied a philosophy of frugality and innovation. During the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, while competitors slashed R&D, Hyundai maintained a 6% investment in research, acquired Kia, and introduced a 10-year warranty to rebuild trust. By 2010, the company had grown unit sales by 2% in a collapsing industry.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway offers a parallel. His “circle of competence” and “margin of safety” principles have turned crises into opportunities. During the 2020 pandemic, Buffett increased stakes in Apple and Amazon, capitalizing on undervalued assets. His focus on durable businesses with unbreachable moats—like Coca-Cola and Apple—has delivered a 12% annualized return over the past decade, outpacing the S&P 500 by 300 basis points.

These leaders share a common thread: they reject short-termism in favor of frameworks that prioritize risk mitigation, cultural alignment, and compounding value. As a 2025 study by the Long-Term Stock Exchange found, founder-led companies outperformed professionally managed peers by 38% during economic downturns, driven by high R&D investment (often exceeding 25%) and strong EBITDA margins.

Case Studies: Undervalued Founder-Led Powerhouses

The resilience premium is not confined to legacy firms. Modern analogues like Medtronic, NXP Semiconductors, and Spotify are rewriting the playbook.

Medtronic (MDT), founded by Earl Bakken in 1949, . . A recent acquisition of Inari Medical expanded its peripheral vascular footprint, .

NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), , exemplifies founder-driven innovation. , .

Spotify (SPOT), under Daniel Ek's leadership, has turned adversity into growth. Despite a 2022 stock drawdown, . .

The GRIT Framework: Measuring Resilience

To identify undervalued founder-led companies, investors should apply the GRIT framework:

Growth: Look for R&D-to-revenue ratios above 20% (e.g., Tesla's 25%, Nvidia's 25%).

Recognition: Assess EBITDA margins and employee retention rates. Hyundai's 90% retention during the 2008 crisis is a benchmark.

Inspiration: Evaluate governance structures. Companies with dual-class shares (e.g., Meta's 61% voting control) must balance founder vision with shareholder accountability.

Trust: Prioritize firms with low leverage (e.g., Hyundai's 0.8x debt-to-EBITDA) and transparent capital allocation.

The Risks and Rewards of Founder Ethos

While founder-led companies offer resilience, they are not without risks. Concentrated control can lead to governance pitfalls, as seen in Australian firms like Kogan.com and Aristocrat Leisure. However, these risks can be mitigated through independent boards, sunset clauses for dual-class shares, and robust ESG frameworks.

For investors, the key is to align with founders who embed resilience into their corporate culture. Consider Associated Banc-Corp (ACBI), which has delivered 40.5% annual earnings growth since 2020 under a mission-driven leadership model. Or Nvidia (NVDA), whose 36.6% annual total return since 1999 is a testament to Jensen Huang's long-term vision.

Conclusion: Building a Resilience-Driven Portfolio

The resilience premium is not a fleeting trend—it is a structural shift in how value is created. Founder-led companies with adversity-driven mental models are outperforming peers by engineering volatility into their strategies. For investors, the path forward is clear: prioritize firms with high R&D investment, low leverage, and a culture of compounding innovation.

As the 2025 Long-Term Stock Exchange study concludes, “The future belongs to companies that treat crises as catalysts.” By identifying undervalued founder-led firms with grit and mission, investors can build portfolios that thrive in any economic climate.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 00:05:09.123486

The plan her employer offers stopped covering GLP-1s for weight loss right around the time she joined.","After losing 50 pounds on the injectable weight loss medication Zepbound, Kyra Wensley received a surprising letter from her pharmacy benefit manager in April.

Her request for coverage had been denied, the letter said, because she'd had a body mass index of less than 35 when she started Zepbound. The 25-year-old who lives in New York had been taking Zepbound without incident for months, so she was confused: Why was her BMI, which had been around 32 when she started, becoming an issue only now?

Wensley had no interest in quitting an effective drug. ""Going right off like that, it's easier said than done,"" she said.

Her doctor fought to keep her on the GLP-1 agonist, the category that includes weight loss and type 2 diabetes drugs Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound. But Wensley ultimately had to switch from Zepbound to Wegovy to meet her plan's requirements. She said she doesn't like Wegovy as much as her old medication, but she now feels lucky to be on any GLP-1.

Lots of research suggests such medications must be used indefinitely to maintain weight loss and related health benefits. But with list prices of roughly $1,000 a month, public and private payers are struggling to keep up with ballooning demand for GLP-1 weight loss drugs and in some cases are eliminating or restricting their coverage as a result.

North Carolina Medicaid plans to end GLP-1 coverage for weight loss on Oct. 1, just over a year after starting the coverage. Pennsylvania is planning to limit Medicaid coverage to beneficiaries at the highest risk of complications from obesity. And despite recent reports of a potential federal pilot program to extend coverage of GLP-1 obesity drugs under Medicaid and Medicare, all state Medicaid programs are likely to be under pressure due to steep spending cuts in the budget reconciliation package recently signed into law by President Donald Trump.

Already, many GLP-1 users quit within a year, studies suggest — often due to side effects, high costs, or insurance issues. Now a growing number of researchers, payers, and providers are exploring deliberate ""deprescription,"" which aims to taper some patients off their medication after they have taken it for a certain amount of time or lost a certain amount of weight.

The U.K.'s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which creates guidance for the National Health Service, recommends two-year limits on the use of some weight loss medications, such as Wegovy. And the concept was raised in a recent Institute for Clinical and Economic Review report on affordable access to obesity drugs.

A. Mark Fendrick, who directs the Center for Value-Based Insurance Design at the University of Michigan, has argued that if some people using GLP-1s to lose weight were eventually transitioned off, more people could take advantage of them.

""If you're going to spend $1 billion or $100 billion, you could either spend it on fewer people for a long period of time, or you can spend it on a lot more people for a shorter period of time,"" he said.

Fendrick's employer, the University of Michigan, indeed does that. Its prescription drug plan caps coverage of GLP-1 drugs at two years if they're used solely for weight loss.

Jamie Bennett, a spokesperson for Wegovy and Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk, declined to comment on the concept of deprescription, noting that its drugs are intended for chronic conditions. Rachel Sorvig, a spokesperson for Zepbound and Mounjaro manufacturer Eli Lilly, said in a statement that users should ""talk to their health care provider about dosage and duration needs.""

Studies have shown that people typically regain a substantial amount of weight within a year of stopping GLP-1 medications, and that many people who quit ultimately go back on the drugs.

""There's no standard of care or gold standard on how to wean right now,"" said Allison Adams, an obesity and internal medicine doctor with UK HealthCare in Kentucky.

But the math shows why time-limited coverage is appealing to payers that struggle to pay for beneficiaries' GLP-1 prescriptions, said Michelle Gourdine, chief medical officer for the pharmacy benefit manager CVS Caremark.

And states are ""between a rock and a hard place,"" said Kody Kinsley, who until January led North Carolina's Health and Human Services Department. ""They're going to have to look at every single thing and trim dollars everywhere they can.""

Pennsylvania was looking for cost-saving strategies even before the new federal tax-and-spending law, according to Brandon Cwalina, press secretary for the state's Department of Human Services. Pennsylvania projects it will spend $1.3 billion on GLP-1 drugs this year.

Plans could see real savings, Fendrick said, if they covered GLP-1s for initial weight loss then moved people to cheaper options — such as more affordable drugs or behavioral health programs — to maintain it.

Plenty of companies are eager to sell insurers, employers, and individuals on behavioral alternatives. One is Virta Health, which advertises its nutrition-focused weight management program as ""a proven approach for deprescribing GLP-1s when clinically appropriate."" A Virta-funded study assessed 154 people with type 2 diabetes who stopped using GLP-1 medications but continued following Virta's program, concluding that their weight did not significantly increase after a year.

Researchers affiliated with a European weight management company also recently reported that slowly tapering off the medications may help maintain weight loss.

For employers and insurers, the ""initial question"" was whether to cover GLP-1s for obesity, said Virta CEO Sami Inkinen. ""Now, basically, everyone's coming to the middle and asking, 'How do we responsibly cover these drugs?'""

Part of responsible coverage, Inkinen said, is providing other forms of support to patients who stop using GLP-1 medications, by choice or otherwise.

For some people, however, maintaining weight loss without a GLP-1 remains a challenge, even with other options available.

Lily, who lives in Michigan, lost almost 80 pounds in roughly 18 months on Wegovy. But she had to quit the drug when she turned 26 and left her parents' insurance plan this year. The plan her employer offers stopped covering GLP-1s for weight loss right around the time she joined.

Lily, who asked to be identified by only her first name because she is not out to her family as transgender, has tried other medications since then, and previously tried lifestyle programs to control her weight. But she said nothing works as well for her as Wegovy.

She has regained 20 pounds since going off the drug at the beginning of the year and worries that number will continue to rise, potentially contributing to future health problems.

""Just give people the drugs,"" she said. ""It seems cheaper and safer in the long run.""

Roughly 4.2 million Americans could lose their health insurance in 2026 because of cost hikes.
Market conditions are so bad that insurers are pulling back on selling ACA plans altogether.
Carriers are also weighing sweeping federal health care policy changes with unclear long-term and even short-term consequences.
“The flip side of that is that they have to be ready to pay higher out-of-pocket costs if they seek out health care.” Ultimately, you’ll have to weigh each plan’s costs against its trade-offs and your anticipated health care needs.","If you’re worried about your health care coverage, you aren’t alone. Health insurers are not only raising premiums, but some are leaving the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace altogether. These departures will drive up costs for Obamacare plans and could leave many Americans without health insurance heading into the 2026 open enrollment season. Here’s what to do if your insurer quits on you, such as the 96,000 Coloradans who just found out they lost coverage.

Roughly 4.2 million Americans could lose their health insurance in 2026 because of cost hikes. Market conditions are so bad that insurers are pulling back on selling ACA plans altogether. For example, late last month, the Colorado Division of Insurance (DOI) announced that Rocky Mountain and Anthem had filed plans to terminate multiple health plans in the state’s individual market, a move that could affect approximately 96,000 residents.

In an even bigger shock earlier this year, Aetna CVS Health said it would fully exit the marketplaces in 2026, citing an inability to provide the same level of value as in prior years. (“We’ll continue to serve all current members within these plans throughout the year, and we’ll help them transition to an alternative option for 2026,” a CVS Health spokesperson said via email.)

What’s Causing the Exodus?

ACA marketplace consolidation isn’t new. A 2022 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that, as of 2020, all of the insurance exchanges were concentrated, meaning that just a few issuers enrolled most people in any given market. But this year, some states, at least, are facing more significant upheaval, putting your coverage at risk.

“The volume and scope of this year’s discontinuances were notably higher than usual,” said Genna Morton, director of communications for Colorado Regulatory Agencies, Division of Insurance. She attributed this spike to Congress’s failure to extend the enhanced premium tax credits, currently set to expire at the end of this year.

These tax credits brought premiums down to $10 a month or less for 75% of enrollees. Changes to the subsidies in the Biden-era American Rescue Plan increased already existing assistance with premium payments for enrollees and, for the first time, removed income limits, making more people eligible for the long-term Obamacare subsidy.

ACA enrollment spiked in the years following this change, reaching a record high of 25.2 million people in 2025. But the enhanced credits are on track to expire by year-end, which would skyrocket premiums for millions of Americans.

‘A Fog of Uncertainty’

The looming loss of the enhanced premium tax credit isn’t the only factor roiling markets. Insurers are also juggling higher health care costs, tariff-related price increases, a rising public demand for pricey GLP-1 weight loss drugs, and unclear federal and state ACA-related timelines.

Anthem, for instance, issued a statement clarifying that it wants to provide health plans in all Colorado counties this year, but cannot commit to specific offerings, given that the state has delayed rate approval until Sept. 30. That means Colorado residents will have to wait longer to see what options they’ll have next year and just how badly premiums could spike.

Carriers are also weighing sweeping federal health care policy changes with unclear long-term and even short-term consequences. The recently passed “One Big Beautiful Bill”, for instance, includes steep Medicaid cuts that could result in 7.8 million Americans losing health insurance over the next 10 years.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s “Marketplace Integrity” rule, introduced additional ACA income and enrollment verification requirements, making it harder for people to join health insurance plans. However, this rule is currently tied up in court.

“Generally, insurers are dealing with this fog of uncertainty when they're setting prices for the upcoming years,” said Matt McGough, policy analyst at KFF for the Program on the ACA and the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker. They then pass that price uncertainty on to customers like you.

Those that aren’t leaving markets are mitigating risk by raising premiums. A recent KFF-Peterson analysis of proposed insurer rates found ACA Marketplace insurers are, on average, requesting a median increase of 18% in 2026, the largest rate change request since 2018. That would be a painful change for Americans who are already battling high inflation across the board.

How to Stay Covered

If you buy health insurance outside of work, be prepared for a worse selection and some major sticker shock when you review what’s available for 2026.

“Issuers leaving disrupts markets and may leave you with very different options than you had before, even if you can afford coverage,” said Jennifer Sullivan, Director of Health Coverage Access, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP).

That said, there are steps you can take to navigate these changes and maintain coverage even under challenging market conditions.

Pay Close Attention to Communications from Your Insurer

This is a critical time to review any information from your insurer. Emails, letters, or texts might contain important details about a plan’s termination or outline certain actions you need to take to avoid coverage gaps.

For instance, if an insurer cancels your plan mid-year, it’ll trigger a special enrollment period, which gives you about 60 days to pick and purchase new coverage.

Avoid Auto-Enrollment

Going on auto-pilot with your 2026 plan selection could cost you. “If you don't proactively go in and change something, they'll just put you in the same plan that you were in the year before, and that may not be what's best for you and your family this year, especially when it comes to the cost,” said Mona Shah, Senior Director of Policy and Strategy at Community Catalyst.

Alternatively, if your plan is no longer available, you’ll get auto-enrolled in a comparable plan with a different insurer, which also might not be your best or preferred coverage option.

A little research can go a long way to saving money. Review all the options on the federal marketplace exchange or your state’s insurance exchange, whichever is used in your area, to see which is most cost-effective for 2026. Exact costs for next year’s plans won’t be out until November, but you can get a sense of what’s out there and who the cost leaders are now.

Shop Early, But Stay Active

The sooner you start looking into your plan options, the more time you have to figure things out. Open enrollment starts on Nov. 1 and runs through Dec. 15. However, if you enroll before Dec. 15, you can change plans through Jan. 15.

“Keep an eye out for that January bill,” Sullivan said. Given the loose deadlines around proposed price hikes and this year’s unclear political climate, there’s a chance “your premium is going to be tremendously higher and you might not know until you get that first bill.”

If it is more than expected, you’ll want to switch plans while you still can. After January 15, you’re locked in for 2026.

Explore All Options

High premium prices and fewer providers can mean you’ll need to explore options you might have previously overlooked.

For instance, if you’ve had Silver or Gold plans in the past, you might consider choosing a Bronze plan that has a lower premium,” McGough said. “The flip side of that is that they have to be ready to pay higher out-of-pocket costs if they seek out health care.”

Ultimately, you’ll have to weigh each plan’s costs against its trade-offs and your anticipated health care needs.

Seek Assistance

“There are a lot of consumer assistance programs or community-based navigators who can help you,” Shah said.

You can identify marketplace-certified assistors in your area via Healthcare.gov’s online directory.

With the release of Q4 2025 earnings, Pro-Dex (PDEX) joined a broader sector trend of muted market reactions to earnings misses. While the health care equipment and supplies industry has historically shown limited price sensitivity to such outcomes, investors remain cautious, especially for stocks like PDEX with historically weak post-earnings performance. The quarter unfolded against a backdrop of moderate economic growth and sector-specific headwinds, including supply chain delays and regulatory uncertainty. As Pro-Dex reported results below expectations, the question now is how the market will react and what this means for its near-term trajectory.

Earnings Overview & Context

Pro-Dex reported Q4 2025 results with a total revenue of $17.494 million, a modest performance in a capital-intensive sector. Despite the top-line figure, earnings per share (EPS) came in at $0.3671, which fell short of market expectations. Operating income stood at $1.199 million, with total operating expenses amounting to $2.292 million, driven by $1.242 million in marketing and general administrative costs, and $905,000 in R&D expenses.

Net interest expense for the quarter was $145,000, contributing to a slight drag on net income, which closed at $1.197 million. The company also reported a $402,000 income tax burden, narrowing its pre-tax income from continuing operations to $1.599 million.

The performance highlights a company with stable but unspectacular operating margins, and the earnings shortfall has been reflected in immediate market sentiment, though historical data suggests the impact may be short-lived.

Backtest Analyses

Stock-Specific Backtest

The stock-specific backtest for Pro-Dex reveals a pattern of weak market reactions to earnings misses. Following such events, PDEX has historically demonstrated low win rates (20% over 3 and 10 days) and negative returns in the short to medium term. The most severe drawdown post-miss was -3.80% within three days, with recovery improving only slightly to a 40% win rate over 30 days. This weak price response suggests that investors should be cautious about entering or maintaining positions in the near term after a report like this. The data points to potential short-term losses, with uncertain long-term recovery.

Industry Peer Backtest

When compared to its peers in the Health Care Equipment & Supplies sector, the impact of earnings misses on stock performance appears even more muted. Industry-wide backtests show that earnings misses rarely result in significant price movements. The sector has seen maximum returns of 6.19% on day 55, but these gains are not consistent across individual events. This suggests that the market may be attributing more weight to other factors—such as macroeconomic conditions or broader industry news—over short-term earnings performance.

The limited predictive power of earnings misses in this sector implies that investors should look beyond quarterly results when making decisions about health care equipment stocks.

Driver Analysis & Implications

Pro-Dex’s earnings performance was primarily driven by its operating costs, with SG&A and R&D expenses together accounting for 12.8% of total revenue. While the company continues to invest in research, the lack of proportionate top-line growth and the drag from interest costs suggest that operational leverage is not materializing. The company’s 2.4% net margin reflects a tight operating environment.

Internally, the guidance and cost management practices are likely under pressure. Externally, the broader health care equipment market remains sensitive to reimbursement policies and regulatory shifts. These factors, combined with Pro-Dex’s performance, suggest a need for strategic cost optimization and innovation to regain investor confidence.

Investment Strategies & Recommendations

For short-term investors, the recent earnings miss and weak price history suggest a cautious stance. The negative 3-day drawdown and limited recovery potential may not align with short-horizon trading strategies. Positioning in PDEX could be considered only after a clearer stabilization in performance and improved guidance.

For long-term investors, the company remains a niche player in a defensive sector. The key will be whether Pro-Dex can demonstrate cost discipline, innovation, and improved operational efficiency in the next few quarters. Investors may want to focus on the next earnings release for updated guidance and potential signs of a turnaround.

Conclusion & Outlook

Pro-Dex’s Q4 earnings report highlights the challenges of maintaining growth in a capital-intensive sector. While the company's fundamentals are stable, the weak market reaction to the earnings miss reinforces the need for a cautious investment approach. The next key catalyst will be the company's guidance and any further commentary on cost management and innovation. Investors are encouraged to monitor Pro-Dex closely in the coming months for signals of operational improvement and strategic clarity.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 23:04:32.827804

Upside potential The worst part of the quarter might have been the news about Nvidia having to suspend H20 chip production and seeing the Chinese government tell local companies to avoid Nvidia's chips.
The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Alibaba is working on a chip to fill the void left by the H20 chip.","Artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant Nvidia (NVDA -2.78%) recently reported strong second-quarter earnings for its fiscal year 2026. Not only did Nvidia beat Wall Street estimates, but the company's board of directors also approved the addition of $60 billion to its share repurchase program, which will help increase earnings per share by lowering the outstanding share count over time.

Despite what looked like strong numbers, Nvidia's stock didn't react too well and fell following the release. Ultimately, there were both positive and negative aspects from the print. Interestingly, I found one aspect to be both the best and worst part of Nvidia's earnings report.

China remains a big variable

In the second quarter, Nvidia reported $1.05 adjusted earnings per share on $46.74 billion of revenue, both of which beat estimates. Nvidia also guided for revenue in the current quarter to hit $54 billion, about $900 million ahead of Street forecasts. However, investors seemed slightly miffed by performance in Nvidia's data center business. Despite growing 56% year over year, the number came up slightly short of estimates.

Part of the shortfall came from a decline in sales of Nvidia's H20 chips, which it sells to businesses in China, in accordance with previous government restrictions. The company has not been able to sell its most advanced chips to China over national security concerns, specifically regarding what China might try to build with these AI capabilities.

These concerns have been ratcheted up under the Trump administration, which earlier this year required Nvidia to obtain export licenses in order to sell to China. In the first quarter of the year, Nvidia took a $5.5 billion charge due to prior built-up inventory and purchase commitments.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang appeared to be making progress with President Donald Trump, agreeing to give 15% of the company's China sales to the U.S. government if it could sell in the country. Nvidia is also reportedly building a scaled-down Blackwell chip, which is more advanced than the H20 chip, that the government might allow the company to sell in China. However, right before earnings, media outlets reported that Nvidia had instructed its suppliers to stop making the H20 chips after the Chinese government told domestic companies to avoid Nvidia chips due to its own security concerns.

Management on the company's earnings call noted that if geopolitical issues are solved, Nvidia could earn an additional $2 billion to $5 billion of revenue from H20 chip sales in the current quarter. But right now, that is not factored into the company's guidance. Furthermore, Huang said the opportunity in China in 2025 would have been $50 billion ""if we were able to address it with competitive products."" He continued, ""And if it's $50 billion this year, you would expect it to grow, say, 50% per year, as the rest of the world's AI market is growing as well.""

Upside potential

The worst part of the quarter might have been the news about Nvidia having to suspend H20 chip production and seeing the Chinese government tell local companies to avoid Nvidia's chips. However, there seems to be a real possibility that Nvidia will eventually be able to sell its products in China, and perhaps even more advanced chips than it had been selling.

In my opinion, this is also in a way the best part of the quarter because the stock and company are performing well without revenue from China, which is clearly material. While the government has reservations about selling U.S. chips in China, it probably would prefer a U.S. company to sell them over Chinese companies. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Alibaba is working on a chip to fill the void left by the H20 chip. While Chinese companies don't have the same chip capabilities as Nvidia right now, that could change one day.

So the opportunity to eventually reignite a business in a fast-growing market where the opportunity is tens of billions in additional annual revenue growth is the most exciting part of Nvidia's recent quarter and near-term future prospects. Nvidia currently trades around 38 times forward earnings, which is above its five year average of 34.4.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/831553/boardroom-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 18:12:29.572825

Martin K. Medicare drug price negotiations: all you need to know.","Nearly 1 in 5 pharmacy owners have expressed that they will not be participating in the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (MDPNP) because of its potential to increase cashflow issues and decrease revenue. Up to 67% of owners are considering not stocking the drugs included under the negotiations, according to a National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA) news release.1

“Independent pharmacists want this program to work, and they want to participate,” said NCPA CEO Douglas Hoey, RPh, MBA, according to the release. “But the program must be implemented in a way that makes business sense or independent pharmacies won’t be able to participate to help make the program successful.”

The data for pharmacies’ feelings toward the MDPNP come from an NCPA survey of 405 pharmacy owners and managers conducted between August 25 and September 2, 2025.2 They were asked about their feelings toward stocking MDPNP prescription drugs, decisions to stay in Medicare Part D, and other questions related to pharmacy sustainability and revenue.

The MDPNP is directly linked with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law by former President Biden in 2022. Under the IRA, lawmakers established the MDPNP, which was intended for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to work alongside drug manufacturers to negotiate on the prices of medications offered through Medicare plans.3

While the law and the price negotiation program were designed to save patients money, its potential impact on community pharmacies has been of significant concern within the greater pharmacy community. And with provisions of the IRA and MDPNP gradually taking place over the past few years, NCPA, their community pharmacy members, and many other advocates have been denouncing the negotiation program for quite some time.

“Like many government programs, the intent is good, but the unintended consequences undermine the goal,” said Hoey, according to a separate release from January of this year.4 “That’s exactly the case here. Everyone wants to reduce drug costs for seniors and taxpayers. But, as our research shows, the program is structured in a way that will force many independent pharmacies out of the Medicare Part D program.”

This time around, NCPA conducted a survey to gain further insights on pharmacies and their feelings toward the program. With results showing significant hesitation among community pharmacy decision makers, NCPA sent its findings to the head of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Mehmet Oz, MD, MBA, this week.

According to the survey’s 405 responses, 19% of pharmacies will not be stocking MDPNP drugs when negotiations take effect at the start of 2026.1,3 There was also a large portion of respondents (67%) that are currently considering the same approach.

To gain an even larger scope of how community pharmacies are faring throughout these negotiations, the survey also explored general financial questions and PBM-related concerns for these pharmacies.

In the past year, 35% of pharmacies said that their financial health has declined significantly, with just 12% saying that they experienced an improvement. For PBMs’ roles in community pharmacy financial health, 44% said that Express Scripts was causing them the most financial stress, followed by CVS Caremark (30%) and Humana (11%).

“NCPA has met with CMS multiple times and submitted comments that we believe provide straightforward solutions to address our concerns and would encourage pharmacy participation in the program,” read the NCPA’s letter to CMS, according to the release.1 “For example, NCPA continues to recommend that CMS revise the program such that Part D plans and PBMs must: 1) pay pharmacies no less than the [maximum fair price] (MFP) plus a commensurate dispensing fee when providing MFP drugs; and 2) not assess direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) fees on MFP drugs.”

However, these solutions have yet to come to fruition. In the meantime, community pharmacies and their advocate groups like NCPA are expressing their concerns of further decreased revenue and pharmacy sustainability stemming from the MDPNP.

“If the program is a net liability for independent pharmacies, they won’t be able to participate. And if they can’t participate, the success of the whole program is in jeopardy,” concluded Hoey.1 “Our letter to CMS outlines common sense recommendations to help assure the success of the program and achieve the objectives of lowering drug costs and optimizing medication effectiveness.”

Conclusion: A Model for Resilience in Uncertain Times AmRest Holdings’ journey through 2024-2025 offers a blueprint for navigating macroeconomic turbulence.
Its EBITDA stability, achieved through operational efficiency and strategic debt management, is complemented by a proactive approach to credit risk mitigation and portfolio optimization.","In an era of persistent macroeconomic volatility, AmRest Holdings’ ability to stabilize its EBITDA while refining its financial and operational strategies underscores its resilience as a European foodservice leader. The company’s performance in 2025, marked by a year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of over EUR 196 million—a figure roughly flat compared to 2024—demonstrates its capacity to navigate inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions [1]. This stability is not accidental but a result of deliberate strategic choices, including debt management, portfolio optimization, and technological innovation.

EBITDA Stability: A Test of Operational Discipline

AmRest’s EBITDA margin has proven remarkably resilient. In Q1 2025, adjusted EBITDA surged 6.5% to EUR 87.8 million, achieving a 14.2% margin despite a EUR 5 million extraordinary loss tied to supply chain deconsolidation [4]. This loss, while impactful, was a one-off event, and the company’s core operations remained largely unaffected. By internalizing supply chain management—a move that followed the disposal of its 51% stake in SCM—AmRest has unlocked operational synergies and reduced exposure to external volatility [1].

The company’s ability to maintain EBITDA stability is further reinforced by its diversified revenue model. With a mix of company-owned and franchised locations, AmRest mitigates risks associated with localized economic downturns. For instance, its 2024 results revealed a 17% EBITDA margin, up 1.2 percentage points year-over-year, even as net profit dipped due to higher interest expenses [5]. This highlights the decoupling of EBITDA performance from net profit, a trend driven by effective cost control and pricing strategies.

Financial Resilience: Balancing Debt and Creditworthiness

AmRest’s financial architecture reflects a calculated balance between growth and prudence. As of Q3 2023, its debt-to-equity ratio stood at 2.25, signaling a heavy reliance on debt financing [3]. However, this leverage has been strategically deployed. In 2023, the company issued €150 million in corporate bonds with a 2026 maturity, enabling expansion and debt refinancing while securing favorable terms [3]. These efforts have paid off: by August 2025, AmRest’s credit rating had rebounded from C2 to C1, and its probability of default plummeted to 0.913%, a stark improvement from its 2021 levels [2].

This financial resilience is critical in a high-interest-rate environment. While debt servicing costs remain a challenge, AmRest’s credit upgrades and disciplined capital allocation—such as closing non-strategic units like Pizza Hut in France—have strengthened its balance sheet [5]. The company’s 2024 revenue of €2.6 billion and EBITDA of €430 million (a 14% year-over-year increase) further validate its ability to generate cash flow despite macroeconomic headwinds [5].

Strategic Adaptability: Innovation and Portfolio Optimization

AmRest’s adaptability extends beyond financial metrics. The company has prioritized digital transformation and sustainability, investing in technologies to enhance customer engagement and operational efficiency. For example, its focus on “brand innovation” has enabled it to maintain relevance in a competitive market [3]. Additionally, its decision to streamline its restaurant portfolio—by shuttering underperforming units and expanding high-potential markets—has optimized resource allocation.

This strategic agility is evident in its 2025 outlook. The company anticipates mid-single-digit sales growth while maintaining EBITDA margins, a target achievable through a combination of new store openings and cost discipline [5]. The declaration of its first-ever dividend (€0.07 per share) also signals confidence in its cash flow sustainability and commitment to shareholder returns [5].

Conclusion: A Model for Resilience in Uncertain Times

AmRest Holdings’ journey through 2024-2025 offers a blueprint for navigating macroeconomic turbulence. Its EBITDA stability, achieved through operational efficiency and strategic debt management, is complemented by a proactive approach to credit risk mitigation and portfolio optimization.

WHAT WE ARE LISTENING TO

🎙 OPS CAST

CMOs continue to face pressure to justify marketing spend, with attribution models often creating more confusion than clarity. Persistent budget gaps in MarketingOps reflect the lack of strong frameworks for proving impact, which limits both scalability and resource allocation. At the same time, AI is reshaping operations by adding reason-based systems to traditional models, though this also raises questions about oversight and responsibility.

Automation and digital employees offer relief by easing burnout. Yet for many marketing leaders, the real strain comes not from workload but from the ongoing demand to prove their strategic value across both creative and analytical roles. Making sense of these pressures helps teams work smarter and scale.",https://beehiiv-images-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/asset/file/d485376e-c723-49f0-9dee-1dc56db6cfc5/Copy_of_ClickZ_-_Thumbnails__15_.png?t=1757159595,N,,2025-09-06 15:13:13.169511

Trump signs executive order implementing trade pact with Japan President Trump has signed an executive order implementing the US's trade deal with Japan, the White House said Thursday.
Trump asks the Supreme Court to move fast and uphold his tariffs Bloomberg reports: Read more here.","In this article:

Postal traffic to the US dropped more than 80% after the Trump administration ended the de minimis tariff exemption for low-cost imports, the United Nations postal agency said Saturday. The AP reports that 88 postal operators have told the UPU they've suspended some or all postal services to the US until a solution is implemented with regard to U.S.-bound parcels valued at $800 or less, the previous limit for imported goods to avoid customs charges.

President Trump on Friday signed an executive order exempting gold, tungsten and uranium from global tariffs, Bloomberg reported.

And on Thursday, Trump cemented and signed an executive order implementing the US's pact with Japan. But despite this, many of Trump's tariffs remain tied up in legal battles, after courts ruled most of them illegal.

Amid legal questions hanging over tariffs, Trump has also asked the Supreme Court for an immediate hearing in hopes of overturning an appeals court ruling that deemed most of his tariffs illegal.

His administration called for the high court to put the case on a highly expedited schedule, with arguments starting in early November, according to reported filings.

On Wednesday, Trump said the US may have to ""unwind"" existing trade deals, including with the European Union, Japan, and South Korea, if the Supreme Court doesn't uphold the tariffs.

""If we don't win that case, our country is going to suffer so greatly,"" Trump told reporters before meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki. ""These deals are all done. I guess we'd have to unwind them.""

A federal appeals court ruled that most of Trump's global tariffs were illegal, reaffirming an earlier ruling by the Court of International Trade and saying he exceeded his authority in using emergency powers to impose them. The judges, however, allowed the tariffs to remain in place while the case moves through the appeals process.

That means the ""reciprocal"" tariffs Trump unveiled on dozens of US trade partners (which you can see in the graphic below) now face legal limbo.

Meanwhile, Trump said he will soon impose tariffs on semiconductor imports but will spare companies like Apple (AAPL), which have promised to increase US investments. Trump said Apple CEO Tim Cook ""would be in pretty good shape"" because of the company's recent commitments.

Elsewhere, Trump has said he is not considering lowering tariffs on India, a week after the US doubled duties on its imports to 50% in response to India's purchase of Russian oil.

When a reporter asked if he might roll back some of the tariffs, Trump replied, ""No.""

Trump lamented later in the week that India — along with Russia — appear to be ""lost"" to ""deepest darkest China."" Trump's comments come as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has embarked on bids to strengthen ties with China and Russia as relations with the US have deteriorated.

US trade deficit widens to largest in 4 months

The US trade deficit widened to its largest amount in four months in July as companies raced to import products in order to front-run President Trump's latest round of broad-based tariffs.

Bloomberg reports that the goods and services trade gap grew nearly 33% from the prior month to $78.3 billion, Commerce Department data showed Thursday. The value of imported goods increased 5.9% in July, driven by industrial supplies, consumer goods, gold, and capital equipment. Exports also ticked higher during the month.

The swings in trade this year have created volatility in gross domestic product (GDP) readings as well, as frequent policy changes have led some importers to pull forward or pause shipments. Following the release of trade deficit data, Goldman Sachs lowered its third quarter GDP growth forecast to 1.6% from 1.7%.

If Trump's biggest tariffs get thrown out, companies could get a refund — but not consumers

While companies absorb tariff costs and pass some of them along to consumers, President Trump has been touting the amount of money US tariffs are bringing the government.

But if the Supreme Court upholds a lower court's ruling that the tariffs are illegal, thereby striking them down, the government could have to refund the taxes it has collected on imported goods. That would mark a huge reversal in Trump's trade policy — but not one that is likely to land consumers any cash back.

China hits US optical-fiber imports with tariffs

China just made its latest deliberated move in its trade dance with the Trump administration.

Bloomberg reports:

China started imposing levies on additional US optical fiber imports, after a six-month investigation found that American companies had circumvented its anti-dumping measures.

The duties, ranging from 33.3% to 78.2%, took effect Thursday Beijing time on “certain cut-off shifted single-mode optical fiber” from the US, according to a statement from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.

Among the companies subject to the new duties, Corning Inc. (GLW) now faces a 37.9% levy, OFS Fitel LLC is at 33.3% and Draka Communications Americas Inc. has a 78.2% duty.

The probe was the first anti-circumvention investigation China has ever initiated, the Mofcom said in a separate statement published Thursday.

Right now, the company owns 27.5% of Kraft Heinz, a stake now worth $8.9 billion, making Warren the food company’s biggest shareholder.
Shares of Kraft Heinz dropped by as much as 7.6% on Tuesday before recovering slightly.
That’s just the latest hit in a long stretch of pain for Kraft Heinz investors.
That could cause other investors to panic and follow suit, making things worse for Kraft Heinz.","Warren Buffett might finally be ready to dump Kraft Heinz. The Oracle of Omaha told CNBC he’s “disappointed” the company is breaking itself into two pieces, a reversal of the 2015 merger he personally backed, which has now turned into one of the worst investment moves of his career.

The news came out during a private phone call with “Squawk Box” co-host Becky Quick on Tuesday. Warren also said he’s angry that shareholders like Berkshire Hathaway weren’t given the right to vote on the decision.

Right now, the company owns 27.5% of Kraft Heinz, a stake now worth $8.9 billion, making Warren the food company’s biggest shareholder.

He confirmed that Berkshire’s next CEO, Greg Abel, already told Kraft Heinz executives they didn’t agree with the split, even before the company finalized the decision.

Warren questions the cost and value of the split

Warren told Becky Quick he’s against the plan, especially the $300 million in overhead costs that will be needed to break Kraft Heinz into two new entities over the next year.

“It certainly didn’t turn out to be a brilliant idea to put them together,” he said. “But I don’t think taking it apart will fix it.”

The market didn’t like the news either. Shares of Kraft Heinz dropped by as much as 7.6% on Tuesday before recovering slightly. The stock ended the short trading week down 2.4% overall.

That’s just the latest hit in a long stretch of pain for Kraft Heinz investors. Since the 2015 merger between Kraft and Heinz, the stock has lost 69% of its value.

The original deal was a joint move between Berkshire Hathaway and Brazil-based 3G Capital, which teamed up in 2013 to buy H.J. Heinz for $23.3 billion.

When the Kraft merger happened two years later, Berkshire walked away with over 325 million shares in the combined company, worth about $24 billion when the deal closed in July 2015.

By 2016, that stake had climbed to $30 billion. But it collapsed over the next few years. Since 2020, the value of the stake has been stuck near $10 billion.

Warren told shareholders in his 2015 letter that Berkshire spent $9.8 billion on the shares. With today’s valuation sitting below that, the company is sitting on a $1.0 billion paper loss.

It’s not the first time Warren has been forced to face that. Berkshire already wrote down $3.0 billion of the investment in 2019, and just this past quarter, it wrote off another $3.8 billion to reflect current market value.

Resignations, rumors, and legal implications add pressure

In May, two Berkshire Hathaway board members resigned from Kraft Heinz after the company said it was reviewing options to boost shareholder value. That triggered speculation that Warren was planning to sell.

Warren hasn’t said whether Berkshire will start selling its shares. But he hasn’t ruled it out either. He said, “We will proceed to do whatever we think is in the best interest of Berkshire.”

He also added that if a buyer tries to take a big chunk of their stake, Berkshire won’t accept it unless the same offer is made to all other shareholders. The only exception would be a full buyout of Kraft Heinz.

If Warren begins offloading shares, it could shake things up fast. Berkshire owns over 10% of the company, which means any open market sale must be reported within two business days. That could cause other investors to panic and follow suit, making things worse for Kraft Heinz.

Warren is not alone in criticizing the split. The Financial Times reported that the company has failed to keep up with what consumers want. The paper wrote that the split isn’t bold or smart, it’s just a way to cover up years of poor results caused by endless cost-cutting and a lack of innovation.

Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway’s other holdings look more stable. As of June 30, the company’s 13F filing showed major investments in public companies across the U.S., Japan, and Hong Kong.

Two of those (Itochu, as of March 17, and Mitsubishi, as of August 28) are listed in Tokyo, and their values are shown in U.S. dollars after converting from Japanese yen using prices from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Full transcript - Barclays 18th Annual Global Consumer Staples Conference 2025:

Ron Lombardi, Chairman and CEO, Prestige Consumer Health Care: Everyone. Thanks for joining us. I’m Ron Lombardi, chairman and CEO of Prestige Consumer Health Care, joined by Christine Sacco, our chief operating and financial officer. So today, we’re gonna give an update and talk a bit about our business. I’ll start things off, and I’ll turn it over to Chris who’ll who’ll wrap up today’s discussion.

So with that, let’s jump into the the slide that I always like to to present and talk about to set up the idea of prestige consumer health care. If you’ve heard us talk in the past, we describe ourselves as looking for niche categories where brands can compete and be successful over the long term. And niche doesn’t necessarily do a great job of describing the categories that we compete in or the reach that we have with consumers. And I think this slide up here does a great way to, I think, add color to it. So every year, we sell enough Clear Eyes and FerriTears and our other eye care brands to treat 12,000,000,000 irritated eye occasions, huge number, huge amount of consumer contacts.

We treat six fifty million sore and dry throat occasions each year. With our BC and Goodies powdered analgesic brands, we help treat about 17,000,000 pain occasions each week, including hangovers, for those of you who may be familiar with the brands. In Monistat, we help women treat about eight million vaginal yeast infections every year. So this gives you an idea of the breadth and depth of connections we have with consumers. Although my favorite statistic about connections with consumers is our fleet brand.

We sell enemas and solid suppository products. And if you take each of the solid suppositories that we’ve made over the last ten or twelve years and stack them end to end, you almost get to the moon, so about 240,000 miles of solid suppository relief over the last dozen years or so. So we really do have deep and long connections with consumers. When we talk about our business, we often break it up into some different categories. You see on the chart, GI is our largest category, followed by women’s health.

Eye and ear care is third, and then followed by skin care and analgesics. But if you dig into each of these categories, you really see that we participate in very different ways in the GI category. So we’ve got Dramamine, which is the leader in motion sickness and nausea treatment and prevention, very different than fleet enemas, which is very different than our Hydralyte hydration product that we sell mainly in Australia and Australasia, but we have the rights for in most of the rest of the world. And then same thing if you go into the women’s health care segment, We have Monistat and Summer’s Eve. Again, very different kinds of products that get lumped into the women’s health.

So we have a very diverse set of brands that treat a very diverse and different set of disease occasions and illness occasions that people may run into. And this diversity gives us a lot of benefits, and we’ll talk about some of those benefits in more detail in a minute here. But it really allows us to deal with the ebbs and flows in illness levels that may happen in a given year. So for example, in the skin category, we have Compound W and NYX lice treatment. This actually is a low lice season incident level this year, back to school, but it’s not enough to move the needle and impact the total performance of our business.

So over time, some of these brands will do better than the average we’d expect for them. Some are a bit below. And some of them are right in line with what you’d expect for illness occasion levels over time. So lots of benefits to this diverse portfolio of brands. So let’s talk about the pillars that create value for our shareholders.

Right? How do we think about driving value and creating value? It always starts with doing a good job with the business you have. Right? On the the slide up here, we’ve described it as investing for growth with our proven brand building playbook.

And I’ll give you some examples over the next few slides. One of the attributes of consumer health care is a very strong financial profile, and that’s the second element of our value creation proposition. Strong gross margins, strong EBITDA margins in the low 30%, that combined with low cash taxes and low capital spending delivers industry leading free cash flow. Last year, we delivered about $2.40 or so, dollars $242,000,000 of free cash flow. I think our outlook for this year is north of $245,000,000 of free cash flow.

And those are not one off levels of performance for us. We have a very long history of solid free cash flow that empowers the third value creator for us, which is a platform that allows us to have capital allocation optionality, right, whether it’s being active in M and A, buying back our stock, or delevering, which we we’ve done very rapidly over the last four or five years, getting the company to the lowest level of leverage we’ve had since the company went public back in 2005 or so. So that’s how we think about creating value. Right? Do a good job with the business we have, growing the brands that we have, delivering solid and consistent financial results and free cash flow, and then using that cash flow to create value over time.

And down at the bottom, you can see what our five year CAGRs were for the end of the last fiscal year. Revenue grew about 3.5%, organic growth 2.5%, and our EPS grew almost 9% during that same time frame. So very solid and repeatable levels of of financial performance. So let me jump into the brand building playbook. Right?

This is the so how do we think about growing and managing the portfolio of brands that we have? First, it all starts with understanding consumer insights and opportunities. Right? How are consumers thinking about taking care of themselves, treating their illness levels, looking for and deciding what product to buy when somebody in their household, their children, are ill? The second part of it is being a flexible and agile marketer.

Right? When we talk through some of the examples here, what you’re gonna find is we think very differently than most big CPG companies where we build our strategies brand by brand. We think about what is the best marketing approach for each brand based on the targeted consumers. And that’s an important differentiator for us. If we get asked, you know, what’s the secret sauce to your brand building?

That’s one of the big elements of it. So we think about brands individually. We also look at expanding consumer reach and the distribution of our products. Right? Ecommerce has been a fast growing channel for us, not only at Amazon, but with our brick and mortar partners as they think about expanding their .com business.

And then finally, the role that new product development and innovation play in brand building. So we’ll talk about these these four elements over the next couple of slides. First, Dramamine is always the classic example we like to use when talking about building a brand over the long term. We bought Dramamine from a big pharma player back in 02/2011. And in the five years prior to us acquiring Dramamine, there hadn’t been a single dollar spent on consumer marketing for the brand.

And that’s not a criticism for the for the previous owner. It’s an observation of Dramamine was not an important brand for them, so it didn’t get investments. We acquired Dramamine. It becomes an important brand for us. We invest behind it through marketing, through new products, through innovation, over time.

And we’ve been able to grow the brand by nearly five x over the fifteen years or so that that we have owned it. And if you look at the top left, in 02/2011, there was essentially two SKUs for Dramamine. And then over time, we built off of that base. We introduced a chewable, great flavored children’s product. Prior to us having a chewable product available, if you wanted to dose your children for motion sickness, you took an adult tablet, you broke it in half, and you tried to get a a six year old to swallow half of a of a tablet.

Right? That’s not rocket science to go talk to the consumer and ask the mom, you know, how do you think about treating your child? And they tell you it’s a hassle. Right? How do I know I got the right dosage?

How do I know it’s half? What if they only take half the pill and spit the other half out kind of thing? So it’s an example of the consumer insight that we worked that we worked on. Another consumer insight that led to new products is we heard from people that said, I trust dramamine for motion sickness. I know it’s gonna work.

I also know it’s gonna make me drowsy, and that doesn’t work for me because I’m driving the boat. I’m driving the car. I’m going on a cruise. I don’t want to be drowsy. So we introduced nondrowsy forms of dramamine to help connect with that insight as well.

And then finally, again, as we talked to consumers and we talked about motion sickness, we often heard back, well, I don’t know about motion sickness. I just feel nauseous, and I feel like I’m gonna throw up. So that insight led us into the nausea category. And, again, new products, new forms, chews and lozenges to deliver clinical doses of ginger as a way to help treat nausea. And we quickly became the number one brand in the nausea category.

So great example of over the long term, we can continue to bring insights and invest behind it, and we’re just getting going on Dramamine. Even though it’s grown by five x, there’s no reason it can’t grow by multiples again over over the long term. So let’s talk about portfolio diverse diversity and being an agile marketer. Right? If you’ve heard us talk over the last year, we’ve talked about supply constraints and challenges we’ve had with Clear Eyes.

So as we’ve dealt with limitations around shipments, we stepped back and reevaluated our marketing plans. Right? We don’t wanna market a product and drive people to the shelf to find empty shelves and and not find the product they’re looking for. So we rediverted some of those dollars away from the Clear Eyes brand to other eye care products, particularly TheraTears, Dibrox, which is an earwax cleaner, and Stye, where we look to better connect and do more advertising for those brands to connect with consumers. And on the right, you can see that we’ve just launched a new marketing campaign for TheraTears as a result of those extra funds being available, and we’ll show that now if we can call that up.

Unidentified speaker: Dry eye relief isn’t just a feeling. It’s a science. VeriTears has Oxylites, a unique blend of the five vital electrolytes found in natural tears, all working together to support hydration For a feeling no other drop can give, give your eyes a burst of long lasting relief with TheraTears dry eye therapy, science backed hydration.

Ron Lombardi, Chairman and CEO, Prestige Consumer Health Care: It’s great. When we talked to consumers about TheraTears, they said it feels great in my eye. I know it’s working. It’d be great to know why. Right?

So we’re furthering that connection with the consumer and reminding them, hey. Here’s what’s unique about TheraTears versus the other competitors in the dry eye space as to why it’s gonna feel and work great in your eye. The other thing that we’ve we’ve done with TheraTears is we’ve been able to finish work to get a twelve hour soothing comfort claim. Right? It works all day long.

A couple of drops in your eyes in the morning, and your eyes will feel great and refreshed all day long. So another example of the marketing playbook where we can go out and do a clinical study to support what consumers are already telling us about the product, which is I put it in the morning, put it in my eyes in the morning, and it feels great ten, twelve hours later. So a couple of examples about our agility and our ability to make changes in our marketing investment plans during the year to take advantage of different opportunities. So let’s move on to distribution and ecommerce. On the left side in the top, you’ll see that we have had a lot of success investing behind ecommerce and partnering not only with Amazon, but our brick and mortar partners to expand our product offering and investments so that we connect with consumers when they go to their chosen.com platform to look for our products.

We’ve been able to to take our .com business from about 4% of sales around five years ago. We’ve grown it by four x. The end of last year, we were about 16% of sales for our .com business. Right? Two thirds of that is Amazon.

We continue to do very well on that. We bring those learnings to our other brick and mortar partners to help them with what they’re trying to accomplish, but, it really works for us. We know how to connect with consumers. We know how to fulfill through Amazon for that and are able to provide up to date content that drives not only awareness but traffic and conversion, for the brands that are out there. The other benefit that we don’t talk a lot about in terms of .com is we’re able to have much broader distribution for our tail brands.

Right? The best way to describe our tail brands is really loyalty brands or heritage brands. They’re brands that consumers have used for very long periods of time that they trust but they can’t find in brick and mortar because the velocity isn’t necessarily enough to support a listing at Walmart, for example, or in the drug channel. So some examples would be like Bino. It does very well for us on .com.

You might not be able to find it broadly in brick and brick and mortar as an example. But we have about 50 brands that fall under that category that if you go out to Amazon or some of the other .coms, you’re gonna find those those unique brands that that you might not find in the store. So it’s all of those elements. We look for every opportunity to connect with consumers and provide them the products, whether they’re going into a convenience store, drug, mass, grocery, dollar, or their.com. So again, we continue to to expect success on this going forward and look for it as a a rapidly growing channel for us.

So finally, in this area, we’ll talk about new products and innovation. And we often get asked, you know, what are the elements of your two to 3% long term organic growth outlook? We always start by saying, you know, we think the categories that we grow in, that we compete in, grow, let’s call it, 1%. Right? Illness levels for lice, as an example, they don’t change dramatically year to year.

They generally follow population growth. So that’s the first part. The next part of that algorithm is gonna be driven by growing the categories that our brands define. And we do that by bringing in new products, new innovation, and marketing so that nontreaters come into the categories. Low treaters expand.

Mistreaters get connected with the right pharmaceutical ingredients to actually help them treat their disease state. You can drink all the ginger ale you want. It’s probably not gonna stop you from getting motion sickness in a car if that’s what bothers you. But tramamine will do it. Right?

And I gave the examples of the new products there. But over the last year, up on the slide, we’ve got six or seven examples of some new products that are doing great for us. We’ve got a Dramamine advanced herbals for kids. Right? So if you’re looking to to give your child maybe not a medicine, but a ginger based approach to helping them deal with nausea, we’ve got a great product for for kids up here.

We launched Summer’s Eve whole body deodorant in the feminine hygiene aisle, and it’s doing fantastic. It’s the number one selling whole body deodorant in the hygiene section. Right? We wanna play where we can be successful in putting Summer’s Eve in the deodorant aisle against the great big CPG companies who’ve got tons of money behind their whole body deodorants, whether it’s a spray or a cream. We’re not gonna be successful there.

People aren’t thinking about Summer’s Eve in the deodorant aisle When women go to shop in the feminine hygiene aisle, right, they know what Summer’s Eve’s proposition is. It and this new product delivers against the expectations. Great fragrance, efficacious, and great feel on the skin. So that’s off to a great start for us. We’ve got a new Goodies mental alertness with some extra caffeine to get you going when you need it.

Fleet has expanded into the stool softener category. So fleet has primarily been associated with enemas and suppositories. Right? That’s the when you’re really desperate and you’ve exhausted every other option to help cure your constipation, right, Fleet had you covered with enemas and suppositories. We’re now looking to connect with you earlier in your constipation journey.

You’re gonna trust Fleet as efficacious and that it’s gonna work. We’ve got a couple of new flavors in Hydralyte, again, to expand with that household penetration, get folks to use Hydralyte more often as part of a more frequent hydration regimen to keep yourself healthy. And then finally, on on the right, as we’ve looked to expand how Monistat connects with women, we’ve got an addition to our care line under the maintain, a a vaginal suppository to help with care over time. So new products can come in lots of different ways, whether it’s an extension into kind of a new subcategory, a new flavor, or a new form is how we think about it. Again, all based on consumer insights.

And then finally, before I turn it over to Chris, we have a fantastic and fast growing international business largely anchored around our Care Pharma business in Australia. It’s been growing in the in the mid teens on average over the last five years or so ahead of our long term expectation of it growing in kind of the mid to high single digits. But, again, it it’s due to the same approach we take in North America, which is great brands, long term brand building, and investments in them to connect with consumers and help them take care of their health. So with that, let me turn it over to Chris. Alright.

There you go. Thanks, Chris. Thanks.

Christine Sacco, Chief Operating and Financial Officer, Prestige Consumer Health Care: Good afternoon, everyone. So when Ron joined the company about fifteen years ago, the company went on a journey to morph the portfolio to become the pure play OTC company that we are today. So if you took this chart and you’re looking at leverage down the number on the bottom there, and you actually went back a few years, you’ll see that we touched 5.8 times, about three times in the company’s history. We did that because we needed to morph the portfolio, as I mentioned. So the power of our cash flow, which I’m going to talk about, has really driven our ability to go, I think Ron mentioned, 2.4 times at the end of our Q1.

We’re a fiscal March 31 company. It’s the lowest level of leverage that the company has seen. The reason we have such strong conversion with free cash flow starts with a variable cost model. We manufacture about 15% to 20% of our product in house. The nature of OTC, as Ron mentioned, right, you go into the store, someone in your household is sick, you’re usually not looking to save $1 Not an area where we get into promotion in the categories that we compete in.

Can’t really get you to buy headlice if no one in the house has headlice by doing a BOGO or whatnot. Low CapEx spend, given the model I just talked about, 1% to 3% of sales a year is, generally speaking, our capital spend. And then we still are benefiting from some acquisitions that we did in the past that drive about a high teens cash tax rate compared to our effective tax rate of 24% you see on the balance sheet. So all of those things really lead us to this consistent and strong free cash flow that we talk a lot about. So what are we going do with that cash?

If you looked at this chart a few years ago when leverage was pretty high, you would have seen number two and number four were reversed. Obviously, we talked about investing in the brands that we have. But over the next four years, we’re going to generate about $1,000,000,000 of free cash flow. And the power of that today compared to the power of that some years ago is that back in the day, we had to use all of that to delever, right? Now as we sit here, we have optionality.

The number one use of cash that we prefer to use right now is M and A, and we’ll talk a little bit about that. After that, we look to do share repurchases. You could probably expect us each year in the first quarter to offset dilution And then beyond that, opportunistic repurchases. We’ve talked about a $300,000,000 multiyear authorization from our Board. We have over $200,000,000 of that left.

And at today’s prices, you’d probably see us be active in that arena. And then fourth, very attractive long term debt. We don’t have any variable debt left at this point, so we’ll likely build some cash on the balance sheet. So again, where we used to use all of our cash flow for deleveraging and we needed to, we don’t need to do that anymore. So we actually can do all four of the things that you see on this page, and we’re doing them this year.

So different lens from our perspective. So again, we get asked a lot of questions about M and A. And what’s out there? Are you seeing it? What’s the environment like?

And we often say it’s more of the same. And this kind of speaks to why. We were trying to communicate when you think about the pie chart up on the top left there, you’ll see even the large players who are here, it’s still very highly fragmented from an industry perspective. And then if you look at the numbers below, you can see that consumer health care, only 27% The top three brands are only holding 27% of their categories, so it is highly fragmented, which creates the opportunity. I like to use the example that you don’t go into a store and say I have a skin problem, right?

You say I have eczema. I have a wart. I have rosacea. I have acne. That creates a lot of opportunities.

We see whether it’s family members, PE firms are always turning things, large players looking to get rid of their tail. We’ve bought brands from all of those players, and we’ll continue to be active in that space. Again, as I mentioned before, at 2.4 times leverage, we look to right now, we have about $1,000,000,000 of acquisition capacity. That’s not going back. You’re very unlikely to see us go back to leverage levels that you saw in the past, right?

Market has responded. We’re in a different world. This is assuming we essentially get ourselves in a couple of quarters this is how we think about it. Two or three quarters, we’re back down to that three times or less leverage level after we do an acquisition. So that’s how we think about acquisitions.

And again, the size could be small. As Ron mentioned, we were able to grow Dramamine quite significantly. It was a $20,000,000 brand when we bought it. To larger transformational acquisitions with $1,000,000,000 of capacity today. So the road ahead.

While we were disappointed to adjust our full year numbers for this fiscal year, really isolated to two things that we think we have a very good handle on and we are addressing. And so Ron mentioned capacity constraints for clear eyes. We also recently announced our plans to acquire our largest provider of clear eyes, who has a high speed line coming on as we enter our fiscal third quarter, which will start on October 1. We also have two new suppliers who are coming online at about the same time. One is online already.

The other will come online around that time frame. And so we feel that we have a good handle on the issues. And as we move forward, again, the attributes of the business are unchanged, and it really speaks to the diversification of the portfolio that Ron touched on. Even with the adjustment of our top line for this year, we’re still holding our free cash flow outlook of $245,000,000 or more. So I think that’s an important thing to note.

So we talked about a little bit touched on the long term growth algorithm. So Ron mentioned how we get to that 2% to 3% of organic growth. And then the power of the cash flow, whether it was paying down debt, buying back shares, earning interest on the balance sheet, enables us to take that EPS growth at a 6% to 8% growth rate above, obviously, our top line growth. And then we think of M and A as additive. You’re going to hear when we think about M and A, the keyword we always talk about is discipline.

It’s not that we couldn’t have bought things over the years, but we remain disciplined to the long term view of these brands and what they can do in this space. And we think that served us well over the years. But M and A, we’ve got a very good playbook for M and A as well, very good at integrating things very quickly. And we’ll continue to stay disciplined, but the any M and A would be additive to this algorithm you see here. So lastly, just to sum it up, diversification is huge.

We saw it during COVID where brands like Dramamine almost had no sales, but no one wanted to go to the doctor. So brands like Monistat had a tremendous amount of sales. And then we saw it all reverse in the opposite direction afterwards. So again, just the power when you look at that pie chart, it’s diversified way beyond what you see in pie chart. We think that serves us very well.

And then also just the leading positions that we’re holding in our categories, right? Two thirds of our sales come from brands that are holding a number one position. And in many instances, it’s a meaningful position. It’s a 50% share, a 60% share with maybe a very small branded player behind it and then private label. We talked about the brand building playbook.

It starts with consumer insights. Starts that’s in the heart of everything that we’re doing. We’re going to hit a lot of singles and doubles. And so again, often it comes from consumer insights. And you look back and you say, well, no kidding.

I can’t believe there was no dramamine for children. But there wasn’t. And so we’ll continue to use those insights to move forward. We talked about our financial profile. Again, our ability to generate strong and consistent free cash flow has been happening year in and year out.

We see that happen over many different kinds of economic environments. Scalable platform. People say to us, well, what do you need if you buy a couple brands tomorrow? We probably need one or two people in operations and a few people in marketing. The platform is there.

It is extremely scalable. And again, we think a lot of opportunities out there, which takes you to the repeatable M and A strategy. We’ll continue to stay disciplined, but there’s a lot out there. We continue to look at all of them. And when it fits our very well defined criteria, we’ll move forward.

So all of those things kind of put together lead us to why we think we can drive long term shareholder value for everyone. Don’t know if there’s the ability to open this to questions. Open this up to questions if anybody has any.

Unidentified speaker: Think a lot of things are coming out of the portfolio. What are the kind of valuation?

Christine Sacco, Chief Operating and Financial Officer, Prestige Consumer Health Care: Sure. We haven’t really seen a meaningful shift in valuations for the kinds of things we’re looking for. Remember, we’re looking for brands that have a leading position in niche categories. And so when we’re competing with private equity, whom is the primary competition when we’re going after a brand or a company or a deal, we have a much lower cost of capital than they do. And our platform is way more sophisticated and scalable, I believe, than many of theirs.

You know, you think about quality and regulatory and pharmacovigilance and all the things that you need to be able to do, we’re certainly in a different position than some of those other companies.

Keene Howard, MedioLandom: Hey. Keene Howard from MedioLandom. Just a quick one given kind of feedback we’ve heard from your peers about the shifting in channel in channel channels from, let’s say, from the traditional kind of drugstores OTC to more club and retailers. Have you thought about how that may affect your business? And kind of can you summarize the relationship you have with kind of both channels?

Christine Sacco, Chief Operating and Financial Officer, Prestige Consumer Health Care: Sure. Do you want to

Ron Lombardi, Chairman and CEO, Prestige Consumer Health Care: take it? I can start. I think my microphone’s on. So channel shift isn’t something new for us to deal with. If you go back to 2019 before we had this big disruption from COVID in terms of where people shopped, Right?

We we saw the drug channel was facing some headwinds. Grocery and regional grocer grocers had some headwinds. Math and dollar were doing well during that time frame. You fast forward to today, and it’s kind of like we’re back to where we were in 2019. Right?

We’ve got retailers that are doing well and some that are challenged. The way we approach it is we want all of our retail partners to be successful. So we try to develop unique programs with each of them based on the positioning a brand may have in a drug channel. So it’s easy to say, oh, jeez, the drug channel is struggling, but it’s often the first shopping point for someone who’s looking to treat a serious disease. So drug is an important channel for Monistat, for lice, for example.

So we’re gonna look to partner with with drug and make the investment to support the success of those brands there, but scale back investments where shoppers may be going to a different channel to look for a a different price value proposition, whether it’s to mass, whether it’s to the convenience of Amazon where they can get great price transparency and get it delivered the next day or the same day depending on where where you are. So it’s not we don’t take the approach of this channel is suffering, so forget that, and we’ll go someplace else. Shoppers are still going into all these retail channels, and it creates an opportunity for us to work with the retailer to help them win and for us to connect with the consumer and win wherever they’re choosing to shop.

Christine Sacco, Chief Operating and Financial Officer, Prestige Consumer Health Care: Yeah. And just to piggyback on that, we’re channel agnostic from a margin perspective. We used to say that to people. Don’t think they believed us. And overnight, in about a month during COVID, we doubled our Amazon sales from or our online sales from 5% to 10%, and I think our margin was slightly up that period.

So it doesn’t happen that way by accident, right? We do not offer the same product offering in Dollar General as we do in Walmart, as we do on Amazon. You have to manage it that way, and we have absolutely that’s been a priority from for us from from day one. So we just want this consumer to take the product off the shelf wherever they’re going. Great.

Great. Yeah. Thanks for taking the time, everyone. Appreciate it.

Ron Lombardi, Chairman and CEO, Prestige Consumer Health Care: Have a good afternoon.

Buffett and Berkshire helped orchestrate the merger of Kraft and Heinz in 2015, but the stock has performed terribly since then.

Kraft Heinz is planning to split its condiments and sauces business from its North American grocer division.

In a rare public repudiation, Buffett went on CNBC and called the split ""disappointing.""

10 stocks we like better than Kraft Heinz ›

In a move that many thought could be coming, Kraft Heinz's (NASDAQ: KHC) management team has chosen to split into two. One company, Global Taste Elevation Co., will comprise the faster-growing sauces and condiments products. The other company, North American Grocery Co., will house the North American grocery business.

The move comes after shares of Kraft Heinz have struggled immensely, down over 22% in the past five years. Shifting consumer preferences into healthier foods have challenged Kraft Heinz's core business, while the company has also been working to lower its high debt load.

Following the announcement of the split, Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, the largest shareholder of Kraft Heinz, told CNBC that he is ""disappointed"" by the strategic move. Given Buffett's stature in the stock market, it's not easy for a company to go against the Oracle of Omaha, especially when Berkshire is the largest shareholder. Will the bold move pay off for Kraft Heinz?

Buffett is not pleased

Buffett and Berkshire essentially created the Kraft Heinz company we know today. In 2013, Berkshire teamed up with Brazilian private equity firm 3G to purchase Heinz in a deal valued at $28 billion, which included assumption of the company's debt. Two years later, Berkshire and 3G again worked together to merge the company with Kraft.

Berkshire is the largest shareholder today, owning 27.5% of outstanding shares. However, it's clear Buffett and Berkshire are not happy with the decision to split into two, citing the $300 million in expenses to split the company, the year it will take to complete the transaction, and the fact that shareholders did not get a vote on the decision.

Perhaps Buffett saw this coming, as Berkshire earlier this year gave up its two seats on Kraft Heinz's board of directors and marked down the position in the second quarter, indicating Berkshire may look to unwind its position. Berkshire's incoming CEO Greg Abel reportedly met with Kraft Heinz management about a week before the split announcement and voiced his displeasure with the idea.

Despite clear frustration, Buffett also told CNBC that it would not accept a block bid for its shares unless the same deal was offered to other shareholders.

Although Berkshire is clearly not happy, their decision to merge Kraft and Heinz has been a dud. Shares are down around 70% since the deal closed in 2015.

Aiming to give growth a better runway

The two new companies will be one focused on global taste innovation and North American Grocery. The global taste company will house faster-growing brands like Heinz, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, and Kraft Mac & Cheese. In 2024, these companies generated net sales of $15.4 billion and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amoritization (EBITDA) of $4 billion. The idea will be to maximize high-margin growth and leading market share.

The North American grocer business will include brands like Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles, Lunchables, Capri Sun, and Maxwell Coffee. In 2024, these businesses generated about $10.4 billion of sales and adjusted EBITDA of $2.3 billion. Management wants the grocer business to focus on reliable free cash flow generation via operational efficiency through stable brands.

Part of Kraft Heinz's issue has been that it operates so many different food brands, forcing the company to compete in many different consumer staple subcategories, which has made it difficult for the company to really focus and deliver strong market share in a number of categories. With two separate entities, this will change, according to Kraft Heinz's management team from the presentation explaining the decision:

... Separating into two independent, publicly traded companies will allow both companies to dedicate the right level of attention and resources to all areas of the business, improve execution, create better aligned incentives, and enable our iconic brands to reach their full potential. We will also be able to reduce operational complexity and tailor operating models, driving further efficiencies and industry-leading margins.

As mentioned, the split will result in $300 million of ""dis-synergies."" The split is expected to close in the second half of 2026. Kraft Heinz's high 6%-plus dividend yield is expected to be maintained in aggregate at inception, although the capital structures of each company including reallocation of the debt has yet to be determined.

Can it work?

There are still a lot of unknowns here, including how the debt will be reallocated and whether either company can achieve the desired growth. It's also possible that the faster-growing Global Taste Elevation business draws the majority of investor interest. I also wonder whether the bulk of the dividends will eventually be allocated to the grocer business to draw more dividend investors, and then have the taste business pay fewer dividends and focus on growth and appreciation.

Buffett and Berkshire have acknowledged that they made mistakes in the past with Kraft Heinz, but despite the stock's wretched performance, Berkshire hasn't bought or sold a share since 2015.

It's too hard to make a real call at this point because it's largely a show-me story right now. The good news is that investors should be able to ride out the high dividend until at least the split happens next year. The bad news is the company has lost the support of Berkshire, which the market holds in high regard.

Even if Kraft Heinz's plan does work, this investment is for patient, long-term investors. It certainly won't happen overnight.

No longer confined to isolated R&D labs or proprietary breakthroughs, companies are now designing interconnected innovation ecosystems to navigate volatile markets and secure long-term competitive advantage. These ecosystems—spanning technology, policy, and cross-border collaboration—have become the bedrock of resilience, enabling firms to scale sustainable solutions while aligning with investor expectations for ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) performance.

The Strategic Imperative: From Isolation to Interconnection

The 2025 global economy is defined by ecosystem-driven innovation, where success is measured not by patents alone but by the ability to translate ideas into scalable, commercially viable solutions. Firms like Tesla and Standard Chartered exemplify this shift. Tesla's integration of electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage, and AI-driven manufacturing has created a self-reinforcing ecosystem, driving a 150% market value increase since 2023. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered's climate-action initiatives—embedding sustainability into operations and reporting $982 million in sustainable finance income in 2024—demonstrate how ESG alignment can boost both financial returns and investor confidence.

The McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025 underscores the role of frontier technologies in reshaping ecosystems. AI is no longer a standalone tool but a foundational enabler of broader transformation, from application-specific semiconductors to agentic AI systems. This has spurred localized investments in critical technologies, with nations and corporations prioritizing self-sufficiency. For instance, the Rise Ahead Pledge—a $277 million commitment by 25 corporations to social innovation—highlights the alignment of private and public sectors in building resilient ecosystems.

Ecosystem Design and Long-Term Profitability

The implications of ecosystem design on profitability are profound. EY and OECD studies reveal that top-performing ecosystems reduce costs by 1.5x and generate 2.1x more revenue than low-performing ones, significantly boosting margins and resilience. Tesla's ecosystem, for example, has reduced coordination costs while accelerating innovation in EVs and energy storage. Similarly, Alibaba's hybrid cloud ecosystem, despite regulatory challenges, has unlocked new revenue streams, illustrating the importance of diversification and governance in sustaining long-term value.

Operational efficiency is another avenue for profitability. Delta Air Lines saved $110 million in 2025 by optimizing flight paths and reducing fuel burn, while H&M's circular economy strategy—reducing Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 41% and using 29.5% recycled materials—positions it to capitalize on the $460 billion circular economy market. These examples highlight how low-cost, high-impact innovations align with both environmental and financial goals.

Sectors and Firms Best Positioned for Growth

AI-native ecosystems are emerging as a critical frontier. Cities like Boston, Silicon Valley, and London lead in AI-related venture capital, with startups leveraging machine learning to disrupt healthcare, logistics, and fintech. The AI-Native Transition factor—measuring AI startups' share of total tech funding—has become a key indicator of ecosystem health. Firms like Google and Amazon are leveraging these ecosystems to reduce coordination costs and accelerate innovation.

Emerging markets are also gaining traction. São Paulo, now the highest-ranked Latin American ecosystem, has attracted record early-stage funding and produced 10 unicorns, driven by government support and a focus on climate-tech and fintech. Similarly, Shenzhen and Beijing in China have surged due to AI-native startups and state-backed infrastructure. Investors targeting these regions can capitalize on high-growth potential as they scale.

ESG-integrated models are another high-conviction area. Starbucks and H&M demonstrate that sustainability is a revenue driver when supported by measurable targets and transparent reporting. H&M's 29.5% use of recycled materials and 41% reduction in emissions align with a $460 billion market opportunity, while Starbucks' ESG-linked revenue growth underscores the financial viability of systemic sustainability.

Strategic Recommendations for Investors

Prioritize Ecosystem Orchestrators: Firms like Tesla, Apple, and Amazon act as orchestrators, connecting startups, corporates, and policymakers to create self-reinforcing networks. These companies generate recurring revenue and network effects, making them attractive long-term investments.

Target Emerging Ecosystems: São Paulo, Bengaluru, and Shenzhen offer outsized returns as they scale. For example, Shenzhen's AI-native startups, backed by state infrastructure, are poised to disrupt global supply chains.

Leverage AI and Frontier Tech: AI-native ecosystems represent the next frontier. Investors should focus on firms building platforms that enable others to innovate, such as Palantir's enterprise AI solutions or IBM's hybrid cloud ecosystem.

Assess Resilience Metrics: Use ESG frameworks to evaluate supply chain diversification, R&D spend, and governance models. Tesla's energy ecosystem and Microsoft's carbon-negative pledge are prime examples of resilience-driven strategies.

Conclusion: The Future Belongs to Ecosystem Builders

The post-pandemic era has redefined competitive advantage, with innovation ecosystems becoming the new standard. Firms that master orchestration, adaptability, and ESG alignment will outperform peers in growth, margins, and resilience. For investors, the key is to identify ecosystem leaders early—companies like Tesla, Apple, and Amazon—and ride their momentum. As the OECD and EY studies show, the future belongs to those who build, not just sell. By fostering collaboration, bridging ecosystem gaps, and maintaining a long-term vision, investors can position themselves to drive the next wave of technological and economic transformation.

Healthcare Brew reached out to both Walgreens and Sycamore Partners for comment on the potential for layoffs or store closures, but did not hear back by publication.","Walgreens has completed a deal to be bought by private equity firm Sycamore Partners, and pharmacy experts are worried it’ll bring with it layoffs and pharmacy closures.

Rumors of the takeover began swirling last December, and Walgreens executives confirmed in March they had signed a definitive agreement with Sycamore. As part of the deal, Walgreens and its subsidiaries are to be split into five separate, privately owned companies: retail pharmacy chain Walgreens, pharmaceutical wholesaler the Boots Group, specialty pharmacy company Shields Health Solutions, post-acute care company CareCentrix, and primary care clinic chain VillageMD.

Under Sycamore’s ownership, Walgreens will be led by CEO Mike Motz, who previously worked as CEO of Staples US Retail, a company the private equity firm acquired in 2017. Former Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth will continue to serve as a director, company execs said in an Aug. 28 press release.

Industry reactions. Shane Jerominski, co-founder of the Pharmacy Guild, a pharmacy workers union formed in late 2023 that represents employees at some Walgreens and CVS locations, told Healthcare Brew in an emailed statement the deal “raises serious concerns for pharmacy professionals and the patients we serve.”

“When private equity firms take over, patients and communities are too often left paying the price through store closures, reduced staffing, and prescription errors—all of which jeopardize safe patient care,” Jerominski said, also highlighting that Sycamore has no background in healthcare or retail pharmacy.

Sycamore’s restructuring of Walgreens “must not come at the expense of patient safety or the dignity of the professionals who keep our pharmacies running,” Jerominski added.

Cherokee Layson-Wolf, a professor in the department of practice, sciences, and health outcomes research at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, told Healthcare Brew her biggest concern is how the deal will affect patient access to pharmacies.

For example, Sycamore may choose to consolidate pharmacy locations and rely more on central fill locations, Layson-Wolf said, which are facilities that fill and transfer prescriptions to pharmacies.

Walgreens has 11 such locations—the company calls them micro-fulfillment centers—that send prescriptions to more than 4,500 stores, Wentworth said in the company’s Q1 2025 earnings call in January. At the time, Wentworth said he wanted to get that closer to 6,000 stores this year.

More central fill locations could mean fewer pharmacies, which may affect patients’ ability to see their pharmacist, Layson-Wolf said.

In a statement released following the announcement, Jim Baker, executive director of nonprofit Private Equity Stakeholder Project (PESP), said the deal puts “patients, workers, and entire communities at risk” because of Sycamore’s record of bankruptcies, layoffs, and cost cutting, which could lead to fewer pharmacies and “thousands of workers” losing their jobs.

Walgreens has already announced plans to close 1,200 stores, and PESP warned “store closures could accelerate under Sycamore Partners’s ownership,” adding closures tend to “disproportionately impact low-income, rural, and minority communities and can create ‘pharmacy deserts’ where patients lose access to essential medicines and services,” according to the statement.

Since Sycamore acquired Staples, the company has shut nearly one-third of its stores in the US, according to PESP. If the same number of Walgreens stores close, that would mean more than 70,000 layoffs, the nonprofit estimated.

Walgreens already announced a number of layoffs in 2024, including 145 “mostly corporate” employees in January, 646 employees in March, an undisclosed number of roles in April, and 256 employees in December, we previously reported.

Warren Buffett told CNBC he's ""disappointed"" that Kraft Heinz plans to split into two companies, essentially reversing the merger he helped orchestrate in 2015 that has turned out to be one of his biggest investment mistakes.

In an off-camera phone call on Tuesday with ""Squawk Box"" co-anchor Becky Quick, Buffett said he is also disappointed the split will not be subject to a shareholder vote.

With a 27.5% stake currently valued at $8.9 billion, Berkshire Hathaway is by far the food giant's largest shareholder.

Buffett said Berkshire's CEO-designate Greg Abel expressed their disapproval directly to the Kraft Heinz management team before the final decision was made.

It is extremely unusual for Berkshire, which is almost always a passive investor, to publicly, or even privately, criticize the management of one of its holdings.

Wall Street shared Buffett's disappointment.

Kraft Heinz shares fell as much as 7.6% on Tuesday after the announcement early that morning, but made back some of that loss, finishing down just 2.4% for the holiday-shortened week.

Will Buffett's unhappiness prompt Berkshire to sell some or all of its stake?

He didn't rule it out, saying, ""We will proceed to do whatever we think is in the best interest of Berkshire.""

Buffett did add, ""If we are approached about selling our shares, we wouldn't accept the block bid unless the same offer is made to other Kraft Heinz shareholders."" That is, unless someone is willing to buy the entire company.

Becky reported Buffett doesn't like the $300 million in additional overhead costs that will be spent to implement the split over the next year, and he doesn't think it will do much good.

""It certainly didn't turn out to be a brilliant idea to put them together, but I don't think taking it apart will fix it.""

In 2013, Berkshire joined with Brazil's 3G Capital Management to buy H.J. Heinz for $23.3 billion.

Two years later, when Kraft merged with Heinz, Berkshire emerged with more than 325 million shares in the new company valued at around $24 billion when the deal closed in July of 2015.

While the value of Berkshire's stake did well immediately after the merger, rising to around $30 billion in 2016, it slid sharply over the following three years and has been bouncing around $10 billion since 2020.

In his 2015 letter to shareholders, Buffett wrote the shares cost Berkshire $9.8 billion, so right now it has an overall loss of around $1.0 billion.

Berkshire wrote down the investment by $3.8 billion in the second quarter to better reflect its market value. It did a $3.0 billion write-down in 2019.

In a 2019 live CNBC interview with Becky Quick, Buffett had some regrets about Berkshire's role in the Kraft Heinz merger, saying he had ""overpaid"" for a good company.

The stock price has dropped 69% since the merger closed.

The split did not come as a complete surprise.

In July, The Wall Street Journal reported Kraft Heinz was ""eyeing spinning off a large chunk of its grocery business, including many Kraft products.""

Two Berkshire executives resigned from the KHC board in May after the company revealed an ""ongoing evaluation of strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value.""

Those resignations prompted speculation at the time Berkshire could start selling, ""creating an overhang on the stock,"" according to one analyst.

That overhang is even more ominous now.

Because Berkshire owns more than 10% of KHC shares, it will need to report any open market sales within two business days, which could prompt other investors to also sell.

Buffett isn't alone in his criticism of the split.

The Financial Times writes, ""At its heart, Kraft Heinz's problem is it has failed to respond to changing consumer tastes."" It thinks the split is ""less a bold strategic pivot, and more the result of years of underperformance caused by prioritising [UK spelling] cost cuts over innovation.""

Reuters columnist Jennifer Saba calls the ""remaking [of] the sausage ... as unpleasant to see as ever.""

""Despite producing a wide variety of brands, the endless cycle of wheeling and dealing seems to come in only one yucky flavor"" with ""implausibly optimistic"" financial engineering.

This puts pressure on companies' management teams, who are turning to acquisitions to bolster growth or selling off businesses that are a drag on performance.","BarcelonaIn the business world, there are also trends and changes in strategy. And sometimes, they work like a pendulum: in some periods, concentrations prevail, through mergers or acquisitions; and in others, separations. The American giant Kraft Heinz is a recent example. A decade after integrating brands such as Philadelphia cheese, the famous Heinz ketchup, and Oscar Mayer sausages into a single group, the two companies are separating.

On the one hand, the sauces, condiments, and spreads business; and on the other, the food business in North America. The sauces and condiments company, provisionally named Global Taste Elevation Co., achieved net sales of $15.4 billion (€13.191 billion) last year, and the basic food products business, provisionally named North American Grocery Co., recorded revenues of 9.00.

The group justifies the measure, unanimously approved by its board of directors, by the need to create businesses with a better strategic focus and less complexity. It is not the only company in the sector that has decided to reduce its diversification in order to focus. This break—after creating one of the largest food groups in the world in 2015—coincides with a change in consumer habits, who are moving away from processed foods and opting for healthier and fresher options. The company has reduced its market value by a third since 2017, when it reached its peak.

Ferrero and cereals

In any case, it's not always about splitting a company, but rather selling off parts of the business, as another US food giant, the famous cereal producer WK Kellogg, did. Ferrero, the family-owned Italian confectionery giant that owns brands like Nutella, agreed a few weeks ago to acquire the American company. This purchase represents the European group's latest attempt to grow its business in North America.

WK Kellogg was created in 2023 when the Kellogg Company spun off its cereal business into an independent company. The remaining business, which focused on snacks like Pringles chips, was renamed Kellanova. This company was also acquired by Mars, the family-owned company behind confectionery products like M&M's and Snickers, in a deal valued at more than €30.7 billion. Recently, the Unilever conglomerate decided to spin off its ice cream business, which plans to go public in November.

Typically, spin-offs or sales of parts of a business aim to increase shareholder value, adapt to new consumer habits, or reduce management complexities. But activist investors often also exert pressure for greater profitability. This is what happened with the hedge fund Elliott Investment Management, which sent a letter to the board of directors of PepsiCo, in which it is a shareholder, criticizing the company for ""a lack of strategic clarity, slowing growth, and eroding profitability."" The capital management firm called for a review of the company's structure, which, in addition to the famous Pepsi soft drinks, owns other brands such as Lay's and 7 Up.

Kraft Heinz's management emphasizes that the separation will allow the appropriate level of attention and resources to be dedicated to all areas of the business, ""allowing each respective brand portfolio to reach its full potential."" It also seeks to reduce operational complexity by driving greater efficiencies and customizing capital allocation based on each company's strategic ambition, accelerating performance and maintaining financial flexibility. Warren Buffett, the group's largest shareholder through Berkshire Hathaway, criticized the merger between the two companies ten years ago and has now expressed his disapproval of the separation because he believes it does not add value.

Analysts point out that the decline in sales volumes of food, snacks, and beverages following a period of high inflation is driving down companies' share prices. This puts pressure on companies' management teams, who are turning to acquisitions to bolster growth or selling off businesses that are a drag on performance.

In any case, a study by the consulting firm EY and Goldman Sachs (Strategies for successful corporate separations) concludes that when corporate spin-offs are executed well, they can generate combined excess returns of around 6% from announcement to two years after closing, compared to the rest of the companies' industries.",https://static1.ara.cat/clip/cd1e9d02-7c9c-431e-b245-8d8bbf24e373_facebook-aspect-ratio_default_0.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 12:28:35.496600

Such a shift will not only secure Vietnam’s export markets but also align the sector with circular economy trends, climate resilience, and cultural development.","Vietnam’s coffee industry is experiencing a breakthrough year, with exports setting new records in both volume and value.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment, coffee exports in the first eight months of 2025 reached 1.2 million tons, worth $6.42 billion. This represents an 8.7% rise in volume and a remarkable 59.1% increase in value compared to the same period last year.

With this momentum, export earnings can approach $8 billion in the 2024-2025 crop year, far surpassing the record $5.6 billion of 2024.

Industry leaders attributed the growth not only to higher global prices but also to Vietnam’s strategy of upgrading quality, expanding specialty coffee, adopting sustainability certification, and meeting international standards. These shifts have helped Vietnamese coffee strengthen its global position and reduce pricing risks.

The average export price stood at $5,580 per ton, up 46.4% year-on-year. Germany, Italy, and Spain remained top buyers, while exports to Mexico surged over 90-fold. Despite modest growth, shipments to China rose 11.7%.

Experts noted that longstanding investments in processing technology and supply chain transparency have lifted the competitiveness of Vietnamese Robusta, making it a preferred choice for roasters worldwide.

Enterprises are also moving into higher-value segments such as specialty and processed coffee, supported by free trade agreements including EVFTA, UKVFTA, and CPTPP.

Private firms have emerged as a driving force. Vinh Hiep Company of Gia Lai province posted over $750 million in exports and expects to surpass $1 billion this year, accounting for more than 12% of national coffee exports.

Meanwhile, Phuc Sinh Group stressed that Vietnamese Robusta, once considered low-priced, is now commanding some of the highest prices globally thanks to advanced processing, modern roasting systems, and expansion into instant and specialty lines.

Vietnam currently cultivates around 732,000 hectares of coffee, with an average yield of 2.9 tons per hectare. Advanced farming models can reach up to 5 tons per hectare, underscoring significant potential for growth.

Despite looming challenges from stricter environmental regulations such as the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), industry experts view this as an opportunity to pivot towards green, sustainable models.

Such a shift will not only secure Vietnam’s export markets but also align the sector with circular economy trends, climate resilience, and cultural development.",https://t.ex-cdn.com/theinvestor.vn/560w/files/honghanh.nguyen/2025/09/06/5930-vietnam-the-investor-222751.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 14:12:23.835946

Monitor EBITDA Margins: Track Goop's ability to improve margins through cost optimization and high-margin product lines.
Assess Retail Partnerships: Ulta's performance in the luxury beauty segment will be a critical indicator of Goop's retail viability.","In the evolving landscape of luxury consumer brands, the concept of premiumization has emerged as a defining trend. Post-pandemic, consumers are no longer satisfied with mere products—they demand emotional resonance, ethical alignment, and immersive experiences. This shift has forced brands to rethink their strategies, prioritizing ecosystem-driven innovation and brand positioning to capture value in a hyper-competitive market. Goop, the wellness and lifestyle brand founded by Gwyneth Paltrow, offers a compelling case study of how strategic pivots and ecosystem design can reshape investor returns in the luxury sector.

The Strategic Pivot: From Mass Market to Premium Ecosystem

Goop's journey from a mass-market beauty brand to a curated, premium wellness ecosystem exemplifies the power of repositioning. In 2023, the brand phased out its budget-friendly Good Clean Goop line, a move that signaled its commitment to premiumization. By 2024, Goop had fully embraced a luxury identity, launching its Goop Beauty line and securing a partnership with Ulta Beauty, expanding its retail presence to 800 locations. This pivot aligned with the $446 billion global luxury beauty market, which is growing at a 13% annual rate.

The brand's strategy is rooted in ecosystem design: integrating digital-first storytelling, sustainability, and high-margin product offerings. For instance, Goop's 2023 podcast episode “Building a Brand That Lasts” emphasized the importance of “storytelling and creative conviction,” reflecting a broader narrative that resonates with Gen Z and millennial consumers. This approach has transformed Goop from a product-centric brand into a lifestyle curator, blending wellness, fashion, and food under a unified ethos.

Financial Performance: Growth, Challenges, and Investor Sentiment

Goop's financial metrics post-pivot reveal a mixed but promising picture. In 2024, the brand reported a 34% revenue growth in its core beauty segment, with Goop Beauty and G. Label (its fashion line) growing by 21% and 45%, respectively. Its ghost kitchen division, Goop Kitchen, saw a staggering 60% revenue increase, underscoring the effectiveness of its omnichannel strategy. However, profitability remains elusive. Despite profitable months in 2024, Goop is still unprofitable in 2025, with two rounds of layoffs (18% in September 2024 and 6% in December 2024) aimed at optimizing costs.

Investors are evaluating Goop's valuation, which rose from $250 million in 2018 to an estimated $433 million by 2025. While the brand has attracted backing from top-tier venture firms like New Enterprise Associates and Lightspeed Venture Partners, its path to scalability is constrained by its reliance on Paltrow's celebrity influence and its niche positioning.

Ecosystem-Driven Innovation: The Goop Model

Goop's success lies in its ability to create a closed-loop ecosystem that bridges digital engagement, physical retail, and sustainability. Key elements include:

1. Omnichannel Retail: The Ulta partnership expanded Goop's reach while maintaining its premium image. By leveraging Ulta's “Conscious Beauty” initiative, Goop emphasized sustainability—a critical factor for eco-conscious consumers.

2. Digital Storytelling: Through podcasts, social media, and content marketing, Goop has cultivated a loyal community centered on wellness and authenticity. This “social-first brand building” approach fosters emotional connections, driving repeat purchases.

3. Product Innovation: Goop's focus on high-performance, clean beauty aligns with the post-pandemic demand for transparency and efficacy. Its 72-Hour Hydrating Cream, for example, became a bestseller by combining scientific rigor with aspirational branding.

Investor Considerations: Risks and Opportunities

For investors, Goop represents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity. On one hand, its alignment with the $6 trillion wellness boom and the 5% CAGR growth of the premiumization segment positions it to capitalize on long-term trends. On the other, its financial scale pales in comparison to industry giants like L'Oréal and Estée Lauder, which leverage AI-driven personalization and global distribution networks.

Key risks include:

- Scalability Challenges: Goop's reliance on Paltrow's personal brand limits its ability to scale organically.

- Profitability Pressures: The luxury beauty market is capital-intensive, and Goop's 2025 unprofitability raises questions about its ability to sustain growth.

- Competitive Landscape: Larger players are rapidly adopting similar strategies, including sustainability and digital engagement.

However, Goop's unique value proposition—its ability to blend wellness, storytelling, and premiumization—offers a compelling edge. Its 2025 plans for international expansion and store openings in New York suggest a long-term vision that could justify its valuation.

Strategic Recommendations for Investors

Long-Term Horizon: Investors should adopt a 3–5 year outlook, given Goop's focus on brand-building over short-term exits.

Diversification: Pair Goop with other premiumization-driven brands (e.g., Allbirds, Patagonia) to hedge against sector-specific risks.

Monitor EBITDA Margins: Track Goop's ability to improve margins through cost optimization and high-margin product lines.

Assess Retail Partnerships: Ulta's performance in the luxury beauty segment will be a critical indicator of Goop's retail viability.

Conclusion: The Future of Luxury is Ecosystem-Driven

Goop's strategic pivot underscores a broader truth: the future of luxury lies in ecosystem-driven innovation. By aligning with post-pandemic consumer values—authenticity, sustainability, and emotional resonance—Goop has redefined what it means to be a premium brand. While its financial journey remains uncertain, its ability to adapt and innovate positions it as a bellwether for the next era of luxury consumerism. For investors willing to navigate the risks, Goop offers a glimpse into a future where brands thrive not by selling products, but by curating experiences.

In a world where exclusivity is defined by connection rather than price, the winners will be those who, like Goop, master the art of ecosystem design.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 11:11:56.337213

Overall, 93% of enterprises surveyed are either piloting, deploying, or enabling AI capabilities in 2025, with telecom, consumer products, and aerospace & defence leading the charge. The most impacted functions include customer operations, marketing, risk management, and IT. “Enterprise adoption of AI is scaling faster than almost any technology we’ve seen before,” said Franck Greverie, chief technology and portfolio officer and group executive board member at Capgemini. “But rapid adoption doesn’t necessarily translate into large-scale deployment with tangible ROI. To succeed, enterprises must set up a solid data foundation, in a trusted environment that’s compliant, secure and ensures necessary privacy. This, along with a new operating model with a balanced human-AI chemistry, can ensure winning business outcomes.” The report also highlights a sharp rise in generative AI investment, with 88% of companies increasing spending by an average of 9% in the past year. But this rapid scale-up has caused unexpected “bill shocks,” with more than half of enterprises hit by rising cloud costs, pushing many to explore smaller, cheaper language models. Despite optimism, trust remains a barrier: 71% of companies said they cannot yet fully rely on autonomous agents, and fewer than half have robust AI governance frameworks in place.

OpenAI has announced plans to launch an AI-focused jobs platform aimed at connecting qualified candidates with companies, part of a broader strategy to expand AI literacy and its business applications. The new “OpenAI Jobs Platform” is designed to help both large corporations and local businesses, as well as local governments, identify talent capable of leveraging AI in the workplace. The service, expected to launch by mid-2026, could position OpenAI as a competitor to Microsoft’s LinkedIn, despite the two companies’ existing partnership and Microsoft’s $13 billion investment in the AI startup.

Fidji Simo, CEO of OpenAI applications and former head of Instacart, emphasized that the platform will not only facilitate talent acquisition but also empower smaller organizations and public entities to compete effectively by finding skilled workers. The initiative reflects OpenAI’s commitment to enhancing workforce capabilities in a labor market increasingly influenced by AI technologies.

In conjunction with the jobs platform, OpenAI plans to expand its OpenAI Academy, an online learning platform that teaches workers to apply AI skills on the job. The program will introduce new certification tracks ranging from basic AI literacy to advanced skills such as prompt engineering and AI-custom job applications. The Academy uses ChatGPT’s Study mode, which enables interactive learning by prompting questions, providing hints, and giving feedback rather than direct answers. Certifications will be adaptable for organizations’ internal learning and development programs, with OpenAI already collaborating with major employers like Walmart. The company aims to certify 10 million Americans in AI skills by 2030.

These developments come as concerns grow over AI’s impact on the labor market. Several business leaders, including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, have announced layoffs linked to AI adoption, and studies suggest the technology may disproportionately affect certain job categories. Simo acknowledged the disruptive nature of AI, stressing the importance of preparing workers and connecting them with companies seeking AI talent to expand economic opportunities. Research from labor market data provider Lightcast indicates that positions requiring AI expertise command higher salaries compared to non-AI roles.

OpenAI’s initiatives also align with federal efforts to promote AI literacy. The company has strengthened ties with the U.S. government, launching OpenAI for Government and securing a Department of Defense contract valued up to $200 million. OpenAI is additionally participating in the $500 billion Stargate project, aimed at building AI infrastructure across the U.S. over the next four years. CEO Sam Altman recently joined a group of tech leaders meeting with the President to discuss AI development, highlighting the importance of responsible management and educational integration as the technology continues to advance.",https://beijingtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/108024232-1724336619758-gettyimages-1590511768-TAXI_PROTEST-23.webp,N,,2025-09-06 15:13:07.791385

Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (NASDAQ: GT) is one of the world’s tire heavyweights, rolling out products from 53 facilities in 20 countries. Goodyear operates across the Americas, Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA), and Asia Pacific—creating, making, and selling tires for everything from family cars to big rigs and earthmovers. The company’s revenue mainly comes from replacing worn-out tires for individual drivers and fleets, plus manufacturing original equipment (OE) tires for carmakers and commercial vehicle builders. The global tire industry’s worth an estimated $278 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow at 3.8% a year through 2030, so there’s plenty of rubber on the road ahead. The five largest players—Bridgestone (14% share), Michelin (13%), Goodyear (10%), Continental (9%), and Pirelli (6%)—make up more than half the market. Goodyear’s edge? A brand name you know, a far-reaching retail network, and investments in tech (think: smart and electric-vehicle tires). But it’s a tough race, with pricing, innovation, and operating costs under the microscope thanks to rivals bigger and better resourced than Goodyear.

Recent Performance

Over the past year (to early September 2025), Goodyear shares slid 5.9% while the S&P 500 climbed 17.3%. That gap has a lot to do with a tricky 2024: net sales dropped 5.9% as tire volumes fell, product mix changed for the worse, input costs climbed, and a stronger U.S. dollar weighed on international sales. A $480 million boost from Goodyear’s cost-cutting plan and insurance payouts helped soften the blow. In Q2 2025, sales dipped 1.3% in the Americas and were inconsistent elsewhere as Goodyear navigated import surges and sold off its off-the-road (OTR) business. Alongside these headwinds, the company raked in over $1.6 billion in gross proceeds from recent asset sales—helping to shore up its balance sheet, even as investors stayed cautious.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

Goodyear’s revenue peaked at $20.07 billion in 2023, then fell to $18.88 billion in 2024. Wall Street thinks sales will inch back up: $18.98 billion in 2025 (+0.6%) and $19.16 billion in 2026 (+0.9%). Gains should come from higher prices, improved product mix, and tweaks to Goodyear’s portfolio. The company is also chasing margins, aiming for $1.5 billion in annual savings by late 2025, and winning more original equipment contracts—Goodyear picked up U.S. market share for OE in Q2 2025. Specialty tires like those for electric vehicles and trucks are another growth engine.

Quality & Moat

Goodyear’s profits are back in the black, with a $70 million gain in 2024 and $254 million earned just in Q2 2025. That’s a turnaround from losses in 2023, thanks to steady cost-cutting. Return on invested capital (ROIC) now stands at 7.42%, better than Goodyear’s five-year average (5.46%) but still well behind the market’s 11.12%. Operating margin rose to 5.42% (vs. five-year avg. 3.52%), and free cash flow yield leapt to 37.5% (five-year avg. 8.02%), showing cash generation is robust—despite ongoing restructurings. Goodyear’s competitive edge comes from its brand, efficient manufacturing at scale, and solid customer ties in replacement and OE channels. Management has stayed disciplined on capital allocation, using over $1.6 billion from asset sales (since February 2025) for debt reduction and reinvestment in higher-margin products.

Valuation

With shares at $8.50, Goodyear trades at a forward P/E of 7.04x—much cheaper than the market’s 25.69x and industry peers like Bridgestone (~13x). Its EV/Sales ratio of 0.55x is just below its own five-year average of 0.60x, and well below the market’s 4.48x. This discount reflects cyclical swings, hefty debt (net debt/EBITDA at 3.41x vs. the market’s 1.38x), and ongoing risks around execution. Still, if Goodyear can pull off its turnaround and hit a 10% segment margin by late 2025, there’s room for a re-rating.

Market Sentiment

Analysts are cautiously hopeful. Big names like JP Morgan (Buy, $17 target) and Deutsche Bank (Strong Buy, $13 target) see upside of 19–56% from here. Goodyear’s relative strength (RS) rating is up to 83—top fifth of all stocks—but technical signals suggest it’s not quite in a classic buy zone, according to IBD. Short sellers are active, with 7.9% of shares floated sold short, while institutional owners control over 89% of the stock.

Key Risks

Leverage Levels: Net debt/EBITDA of 3.41x is much higher than the market’s 1.38x, which means Goodyear is more exposed if earnings stumble.

Cyclical Demand: Tire sales move in step with auto production, replacement cycles, and freight activity—all of which can dip if the economy slows.

Raw Material Costs: Swinging prices for rubber, steel, and oil can squeeze margins, and Goodyear doesn’t always have the power to pass cost hikes on to customers.

Divestiture Execution: Goodyear needs smooth and timely closings on its asset sales (including OTR, Dunlop, and chemical businesses) to hit its targets for reducing leverage.

Foreign Exchange: A strong U.S. dollar eats into revenue from international operations, as seen in 2024’s $192 million drag from currency moves.

Bull Case

Deep Valuation Discount: With a forward P/E of 7x and EV/Sales of 0.55x, Goodyear has room to rerate if it nails the turnaround.

Strong Cash Generation: A free cash flow yield of 37% gives Goodyear firepower to pay down debt, reinvest in premium products, or return cash to shareholders.

Transformation Tailwinds: The Goodyear Forward plan yielded $480 million in 2024 and $195 million in Q2 2025, with $1.5 billion in annual savings targeted by end-2025.

OEM Share Gains: Goodyear continues to pick up original equipment contracts in the U.S.—a higher-margin segment than replacement tires.

Asset Sale Proceeds: Over $1.6 billion in gross proceeds from recent business sales (OTR, Dunlop, chemical) have improved Goodyear’s balance sheet.

Bear Case

Execution Risk: If Goodyear misses on cost savings or asset sales take longer (or close at lower prices), financial goals could slip, and underperformance could drag on.

High Volatility: A beta of 1.31 and stock volatility at 72.8% (vs. the market’s 25%) mean shares can move sharply in either direction.

Competitive Pressure: Giants like Bridgestone and Michelin have bigger war chests, making it tough for Goodyear to hold the line on prices.

Economic Slowdown: If auto sales slump or drivers put off replacing tires, volumes could fall further and margins might get squeezed.

Currency Headwinds: Another leg up for the U.S. dollar could keep international sales under pressure.

On Our Radar

Q3 2025 Earnings: Results expected in early November 2025—look out for updates on tire volumes, savings delivery, and margin trends.

Chemical Business Sale: Goodyear aims to close the sale late in 2025, planning to channel the proceeds into cutting debt further.

Regulatory Shifts: New tire standards or trade changes—like anti-dumping measures—could push costs up or reshape pricing.

EV Tire Contracts: Signing new electric-vehicle OEM deals would be a strong signal Goodyear’s carving out a spot in this fast-growing market.

Investment Conclusion

Goodyear’s 2025 comeback story depends on pulling in the full $1.5 billion in Goodyear Forward savings, wrapping up key business sales, and keeping tire volumes steady in a naturally bumpy market. Right now, the shares offer a compelling risk/reward profile for long-term investors who can stomach some execution hiccups and economic twists. Still, heavy debt, unpredictable raw material costs, and fierce rivals mean caution is essential. Investors should keep an eye on upcoming earnings and how divestitures progress before making any moves.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-09-06 12:28:52.441373
