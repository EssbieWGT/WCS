Extreme Networks Launches New Partner Program To Position Specialists Against Network Heavyweights

Extreme Networks makes this week’s Came to Win list for its launch of a new partner program that seeks to meet the changing networking market needs of enterprise customers while providing simplicity for channel partners.

The Extreme Partner First program simplifies deal registration, serves up more transparent pricing, offers new training and certifications, and uses AI to improve time to revenue and profitability with less friction, according to Joe Spencer, Extreme’s senior vice president of global channel and strategic initiatives.

“Our program has been around for quite some time. It was designed for what the market needed several years ago, and we listened to our partners and redesigned for what they need today,” Spencer told CRN. “I want partners to know that we’re going to do business with them in a simple and predictable fashion that builds trust between us and them and that if we go to market together, they know what to expect, and that they’re going to solve their needed customer outcomes with ease with Extreme versus our competition.”

Extreme Partner First offers a unified rebate structure, quicker deal approvals, and clearer pricing and benefits for partners. For more predictable profitability, the program provides one global, SKU- and volume-based rebate model and a unified global framework for deal registration with a 48-hour target approval for service level agreements that makes it easier for partners to pursue and scale international opportunities.

Extreme will also help partners close deals faster thanks to its new Partner AI Sales Assistant, a feature that helps partners find critical sales information in seconds, the Morrisville, N.C.-based company said.

Through new training opportunities, partners can earn combined certifications for installation and troubleshooting, with a specific focus on AI readiness and use cases within the company’s flagship Extreme Platform ONE.

D&H Acquires Fulfillment.com In Third-Party Logistics Play

D&H made a savvy acquisition this week, buying Fulfillment.com, a Savannah, Ga.-based provider of technology for e-commerce fulfillment, in a move the IT distributor said will expand its Scale third-party logistics and supply chain services business.

Fulfillment.com is a top provider of e-commerce fulfillment services to high-volume, multi-channel and omni-channel internet retailers worldwide. The company says it ships millions of business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) orders to over 150 countries.

D&H told CRN the acquisition is focused on expanding the capabilities of D&H’s Scale business and strengthening the distributor’s ecommerce fulfillment and third-party logistics operations. D&H Scale is an in-house supply chain management organization that offers end-to-end B2B and B2C commerce capabilities.

D&H Scale is independent of D&H’s core technology distribution strategy and the Fulfillment.com acquisition does not involve changes to channel programs, partner engagement models or distribution operations.

But while Fulfillment.com is focused on B2C distribution, the company’s technology could be a boon to D&H’s channel partner community through enhanced third-party logistics capabilities, expanded direct-to-consumer fulfillment, an improved global e-commerce infrastructure,and advanced technology-driven logistics.

Fulfillment.com has four fulfillment centers in the U.S. and one each in Canada, the U.K., the Netherlands, and Australia. The company says that in the U.S., it can make one-day to two-day delivery to 99.97 percent of the continental U.S. population and can make next-day delivery by ground to 69 percent of that population.

ConnectWise Buys Service Desk Agentic AI Startup

Staying on the topic of strategic acquisitions, ConnectWise this week acquired Toronto-based Zofiq, an agentic AI company with technology that automates high-volume service desk operations, in a move to push toward more autonomous service delivery for MSPs.

The acquisition deal brings about 15 Zofiq employees into the Tampa, Fla.-based vendor and folds the startup’s technology directly into ConnectWise’s broader platform strategy: embedding AI agents inside PSA and RMM workflows.

“This has always been part of our strategy,” ConnectWise CEO Manny Rivelo (pictured) told CRN. “How do we move the company toward autonomous workflows? When you look at Zofiq, it just feels like a great marriage. The timing is right, the technology is ready and the industry needs it.”

Service desks are under pressure from every direction, according to Rivelo. Service ticket volumes keep climbing, talent is hard to find and harder to keep, and customers expect faster, more consistent outcomes, he said. With Zofiq, AI agents handle tasks like triage, routing, resolution steps and documentation—all within existing workflows.

Zofiq’s approach ingests ticket data and learns from it. “At the core of Zofiq is our learning engine. It trains on historical data, learns how an MSP works, and automates based on that. In the old world, you automated by building workflows. In the post-AI world, you automate by letting AI learn from your data and guiding it with natural language,” said Lee Silverstone, Zofiq co-founder and CEO.

Claroty Raises $150M In New Funding Amid Industry Segment Consolidation

Claroty, a developer of security for cyber-physical systems, makes this week’s list for raising an impressive $150 million in a Series F funding round.

Funding from the new round, which was led by Golub Growth with participation from earlier investors, will be targeted for expansion globally, including potentially through mergers and acquisitions.

With the new capital infusion, Claroty has raised at least $885 million in total funding since its launch in 2015.

Claroty did not disclose a new valuation for the company following the new funding round, but the company said it had experienced 80 percent growth in valuation since the previous funding round in March 2024. A published report said Claroty was eyeing a possible IPO in 2027.

The announcement of Claroty’s new funding comes amid consolidation in the market for vendors specializing in OT and IoT security. Nozomi Networks disclosed in September that it had reached an agreement to be acquired by Mitsubishi Electric for roughly $1 billion.

ServiceNow Beefs Up Channel Program With AI Emphasis

ServiceNow this week unveiled a number of enhancements to its channel program, including the launch of a new partner business value composer designed to make it easier for solution providers to help speed customers’ adoption of the latest AI technologies.

The company is also offering partners new certifications in different product areas, as well as bringing them the fruit of acquisitions such as ServiceNow’s pending acquisition of agentic AI developer Moveworks.

The changes to the channel program were officially unveiled at ServiceNow’s annual sales kickoff, held this week in Las Vegas.

One initiative ServiceNow is discussing at the sales kickoff is streamlining the incentives the company provides across the deal life cycle, Michael Park (pictured), senior vice president of global partnerships and channels, told CRN.

“We are expanding our strategic investment fund,” Park said. “We’re setting a new market development fund in front of that for demand gen. ... And then we have reseller fees and incentives for deployment. When I came into the job, there were 14 different incentive models. We now have four.”

Another plan introduced at the sales kickoff was simplifying partner membership fees, Park said. “We’re going to roll out a single program membership fee across all the partner types,” he said. “We’ve got too many versions right now. It’s so complicated. Let’s just do one.”",https://www.crn.com/news/channel-news/2026/media_1767c0ecc897fa2a845b017258f7e1dd7f019085e.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2026-01-23 13:59:20.080041

In a series of announcements this week, the artificial intelligence giant behind ChatGPT signaled meaningful shifts in how it plans to scale its technology, and added some safety rails in response to allegations it has been subjected to time and again.

This comes as OpenAI defends its governance history, navigates criticism from co-founder Elon Musk and surrounding legal drama, and strategizes ways to increase recurring revenue.

At the center of it is that it will begin testing advertisements within ChatGPT for users on its free tier and the newly introduced $8-per-month Chat “Go” plan. This marks a new revenue source for the company as it prepares to launch hardware AI products and continues to invest heavily in data centers.

Until now, it primarily relied on investments, partnerships, and subscription revenue to cover its ever-growing computing costs.

ChatGPT ads come with guardrails

OpenAI’s belief has been that its revenue model must grow to support the value intelligence it delivers to its users and organizations. CFO Sarah Friar, in a recent blog post, explained that the company’s monetization strategy has always been direct and simple.

In this informational post, Friar also expanded on what could come next for the company- licensing to IP-based agreements. Further adding, “that is how the internet evolved. Intelligence will follow the same path.”

On X,Sam Altman emphasized that this introduction will not result in any discrepancy in the information provided to its users.

Further clarifying that the need for this step is to ensure ChatGPT remains available to consumers who “don’t want to pay” but want to use it.

The message was echoed by Fidji Somo in her blog post, reinforcing that ads remain a means of aligning revenue with usage, rather than steering behavior. Somo also elaborated that these ads will be used to improve the user experience and will be expanded to allow users to ask questions about the sponsored product.

The move does not come as a surprise, given the rising demand for generative AI tools, and add to that the related costs, which remain high.

Overall, the Supreme Court upheld the appeal, reiterating the CAT’s gatekeeping function as a specialist tribunal, in a ruling that is welcome news for corporate defendants.

To curtail the use of opt-out proceedings as a means of leveraging settlement in weak and frivolous claims, claimant firms will need to put forward an arguable case and demonstrate that opt-in proceedings are not a practicable alternative for the class they purport to represent.

On 18 December 2025, the UK Supreme Court handed down its judgment in the case of Evans v Barclays Bank plc & Ors [2025] UKSC 48, with significant implications for the future of collective proceedings in the United Kingdom. Overturning the Court of Appeal’s decision, the Supreme Court emphasised the importance of the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) exercising its discretion as a specialist body and clarified the relevant factors to consider when deciding whether opt-in or opt-out proceedings are more appropriate.

Background

In 2019, Mr Evans sought permission to bring opt-out collective proceedings against several major banks, including Barclays, seeking damages as part of a ‘follow-on’ claim for anticompetitive infringements relating to foreign exchange trading. The main issue in contention was the mechanism by which the collective action would proceed — specifically, whether the claims should be certified on an opt-in or opt-out basis.

CAT Decision — 31 March 2023

The CAT considered Mr Evans’ application for opt-out certification, referring to section 79(3) of the CAT Rules 2015, which identifies the merits of the case and the practicability of opt-in proceedings as relevant factors. It concluded that Mr Evans failed to articulate a plausible case on causation, potentially justifying strike-out, and determined that opt-in proceedings were practicable for the sophisticated institutional class members, whose losses accounted for a majority of the claim’s value. On this basis, the CAT refused opt-out certification.

Court of Appeal Decision — 9 May 2024

The Court of Appeal overturned the CAT’s judgment, rejecting the emphasis placed by the CAT on its assessment of the merits of the case. The Court of Appeal gave more weight to the fact that opt-in proceedings were unlikely to occur, stating that access to justice considerations were relevant to the assessment of practicability including all members of the class irrespective of their size and sophistication, not solely for consumers and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The cost of opt-in proceedings and the practical burdens associated with opting in would likely exceed the sums at stake for most of the class members, thereby limiting the practicability of opt-in proceedings and favouring opt-out certification. Accordingly, it set aside the CAT’s decision and remitted the case, prompting an appeal from the banks to the Supreme Court.

Supreme Court Decision — 18 December 2025

The Supreme Court examined the decision to intervene with the CAT’s reasoning and disagreed with the Court of Appeal, overall reaffirming the CAT’s ability to exercise discretion as a specialist tribunal.

1. Merits of the Claims

Firstly, the Supreme Court agreed that the strength of Mr Evans’ claim was an important factor, as section 79(3)(a) of the CAT Rules expressly identifies. It also observed that opt-out proceedings legally and commercially favour claimants, as the procedure enables the representation of a larger class. This often results in higher value claims and increased costs for corporate defendants, which may be leveraged to advance weak and frivolous claims. To preserve the balance between access to justice for claimants and protection for corporates against oppressive litigation, the courts should not allow weaker claims to proceed on an opt-out basis. The Supreme Court therefore held that the Court of Appeal had no basis for interfering with the CAT’s decision.

2. Practicability of Opt-In Proceedings

On the issue of practicability, the CAT was correct to divide the class into subclasses. The potential claimants ranged from sophisticated commercial entities and financial institutions to individuals and smaller entities. The CAT gave foremost attention to the sophisticated entities who accounted for most of the value of the claim. Those institutions were capable of pursuing litigation on an opt-in basis but had made a conscious and deliberate decision not to do so. Opt-out certification should not be used as an alternative route in cases where opt-in proceedings fail to generate sufficient interest. The CAT exercised its discretion to divide the class and came to a reasoned decision, and there was no basis for the Court of Appeal to interfere.

3. Neutral Starting Point

The Court of Appeal adopted a starting position in favour of opt-out proceedings, taking the view that it must uphold principles of vindicating rights and deterring future wrongdoers as powerful factors favouring certification. However, the Supreme Court disagreed, confirming that judicial decision-makers must adopt a position of neutrality with no presumption in favour of either procedure when determining certification. The Supreme Court held the CAT was correct to adopt an even-handed approach, weighing factors on both sides to strike a balance between competing interests, and to exercise its judgment as a specialist tribunal without interference from the appellate courts in the absence of an error of law.

A More Exacting Certification Process

Overall, the Supreme Court upheld the appeal and reiterated the CAT’s gatekeeping function as a specialist tribunal, in a ruling that is welcome news for corporate defendants. As identified in the October 2025 report we published in conjunction with Kendal Global Advisory, businesses have reported increased liability risk and exposure to damages resulting from the strategic utilisation of the collective redress regime by claimant firms, as well as concerns that claimant interests are not at the forefront of such actions. This decision — one amongst a number of recent appellate court judgments shaping the collective and class actions landscape — raises the threshold for opt-out certification and reflects the court’s increasing attentiveness to the practical and procedural realities of such large-scale litigation.

Johnson & Johnson’s dividend is among the reasons analysts and institutions like this stock.","Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), amid the noise of Trump’s Greenland agenda and renewed trade war fears, is quietly executing its healthcare strategy, growing revenue and widening margins, setting its stock up to continue trending higher. A recent earnings release and 2026 guidance update, though strong, triggered a price pullback and a trend-following opportunity.

What is a trend-following signal? Assuming the trend is up, as it is with JNJ stock, a trend-following signal occurs when the price action retreats to an accepted trend-following indicator, such as a moving average or trend line, and then confirms support at that level. What this does is affirm the presence of buyers and high potential for rebound while derisking the entry point. The likely outcome of such a signal is that the stock price will continue its steady advance and set fresh highs in the near future.

Johnson & Johnson’s Healthy Business and Pipeline Underpin Stock Price Action

Johnson & Johnson’s Q4 results reveal the strength of its portfolio and pipeline, with revenue up 9.1% YOY and nearly 200 basis points better than expected. The strength was driven by the combination of core strength in Innovative Medicine and Med Tech, compounded by acquisitions. The company grew organically by 7.1% and adjusted by 6.1%, and expects to sustain a mid-single-digit pace in 2026.

Margins, which were roughly in line with consensus expectations, were an area of strength in the report. The company’s adjusted earnings, like margins, were as expected, showing significant improvement compared to the prior year.

Up more than 20%, adjusted earnings strengthened the already strong balance sheet and capital return outlook.

Management's guidance was good—and likely to be cautious. The company targets 6.7% revenue growth and margin improvement, with both targets above consensus.

Momentum in core segments (specifically with blockbusters like Darzalex) and pipeline advancement, could cause the firm to beat on its own guidance next report.

Lastly, the company reported positive results from several trials and submitted its OTTAVA robotic surgical system for De Novo classification. If approved, it will open a new revenue stream with potential to grow at a high-double-digit rate for several years.

Johnson & Johnson’s bullish analyst trends are unlikely to end, given the Q4 strengths and outlook. As it stands, the 29 tracked by MarketBeat rate this stock as a Moderate Buy and price targets are rising.

The consensus price target implies the stock is fairly valued, trading near the pre-release close, but the trend points to the high end of the range, sufficient for a 10% upside and a fresh all-time high.

Institutions also accumulated in 2025 and early 2026, limiting the downside risk should the stock price pull back.

Johnson & Johnson’s dividend is among the reasons analysts and institutions like this stock. The payment yields nearly 2.5%, even with shares near record highs, and is expected to grow over time.

The company is a Dividend King with over 60 years of annual increases to its credit. A low payout ratio of 50% signals that modest, single-digit increases can be sustained for the foreseeable future.

Risks for JNJ shareholders in 2026 include ongoing talc litigation, competition from Stellara biosimilars, and execution risk tied to the expected OTTAVA launch. Talc litigation is being allowed to advance, with the plaintiff’s expert testimony to be allowed. This is a hurdle for the company, but it will be allowed to refute the testimony. Meanwhile, Stelara lost its patent protection in 2025 and will face increasing competition as the year progresses. Sales of Stelara, which accounted for approximately 11.5% of 2024 revenue, fell more than 40% in 2025.

FactSet Barclays Partnership Tests Growth Narrative After Share Price Slide

January 23, 2026

FactSet Research Systems (NYSE:FDS) has entered a multiyear partnership with Barclays to support the bank's long term market data strategy.

The collaboration will see FactSet provide data and analytics capabilities to Barclays across its global operations.

The agreement signals deeper integration of FactSet's platforms into a major financial institution's core workflows.

For investors watching FactSet at a share price of $288.79, this new Barclays agreement comes after a mixed performance record. NYSE:FDS shows a 1.4% gain year to date, but the stock has seen a 37.1% decline over the past year and is lower over the 3 year and 5 year periods. That backdrop makes large client wins particularly important to how you might think about the business today.

The Barclays partnership could influence how you assess FactSet's competitive position in high value enterprise data contracts, an area where scale and client stickiness tend to matter. While the revenue and margin impact are not detailed here, investors may want to watch for future disclosures around adoption, product scope, and any expansion of the relationship into additional business lines.

This agreement looks like a meaningful validation of FactSet's role in enterprise data, since Barclays is tying a long term market data plan to FactSet's analytics and technology. For you as an investor, the key angle is that Barclays is not just buying a single product; it is standardising on a suite of tools, which can deepen usage over time if FactSet is embedded across desks and regions.

FactSet Research Systems narrative, does this Barclays deal move the needle?

Recent concerns around slowing revenue growth and a 31.8% share price decline over six months have fed a narrative that FactSet is a mature business without much excitement. A large global bank choosing FactSet to power its market data strategy may challenge that view slightly, because it speaks to relevance with tier one clients even as growth has moderated.

Risks and rewards to weigh from this partnership

🎁 A multiyear, broad product rollout at Barclays can support perceptions of dependable earnings and help justify fair value assessments that already factor in a reliable 1.52% dividend.

🎁 The agreement may reinforce existing views that FactSet is still winning business, with earnings having grown 9.4% per year over five years and forecasts pointing to 6.13% annual growth.

⚠️ Execution risk remains, since FactSet still has a high level of debt and must deliver smoothly on complex implementation and service requirements for a global bank.

⚠️ Investors may want to see whether this is a one off win or part of a broader pattern of similar deals before revising expectations around long term growth.

What to watch next

From here, it is worth tracking any quantified disclosures on contract value, product adoption across Barclays' business lines, and whether other large institutions reference similar partnerships with FactSet.

Will Agilent’s (A) New AI-Enabled Slide Scanner Redefine Its Role in Digital Pathology Workflows?

January 23, 2026

Agilent Technologies has launched the Agilent S540MD Slide Scanner System in key European markets, adding a high-capacity, AI-assisted whole slide imaging solution to its digital pathology portfolio.

By branding and offering the Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S540MD within its ecosystem, Agilent broadens its role across the pathology workflow, from staining through to AI-supported decision tools.

Next, we will explore how this push into high-throughput, AI-enabled digital pathology shapes Agilent’s broader investment narrative.

What Is Agilent Technologies' Investment Narrative?

To own Agilent, you need to be on board with a measured, innovation-led story rather than a hyper-growth one. The company is generating solid revenue of US$6,948.0 million and earnings of US$1,303.0 million, but its share price has lagged both the broader US market and the Life Sciences industry over the past year. The launch of the S540MD slide scanner fits neatly into Agilent’s push deeper into digital pathology and AI tools, but on its own it is unlikely to shift the near term earnings outlook or the consensus price target, which already sits about a fifth above the current share price. The more immediate catalysts remain execution on moderate earnings growth, management’s relatively new tenure, and how comfortably investors accept a valuation above some fair value estimates.

However, there is one key execution risk around new management and capital allocation that investors should not ignore. Agilent Technologies' share price has been on the slide but might be up to 22% below fair value. .

Exploring Other Perspectives

Five fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$113 to US$169 per share, underlining how far apart private investors can be. Against that backdrop, Agilent’s push into AI enabled pathology and a relatively new management team give you plenty of reasons to compare several viewpoints before deciding how much of its future you want to price in.

- why the stock might be worth as much as 22% more than the current price!

On January 13, Christine Cho, CFA, from Barclays, reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $146 price target. However, earlier on January 9, Goldman Sachs had maintained a Neutral rating on Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) with a $106 price target.

​The ratings follow the company’s agreement with Meta to develop a 1.2 GW Nuclear Energy at Pike County, Ohio. Management of Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) noted that, under the agreement, Meta will prepay for the power and provide capital to ensure the project is completed successfully. Management noted that they plan to use the capital to advance phase 1 of the project on the land that has already been acquired, along with securing fuel for the plant. The pre-construction work is expected to start this year, with the first phase of the plant coming online in 2030.

​According to Goldman Sachs, each GW of powerhouse deployment will add roughly $15 to $20 per share to the company’s stock, based on the DCF analysis. The firm also noted that Meta is pursuing other nuclear deals, which it views as positive for companies in the nuclear segment.

​Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) develops advanced nuclear power plants that recycle nuclear waste to provide clean, reliable energy, supporting sustainable solutions for the increasing power demands of AI.

Andrea Abell, CISO at pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, is utilizing the technology available for all sorts of tasks. During a conversation with IT Brew at CES earlier this month, Abell said she uses AI “across the board.” Defenders should assume threat actors are doing the same.

“If we are looking to defend [against] generative AI, we have to think about all of the places that an attacker can take advantage of it,” Abell said.

Seeking out. Likening threat detection to finding a needle in a haystack, Abell said that she believes AI can make the haystack smaller and speed up the hunt, especially when combined with human knowledge. Agentic AI also has a role to play, especially in threat modeling.

“We’re doing what everyone else is doing, which is making agents to help reduce the human workload,” Abell said. “All of this new technology requires new defenses, new tooling, all of those types of things.”

In the healthcare sector, workers are often the last line of defense against hackers—and attacks can come when the focus is on saving lives, not protecting systems. John Riggi, national advisor for cybersecurity and risk at trade and lobbying group the American Hospital Association (AHA), told IT Brew in November that cybersecurity is an important part of any healthcare organization’s setup.

“Cyber hygiene is as important as medical hygiene to help protect patients from harm,” Riggi said.

Part of making that happen, said Alex Tyrrell, SVP and CTO of the health division at Wolters Kluwer, is ensuring there’s device security alongside the implementation of AI solutions.

“Training is going to be a key aspect and maintaining these guardrails, make sure the controls are in place,” Tyrell told IT Brew in December.

Get it right. Yes, there will be challenges. But Abell remains optimistic and hopeful about the future of AI-assisted cybersecurity in the healthcare space. Implementing change in the supply chain for vendor security, as well as modeling threats, requires a serious effort on the part of IT pros at Eli Lilly.

Abell added that she hopes initiatives like secure by default, which are being implemented by companies like Amazon and Microsoft, will help to offer a framework for small, rural healthcare centers and hospitals.

WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) – U.S. business activity was steady in January as an improvement in new orders was offset by a lackluster labor market and lingering concerns among firms over higher costs because of import tariffs, a survey showed on ‍Friday.

S&P Global said its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, inched down to 52.8 this month from 52.7 in December. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the private sector. Both services and manufacturing flash PMIs were little changed this month.

S&P Global said the composite PMI was consistent with a moderation in economic growth at the turn of the year.

The government reported on ‌Thursday that the economy grew at a 4.4% annualized pace in the ‌third quarter, driven by strong consumer and business spending on intellectual property products, likely related to artificial intelligence, as well as a smaller trade deficit.

The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 5.4% rate in the October-December quarter. The fourth-quarter GDP report, delayed by the 43-day government ​shutdown, will be published on February 20.

The survey continued to paint a picture of labor market stagnation, which S&P Global said reflected concerns over rising costs and softer sales growth in ‍recent months. Its measure of private sector employment edged up ​to 50.5 from 50.3 last month.

Some businesses reported difficulties finding staff, which ​could be linked to an immigration crackdown that economists say has reduced labor supply.

TARIFFS ARE WIDELY BLAMED ‍FOR INCREASED COSTS

The survey’s gauge of prices asked by firms for goods and services ticked down to 57.2, still among the highest recorded over the last three years, from 57.3 in December.

A measure of prices paid for inputs fell to a still-high 59.7 from 61.9 last month.

The elevated price measures suggest that inflation could remain high for some time. Businesses have absorbed ‍some of the duties from President Donald Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs, helping to avert a much feared big inflation surge. The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged next week while policymakers watch ‍inflation and the labor market.

“Increased ‍costs, widely blamed on tariffs, are again cited as a key driver ​of higher prices for both goods and services in January, meaning ​inflation and ⁠affordability remains a widespread concern among businesses,” said Chris Williamson, chief business ‌economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The survey’s measure of new orders received by businesses rose to 52.2 from 50.8 in December. But exports fell to a nine-month low, pulled down by declines in both goods and services.

Business confidence weakened, dropping slightly below the average seen last year. S&P Global said “the demand-dampening impact of higher prices, geopolitical worries and federal government policies remained a concern among many firms.”

“The Sphere-360 catheter offers an excellent balance between ease of use and consistency in outcomes.

The Affera catheter earned CE mark clearance in Europe and the first cases in the Horizon 360 IDE pivotal trial were completed.

The Sphere-360 catheter was designed in response to physician feedback showing the need for a simple, differentiated workflow and predictable outcomes using a single catheter that accommodates anatomical variations in pulmonary veins. The catheter boasts an adjustable configuration lattice design that conforms to the shape of the veins and allows energy delivery without needing to rotate the catheter in each position.

“The Sphere-360 catheter offers an excellent balance between ease of use and consistency in outcomes. Its design conforms to the pulmonary vein in a unique way that delivers consistent, effective and durable lesions for AFib patients, without any rotation of the catheter,” said Tobias Reichlin, MD., Director of Electrophysiology at Inselspital University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland. “With the full integration into the Affera mapping system, it’s an exciting step forward for patient care in Europe.”

It delivers circumferential, consistent lesions from the entire 34 mm lattice without catheter rotation. The all-in-one catheter for navigation, mapping, and ablation needs a single transseptal puncture and no catheter exchange.

Polestar Capital e-Mobility & Infrastructure Fund (PCEIF) was launched in February 2025 with a target of €500 million and a €1 billion hard-cap.
“That may have been one of the triggers because Polestar Capital was earning quite good money from that mandate,” one source said.
The firm previously had three other funds in capital raising, which have now either been suspended or sold: PCEIF; Dutch Heat Fund (Warmtefonds); and Polestar Capital Circular Debt Fund (PCDF).
Fund strategy PCEIF is an infrastructure credit fund that invests in the energy transition by providing senior-secured loans to businesses supplying low-carbon transport solutions.","Utrecht-based Polestar Capital has halted fundraising for its flagship sustainable infrastructure debt strategy, Infrastructure Investor has learned.

Polestar Capital e-Mobility & Infrastructure Fund (PCEIF) was launched in February 2025 with a target of €500 million and a €1 billion hard-cap. The fund was expected to hold a €500 million first close on its target by the end of 2025, with a final close anticipated on its hard-cap in Q3 2026.

Sources with knowledge of the matter said that the manager suspended fundraising after encountering financial difficulties. As a result, Polestar has embarked on an organisational restructuring and implemented a new business strategy.

“They [Polestar] decided to do a reorganisation, which meant that half of the staff left,” one source stated, noting the departures included the biodiversity team and the PCEIF investment unit.

Meanwhile, another source echoed this view: “PCEIF is on hold for the moment; it’s not fundraising because things are not going well.”

When approached for comment, a spokesperson at Polestar disputed that the firm had experienced financial challenges. The firm acknowledged that it had paused fundraising for PCEIF, but stated the decision was in response to feedback from investors to widen and diversify the scope of the strategy.

Infrastructure Investor understands that one of the potential causes for the alleged financial challenges could be the loss of one of its earnings streams and key mandate – the Dutch Heat Fund (Warmtefonds) – in 2024.

It is understood that the manager sold its brokerage operations in December 2024, including the activities related to the Dutch Heat Fund (Warmtefonds).

“That may have been one of the triggers because Polestar Capital was earning quite good money from that mandate,” one source said. “That mandate was given back to the [Dutch] government.”

Crucially, sources suggested investors grew concerned after learning of the firm’s alleged financial constraints in June and July 2025, leading some to withdraw their interest. At that time, PCEIF had been in advanced discussions with several large Dutch institutional investors and some international investors who were conducting due diligence.

Sources added that the manager was anticipating that three or four investors would contribute more than €100 million each to the strategy. These investors – including pension schemes and insurance companies from the Netherlands and abroad – were expected to provide the €500 million required for the vehicle’s first close by the end of Q4 2025.

Polestar denied that investors had withdrawn their interest due to concerns over the manager’s financial position.

Infrastructure Investor understands that despite the suspension, efforts are being explored to continue the strategy, either under a new GP or within the sustainability arm of an existing manager. Sources also pointed to ongoing discussions with potential GPs in Germany, the UK and the Netherlands about taking over the fund or strategy.

Another source suggested Polestar is likely to reassess whether to resume fundraising for PCEIF once the reorganisation is complete.

The Polestar spokesman signalled the firm may return to market later this year with a broader impact strategy, which could still feature e-mobility as one of its themes.

Infrastructure Investor understands the manager is still in the market with its remaining strategy, Limburg Energy Fund.

The firm previously had three other funds in capital raising, which have now either been suspended or sold: PCEIF; Dutch Heat Fund (Warmtefonds); and Polestar Capital Circular Debt Fund (PCDF).

In December 2025, Colesco Capital, a sustainability-led private credit specialist, acquired the management of PCDF from Polestar and renamed it the Colesco Circular & Climate Credit Impact Fund.

Fund strategy

PCEIF is an infrastructure credit fund that invests in the energy transition by providing senior-secured loans to businesses supplying low-carbon transport solutions.

The vehicle aims to finance a portfolio of 15-30 initiatives, with approximately 80 percent based in the Netherlands and the remainder in Northwestern Europe.

PCEIF deploys capital to e-mobility and charging infrastructure projects, including e-fleets, public charging point operators, and privately-owned depot charging facilities.

The fund targets an 8 percent net IRR, with ticket sizes ranging between €5 million and €75 million, and has a 10-year term with an option to extend for two years.",https://media.infrastructureinvestor.com/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1313535992.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 10:41:29.295202

Aortic stenosis occurs when the aortic valve, which controls blood flow from the heart to the body, becomes narrowed.
TAVR stands for transcatheter aortic valve replacement, a minimally invasive procedure to replace a diseased aortic valve.","Medtronic will invest up to US$90m in Anteris Technologies to help fund the next stage of growth and the DurAVR transcatheter heart valve programme.

The Australia-founded company said the funding will support execution of its clinical strategy for DurAVR, designed to mimic a healthy human aortic valve and replicate normal aortic blood flow.

Transcatheter heart valves are replacement valves delivered to the heart through a catheter, a thin flexible tube inserted through a blood vessel rather than open heart surgery.

The private placement requires Medtronic to acquire a 16.0 to 19.99 per cent stake in Anteris.

Anteris is also proposing a US$200m underwritten public offering, with underwriters given a 30-day option to spend US$30m to buy additional shares at the offering price, minus underwriting discounts and commissions.

Recruitment is ongoing for the DurAVR transcatheter heart valve global pivotal trial for patients with severe aortic stenosis, known as the Paradigm trial. Aortic stenosis occurs when the aortic valve, which controls blood flow from the heart to the body, becomes narrowed.

The company said it is expanding its manufacturing capabilities.

Jorie Soskin is vice president and general manager of the structural heart business in Medtronic’s cardiovascular portfolio.

Soskin said: “Medtronic is a pioneer in TAVR innovation and evidence.

“Our investment in differentiated innovation like DurAVR THV technology, which has the potential to offer improved valve performance in a balloon-expandable platform, is core to our commitment to define and drive the future of TAVR, meeting the needs of more aortic stenosis patients and heart teams with a comprehensive portfolio.”

Officials said part of the proceeds may also fund research and development for v2vmedtech, Anteris’ partner company, which is developing a next-generation transcatheter edge-to-edge repair system for mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation. This refers to leaky valves that allow blood to flow backwards.

Any remaining funds could be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

The fundraising came nearly three months after Anteris announced positive one-year clinical outcomes for DurAVR. The balloon-expandable, biomimetic DurAVR THV is made from a single piece of moulded Adapt tissue, described as the company’s patented anti-calcification bovine tissue technology.

Wayne Paterson, chief executive of Anteris Technologies, said the deal followed 2.5 years of negotiations.

Paterson said Medtronic wanted to acquire the company outright because Anteris’ technology could make it more competitive against TAVR rival Edwards Lifesciences, but it ultimately agreed to an investment that could enable a co-commercialisation partnership and manufacturing collaborations around Minneapolis.

TAVR stands for transcatheter aortic valve replacement, a minimally invasive procedure to replace a diseased aortic valve.

According to a regulatory filing linked to the offering, Medtronic will also have the right to a non-voting board observer and certain negotiation rights in connection with future third-party acquisition proposals.

The investment in Anteris comes after Medtronic’s TAVR competitor Edwards Lifesciences failed to acquire JenaValve due to antitrust concerns from the Federal Trade Commission.",https://www.htworld.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cropped-HTW-3-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-23 09:42:25.448504

Overview

Sandisk Corporation's stock experienced a dramatic 1,117% surge over six months, doubling in the first two weeks of 2026. This rally, attributed to the AI trade's focus on storage and a flash memory shortage enabling price hikes, has generated over $3 billion in mark-to-market losses for short sellers. With short interest rising to 7.5% of the float, S3 Partners flags an 'extreme' risk of a short squeeze.

1. THE SEAMLESS LINK

The escalating short squeeze risk for Sandisk Corporation is a direct consequence of its remarkable stock performance, which has seen shares appreciate over 1,100% in the past six months. This meteoric rise, which accelerated with a doubling in value during the first two weeks of 2026, has placed immense pressure on bearish investors. The company's trajectory is closely watched, especially given the fundamental shifts occurring in the technology sector.

2. THE STRUCTURE

The AI-Fueled Storage Surge

Sandisk Corporation's stock has demonstrated an extraordinary upward trend, climbing 1,117% in the last six months and showing no signs of abatement, even doubling in the initial two weeks of 2026 [6, 9]. This performance has inflicted substantial mark-to-market losses exceeding $3 billion upon short sellers [News1]. According to S3 Partners, short interest has climbed to 7.5% of Sandisk's total float, a significant increase from a prior 4%, elevating the firm's risk score to an 'extreme' level indicative of a potential short squeeze [News1]. A short squeeze materializes when a rapid stock price increase compels short sellers to repurchase shares to cover their positions, often at a loss, which can further amplify the price climb [News1]. As of January 21, 2026, Sandisk's market capitalization stood at approximately $73.47 billion, with its stock trading around $501.29 [7, 9]. The company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio remains negative on a trailing twelve-month basis, a common characteristic for companies undergoing rapid growth or strategic investment phases, though a forward P/E estimate for 2026 stands at approximately 35.6 [1, 15].

Catalysts Driving Storage Demand

The remarkable rally in Sandisk shares is underpinned by a confluence of factors. The burgeoning artificial intelligence sector has increasingly directed its focus toward storage solutions, recognizing the massive data requirements for AI infrastructure [6, 18, 23]. This heightened demand, coupled with a critical shortage in flash memory supply, has provided Sandisk with the leverage to increase prices [6, 11, 35]. Supporting this narrative, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's pronouncements at the CES Technology conference, where he described the storage space as a ""completely unserved market,"" added considerable positive sentiment towards storage-focused companies [19, 27]. The global memory chip shortage, exacerbated by manufacturers shifting capacity to high-margin AI products like HBM and DDR5, is projected to persist through late 2026 and into 2027, further tightening supply and supporting higher prices for NAND flash [18, 39].

Sandisk's Market Position and Corporate History

Headquartered in California, Sandisk is recognized for its high-performance storage drives, memory cards, and USB flash drives [News1]. Sandisk Corporation (SNDK) completed its separation from Western Digital and began independent trading on the Nasdaq on February 24, 2025 [20, 36]. Since its re-listing, its stock has experienced substantial growth, with reports indicating gains of over 700% by early 2026, and a significant increase from April 2025 to January 2026 [6, 47]. Western Digital, now a pure-play HDD provider post-spin-off, has also seen its stock surge significantly, benefiting from AI-driven demand for high-capacity storage solutions and improved margins [21, 28]. Several investment banks have raised price targets for Sandisk, with Bernstein Société Générale doubling its target to $580, citing unprecedented NAND shortages and price increases [15]. Sandisk is scheduled to announce its fiscal second-quarter financial results on January 29, 2026 [11].

Successful completion of first cases at multiple sites kicks off Horizon 360 IDE pivotal trial in the United States

Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), a global leader in healthcare technology, today announced two major milestones for the Affera™ Sphere-360™ catheter, a first-of-its-kind, all-in-one mapping and single-shot pulsed field ablation (PFA) catheter for treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AFib): CE Mark in Europe and the completion of first cases in the Horizon 360 IDE pivotal trial in the United States.

The Sphere-360 catheter was designed in response to physician feedback expressing the need for a simple, differentiated workflow and predictable outcomes using a single catheter that accommodates anatomical variations in pulmonary veins. Seamlessly integrated with the Affera mapping and ablation system, the catheter offers an adjustable configuration lattice design that conforms to the shape of the veins and allows energy delivery without the need to rotate the catheter in each position.

The Affera mapping and ablation system and the Sphere-9™ all-in-one mapping and ablation catheter have been rapidly adopted by physicians in multiple geographies for their excellent safety and durability profile.

""The Sphere-360 catheter offers an excellent balance between ease of use and consistency in outcomes. Its design conforms to the pulmonary vein in a unique way that delivers consistent, effective and durable lesions for AFib patients, without any rotation of the catheter,"" said Tobias Reichlin, M.D., Director of Electrophysiology at Inselspital University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland. ""With the full integration into the Affera mapping system, it's an exciting step forward for patient care in Europe.""

Additional benefits of Sphere-360 include:

Delivers circumferential, consistent lesions from the entire 34 mm lattice without catheter rotation, enhancing workflow efficiency

Adapts to the vein by adjusting the shape of the conformable lattice to the patient's anatomy

All-in-one catheter for navigation, mapping, and ablation with a single transseptal puncture and zero catheter exchange

Real-time local impedance information to assess catheter proximity to tissue

Easy access to pulmonary veins with enhanced stability through its over-the-wire design

Compatible with FlexCath Contour™ 10 French deflectable sheath designed for easy catheter positioning

""Advances in electrophysiology over the past several years are having a significant impact on care for arrhythmia patients, and Affera has been a key part of that impact,"" said Vivek Reddy, M.D., Director of Cardiac Arrhythmia Services for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. ""Now with Sphere-360, we have a new and differentiated single-shot PFA catheter with the potential to deliver the next phase of innovation. It's an exciting time for physicians and patients and we're not slowing down.""

Results from the Sphere-360 European study at one year were presented at the Heart Rhythm Society Annual Meeting and published in the Heart Rhythm Journal in April 2025. The prospective, single-arm, multi-center trial in European centers demonstrated excellent efficacy, safety, and durability that led to CE Mark.

""The achievement of CE Mark for Sphere-360, as well as the first cases in the U.S. IDE trial, mark two major achievements in our effort to deliver new and better treatments to AFib patients,"" said Rebecca Seidel, president of the Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio. ""We're committed to leading in PFA and bringing meaningful innovation at a regular cadence.""

The Horizon 360 IDE study is a prospective, single-arm clinical study at centers across the U.S. The study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Sphere-360 catheter with the Affera mapping and ablation system for treating paroxysmal AFib.

Operational information for accessing the measures is available at UniCredit branches throughout the region.","UniCredit has launched extraordinary measures to meet the immediate needs of families and businesses affected by the severe weather in Calabria. This initiative provides financial support to customers residing or headquartered in Calabria.

The severe weather that has hit large areas of Calabria in recent weeks, the institute in Piazza Gae Aulenti explains in a statement, is causing damage to infrastructure, homes, and businesses, placing particular pressure on small towns, agricultural supply chains, local businesses, and widespread tourism. Several areas are experiencing operational difficulties, production slowdowns, and strains on businesses' liquidity, in a context already marked by structural fragility and increasing exposure to extreme weather events.

In this context, UniCredit has made available an ""Emergency Moratorium,"" which allows for the suspension of mortgage payments for up to twelve months for private customers and for mortgage and unsecured loans for businesses, for loans that are in regular repayment and have not incurred any irregularities in the two months prior to the request. Applications must be submitted by March 31, 2026, accompanied by a self-certification certifying the damage suffered. The suspension takes effect from the first available payment following the submission of the request and does not result in negative reports in credit databases.

In addition to the moratorium, a ""New Business Credit"" package is available, which provides financing on favorable terms to support business continuity, the recovery of operations, and initial liquidity needs, subject to a credit assessment. Applications must be received by March 31, 2026. The suspended installments, including interest accrued on the suspended principal only, can be repaid at the end of the original repayment plan, over the remaining term of the mortgage, or in a lump sum in the event of early repayment. The suspension can also be requested for mortgages subject to securitization or the issuance of covered bank bonds and does not constitute contractual novation.

""When an extraordinary weather event hits a region, the priority is to prevent the damage from quickly turning into financial hardship for families and businesses,"" says Ferdinando Natali, Unicredit's Southern Regional Manager. ""Suspending installments and accessing new liquidity allow us to maintain continuity in payments, supplier relationships, and day-to-day operations, at a time when stability is crucial.""

Operational information for accessing the measures is available at UniCredit branches throughout the region.

Omics Lab Services Market

Dublin, Jan. 23, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Omics Lab Services Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2021-2031"" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Omics Lab Services Market is projected to expand from USD 72.88 Billion in 2025 to USD 128.48 Billion by 2031, registering a CAGR of 9.91%. The market is significantly propelled by the increasing integration of personalized and precision medicine, as healthcare providers turn to molecular profiling to customize patient treatments.

This transition from generalized prescribing to targeted therapeutic approaches requires extensive genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic testing, thereby boosting the volume of samples processed by specialized labs. Pharmaceutical developers are heavily investing in biomarker research to validate these targeted therapies, fueling the demand for outsourced, high-complexity testing to ensure regulatory approval and clinical success. According to the Personalized Medicine Coalition's May 2025 report, 'Personalized Medicine at FDA: The Scope & Significance of Progress in 2024,' the FDA approved 18 new personalized medicines in 2024, representing roughly 38% of all newly approved therapeutic molecular entities, which highlights the industry's reliance on advanced omics data.

Concurrently, the rising demand for liquid biopsy and non-invasive diagnostic tools is widening the market scope by facilitating frequent disease monitoring without the risks involved in tissue biopsies. This shift compels service providers to expand their sequencing infrastructure and bioinformatic capabilities to manage the growing influx of complex blood-based biomarker tests needed for cancer surveillance and early detection. Guardant Health reported in its 'Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results' in February 2025 that it processed approximately 206,700 oncology clinical tests during 2024, a 20% increase year-over-year. The financial magnitude of this trend is further demonstrated by Exact Sciences, which reported total revenue of $2.76 billion for the full year 2024 in 2025, largely attributed to the strong uptake of its diagnostic and cancer screening services.

Market Challenges

A major obstacle to the Global Omics Lab Services Market is the intricate regulatory framework governing data privacy and ethical compliance. Because laboratories handle vast amounts of sensitive genetic data, they must implement advanced data protection systems to satisfy strict international requirements. This necessity requires significant resource allocation, which increases operational costs and diverts funds away from research and development, often leading to project delays. Consequently, the financial and technical demands of compliance establish high barriers to entry, deterring smaller, innovative companies and favoring market consolidation among a few large providers.

Additionally, the severe financial implications of data breaches force laboratories to prioritize risk management over service expansion. The costs associated with security failures are prohibitive and pose significant liability concerns; the American Hospital Association's 2025 Environmental Scan report noted that the average cost of a healthcare data breach in 2024 was $9.77 million. Such high risks drive organizations to adopt restrictive data handling protocols, which can impede collaborative research efforts and slow the market's capacity to provide timely and accessible diagnostic solutions.

Market Trends

The integration of Artificial Intelligence for advanced data interpretation is emerging as a cornerstone trend in the omics sector, shifting the focus from delivering raw sequencing data to providing actionable insights. Service providers are increasingly incorporating machine learning algorithms into their bioinformatics workflows to decode complex multi-omics datasets, enabling pharmaceutical clients to discover new therapeutic targets more rapidly and accurately. This evolution toward AI-driven insight generation offers significant revenue potential for technologically advanced labs. For instance, Tempus AI reported in its 'Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results' in February 2025 that it achieved a total revenue of $693.4 million for the fiscal year 2024, marking a 30.4% year-over-year increase driven largely by its enhanced AI-enabled capabilities.

In parallel, the rise of Spatial Omics and tissue profiling technologies is transforming biological analysis by allowing researchers to map gene expression within the architectural context of tissue. Unlike traditional sequencing methods that dissociate cells, spatial profiling maintains the sample's positional integrity, offering vital insights into tumor microenvironments and cellular interactions crucial for immuno-oncology. This advancement has prompted laboratories to invest significantly in high-plex imaging and spatially resolved transcriptomics to satisfy growing biopharma demand. Highlighting this trend, 10x Genomics reported in its 'Preliminary Select Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Results' in January 2025 that it generated approximately $121.1 million in spatial consumables revenue for the full year 2024, demonstrating the rapid industry adoption of these context-aware solutions.

In short, ByteDance, Meta, and OpenAI are all betting on one thing: What if users don't click on apps?
Large companies are vying for our attention, the scenes in front of us, and the sounds in our ears.","Have you noticed that large companies are all deploying their own AI hardware products?

At the Davos Forum, Chris Lane, the global affairs officer of OpenAI, revealed the latest news that OpenAI is progressing as planned and preparing to launch its first AI hardware device in the second half of 2026.

This news has completely stirred up the already anxious tech circle.

This means that the world's top algorithm engines are entering the hardware race. In China, recently, companies like Huawei, ByteDance, and Alibaba are all flocking to the AI hardware market.

You know, in the past decade, Internet companies have been trying to get rid of bulky hardware and pursue a light - asset software model. Now, they are collectively ""reverting to their ancestors"" at all costs and rushing back to the tough hardware market that once gave them a hard time.

Take ByteDance as a typical example. As a software company, its Feishu recently collaborated with Anker Innovations to launch an AI office hardware called ""One Bean"". Before that, people only knew Feishu for its documents, spreadsheets, and video conferencing.

But if you broaden your perspective, you'll find that this is not just Feishu's move. ByteDance, Alibaba, Xiaomi, Baidu, and even Meta and OpenAI across the ocean are all scrambling into the hardware market.

Meta is the most aggressive. According to media reports, Zuckerberg has asked manufacturing partners to double the annual production capacity of AI smart glasses to 20 million pairs by the end of 2026.

Is this another technological upsurge? However, if you look back at the pitfalls these large companies have encountered on the hardware path, you'll find how abnormal this collective influx is.

In the past decade, large companies' attempts at hardware almost always ended in failure, especially in the Chinese market. Baidu made mobile phones, ByteDance acquired Smartisan, Alibaba launched Tmall Genie, and Tencent also tried various social hardware.

What was the result? Either they left with losses or disbanded the departments. It seems that software companies' DNA is not suited to handle hardware.

For large companies to venture into hardware is like jumping into a fire pit.

But in 2026, the hardware trend has not only returned but is even more intense than before.

What exactly is going on behind this? Why are large companies willing to jump into this arduous hardware business again?

1. Why can't software companies do well in hardware?

Before discussing why everyone wants to do hardware now, we need to see why they failed in the past.

You may have forgotten that Tencent once wanted to make mobile phones. Around 2015, Tencent launched the TOS (Tencent OS) system and even collaborated with manufacturers to produce mobile phones. What was the result? There was no splash in the market, and the project was soon halted. After ByteDance acquired Smartisan, it also couldn't escape the fate of failure.

The reason why it's difficult for large companies to do hardware is that they carry the arrogance of Internet companies in their genes.

The logic of Internet companies is to quickly test and iterate. If there is a mistake in an app, programmers can stay up all night to modify the code, and users can resume normal use after an update the next day. In this world, the marginal cost is almost zero. One more user just means a little more server space.

But hardware is a completely different story.

The logic of hardware is a one - shot deal. If there is a one - millimeter error when making a mold, hundreds of thousands of shells will become waste. If you order one less sensor in the supply chain, your entire production line will have to stop. Hardware companies pursue cost control of each part and inventory turnover.

Take the smart speaker war back then. To grab users, large companies sold speakers that cost 200 yuan for 69 yuan or even less. They thought that as long as you bought their speakers, you would use their music services and buy their products.

Users did buy, but they just used the speakers as alarm clocks or radios. The hardware itself didn't make money, and the software services couldn't drive sales either. In the end, these hardware departments became a heavy burden on the company's books.

In short, software companies didn't understand the respect for hardware before. They approached hardware with the same mindset as making apps and were finally taught a lesson by the supply chain and inventory.

2. AI has changed the rules of the game

Since it was so difficult in the past, why do people think it's okay now?

The answer lies in the large - scale AI models. The most important reason is actually just two words: interaction.

In the past, it was difficult to make hardware. You had to design screens, complex menus, and figure out how users would click and press. This required strong industrial design and interaction logic. Software companies' failure in hardware was largely because they designed the hardware too complexly and couldn't handle these physical - level complex interactions.

But after the emergence of large - scale AI models, the situation has changed.

Nowadays, AI hardware no longer needs a screen or even redundant buttons. Look at Feishu's ""One Bean"". Its core interaction is simply listening and speaking.

Take AI glasses as another example. You say a word to the glasses, and they can understand your meaning and execute directly. This interaction method has lowered the threshold of hardware.

Software companies have found that they don't need to study how to make a perfect touch screen. They only need to do a good job on the ""brain"" (AI model), and the hardware only needs to provide a microphone, camera, and chip.

Nowadays, hardware has essentially become a sensor for AI.

Take the Plaud Note product as an example. It sells well because it addresses the pain point that the iPhone can't record calls. But do users really buy it just for recording? No. Users buy it for the summarization, transcription, and translation after recording.

Without a model like ChatGPT behind it, this recording pen would just be ordinary electronic waste. It's AI that gives these simply - structured hardware devices the ability to think and summarize.

Software companies suddenly realized that they don't need to compete with Apple and Huawei in terms of precise industrial design. They only need to make a simple carrier and install their AI models into it.

For Feishu, the original intention of making ""One Bean"" is definitely not to make money from selling hardware, but to let Feishu's AI go beyond computers and mobile phones. If you're in an offline meeting or on the road while driving and can't open your computer to write a document, ""One Bean"" becomes your external brain.

In short, what software companies are best at has now become the core competitiveness of hardware.

3. ByteDance, Meta, and OpenAI are all betting on one thing

You may ask, since software is so powerful, why not just make apps as before? Why do they have to get involved in making hardware themselves?

Imagine the scenario in 2026. If you're wearing Meta's glasses or OpenAI's headphones and you have a need. For example, you want to schedule a meeting at 3 p.m.

Will you take out your phone, unlock it, find the Feishu icon, click on it, and then look for the calendar?

Most likely not. You'll just say to the glasses: Schedule a meeting for me.

At this time, the AI Agent in the glasses will directly handle the matter for you. In this process, the Feishu app completely disappears. It becomes a ""plug - in"" that provides data in the background.

This is fatal for large software companies.

If users no longer open the app, large companies will lose direct control over users. They can't see users' behavior habits, can't push ads to users, and can't sell other value - added services. They become workers for hardware manufacturers.

Feishu's making of ""One Bean"", Meta's making of glasses, and OpenAI's making of headphones are all essentially about defending their interaction entrances. They must have their own hardware carriers to ensure that when users have a need, they turn to their AI first, not others'.

Whoever controls the hardware closest to users' ears and eyes controls users' habits.

In short, ByteDance, Meta, and OpenAI are all betting on one thing: What if users don't click on apps?

This is a battle for the right to control the user entrance and the first interface.

4. Data scarcity, and even more panic without data

Besides seizing the entrance, there is a more hidden reason: AI has exhausted the data on the Internet.

You may not know that the current AI models are facing an embarrassing reality. The high - quality text data on the Internet is almost used up.

According to a report by the Epoch AI Research Institute, the high - quality English language data may run out between 2026 and 2032. In China, the data of each large company is self - contained and not open.

If AI wants to continue to evolve, it must find new data sources.

Where is this data? It's in our real life.

The data on the Internet is ""dead"" and processed by others. But the conversations in the real world, the scenes you see, and the tone in your meetings are real - time data.

AI hardware is essentially a 24 - hour detector.

When you wear AI glasses and enter a supermarket or use an AI recording pen in a meeting, AI is learning in real - time how humans handle real - world problems. It can see your logic in choosing products and hear your negotiation skills.

This first - person audio - visual data from the physical world is the scarcest resource for training the next - generation AI at present.

By selling hardware, large software companies are actually installing countless eyes and ears around the world. The data sent back to the cloud can make their models smarter and more understanding of human behavior logic.

Why do large companies make AI hardware? They don't care about the hardware profit. What they want is the real world in front of you.

5. Hardware is no longer a heavy asset

Why do people think they can succeed this time? Because large companies have become smarter and no longer try to handle everything by themselves.

Previously, when large companies made hardware, they took on everything from circuit board design to mold - making and factory production scheduling. As a result, it was not only slow but also lacked professionalism.

Now the trend is cooperation. For example, recently Doubao collaborated with ZTE to make mobile phones, and Feishu's choice to work with Anker Innovations on ""One Bean"" is a typical sign. It has to be said that ByteDance has mastered the dual - mode of software and hardware well.

Anker Innovations is a world - leading consumer electronics company. Their understanding of hardware such as the supply chain, batteries, and audio chips is world - class, and their supply - chain advantage is very strong. Anker Innovations provides the hardware carrier and distribution channels. Feishu provides the AI model and connects the office ecosystem.

This division of labor has significantly reduced the trial - and - error cost for software companies.

Feishu doesn't need to study how to make a non - heating charging chip, and Anker Innovations doesn't need to train a large - language model. This ""Lego - style"" assembly model has shortened the hardware R & D cycle from the previous 18 months to the current 6 months or even less.

Hardware is no longer a heavy asset but has become a plug - in that can be quickly iterated.

The production cycle of hardware has been shortened, and the risks have been shared. This makes large companies think that it's worth jumping into this ""fire pit"" again.

[Beyond the Page] Words:

The AI hardware trend in 2026 seems lively but is actually full of helplessness.

The collective move of software companies into hardware is essentially a fear of the end of the mobile Internet era. People have found that the walls of apps can no longer withstand the impact of AI. If you don't turn yourself into a physical entity that users carry around, you'll be forgotten by users.

But we also need to think about a question: Do we really need so many AI recording pens, glasses, and headphones?

The progress of technology is supposed to make people's lives easier. But now, we seem to be surrounded by more sensors. Large companies are vying for our attention, the scenes in front of us, and the sounds in our ears.

When the large - scale model finds its carrier, it is no longer just an icon in the phone but becomes a part of our body.

Is this human evolution or another deep penetration into our lives?","https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20260123/v2_c5b4ce30ed5f4130ab317e3df97b6e5e@000000_oswg62034oswg946oswg403_img_000?x-oss-process=image/resize,m_mfit,w_600,h_400,limit_0/crop,w_600,h_400,g_center",N,,2026-01-23 11:01:02.855369

LONDON Art Fair features works from two modernist homes built in the late 1930s and run by the National Trust, the show’s museum partners, at its 2026 season opener.

The NT is Europe’s largest conservation charity, with 360-plus buildings in its care, and 2 Willow Road, Hampstead, by Ernő and Ursula Goldfinger and The Homewood, in Esher, by Patrick Gwynne, were both designed by the architects as family homes to include art.

Pieces on show include those by Henry Moore, Max Ernst, Prunella Clough, and more from Hampstead; and from Esher, most notably three works on paper by Henri Gaudier-Brzeska.

The 38th LAF is up and running at the Business Design Centre in Islington* and continues until Sunday, see www.londonartfair.co.uk for full details.

More than 120 galleries from home and abroad are represented, selling some excellent modern and contemporary art, complemented by an impressive programme of talks and tours throughout.

The Platform presentation, guest curated by Dr Ferren Gipson, is on the theme of The Unexpected, with artists challenging “conventions in material, process, and form in their work”.

An Encounters section has “the freshest contemporary art” from some 23 galleries, and among them IDENTITY – Ukrainian Artists’ Community, most of whom have moved to the UK owing to the war.

They offer a variety of styles and techniques on the theme “geometry of the universe”.

Siger Gallery’s exhibit “focuses on anxious artistic practices”, both challenging and unnerving.

Guillermo Monroy’s mixed media sculpture Speechless, for example, particularly so; with a masked young female as if coffined in a violin case.

And the Cole Levi-Klimt stand has a more overt religious theme, which includes an intriguing take on the Madonna and Child by Paul Freud.

With both smaller and larger galleries at the fair there’s enormous choice.

From oils by LS Lowry (price on application) and rare early works by David Hockney to oils from Walter Sickert, Ivon Hitchens, Kyffin Williams and many, many, more.

The rhetoric hints at the anxiety of this moment for AI. Many investors are getting antsy to see significant commercial growth that justifies the sector’s enormous expenditures and lofty valuations. OpenAI, an unprofitable startup, has committed to spend more than $1.4 trillion on data centers and chips for AI in the coming years, including striking several deals with cloud providers and chipmakers that have been criticized as circular.

Here follows a statement by the Royal Office :

""Following the 35th African Cup of Nations, hosted with great enthusiasm by the Kingdom of Morocco from December 21st, 2025 to January 18th, 2026, His Majesty the King Mohammed VI, may God assist Him, wishes to convey His gratitude to all members of the Nation, who have contributed admirably to the full success of this wonderful event.

His Majesty the King particularly wishes to congratulate all citizens, across various cities of the Kingdom, for the efforts deployed, and to thank each and every one for their valuable contribution to this historic success, which has been acknowledged and acclaimed worldwide.

The Sovereign also addresses His congratulations to millions of Moroccan women, men and children who, in an exemplary manner and each in their own way, tirelessly supported their national team, currently ranked 8th best national team in the world. Such remarkable result, fruit of a high-level proactive sports and infrastructure policy, as well as the patriotic choice made by talented youth of Moroccan Expatriates to opt for the national team’s jersey and to defend its colors with pride and gusto.

This edition of the continental competition will stand as a milestone, as, beyond its sporting outcomes, it made for a gauge for the Kingdom’s major leap on the path to development and progress, fruit of a long-term vision and a unique and efficient Moroccan model which puts the citizen at the heart of all ambition.

Moreover, even if this major continental football celebration hosted by the Kingdom appears to have been sadly marred by the unfortunate events of the final minutes of the match between the national teams of Morocco and Senegal, during which regrettable incidents and deeply deplorable behavior occurred, it remains nonetheless that, once passions have subsided, inter-African fraternity will naturally prevail, for this Moroccan success is also an African success. Morocco remains proud to have offered, on its soil, a month of popular joy and sporting emotion, and to have contributed to the prominence of Africa and its football.

Furthermore, in view of the denigration and attempts at discrediting sustained, His Majesty the King, may God assist Him, remains convinced that hostile schemes will never reach their aims, and that Moroccan people know to balance matters and not to be drawn into resentment and discord. Nothing will alter the closeness that was fostered over centuries between our African people, nor the fruitful cooperation built hand in hand with different countries of the Continent, bolstered by ever ambitious partnerships.

The Kingdom of Morocco is and shall remain a great African country, faithful to the spirit of brotherhood, solidarity and an always nurtured mutual respect towards its Continent.

In accordance with the enlightened Vision of the Sovereign, Morocco will further its resolute and steadfast commitment in favor of a united and prosperous Africa, notably through mutual exchange of experiences, expertise and knowledge.""",,N,,2026-01-23 11:43:38.684706

Let's dig into Taiwan Semi's earnings results and explore why the company's outlook bodes well for top players in the semiconductor industry.

Taiwan Semi just reported monster earnings

In the fourth quarter, Taiwan Semi generated $33.7 billion in revenue. This was about $300 million above the company's previously issued guidance, and represented growth of 25% year over year and 2% sequentially.

Perhaps even more encouraging is the company's profitability profile. In Q4, TSMC posted a gross margin of 62% -- roughly 330 basis points higher compared to the same period in 2024.

The combination of robust acceleration across the top line and widening gross profits fueled meaningful expansion in operating margins and earnings per share (EPS) for Taiwan Semi.

During the earnings call, the company's CEO, C.C. Wei, hinted that Taiwan Semi would use this excess cash flow to continue investing in next-generation foundries -- referring to the ongoing infrastructure boom as a ""multiyear AI megatrend.""

Taiwan Semi should be thought of as a pick-and-shovel player along the chip value chain. While Nvidia and Broadcom design different types of semiconductors meant for generative AI development, TSMC is the company behind the scenes bringing this hardware to life.

Taiwan Semi is the largest chip manufacturer in the world in terms of revenue. With a market share hovering around 70%, both Nvidia and Broadcom rely heavily on TSMC's fabrication expertise in order to fulfill their respective backlog orders. Taiwan Semi's current growth trajectory and encouraging forward guidance is especially good news for Nvidia and Broadcom investors.

TSMC's results validate that hyperscalers like Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- some of Nvidia's largest customers -- are accelerating their AI infrastructure roadmaps.

Taiwan Semi's ability to manufacture advanced processing nodes such as 5 nanometer and 3 nanometer at scale matters greatly for Nvidia. The reason this is important is because higher profit margins and increased output from TSMC suggest that Nvidia's chips are both in high demand and being converted into shipped revenue more quickly.

Broadcom benefits from TSMC's success for a different reason than its GPU counterpart. Broadcom's value in AI infrastructure comes from designing networking gear for data centers, custom silicon architectures, and connectivity chips. Many of these specialty processes are also manufactured by Taiwan Semi.

TSMC's booming business underscores the idea that AI budgets aren't entirely consumed by GPUs. Rather, the hyperscalers are deploying capital across a broad suite of critical infrastructure beyond general-purpose training hardware.

In other words, the resiliency of Taiwan Semi's business suggests that the current infrastructure supercycle differs materially from the historical cyclicality of the semiconductor industry. Developers are investing beyond raw compute and opting for a full hardware stack to build out their AI systems.

Should you buy Taiwan Semi stock right now?

Taiwan Semi currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24. While the company has experienced meaningful valuation expansion over the last year, TSMC's forward earnings multiple trades at a steep discount to prior highs.

In my eyes, the compression in the company's valuation multiple could suggest that investors have not yet priced in the entirety of Taiwan Semi's growth prospects over the next several years. In other words, despite a strong earnings report and encouraging outlook, some investors may still be suspicious that AI is a bubble and therefore are not assigning premium valuations.

To me, TSMC's latest report should mitigate the bubble fears. The company's growth is accelerating across the board, and management has been explicit about its expansion plans. I think Taiwan Semi is positioned for significant revenue and profit growth through the rest of the decade, making now an interesting time to buy the stock at a reasonable price point.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F851887%2Ftaiwan-semiconductor-tsmc-building-with-tsmc-logo-in-front_tsmc-9.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-23 07:58:27.878399

The announcement, made the day that the Sundance Film Festival debuted in Utah, holds promise in particular for many smaller and independent creative shops (such as those dozens of indie projects on display during Sundance) in both entertainment and marketing for enterprises.

The announcement includes partnerships with Hollywood’s Big Three talent agencies (UTA, WME and CAA); hybrid and AI film-production companies Wonder Studio, Promise.ai, Infinite Studio and B5 Studios; Parsons School of Design and two other art colleges; design studio Cantina Creative; and prominent directors David Ayer and Jaume Collet-Serra.

Anna’s Archive calls itself a non-profit that aims to preserve all human knowledge and make it accessible to anyone in the world, doing so by illegally scraping vast troves of data. It makes pirated content like e-books and scientific articles available in the form of download links via partner servers at varying speeds.

Anna’s Archive stated in a Reddit post that it provided its data to anyone who wanted it, and that anyone could torrent its data or pay for higher speed access. The platform also said that while it did not have direct dealings with Nvidia (as was alleged in the lawsuit), it had no objections in coming to an agreement with the company.

Following up on a lawsuit filed in 2024, authors Abdi Nazemian, Brian Keene, Stewart O’Nan, Andre Dubus III, and Susan Orlean alleged that Nvidia copied their works multiple times to train its language models and reached out to Anna’s Archive for data.

“NVIDIA “got the green light” to use Anna’s Archive. NVIDIA did not hesitate in using pirated books from these illicit sources of copyrighted material, regardless of the “risk” or the harm to authors like the Plaintiffs,” the authors claimed in a legal filing dated January 16.

But the price surge is rippling through consumer markets.
Counterpoint estimates that memory prices will jump 40 percent to 50 percent in the first quarter, after last year’s 50 percent surge.
Some analysts said Apple, with its scale, pricing power and deep supplier network, is better positioned to weather the memory chip price surge than its smaller rivals.
“But it isn’t immune, and may need to raise prices to pass on higher input costs.”","Global demand for smartphones, personal computers and gaming consoles is expected to shrink this year as companies from Britain’s Raspberry Pi to HP Inc raise sticker prices to offset surging memory chip costs.

The rapid build-out of artificial intelligence infrastructure by US tech firms such as OpenAI, Alphabet-owned Google and Microsoft has absorbed much of the world’s memory chip supply, pushing up prices as manufacturers prioritize components for higher-margin data centers over consumer devices.

Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron, the world’s three largest producers of memory chips, have said in recent months that they were struggling to keep up with demand as they reported rosy quarterly earnings on the back of surging prices for their semiconductors.

But the price surge is rippling through consumer markets.

Research firms IDC and Counterpoint both now expect global smartphone sales to shrink at least 2 percent this year, in a sharp reversal from their growth outlook a few months ago. That would mark the first annual decline in shipments since 2023.

The PC market is expected to shrink at least 4.9 percent in 2026, IDC estimated, after an 8.1 percent growth last year. Meanwhile, console sales are expected to fall 4.4 percent in the current year after an estimated growth of 5.8 percent in 2025, according to TrendForce.

While several firms have already raised prices, industry heavyweights Apple and Dell face a tough choice: take on the costs and sacrifice margins or pass them onto consumers at the risk of stifling demand.

“Manufacturers might absorb some costs but given the scale of the shortage, it is certainly going to show up as higher prices for consumers,” Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said.

“It is going to result in more tepid consumer device sales in 2026. It will be a challenge for these companies that are trying to sell products during a time of broader inflation.”

Pressure is being compounded by expectations that the price increases will persist, possibly into next year. Counterpoint estimates that memory prices will jump 40 percent to 50 percent in the first quarter, after last year’s 50 percent surge.

“Over the last two quarters, we’ve seen 1,000 percent price inflation in some products and pricing is continuing to rise,” said Tobey Gonnerman, president of semiconductor distributor Fusion Worldwide.

“Consumers can expect to pay significantly higher prices for laptops, mobile phones, wearables and gaming devices very soon.”

Analysts believe the impact is likely to be most pronounced for manufacturers of low- and mid-range devices, such as Chinese smartphone makers Xiaomi and TCL Technology and PC firm Lenovo.

TrendForce said last year that Dell and Lenovo were planning price hikes of as much as 20 percent early in 2026.

Shares of all Raspberry Pi, Xiaomi, Dell, HP Inc and Lenovo fell in the last three months of 2025, with Xiaomi posting the biggest drop with a 27.2 percent decline.

HP CEO Enrique Lores said in November the company would raise PC prices due to “significant” memory chip costs, while Raspberry Pi CEO called the cost surge “painful” in a December blog post announcing price increases for its devices.

The weaker demand outlook could also hamper sales at electronics-focused retailers such as Best Buy, which had already warned last year that tariff-driven price increases could dissuade potential buyers.

Apple will report earnings on January 29, while Dell is slated to report on February 26. Xiaomi usually reports in late March.

Some analysts said Apple, with its scale, pricing power and deep supplier network, is better positioned to weather the memory chip price surge than its smaller rivals.

The company typically holds prices of its flagship iPhone lineup in the US steady between its September launch events. Last year, it absorbed the hundreds of millions of dollars in tariff-related costs, instead of passing them on to customers.

“Apple is better-positioned, as it uses contract pricing (rather than more volatile spot pricing) for its purchases, securing better prices,” Morningstar analyst William Kerwin said.

The company appointed Barret Zoph to lead its efforts to sell its AI to enterprises, according to reporting from The Information, citing an internal OpenAI memo.

TechCrunch reached out to OpenAI for confirmation and more information.

Zoph returned to OpenAI last week after leaving Thinking Machine Labs, former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s AI startup where Zoph had served as a co-founder and CTO since October 2024.

The exact circumstances of his departure aren’t clear, with rumors swirling about whether Zoph and a few other former OpenAI employees were fired or left on their own accord, possibly with plans to return to OpenAI all along.

Zoph was previously the vice president of post-training inference at OpenAI from September 2022 to October 2024. He’s stepping into a very different position and will likely play an important role at the company as it looks to grow its enterprise business — an area where it is losing ground to competitors.

OpenAI launched its enterprise-focused ChatGPT Enterprise product in 2023 more than a year before Anthropic and multiple years before Google launched its enterprise offerings. The company claims the product has more than 5 million business users and counts companies including SoftBank, Target, and Lowe’s as customers.

But its market share is falling while its rivals are climbing.

Anthropic holds a dominant lead over its AI rivals when it comes to enterprise large language model usage. The AI research lab holds a 40% market share, according to a December report from VC firm Menlo Ventures (which, it should be noted, has invested aggressively in Anthropic). In July, the startup’s market share was estimated to be 32%.

Google’s Gemini adoption has been steadier, according to Menlo Ventures. The company released its enterprise product last fall and has seen its enterprise LLM usage market share largely stay the same, per Menlo’s findings, growing from 20% in July to 21% at the end of the year.

OpenAI on the other hand has seen its usage market share drop from 50% in 2023 to 27% at the end of 2025 — a trend that appears to concern the company. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman expressed concern specifically that Google Gemini’s growth was starting to encroach on OpenAI in an internal memo a few months ago.

Cloud software stocks have started this year where they left off in 2025: sell-off mode.

The continued downward spiral is setting the stage for a flurry of acquisitions, investors told CNBC.

The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund , which tracks cloud software, has dropped more than 8% so far this year, while the Nasdaq is slightly up. Leading software names like Salesforce , ServiceNow and Adobe are down more than 14% after badly underperforming the market a year ago.

The overriding concern is that artificial intelligence will eventually displace key pieces of the enterprise stack, as IT buyers turn to AI agents to handle tasks currently handled by software vendors, both large and small. Those fears were amplified last week when Anthropic's Claude launched an AI agent tool named Cowork that is aimed at the enterprise customer.

A senior investor at a large private equity fund who asked not to be named in order to speak candidly on the subject said the disruption in software is happening today and will force several midsized software companies to seek financing options, potentially spurring acquisitions by private equity.

Orlando Bravo, co-founder of software-focused buyout firm Thoma Bravo, is looking to buy the dip, and sees value in companies that are building their own agentic solutions to work with their existing systems.

""We're seeing just incredible buying opportunities right now,"" Bravo told CNBC's Sara Eisen in Davos on Wednesday. He said his firm is doing deals and ""will be a lot more active.""

While investors like Bravo remain bullish on software in an AI-dominated world, analyst Jackson Ader at KeyBanc sees real vulnerabilities. He conducted an analysis of the major threats facing software in August, and said then that seat-based application companies like Monday.com , Asana and Sprout Social are the most exposed. All three stocks have seen double-digit drops in 2026.

In that same note to clients, Bader said those companies aren't tied to an anchor system of record like enterprise resource planning, or ERP, and customer relationship management, or CRM, and have yet to become multiproduct platforms. Representatives from Monday, Asana and Sprout didn't respond to requests for comment.

Even companies with a wider breadth of products and more established enterprise footprint are facing significant market skepticism.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has spent months defending his company and trying to reassure investors that it is well-positioned in AI.

In Davos, Benioff told Eisen that the company's latest quarter was ""the best quarter we've ever had in our careers"" and that ""we're one of the largest cash-producing companies in the world.""

""But it's not enough,"" Benioff said, referring to the market action. ""Because if you don't produce a large language model, you're evidently not in fashion right now.""

ServiceNow is responding to the pressure by joining the potential competition. On Wednesday, the company announced a deal with OpenAI to use its models to offer AI agents to business customers.

The news didn't ease concerns. ServiceNow shares dropped for six consecutive trading days before rising on Thursday, and are down 17% in January.

HubSpot , Atlassian and Braze are having an even worse start to the year, with shares of each down more than 20%.

Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC that the recent pullback in software stocks could force certain companies to ""explore strategic alternatives"" and that any new deals that don't have a compelling AI angle won't gain much traction with investors.

In a note published in late November, Jaluria highlighted Asana, Box and DocuSign as potential acquisition targets in software. The companies didn't respond to requests for comment.

With tech earnings season kicking into high gear next week, Wall Street will start to get a clearer picture of where particular companies stand in adopting AI or getting swallowed by it.

Luria said one of the crucial questions is how quickly AI agents like Claude's Cowork go beyond developing new code and actually automate different parts of the software lifecycle. That timeline will be critical in understanding the reality of the AI threat and how soon cloud software companies might feel the pain.

The company is making moves to strengthen its pharmaceutical supply chain, boost resilience, and support advanced manufacturing capabilities.

This story is courtesy of our content partner, Thomasnet.com

Johnson & Johnson plans to construct two new production facilities in the U.S. as part of a broader strategy to localize the manufacturing of advanced medicines. These sites are part of a $55 billion commitment to domestic research, development, and technology through 2029.

Expanding the East Coast Footprint

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology company is establishing a next-generation cell therapy production site in Pennsylvania and a biologics plant in North Carolina.

J&J added that these additions complement an existing $2 billion biologics plant currently under construction in Wilson, North Carolina, which is expected to generate roughly 5,000 jobs. The organization has also recently acquired a 160,000-square-foot biopharmaceutical facility in Holly Springs to bolster its long-term production capabilities.

Strategic Pricing and Access

In coordination with federal initiatives, the healthcare firm is launching a direct-to-patient platform that aims to provide pharmaceutical products at discounted rates. According to the manufacturer, this move seeks to align domestic drug pricing more closely with costs found in other developed international markets.

The agreement also provides the company with specific exemptions from certain tariffs.

Future Infrastructure Goals

The organization aims to produce the majority of its complex therapies within the U.S. to ensure more reliable patient access, according to the company announcement. By investing heavily in advanced manufacturing technologies, the firm is transitioning away from older production models to more efficient, automated systems.

J&J added that more announcements regarding domestic production are expected before the end of the year.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

A few years from now, you’ll wish you’d owned this stock.

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

On January 16, Oppenheimer lowered its price target on Boston Scientific to $100 from $125 with an Outperform rating. Oppenheimer is cautious on the financial optics of Boston Scientific’s $14.5 billion acquisition of Penumbra. Although the deal creates a powerhouse in the thrombectomy and neurovascular markets, analysts are questioning the valuation. At $374 per share, the high purchase multiple may hinder the company’s ability to generate a strong ROIC, leading the firm to question whether the timing was ideal for such a large-scale transaction.

Penumbra’s acquisition represents Boston Scientific’s second-largest takeover in its history and marks its re-entry into the neurovascular market.

The move is designed to broaden Boston Scientific’s cardiovascular and neurovascular portfolios. Having divested its neurovascular business to Stryker over a decade ago, Boston Scientific CEO Mike Mahoney emphasized that the company sought a scaled platform and a strong pipeline to return to this attractive segment. Penumbra is expected to contribute ~$1.4 billion in sales for 2025, and the integration is projected to enhance Boston Scientific’s revenue and margins over the long term.

Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) develops, manufactures, and markets medical devices for use in various interventional medical specialties. It has two segments: MedSurg and Cardiovascular.

While we acknowledge the potential of BSX as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

According to the reports, the company’s CEO, Sam Altman, has been meeting with top sovereign wealth funds and other large investors, especially in the United Arab Emirates and Abu Dhabi, to discuss the potential deal.

Valuation could be up to $830B

The talks are still in the early stages, and the amount could change, the report adds. People familiar with the discussions say OpenAI is targeting a valuation between $750 billion and $830 billion, though no final agreements have been announced.

OpenAI is known for its artificial intelligence systems such as ChatGPT and has spent heavily on developing large models, data centers, and computing infrastructure.

Raising new capital would help fund future technology work, including building more computing capacity and hiring engineers.

In addition to the Middle East meetings, Altman has also held separate talks with companies like Amazon about potential investments of at least $10 billion, according to earlier reports.

The completed transactions mark a major funding milestone for the structural heart company as it advances its global pivotal clinical program and scales manufacturing in preparation for potential commercialisation.

Capital raising structure and pricing

The underwritten public offering was initially announced earlier this week at US$200 million but was increased to US$230 million following the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares.

Anteris ultimately issued 40 million common shares at US$5.75 per share in the public offering, including the additional shares issued under the option.

In parallel, the company completed a private placement of 15.65 million shares to Medtronic at the same US$5.75 per share, bringing total gross proceeds from the two transactions to about US$320 million before fees and expenses.

The offering was led by Barclays, Wells Fargo Securities and Cantor as joint book-running managers, with Barrenjoey Markets acting as financial adviser to Asia-Pacific investors. Wells Fargo Securities also acted as sole placement agent for the Medtronic investment.

Funding global PARADIGM trial and manufacturing expansion

Anteris said the net proceeds from the offering and private placement, together with existing cash reserves, will support the next phase of growth and execution of its clinical strategy.

A key focus will be the ongoing recruitment and execution of the global pivotal PARADIGM trial, which is evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the DurAVR® Transcatheter Heart Valve (THV) in patients with severe aortic stenosis. The company also plans to use funds to expand manufacturing capabilities and support continued research and development activities, with remaining capital allocated to working capital and general corporate purposes.

The PARADIGM trial is a large, randomised controlled study designed to enrol around 1,000 patients globally and compare DurAVR® head-to-head against commercially available transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) systems. The trial assesses a composite endpoint including all-cause mortality, stroke and cardiovascular hospitalisation at one year.

Recruitment is already under way, with the first patients enrolled and implanted in Denmark during the December quarter of 2025.

Strategic backing from Medtronic

Management said the US$90 million investment from Medtronic provides both financial support and crucial strategic validation of Anteris’ valve technology as it moves towards regulatory approval and commercialisation.

“This strategic investment, along with our underwritten offering of common stock, represent an important milestone for our company,” said Anteris chief executive officer Wayne Paterson.

“It also provides strong validation of our program from the capital markets and a major strategic innovator,” he added. “The investment is one aspect of a collaboration that may expand into other strategic areas in the future.”

Medtronic said its investment reflects confidence in differentiated innovation within the TAVR market, particularly in technologies that aim to improve haemodynamics and valve performance within a balloon-expandable platform.

Strengthened balance sheet supports next phase

With the capital raise now completed, Anteris said it is well positioned to maintain momentum across clinical execution, manufacturing scale-up and longer-term commercial planning.

The strengthened balance sheet is expected to support expansion of the PARADIGM trial across additional geographies and advance Anteris’ goal of delivering next-generation transcatheter heart valve solutions to a growing global patient population.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI2XzAxXC9TY3JlZW5zaG90LTIwMjMtMDEtMjMtYXQtMS0xMC0wNy1QTS5qcGciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6NjMwLCJmaXQiOiJjb3ZlciJ9fX0=,N,,2026-01-22 20:39:23.347863

That is why Binance is now pursuing a European license and turning to Greek authorities. The company has established both a holding company there and submitted a formal application for a MiCA license. This step comes against the backdrop of intensified scrutiny by French regulators and an escalating conflict over enforcement of the Markets-in-Crypto-Assets Regulation, which has been fully applicable since December 2024. By July 1, 2026, all crypto platforms operating in the EU must provide appropriate authorization, otherwise they face exclusion from the European market.

The French banking regulator ACPR identified significant deficiencies in Binance’s risk control systems during inspections, while intensive anti-money laundering reviews are running in parallel at dozens of crypto exchanges. Of over 100 platforms registered in France, only four have received full authorization so far—a success rate of four percent. In contrast, competitors such as Kraken, Binance, KuCoin, Bybit, Coinbase, and OKX have already obtained MiCA-compliant licenses and now operate in all countries of the European Economic Area or will soon launch. Overall, more than 50 crypto companies now hold MiCA approval—Binance cannot be missing.

Stablecoins: Clear Winners and Losers

In the stablecoin sector, a clear market consolidation is emerging. While Tether, despite its market dominance, has not yet received a MiCA license and has already been removed from several EU exchanges, Circle with EURC and USDC, Société Générale-Forge with EURCV and USDCV, and Membrane Finance with EURe and eUSD have successfully cleared the regulatory hurdle. Notably, most approved stablecoins are denominated in euros, suggesting a strategic realignment of the European crypto market.

The consequences for non-compliant companies are drastic. Regulators have already imposed fines exceeding 540 million euros against crypto firms that violated regulatory requirements. After the deadline in July 2026, all tolerance ends, and companies without appropriate authorization irrevocably lose their operating license in the European Union. For Binance and other pending applicants, the clock is ticking, while already-licensed competitors continuously expand their market position.

Binance Entered 2026 Optimistically

Binance co-CEOs Yi He and Richard Teng, whose team serves approximately 300 million customers, showed greater optimism than ever in their 2026 outlook. They identified five converging forces that will drive the market from “uncertain expansion” to “secure expansion”: robust global economic growth despite trade conflicts, an impending technological revolution (AI, quantum computing, fusion), increased government liquidity provision to households and businesses, the resumption of balance sheet expansion by the Federal Reserve with further interest rate cuts, and expected regulatory clarity through the “RFIA/CLARITY Act,” which is intended to define rules for on-chain assets. This combination of macroeconomic tailwinds, monetary easing, fiscal support, and regulatory clarity makes the long-term development of on-chain assets and applications far more predictable.

The CEOs particularly emphasized that coming growth will no longer be based solely on sentiment and hype, but driven by two fundamental factors: state capital at the sovereign level and enterprise-grade applications. When nations discuss Bitcoin as a strategic reserve and on-chain assets grow from billions to trillions, it is no longer just a “bull market,” but a fundamental redesign of financial infrastructure. In this environment, Binance intends to continue functioning as a “road builder” and is increasing investment in security, compliance, and education to provide all users with safe access to the crypto world.",https://www.trendingtopics.eu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Binance_Leadership.png,N,,2026-01-22 22:40:00.450460

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things.","NEW YORK — Skydance-owned Paramount is again extending the tender offer window in its $77.9 billion hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, while doubling down on a coming proxy fight.

Warner stockholders now have until Feb. 20 to sell their shares to Paramount for $30 apiece in cash — a price that remains unchanged, giving the offer a total enterprise value of over $108 billion including debt. It marks the second extension the company has made since challenging Warner's merger agreement with Netflix last month.

As of late Wednesday, Paramount said that more than 168.5 million Warner shares had been tendered in support of its offer. But that's still far below the 50% mark it would need to effectively gain control of Warner — which has about 2.48 billion shares outstanding in series A common stock today.

“Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix,"" Warner said in an emailed statement Thursday — adding that it's “clear our shareholders agree,"" as more than 93% have so far rejected “Paramount’s inferior scheme.”

In December, Netflix agreed to buy Warner's studio and streaming business for $72 billion — now in an all-cash deal that the companies say is more straight forward and will speed up the path to a shareholder vote by April. Including debt, the enterprise value of the deal is about $83 billion, or $27.75 per share.

But Paramount argues its offer is better than Netflix’s and has accused Warner leadership of not being transparent with stockholders. On Thursday, the company claimed Warner’s board was “rushing to solicit shareholder approval” for the Netflix merger, which it said could lead to a lower payout for shareholders if debt spanning from a previously-announced spinoff of Warner’s networks business makes its way to studio and streaming operations.

In an escalation of its hostile bid, Paramount is also moving forward with a proxy fight. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to nominate its own slate of directors to Warner's board before the next shareholder meeting. And on Thursday, Paramount filed preliminary materials to solicit proxies in opposition to the Netflix merger.

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things. Netflix's proposed acquisition includes only Warner's studio and streaming business, including its legacy TV and movie production arms and platforms like HBO Max. But Paramount's bid is for the entire company — which, beyond studio and streaming, includes its news and cable operations. That would put CNN under the same roof as CBS.

If Netflix is successful, Warner's current networks would be spun off into their own company called Discovery Global, under a previously-announced separation.

Regardless of who wins the upper hand, a Warner Bros. Discovery sale could be a long, drawn-out process — likely attracting tremendous antitrust scrutiny. Politics are expected to come into play under President Donald Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement on whether a deal will go through.

Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery and Netflix both fell slightly Thursday. Shares of Paramount-Skydance rose nearly 3%.

Albertsons Companies ( (ACI) ) has issued an update.

On January 22, 2026, Albertsons Companies and several subsidiaries launched a refinancing push in the bond market, announcing plans to redeem in cash the full $1.35 billion of 4.625% senior notes due 2027 and the $750 million of 5.875% senior notes due 2028, with the redemption expected to occur on February 21, 2026. To fund this move, the company priced an upsized private offering to institutional and offshore investors of $1.2 billion of new senior notes due 2032 at 5.625% and $900 million of additional 5.750% senior notes due 2034, issued at 98.5% of face value and fungible with its existing 2034 notes, with closing expected around February 2, 2026. The transaction extends Albertsons’ debt maturities and consolidates its capital structure by shifting obligations from 2027–2028 to 2032–2034, a step that could ease near-term refinancing risk and provide greater financial flexibility for operations and stakeholders, albeit at somewhat higher long-term coupon costs.

Spark’s Take on ACI Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, ACI is a Neutral.

The score is held back primarily by high leverage and weakening margins, plus bearish technicals with the stock trending below key moving averages. These are partially offset by supportive valuation (low P/E and ~3.7% yield) and a constructive earnings-call backdrop with narrowed guidance, strong digital/pharmacy execution, and continued capital return plans, albeit with notable near-term headwinds.

The stock has retreated from its recent peak, with the market's attention firmly fixed on the upcoming release of the company's Q4 2025 financial results. The central question is whether IBM can deliver on the high expectations surrounding its software division and its current artificial intelligence strategy.

High Stakes for Software and AI

The upcoming report on January 28 is viewed as a critical test for the bullish narrative supported by several analysts. Consensus estimates set a high bar:

- Earnings Per Share (EPS): Approximately $4.33, compared to $3.92 in the prior-year period.

- Total Revenue: Around $19.22 billion, up from $17.55 billion in last year's fourth quarter.

- Software Revenue: Expectations are set near $8.9 billion.

Market observers will scrutinize the software segment with particular intensity. Growth of roughly 7% year-over-year is seen as a minimum threshold to justify recent analyst optimism. A miss on this key metric could widen the apparent gap between positive analyst commentary and the stock's recent cautious price action. Furthermore, IBM's guidance for 2026, especially concerning free cash flow and margin development, will significantly influence the stock's subsequent trajectory.

Analyst Conviction Meets Market Hesitation

At the beginning of the year, several investment banks raised their targets for IBM. Jefferies upgraded the stock to ""Buy"" on January 5, establishing a price target of $360. Bank of America followed with a $335 target, while Evercore ISI set its objective at $330. The common theme is a belief in the company's intact medium-term story, even as short-term market sentiment grows more tentative.

Firms like Stifel have reaffirmed buy recommendations, projecting organic software growth of 7–8%, consistent with the division's trajectory throughout 2025. This dynamic is expected to underpin further margin expansion and growing cash flows. Despite these upward revisions, the equity has recently softened. Priced at €259.25 in European trading, the shares sit approximately 17% below their 52-week high, though they remain well above the prior year's low. The recent pullback is largely attributed to profit-taking and heightened investor restraint ahead of the earnings release.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying IBM?

Strategic Moves in Quantum Security and AI

Beyond the financials, IBM continues to advance its technological positioning. On January 22, the corporation announced a strategic partnership with Keyfactor, a provider of digital trust solutions. The collaboration aims to prepare enterprise clients for the coming era of ""post-quantum cryptography.""

The initiative involves integrating Keyfactor's automation platform with the cybersecurity expertise of IBM Consulting. This move is predicated on the expectation that future quantum computers could compromise current encryption standards. By addressing this threat early, IBM seeks to establish itself as a provider of high-margin consulting and security solutions with potential for long-term demand.

The company is also maintaining its activity in the AI arena. New collaborations with S&P Global and chip specialist Groq are designed to embed the watsonx platform more deeply into corporate workflows and accelerate the practical deployment of agentic AI applications. This strategy allows IBM to target the trend toward specialized, productivity-enhancing AI systems, moving beyond broad platform promises.

The Path Forward Post-Earnings

A convincing performance from IBM, demonstrating robust software growth and providing a confident outlook, could reframe the recent share price decline as a healthy consolidation before a potential next leg up. The January 28 report serves as the definitive event that will either validate the current analyst confidence or challenge the foundations of the optimistic investment thesis.

PVI durability is sometimes a significant issue with PFA, but these one-year results suggest cardiologists using the Globe Pulsed Field System may have better luck with avoiding the need for redo procedures.
The two co-authors did note that the Globe Pulsed Field System almost appears to be “overengineered” at first due to its advanced features.","The Globe Pulsed Field System, a new pulsed field ablation (PFA) system from Vancouver-based Kardium, is a safe, effective treatment option for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AFib), according to new findings published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC).[1]

The Globe Pulsed Field System, which gained U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in September 2025, is capable of both high-density mapping and PFA. It features a 122-electrode spherical array designed to deliver single-shot pulmonary vein isolation (PVI).

Reviewing 1-year data from PULSAR

The FDA’s decision to approve this technology was largely based on results from the Kardium-funded PULSAR clinical trial. One-year data from PULSAR is now available in full.

The study’s authors tracked 183 patients with a mean age of 65 years old. The primary effectiveness endpoint—freedom from atrial arrhythmias or other failure modes for one year—was seen in 77.8% of patients. The primary safety event rate, meanwhile, was 0.6% due to a single stroke in a patient with severe hypertension and polycystic kidney disease. There were no device-related primary safety events.

Another key takeaway from PULSAR was the fact that PVI durability rates were quite high. PVI durability is sometimes a significant issue with PFA, but these one-year results suggest cardiologists using the Globe Pulsed Field System may have better luck with avoiding the need for redo procedures. The authors did warn that more research is still needed to determine if this durability will remain outside of a pivotal study made up of high-volume operators.

“The Globe Pulsed Field System has the potential to transform how we treat AFib by delivering durable pulmonary vein isolation with remarkable efficiency and safety,” said Vivek Reddy, MD, PULSAR principal investigator and a prominent electrophysiologist from Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital, said in a statement. “These results show that this technology can make a real difference for patients, offering them better outcomes and a safer path to long‑term relief from arrhythmias.”

“The publication of the PULSAR pivotal trial results in JACC is a tremendous validation of the safety, efficacy and efficiency of the Globe System” added Kevin Chaplin, CEO of Kardium. “At Kardium, we are committed to delivering the most advanced system for the treatment of AFib.”

An outside perspective on Kardium’s PFA technology

Two electrophysiologists out of Germany—Boris Schmidt, MD, and K.R. Julian Chun, MD, both of Cardioangiologisches Centrum Bethanien in Frankfurt—wrote an editorial that accompanied the one-year PULSAR data.[2] Schmidt and Chun did not participate in the trial and have no connection to Kardium, providing readers with an outside perspective of this new technology.

Overall, Schmidt and Chun celebrated the “remarkable” one-year outcomes of this study. They pointed to the “favorable safety profile” and the “impeccable” PVI durability rates.

The two co-authors did note that the Globe Pulsed Field System almost appears to be “overengineered” at first due to its advanced features. However, they highlighted the technology’s potential to provide additional value not seen with other PFA systems.

“The most innovative potential of the global array lies in the capability to simultaneously record intracardiac electrograms from 122 distinct electrodes,” they wrote. “This will allow us to improve our understanding of electrical phenomena present during atrial fibrillation and may help to identify drivers, rotors, and other arrhythmogenic sources. Thus, it may be a unique mapping and ablation solution for patients with persistent AFib or with AFib independently from the pulmonary veins.”

The co-authors concluded by looking ahead, saying only time will tell whether this is “just another single-shot ablation tool, or if these sophisticated features will add substantial benefit.”

Spark’s Take on BK Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, BK is a Outperform.

The score is driven primarily by strong financial performance (profitability, improved leverage, and solid cash conversion despite weaker FCF growth) and supportive technical momentum (price above major moving averages with positive MACD). Earnings-call guidance and raised medium-term targets further reinforce the outlook, while valuation appears reasonable with a moderate dividend yield.

""As is our common refrain, Chinese banks are adequately capitalised, and losses on property loans are manageable,"" said Ming Tan, credit analyst, S&P Global Ratings.

""Moreover, data from the structured finance market indicates that Chinese mortgages are performing normally, with no big spike in bad loans,” Tan added.

But banks' property-sector strains are easing in S&P’s base case, albeit from a high level, S&P said.

Meanwhile, China's domestic demand is likely to remain subdued and exports should slow in China.

Despite this, China’s real GDP is still headed for growth in 2026, with S&P estimating a 4% rise during the year.

“Meanwhile, given fewer interest rate cuts in 2025 than we expected, we project the banking sector's net interest margin will stabilize at 1.29% in 2027. This would be slightly higher than our previous forecast of 1.27%,” Tan wrote in the report.

Vera Rubin is already being pitched as a full-stack AI infrastructure play, with revamped GPUs, CPUs and networking chips aimed at agentic and inference workloads. Recent reports claim Nvidia has reshuffled key elements, framed as a response to AMD’s push with Instinct MI455X.

SemiAnalysis claims the Vera Rubin NVL72 spec will have 22.2 TB/s of memory bandwidth. That is a hefty leap from the numbers Nvidia showed off at GTC 2025, and it looks like a deliberate move to keep its lead in hyperscaler adoption.

The jump from roughly 13 TB/s to 22.2 TB/s does not come from fairy dust. The claim is that Nvidia is pushing HBM4 beyond standard JEDEC ratings, asking suppliers to raise pin speeds up to 11 Gbps.

Nvidia is working with a narrower eight-stack interface, so squeezing more out of pin speeds is the obvious lever to pull. AMD previously looked comfortable, leaning on 12-Hi HBM4 stacks to claim a 19.6 TB/s figure.

AMD has been talking up the Instinct MI400 family for a while, and it clearly fancies a more serious run at hyperscaler sockets this round. This all seems Nvidia’s attempt to counter this.

USA Today Network

Microsoft Corp. is planning 15 more data centers and adding 8.7 million square feet to its operation in Racine County.

The Mount Pleasant Village Plan Commission unanimously approved the site plans for Microsoft‘s latest development on Jan. 21. The approval goes to the full village board.

Microsoft has had a presence in the area since it announced it was building its first data center in 2024.

This latest proposal, if approved by officials from the Village of Mount Pleasant, marks the biggest expansion the company has made since it came to Wisconsin.

Here’s what to know about Microsoft’s latest plans for Mount Pleasant.

What is the scope of the Racine County Microsoft projects?

Microsoft’s biggest presence is in Mount Pleasant in Racine County. So far, the company has committed more than $7.3 billion in the first phase of its data center campus to support its efforts on artificial intelligence, and it’s likely to grow as the demand for data centers increases.

What’s the location of the planned Microsoft projects in Racine County?

There are two proposals being evaluated by Mount Pleasant officials. One is located on Durand Avenue and the other is on International Drive.

On Durand Avenue, the proposal is planning for up to nine data centers with additional office space, each up to 579,796 square feet. The proposal also includes a 96,000-square-foot office and storage building, and other accessory buildings.

On International Drive, the proposal is planning for six data centers and additional office space, each up to 568,103 square feet. The proposal includes a 74,000-square-foot office and storage building, and other accessory buildings.

Is there a timeline for all of this construction?

Short answer: No.

Longer answer: Microsoft has issued a statement saying “Microsoft has proposed an expansion in Mount Pleasant, with plans submitted for two additional datacenter campuses on land we purchased in 2024. These preliminary plans are the next step in our years-long development process and we look forward to sharing more about our specific plans as we go forward as we’ve done for our first two sites in May 2024 and September of 2025 respectively.”

How many buildings has Microsoft constructed in Racine County?

The company is finishing up its first data center, which consists of multiple buildings. And Microsoft is planning on breaking ground on a second data center later this year.

What guidelines must Microsoft follow while building in Mount Pleasant?

Village staff has set conditions to the proposals which include meeting architectural, lighting, parking and other modifications.

Also, Microsoft must “comply with all Racine Water Utility, Mount Pleasant Sanitary Sewer Utility, and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources rules and permissions regarding consuming and returning water to the applicable utility systems and watersheds,” the staff report says.

How many buildings does Microsoft plan to construct in Racine County?

If what Microsoft is planning comes to fruition, then nearly 20 buildings are planned for the next several years. However businesses change course regularly, even on the plot of land Microsoft is building on. It was originally intended for a giant campus for Foxconn but the original plans fell apart, giving Microsoft an opportunity to build its data centers.

And in 2025 Microsoft paused construction on its first data center for a brief period of time as the company because it was “assessing demand overall for AI and the other was assessing what kind of data center would make the most sense to build here for the second phase,” according to Brad Smith, Microsoft president.

How does the Microsoft data center square footage compare with a Walmart Supercenter?

Walmart Supercenters can range from 99,000 to 260,000 square feet. A Walmart Supercenter is about 200,000 square feet.

Each data center and office space Microsoft is proposing is more than 560,000 square feet, which is nearly three times the size of a Supercenter. With 15 proposed data centers being evaluated for Mount Pleasant, that’s easily more than two Walmart Supercenters per data center.

Medtronic, a global leader in healthcare technology, announced verification study results for its investigational Nellcor™ pulse oximetry with Nell-EQ™ intelligent processor at the Society for Technology in Anesthesia (STA) Annual Meeting.

The company successfully completed pivotal clinical studies for its new Nellcor™ pulse oximetry technology. Initial data show that the investigational Nell-EQ™ intelligent processor technology, when paired with a set of market-released sensors representative of the Nellcor™ pulse oximetry sensor line, demonstrated SpO₂ accuracy better than the FDA's draft-recommended1 threshold. Additionally, pulse rate accuracy was within Nellcor™ technology acceptance limits. These results were observed in a sample inclusive of the full range of skin tones.

Pulse oximetry accuracy has historically varied across skin tones, raising concerns about technology that works for all patients. The investigational Nell-EQ™ intelligent processor technology reflects ongoing efforts of Medtronic to deliver its Nellcor™ technology's consistent SpO₂ and pulse rate accuracy across all skin tones. The company's commitment to getting it right - for every patient - is why Medtronic opened a clinical physiology lab near the Five Points neighborhood of Denver, Colorado. As a result of their extensive community outreach efforts, Medtronic has conducted its clinical studies not only with a diverse array of participants but with greater speed and frequency, leading to faster innovation.

Previously granted FDA Safer Technologies Program (STeP) designation, the company's investigational Nellcor™ pulse oximetry with Nell-EQ™ intelligent processor is currently under 510(k) review, marking an important regulatory milestone in efforts by Medtronic to bring this innovation to market.†

""Today's verification study results demonstrate accuracy across various skin tones, meeting and exceeding both the current U.S. FDA guidance and newer, more-inclusive draft guidance,"" said Dr. Randall Clark, principal investigator of the Medtronic clinical physiology lab. ""Seeing such positive outcomes with the investigational Nellcor™ pulse oximetry technology, paired with Nellcor™ sensors, marks an important step toward advancing medical-grade pulse oximetry that works for every patient.""

The verification studies were conducted in consideration of the evolving regulatory guidance1 and global standards expectations on pulse oximeters for medical purposes, which recommends accuracy testing across the full spectrum of skin tones and maintaining the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for SpO₂ accuracy within 3%, regardless of sensor type.

Key findings:

Study design: Three controlled hypoxia studies with 71 participants (ages 20-46) representing diverse skin tones across Monk Skin Tone (MST) cohorts:

ID9,Boston Scientific,2026-01-22 19:38:20+00:00,Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry,Moving the Needle in the Home Healthcare Manufacturing Space,Susan Shepard,,,,,https://www.mddionline.com/drug-delivery/moving-the-needle-in-the-home-healthcare-manufacturing-space,"He also serves as a Medtech consultant for Forj Medical, a contract development and manufacturing organization focused on advancing next-generation manufacturing solutions for minimally invasive and devices.
At MD&M West, he will present “The Needle Boom: Scaling Overmolded Needle Manufacturing for the At Home Care Revolution,” where he will share how manufacturers should think about scaling precision devices for a rapidly changing home healthcare landscape.
As medical devices increasingly enter the home as part of daily life, the shift is profound.
Can you briefly explain what overmolded needles are and why they are so important in the home-care sector?
Springer: Overmolded needles are more reliable and more precise than glued needles, especially when devices are used unsupervised at home.","“When you start democratizing or decentralizing technology, you have to be very thoughtful about who you partner with,” said Michael Springer, in a recent interview with MD+DI. Speaking about overmolded needles and the accelerating demand driven by GLP‑1 therapies, CGMs, and even neural devices, he offered a clear caution: “Most importantly, don’t try to do it yourself.”

Springer, a Medtech innovation and commercialization leader, works closely with startups, clinicians, and OEMs to accelerate the path to market for breakthrough technologies. He also serves as a Medtech consultant for Forj Medical, a contract development and manufacturing organization focused on advancing next-generation manufacturing solutions for minimally invasive and devices.

At MD&M West, he will present “The Needle Boom: Scaling Overmolded Needle Manufacturing for the At Home Care Revolution,” where he will share how manufacturers should think about scaling precision devices for a rapidly changing home healthcare landscape.

He believes companies can learn from startups, particularly in how they approach manufacturing differently. “You have to ask whether you’re simply good at making needles, or whether you truly understand how needles behave as systems evolve,” Springer explained. “That’s the difference between a manufacturing company and a process engineering company.”

Springer noted that this distinction is central to the work he supports at Forj Medical, where integrated design-through-manufacturing teams help customers anticipate scale from the earliest stages.

Below, Springer shares his perspective not only on overmolded needles but also on the broader shift toward scaling medical devices for home use and what it takes to do it well.

Let me start off by asking why is this topic important for medical device manufacturers?

Springer: With the rise of GLP1s, single-use consumables, and vaccination-driven injections, needles are back in focus. But this conversation goes well beyond needles. When devices move from hospital to home to consumer scale, many of the same patterns appear.

Across wearables, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), drug delivery, and implantables, signal paths and fluid paths get smaller, while tolerance for failure goes to zero. Needles are a great example of a broader trend. Manufacturing is no longer downstream—it’s part of the invention itself.

If you look at who is entering this space today, ranging from large pharma to glucose monitoring companies, it’s becoming clear that success requires far more than understanding the needle alone. Needles appear simple, but they are complex to manufacture at scale.

Take a startup like Biolinq, a company working with micron-scale sensing elements that function similarly to needles. It raises a fundamental question: what actually defines a needle? That challenge forces the industry to rethink assumptions.

Many established companies are comfortable saying, “This is how we’ve always done it.” The real question is whether that approach keeps you ahead of the curve, or already behind it.

As medical devices increasingly enter the home as part of daily life, the shift is profound. It’s comparable to moving from desktop software to mobile apps. Everything becomes decentralized.

When choosing partners, it’s not enough to ask whether they can make a needle. You also must ask whether they understand home-use environments. There are hidden physics and scaling challenges that startups are often solving first.

That’s one of the reasons I work with Forj Medical. Their global footprint and integrated engineering-to-manufacturing ecosystem is built to support devices as they move from early development into high-volume use markets.

My view is that if you’re not working with new companies pushing these boundaries, your design and manufacturing perspective becomes limited. There are many excellent engineers and manufacturers, but the pace of change demands constant challenge and strategic alignment.

Can you briefly explain what overmolded needles are and why they are so important in the home-care sector?

Springer: Overmolded needles are more reliable and more precise than glued needles, especially when devices are used unsupervised at home. Home-use devices live in the real world. A hospital is not the real world.

When you remove trained operators and controlled environments, expectations rise dramatically. If something doesn’t work at home, users lose trust quickly. They stop wearing the device or stop taking the medication.

That’s why human-centered design becomes critical. Overmolded needles support reliability, longevity, and trust. As devices continue to shrink, overmolding presents new technical challenges, but it remains essential for reliability at scale. Companies like Forj Medical, which specialize in microscale molding, electromagnetic sensing, and full system technologies, are increasingly being asked to solve these challenges earlier in the development cycle.

Who should come to your session?

Springer: Ideally, attendees leave with something that resonates and something that challenges how they think. The irony is that final decision makers often don’t attend sessions like this.

If an engineer and a manager attend together, they can continue the conversation back at their company. They can ask, “Is this real? Are we seeing this already?”

The session is for people who are allowed to take calculated risks through strategic decisions. It’s about understanding your risk profile, how you partner, and how you outsource as technology evolves. Forj Medical has been navigating these exact questions as they prepare customers for scale.

What are the main messages you would like your attendees to take away from your session?

Springer: First, it’s never too early to get help. This session is for teams who don't just want to launch a device, but they also want to survive scale.

Many of the best projects fail early, pivot, and eventually find their path. That process often requires outside experience. Asking for help is not failure—it’s a strategic decision.

Second, scale must be designed in from the beginning. Scale is where most devices fail. Working with a CDMO like Forj Medical can help teams design with scale, manufacturability, and global production in mind from day one.

If someone leaves and decides to send one thoughtful email or start one internal conversation, that’s a win.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt14ac89070d5e4751/bltdc6b4703ab050591/69727a45dbcab26a37fe04b7/Untitled_design_-_2026-01-22T142727.202.png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-22 17:40:24.148665

Since its peak in 2017, Kraft Heinz shares have plummeted approximately 70% in value.
The timing delivers an immediate blow to newly appointed Kraft Heinz CEO Steve Cahillane, who assumed the role on January 1, 2026.
Or is it worth buying Kraft Heinz?
Upcoming Earnings to Intensify Scrutiny The next critical test arrives on February 11, 2026, when Kraft Heinz reports its fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 results before the market opens.","In a decisive move signaling a significant loss of confidence, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has filed to divest its entire stake in Kraft Heinz. SEC documents dated January 21 reveal the investment conglomerate plans to sell 325.4 million shares, representing over one-quarter of the company's total share capital. This exit concludes an investment held for more than a decade and comes at a moment of considerable challenge for the packaged food giant.

The decision appears to be a clear verdict on the company's future direction. Since its peak in 2017, Kraft Heinz shares have plummeted approximately 70% in value. The move by CEO Greg Abel is widely seen as tidying up the portfolio of his predecessor, Warren Buffett, who had himself labeled the 2015 merger of Kraft and Heinz a mistake. Berkshire had already recorded a $3.76 billion impairment on the investment in the summer of 2025.

The timing delivers an immediate blow to newly appointed Kraft Heinz CEO Steve Cahillane, who assumed the role on January 1, 2026. He now faces a stark vote of no confidence from one of the company's most prominent shareholders. Market analysts are aligning with this skeptical view, as evidenced by recent rating adjustments:

BNP Paribas Exane downgraded the stock to ""Underperform,"" setting a price target of $22.

JPMorgan reduced its rating to ""Neutral"" with a $24 target, citing persistent volume pressure expected through the end of 2026.

Jefferies maintained a ""Hold"" but cut its price target to $23, criticizing the company's ""unclear separation strategy.""

Operational performance offers little solace. The company's U.S. retail sales declined by four percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Kraft Heinz?

A Vote Against the Planned Split

Central to the current uncertainty is CEO Cahillane's strategy to split Kraft Heinz into two separate publicly traded entities in the second half of 2026. The plan would create ""Global Taste Elevation Co."" for faster-growing sauces and condiments, and ""North American Grocery Co."" for established staple brands in the U.S. market.

Observers interpret Berkshire's registered exit as a direct expression of doubt in this separation plan's value-creation potential. Rather than waiting to see the split implemented, Berkshire is choosing to cut its losses, even at current depressed share prices.

Upcoming Earnings to Intensify Scrutiny

The next critical test arrives on February 11, 2026, when Kraft Heinz reports its fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 results before the market opens. Analysts are forecasting earnings per share of $0.61 on revenue of $6.38 billion.

Until the disposal is complete, selling pressure is likely to persist. A key concern for the market is the method of Berkshire's exit. If the shares are sold on the open market rather than through a controlled secondary offering, the resulting liquidity overhang could stifle any potential for a near-term share price recovery.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2440222_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 18:41:31.444124

Founded in 2015 by Sameer Nigam, Rahul Chari, and Burzin Engineer and acquired by e-commerce giant Flipkart a year later, PhonePe has emerged as one of India’s most successful fintechs. The company started with digital payments and has expanded into stockbroking and mutual fund investments, and even offers an Android app store as an alternative to the Google Play Store.

PhonePe is the largest player in India’s digital payments market, leading the UPI ecosystem in transaction volumes and staying ahead of Google Pay. In December 2025, it processed about 9.81 billion transactions worth roughly ₹13.6 trillion (about $148.6 billion), compared with Google Pay’s 7.50 billion transactions worth about ₹9.6 trillion (around $104.5 billion), according to the latest NPCI data.

The company was spun off after Flipkart decided on a partial split in December 2020. PhonePe and Flipkart completed their separation in December 2022, and Walmart remained the fintech’s dominant shareholder.

In the six months ended September 2025, PhonePe’s revenue from operations rose 22% to ₹39.19 billion (about $427.79 million) from a year earlier, while its loss widened to ₹14.44 billion (around $157.70 million) from ₹12.03 billion (about $131.34 million), per the prospectus.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1206129405.jpg?resize=1200,784",N,,2026-01-22 14:42:23.798834

Training Safety Through Data and Simulation Modern AI-driven safety systems learn from exponentially more driving scenarios than any human could experience in a lifetime.
By generating synthetic scenarios that represent these rare situations, AI systems can learn appropriate responses during development without putting people at risk.","AI-powered driver assistance technologies are becoming standard equipment, fundamentally changing how vehicle safety is assessed and validated.

The recent recognition of the Mercedes-Benz CLA as Euro NCAP’s Best Performer of 2025 underscores this shift, as the vehicle combines traditional passive safety features with NVIDIA DRIVE AV software to achieve the highest overall safety score of the year.

​​“When Euro NCAP assesses vehicle safety, it evaluates both passive and active systems — achieving a perfect score requires a state-of-the-art advanced driver assistance system,” said Ola Källenius, CEO of the Mercedes-Benz Group. “This milestone represents the culmination of five years of collaboration between Mercedes-Benz and NVIDIA to enhance real-world safety and deliver tangible value to customers.”

Euro NCAP (European New Car Assessment Programme) has for nearly 30 years served as Europe’s independent vehicle safety authority, backed by European governments, motoring organizations and consumer groups.

Euro NCAP evaluates vehicles across four categories that reflect real-world safety. For AI-powered driver assistance, the most relevant are the “Vulnerable Road User” and “Safety Assist” categories, which assess technologies designed to help prevent crashes — including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping support and speed assistance.

Only vehicles achieving five-star ratings with standard equipment qualify for “Best in Class” recognition, with winners determined by weighted scores across all categories. In 2025, Euro NCAP tested a record 49 models.

Safety Comes First: How DRIVE AV Is Built for Trust

Safety ratings like Euro NCAP are increasingly recognizing vehicles that combine strong passive protection with advanced active safety performance. As AI becomes central to driving, the benchmark for the “safest” car will increasingly be defined not only by how well a vehicle handles a crash, but how effectively it helps prevent one.

The Mercedes-Benz CLA is built with NVIDIA DRIVE AV, a dual-stack architecture that’s designed to help automakers deliver systems that aren’t only intelligent, but predictable, verifiable and resilient in the real world. The architecture pairs an AI-driven end-to-end driving system with a parallel classical safety stack to provide redundancy across AV sensing, planning and execution.

The CLA is also built on the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion architecture, which incorporates sensor diversity and hardware redundancy into the vehicle’s overall design.

At the heart of this approach is NVIDIA Halos — a comprehensive safety system spanning hardware, software, tools, development processes and certification support. Halos delivers a structured safety foundation for developing automated driving and other AI capabilities while staying anchored to robust guardrails, redundancy and fault tolerance.

Third-party certification and assessments are also important to build trust:

TÜV SÜD granted the ISO 21434 Cybersecurity Process certification to NVIDIA for its automotive system-on-a-chip, platform and software engineering processes. Additionally, NVIDIA DriveOS 6.0 conforms to ISO 26262 Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL) D standards.

TÜV Rheinland performed an independent United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) safety assessment of NVIDIA DRIVE AV related to safety requirements for complex electronic systems, which NVIDIA successfully completed.

NVIDIA recently released its Alpamayo family of open AI models, simulation tools and datasets — which enables AVs to navigate even rare, “long-tail” events they haven’t been trained on by breaking the scenario down into smaller steps, reasoning through multiple possible actions and ultimately selecting the safest one. Using these models with the parallel classical safety stack in the NVIDIA DRIVE AV dual-stack architecture provides an additional layer of protection to keep vehicles operating within safe boundaries.

Training Safety Through Data and Simulation

Modern AI-driven safety systems learn from exponentially more driving scenarios than any human could experience in a lifetime. NVIDIA’s cloud-to-car development approach transforms real-world data into billions of simulated miles using NVIDIA DGX systems for neural network training, the NVIDIA Omniverse and Cosmos platforms for simulation, and NVIDIA DRIVE AGX for in-vehicle computing.

This methodology addresses a critical challenge in safety validation: training AI to navigate rare but high-risk edge cases that are too dangerous — or too infrequent — to test reliably in the real world. By generating synthetic scenarios that represent these rare situations, AI systems can learn appropriate responses during development without putting people at risk.

The CLA’s recognition is more than a single model earning a top rating — it reflects a broader shift in what safety means in the modern vehicle, where trusted crash protection is paired with AI-enabled driver assistance designed to help avoid accidents in the first place.",https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/mb-cla-euro-ncap-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 14:59:18.969484

In a note ahead of IBM’s earnings report, due on January 28, the firm reiterated a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock. “We are bullish on IBM's ability to deliver upward estimate revisions and accelerating software growth in calendar year 2026,” the analysts wrote.

Jefferies pointed to Red Hat as a primary driver of the outlook, noting that bookings growth accelerated to roughly 20% and that key subscription products such as OpenShift and Ansible are showing accelerating demand. The analysts highlighted OpenShift’s annual recurring revenue of about $1.8 billion, along with about 40% bookings growth, supported by $400 million in virtualization-related bookings and an additional $700 million pipeline. They wrote that these indicators, along with broader Red Hat momentum, could help drive stronger software revenue.

The note also cited momentum in automation and data as supporting factors, noting that HCP delivered its highest bookings quarter in history in the third quarter, supported by IBM’s global distribution channels, and is expected to approach 20% growth this year.

Jefferies added that the Data and AI portfolio, initially expected to grow in the mid-to-high single digits, could benefit from the CFLT transaction through acquired revenue and a higher growth profile.

A rebound in mainframe software spending could further support software revenue, the firm added. The analysts noted that transaction processing software underperformed for much of 2025 as mainframe clients prioritized hardware spend early in the cycle.

Given the strength in shipped MIPS, which they wrote were more than 100 percent higher versus the z16 cycle, Jefferies believes that transaction processing revenue should benefit as shipped MIPS turn into installed MIPS.

On IBM’s Q4 results, Jefferies noted that sentiment has improved as IBM’s software growth rose from mid-single digits to high-single digits, but execution has been inconsistent and the company has slightly missed Street estimates in each of the last four quarters.

They noted that Street estimates are modeling 10.2% year-over-year software growth in the fourth quarter, alongside 10% infrastructure growth and 6% consulting growth, with total revenue growth expected at 9.5% and a free cash flow margin of 36%.

Jefferies also discussed valuation, noting that IBM trades at 26 times CY27 GAAP EPS, compared with 27 times for Oracle and 23 times for Microsoft. They have a $360 price target on IBM, which traded hands at about $297 on Thursday afternoon.

The analysts believe that the multiple could expand if software execution becomes more consistent and the software business mix rises, with software expected to represent nearly half of revenue by 2027.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI2XzAxXC8yMDI0LTEwLTI0LTEyLTU4LTMxLWI0ZGVlMWNmOTU0ZTU0NzcwZjA1ZjlkMjU0OGU4YzhkLmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,N,,2026-01-22 14:42:07.242786

Managing GLP-1 spending has become a strategy of its own, according to one NFP leader, who advocated for collaboration among CHROs, CFOs, and corporate boards to address this issue.
A host of pharmaceutical manufacturers have agreed to sell their medications at a lower price point, including Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, which make GLP-1 drugs.
“I think GLP-1s will always be a specific, individual topic,” apart from pharmacy benefits more broadly, he explained.
Managing complex challenges surrounding pharmacy costs may benefit from cross-collaboration among HR and finance teams, as well as corporate boards, Conway suggested.","Employers grew more concerned about the high cost of pharmaceutical drugs last year, even as the White House rolled out a series of policies intended to lower prices of some popular medications.

Nearly three-quarters of employers said they were moderately, very, or extremely concerned about pharmacy costs being “unsustainable” in 2025, according to a recent report from NFP, a benefits consultancy that’s part of Aon. That’s up from 67% who expressed moderate to extreme concern about pharmacy costs in 2024.

The growing focus on pharmacy spending comes as employer health costs are projected to rise more than 9% this year, driven in part by coverage of costly GLP-1 medications for weight loss. Managing GLP-1 spending has become a strategy of its own, according to one NFP leader, who advocated for collaboration among CHROs, CFOs, and corporate boards to address this issue.

How HR is seeking to control prescription drug spend. President Donald Trump campaigned on overhauling the US healthcare system and has rolled out a number of policies intended to lower drug prices since taking office in 2024. A host of pharmaceutical manufacturers have agreed to sell their medications at a lower price point, including Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, which make GLP-1 drugs.

The hope is that these deals will eventually bring relief to the employer-sponsored insurance market. As of October 2025, though, GLP-1 diabetes and weight loss medications were still cited as the top driver of prescription drug spending among health benefits decision-makers surveyed by NFP, with 51% identifying them as such, up from 44% in 2024.

Despite their high cost, GLP-1s are gaining ground as a potential lever for talent attraction and retention. Indeed, 29% of workers told NFP they would switch jobs to gain GLP-1 coverage.

Still, decisions about coverage vary “dramatically” from one employer to the next, said Nick Conway, NFP’s president of Rx Solutions. Those who are covering the drugs are commonly turning to “bolt-on solutions” to help manage costs, he said. Such solutions may be offered by a pharmacy benefit manager or a third party, and may help employers evaluate whether GLP-1s are appropriate for their workers, as well as manage utilization.

Other employers may forgo working with their PBM entirely and turn to point solution vendors to help manage GLP-1s separately from other prescription drugs, he said.

Whatever approach HR teams land on, it looks likely that GLP-1s will require unique strategic thinking for the foreseeable future, Conway said. “I think GLP-1s will always be a specific, individual topic,” apart from pharmacy benefits more broadly, he explained.

Managing complex challenges surrounding pharmacy costs may benefit from cross-collaboration among HR and finance teams, as well as corporate boards, Conway suggested. “All this disruption is creating a more robust conversation at our employer clients to bring in either the chief financial officer of the business, or the board of the business, into these decisions,” he said.","https://morningbrew.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,quality=70,format=auto/https://storage.morningbrew.com/image/2026-01-22/image-8d1ec49515058dfebb728eb57c8fded728c81ac9-2409x1606-jpg/Moneyinhealthcare-Highcosthealthconcept",N,,2026-01-22 17:58:24.670397

Lisa Su — Chair and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon to all those listening today. So we delivered very strong second quarter results, with revenue exceeding the midpoint of guidance as higher EPYC and Ryzen processor sales more than offset headwinds from export controls that impacted Instinct sales. We set records for both EPYC and Ryzen CPU sales, reflecting the broad-based demand for our differentiated, high-performance data center, PC, and embedded processors.

Second quarter revenue increased 32% year-over-year to a record $7.7 billion, and we delivered over $1 billion in free cash flow. Excluding the $800 million inventory write-down related to data center AI export controls, gross margin was 54%, marking our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion led by a richer product mix.

Turning to the segments, Data Center segment revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $3.2 billion. We saw robust demand across our EPYC portfolio to power cloud and enterprise workloads and increasingly for emerging AI use cases. In particular, adoption of Agentic AI is creating additional demand for general-purpose compute infrastructure, as customers quickly realize that each token generated by a GPU triggers multiple CPU-intensive tasks. Against this backdrop, 5th Gen EPYC Turin shipments ramped significantly, and we had sustained demand for our prior generation EPYC processors. As a result, we set records for both cloud and enterprise CPU sales and delivered our 33rd consecutive quarter of year-over-year share gains.

In cloud, adoption expanded with the largest hyperscalers as they deployed EPYC to power more of their mission-critical infrastructure, services, and public cloud products. More than 100 new AMD-powered cloud instances launched in the quarter, including multiple Turin instances from Google and Oracle Cloud that deliver up to twice the performance of our previous generation, which were already the industry’s highest-performing offerings. There are now nearly 1,200 EPYC cloud instances available globally, as providers continue expanding both the breadth and regional availability of their AMD offerings. This continued expansion is accelerating enterprise adoption of EPYC in the cloud, with deployments growing significantly from the prior quarter as we closed large wins with dozens of large aerospace, streaming, financial services, retail, and energy companies.

EPYC adoption also grew with telecom customers, as providers modernize their infrastructure for next-generation networks. For example, KDDI announced plans to deploy EPYC processors to power its 5G virtualized network, and Nokia selected EPYC for its cloud platform used by service providers to build, deploy, and manage core network functions.

Turning to enterprise on-prem adoption, HPE, Dell, Lenovo and Supermicro launched 28 new Turin platforms in the quarter that delivered leadership performance, efficiency, and TCO across a wide range of enterprise workloads. EPYC enterprise deployments grew significantly from the prior quarter, supported by new wins with large technology, automotive, manufacturing, financial services, and public sector customers. To extend our momentum with SMB and hosted IT service customers, we launched the EPYC 4005 series that combine enterprise-grade performance and features in cost-optimized platforms, purpose-built for smaller-scale deployments.

Turning to HPC, AMD now powers more than one-third of the world’s fastest supercomputers, including El Capitan and Frontier, which retained the number one and number two spots on the latest top 500 list. We also powered 12 of the top 20 systems on the Green500, highlighting the performance per watt advantages of EPYC and Instinct for large-scale deployments. Looking ahead, we remain bullish on our server CPU business, driven by durable tailwinds, including growing demand for cloud and on-prem compute, sustained share gains, and the growing investments in general-purpose infrastructure required to enable AI.

Turning to our data center AI business, revenue declined year-over-year as US export restrictions effectively eliminated MI308 sales to China, and we began transitioning to our next-generation MI350 series accelerators. We made solid progress with MI300 and MI325 in the quarter, closing new wins and expanding adoption with Tier1 customers, next-generation AI cloud providers, and end users. Today, seven of the top 10 model builders and AI companies use Instinct, underscoring the performance and TCO advantages of our data center AI solutions. We launched our Instinct MI350 series with industry-leading memory bandwidth and capacity and broad adoption across hyperscalers, AI companies, and OEMs.

From a competitive standpoint, MI355 matches or exceeds B200 in critical training and inference workloads and delivers comparable performance to GB200 for key workloads at significantly lower cost and complexity. For at-scale inferencing, MI355 delivers up to 40% more tokens per dollar, providing leadership performance and clear TCO advantages. With the MI350 series, we’re also expanding our system-level capabilities to support deployments powered by AMD CPUs, GPUs, and NICs. As one example, Oracle is building a 27,000-plus node AI cluster combining MI355 accelerators, 5th Gen EPYC Turin CPUs, and Pollara 400 SmartNICs. We began volume production of the MI350 series ahead of schedule in June, and expect a steep production ramp in the second half of the year to support large-scale production deployments with multiple customers.

Our Sovereign AI engagements accelerated in the quarter, as governments around the world adopt AMD technology to build secure AI infrastructure and advance their economies. As one example, we announced a multi-billion dollar collaboration with UMaine to build AI infrastructure powered entirely on AMD CPUs, GPUs, and software. Initial deployments are underway in key regions, with quarterly expansions planned over the coming years. In addition, we have more than 40 active engagements globally and see significant opportunities to power an increasingly larger portion of national computing centers and sovereign AI initiatives.

On the AI software front, we made significant progress this quarter increasing the performance, improving the usability, and expanding the adoption of ROCm. We announced ROCm 7 with major upgrades across every layer of the stack, delivering more than 3x higher inferencing and training performance, compared to our prior generation, and adding support for large-scale training, distributed inference, and lower precision data types. The deepened developer engagement, we introduced nightly ROCm builds and expanded access to instant compute infrastructure, including launching our first Developer Cloud that provides pre-configured containers for instant access to AMD GPUs. We also expanded native support for ROCm across key frameworks including vLLM and SGLang, enabling frontier models like Llama 4, Gemma 3, and DeepSeek R1 to launch with Day 0 AMD support. To accelerate enterprise adoption, we introduced ROCm Enterprise AI, a full-stack platform that integrates seamlessly with existing IT infrastructure and includes everything needed for an enterprise to deploy, manage, and scale AI across their business.

Looking ahead, the development of our next-generation MI400 series is progressing rapidly. These are the most advanced GPUs we have ever built, with up to 40 petaflops of FP4 AI performance and 50% more memory, memory bandwidth, and scale out throughput than the competition. With the MI400 series, we’re bringing together everything we’ve learned across silicon, software, and systems to deliver Helios, a full-stack, rack-scale AI platform. Helios is purpose-built for the most demanding AI workloads, with each rack connecting up to 72 GPUs that can operate as a single massive AI accelerator. Helios is expected to deliver up to a 10x generational performance increase for the most advanced frontier models, and we believe it will be the highest performance AI system in the world when it launches. MI400 series development is progressing well towards our planned launch in 2026, with significant interest in large-scale deployments from multiple high-profile customers.

To accelerate our development, we have invested significantly to expand our AI software and hardware capabilities, both organically and inorganically with a number of acquisitions and strategic investments. We strengthened our software stack last quarter with the addition of the Brium and Lamini teams, building on our acquisitions of Nod.ai, Mipsology, and Silo AI. On the hardware side, we added a world-class rack and data center scale design team in the second quarter with our acquisition of ZT Systems. The ZT team has integrated seamlessly, and they are actively engaging with multiple customers to accelerate deployments of our Helios solutions at scale. We also announced last quarter that Sanmina intends to acquire ZT’ US-based manufacturing business, becoming our lead partner for AI rack manufacturing.

Turning to the AI regulatory environment, earlier this quarter, we were notified by the Department of Commerce that it is moving forward with the review of our license applications to export MI308 to China. We appreciate the focus the Trump administration is placing on ensuring that the US technology remains central to global AI infrastructure, and we expect to resume MI308 shipments as licenses are approved, subject to end customer demand and supply chain readiness. As our licenses are still under review, we are not including any MI308 revenue in our third quarter guidance. Despite that, we expect Instinct revenue to grow year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by the ramp of MI350 at multiple customers.

In Client and Gaming, segment revenue increased 69% year-over-year to $3.6 billion, driven by record client CPU sales and strong demand for our semi-custom game console SoCs and Radeon GPUs. Client revenue increased 67% year-over-year to $2.5 billion led by record desktop CPU sales. Demand for our latest generation Ryzen 9000 series was strong, especially for our differentiated X3D processors. We delivered record desktop channel CPU sales, as Ryzen processors consistently topped the best-selling CPU lists at major global e-tailers throughout the quarter. We also expanded our Zen 5 desktop portfolio with the launch of our latest Threadripper processors that feature up to 96 cores and deliver up to double the performance of the competition in many popular content creation and design workloads.

In mobile, demand for AMD-powered notebooks was strong, with sell-out growing by a large double-digit percentage year-over-year. We drove a richer mix of higher ASP mobile parts year-over-year as we expanded our share in the premium notebook segment, where our Ryzen AI 300 CPUs deliver leadership, performance, and value for both general-purpose and AI workloads.

In commercial PCs, Ryzen adoption accelerated as OEM consumption increased more than 25% year-over-year. We saw strong sell-through for AMD commercial notebooks with Lenovo and HP, and a significant uptick in Dell sales as they ramp availability of their AMD commercial portfolio. We also closed new enterprise wins with Forbes 2000 pharma, tech, automotive, financial services, aerospace, and healthcare companies. We expect to continue growing our commercial client share based on the strength of our product portfolio and expanded breadth of OEM offerings.

Looking more broadly, we remain confident we can continue growing client processor revenue ahead of the market over the coming quarters, driven by increased adoption of our desktop and notebook products, growing commercial momentum, and a richer product mix.

In gaming, revenue increased 73% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. Semi-custom revenue increased by a large double-digit percentage year-over-year, as console inventories normalized and our customers began preparing for the holiday season. We announced a new multiyear collaboration with Microsoft for custom chips that will power the next-generation of Xbox devices, including consoles, PCs, and handhelds. We also deepened our collaboration with Sony through Project Amethyst, a co-engineering program that will use machine learning to power the next wave of immersive gaming experiences.

In PC gaming, demand for our latest generation Radeon 9000 series GPUs was very strong, with desktop GPUs sell-through accelerating in the quarter, as demand outpaced supply. We launched the Radeon 9600 XT, extending the performance advantages of RDNA 4 to mainstream gamers and delivering a significant uplift in gaming performance, including more than double the ray tracing of our prior generation. As part of our end-to-end AI strategy, we introduced the Radeon AI PRO R9700 GPU for local inferencing, model fine-tuning, and other data-intensive workloads. The R9700 features more memory, full ROCm support, and multi-GPU scalability, enabling advanced AI development and deployment directly on the desktop.

Turning to our embedded segment, revenue decreased 4% year-over-year to $824 million. Demand continues recovering gradually with sell-through in the second quarter picking up, as strength in most markets was offset by a few pockets of softness in inventory reduction actions, largely with industrial customers. We expanded our embedded portfolio with the first production shipments of Spartan UltraScale+ FPGAs that deliver leadership performance and advanced security for cost-sensitive, low-power applications. Adoption of our Versal adaptive SoCs continues expanding in high-end applications, including next-generation Robotaxi platforms developed by Bosch in Europe, where Versal serves as a high-performance controller enabling real-time processing, security, and encryption in fully electric automated vehicles.

Looking ahead, we expect improving demand in the test and measurement, communications, and aerospace markets will drive a return to sequential growth in the second half of 2025. Longer-term design win momentum continues to build tracking ahead of this point last year and putting us on pace to surpass the record $14 billion in design wins we achieved in 2024.

In summary, demand is very strong across our product portfolio, and we are well-positioned to deliver significant growth in the second half of the year, led by the steep ramp of MI350 series accelerators and ongoing EPYC and Ryzen share gains. Our server and PC CPU businesses are accelerating, driven by growing demand for high-performance compute, sustained share gains, the strength of our product portfolio, and expanded go-to-market investments. Our embedded in gaming businesses are returning to growth and are well-positioned for long-term success, supported by strong design win momentum. And in AI, we are seeing strong adoption of our MI350 series and ROCm 7, as we deliver leadership performance and TCO advantages across a broader range of workloads and ramp deployments with an expanded set of cloud and enterprise customers.

Looking ahead, we see a clear path to scaling our AI business to tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. We are very excited about our next-generation MI400 series, which is another giant step forward on our roadmap and has been designed to deliver leadership performance at the chip, server, and rack levels. Customer interest for the MI400 series is very strong, and we are actively engaging with an expanding set of customers to support large-scale deployments in 2026. We are in the early stages of an industry-wide AI transformation that will drive a step function increase in compute demand across all of our markets, positioning us for significant revenue and earnings growth over the coming years.

Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our second quarter results. Jean?

Jean Hu — Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer

Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I’ll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. We are pleased with our strong second quarter financial results. We delivered record revenue of $7.7 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance, up 32% year-over-year, reflecting strong momentum across our business. Record sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and higher semi-custom shipment more than offset the impact of the US export controls, restricting MI308 sales to China. Revenue increased 3% sequentially due to strong growth in the Client and Gaming segment, partially offset by the data center revenue decrease due to export controls.

Gross margin was 43%, down 10 points from 53% a year ago. The decrease was due to the $800 million inventory and related charges associated with the export restrictions. Excluding this charge, non-GAAP gross margin would have been approximately 54%.

Operating expenses were approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of 32% year-over-year, as we continue to invest aggressively in go-to-market activities for revenue growth and in R&D to capitalize on significant future AI expansion opportunities. Operating income was $897 million, representing a 12% operating margin compared to $1.3 billion, or 22% a year ago. The decline was primarily due to the inventory and related charges. Taxes, interest expense, and other totaled $126 million.

For the second quarter of 2025, diluted earnings per share were $0.48, compared to $0.69 a year ago. The inventory and related charges reduced earnings per share by approximately $0.43.

Now turning to our reportable segment, starting with the Data Center. Data Center segment revenue was $3.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, driven by strong EPYC CPU revenue and the share gains across both cloud and enterprise customers. On a sequential basis, Data Center revenue decreased 12% due to the impact of the export controls on MI308. The Data Center segment operating loss was $155 million, compared to operating income of $743 million a year ago, or 26% of revenue. The loss was primarily due to the inventory and related charges.

Client and Gaming segment revenue was $3.6 billion, up 69% year-over-year and 20% sequentially, driven by record client CPU sales and strong demand for our PC and console gaming products. In the Client business, revenue was a record of $2.5 billion, up 67% year-over-year, driven by record sales of our Ryzen desktop CPUs and richer product mix. Gaming revenue rose to $1.1 billion, up 73% year-over-year, reflecting strong demand for our newly launched gaming GPUs and higher semi-custom revenue as inventory has now normalized and customers prepare for the holiday season.

Client and Gaming segment operating income was $767 million, or 21% of revenue, compared to $166 million, or 8% a year ago, driven by richer client product mix and operating leverage on higher revenue. Embedded segment revenue was $824 million, down 4% year-over-year and flat sequentially, as embedded and market demand remains mixed. Embedded segment operating income was $275 million, or 33% of revenue, compared to $345 million, or 40% a year ago. The decline in operating income was primarily due to product mix.

Before I review the balance sheet and the cash flow, as a reminder, we closed the acquisition of ZT Systems early in the second quarter. As we had announced our intent to divest ZT manufacturing business, the financial results of the ZT manufacturing business are reported separately in our financial statements as discontinued operations and are excluded from our non-GAAP financials. Subsequently, in May, we entered into an agreement with the Sanmina Corporation to sell the ZT manufacturing business for $3 billion in cash and stock, inclusive of contingent payments. The transaction is expected to close near the end of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.

Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, during the quarter, we generated $1.5 billion in cash from operating activities of continuing operations, and free cash flow was a record of $1.2 billion. We returned $478 million to shareholders through share repurchases, resulting in $1.2 billion in share repurchases for the first half of 2025. In May, our Board of Directors approved an additional $6 billion authorization exiting the quarter, we have $9.5 billion remaining under our share repurchase program. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5.9 billion. Our long-term debt was $3.2 billion. During the quarter, we paid down $950 million of commercial paper used to finance the ZT Systems’ acquisition cost.

Now turning to our third quarter 2025 outlook, please note that our third quarter outlook does not include any revenue from AMD Instinct MI308 shipment to China, as our license applications are currently under review by US government. For the third quarter of 2025, we expect revenue to be approximately $8.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. The midpoint of our guidance represents approximately 28% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by strong double-digit growth in our Client and Gaming and Data Center segments. Sequentially, we expect revenue to grow by approximately 13%, driven by strong double-digit growth in the Data Center segment with the ramp of our AMD Instinct MI350 series GPU products. Modest growth in our Client and Gaming segment, with client revenue increasing and gaming revenue to be flattish. And our Embedded segment revenue to return to growth.

In addition, we expect third quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%, and we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.55 billion. We expect net interest and other expenses to be, again, over approximately $10 million. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.63 billion shares.

In closing, we executed very well in the first half of the year, delivering record revenue and building strong momentum for growth in the second half. The strategic investment we are making positioned us to capitalize on the expanding AI opportunities across all our end markets, driving sustainable long-term revenue growth and earnings expansion for compelling value creation.

With that, I’ll turn it back to Matt for the Q&A session.

Matthew Ramsay — Vice President of Financial Strategy and Investor Relations

Operator, will you please pull the audience for questions? Thank you.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Yes, thank you, Matt. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Thomas O’Malley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.

Thomas O’Malley

Hey, thank you for taking my questions, and I appreciate it. Lisa, I want to start on the Client business. So you had previously laid out a second half outlook that was roughly flattish with the first half, as you were kind of protecting against some pull-forward. So first, do you think that your Q2 results included some pull-forwards and the second half should still be flattish? And longer-term, after the Intel commentary regarding 18A, maybe what that means is a knee jerk reaction just right away for AMD longer-term in terms share and ASPs?

Lisa Su

Sure, Tom, thanks for the question. So first of all, our Client and Gaming segment, and particularly our Client business, just performed very well in the first half of the year, I think if you look at the entire first half, it was up 68% year-over-year. I think if you look underneath that, what we’re seeing is strength in every part of our Client business. So we saw very strong sales in our desktop channel area. We have a leadership product there, best gaming GPUs with our X3D GPUs. We’ve had strong rise in AI adoption as well in the first half of the year, we see that in sell-through. And in addition, we’ve had strong enterprise sell-through as we brought that forward.

So to your question of how much is pull-forward, we don’t think a whole lot of that is. We actually — when we look at the sell-through patterns, the end user consumption is actually quite strong for client in terms of going into the second half of the year. As we said in our Q3 guide, the primary driver of our Q3 guide is a very strong data center driven by MI350 ramping. We are expecting some growth in the Client business, so I wouldn’t say it’ll be flat to the first half, but it won’t be — we’re planning for it to be a little bit less than seasonal, just given some of the uncertainties out there. But the Client business is performing extremely well for us. We believe we are gaining share in all the right places. So if you look at the numbers in the first quarter, and it’ll show through in the second quarter as well, a lot of the uplift in revenue is in ASPs. And that is basically, we’re selling up the stack on the strength of our portfolio.

And I think we’re still quite underrepresented in the enterprise portion of the business. That is where we have increased our go-to-market resources and focus. And we’re seeing nice traction there, especially with the portfolios that we have from HP and Lenovo in enterprise PCs. And now we’re adding Dell as well as it’s ramping here, started in the second quarter, we’ll ramp more in the second half of the year. So I think all of those are tailwinds for our Client business, beyond the second half of ’25, but really, into the next number of quarters, as we think about the portfolio and the opportunities for us.

Thomas O’Malley

Super helpful. And then secondly, I was hopeful you could provide us a little more color on China. So the guide doesn’t include MI308. But perhaps you could comment on when you get approval if the supply chain is ready, what’s currently in inventory, and maybe compare what you think the contribution will look like versus the $700 million in Q2 and the $800 million for the second half you spoke about in April?

Lisa Su

Sure, Tom. So, yeah, let me answer some of the questions on China. I’m sure that there are some questions. Look, we’re very pleased with the progress that’s been made with the administration over the last couple of months. We’ve been working very closely with the administration. I think the focus here on ensuring that US technology gets utilized throughout the world is something that we certainly support and very much want to contribute to. China is an important market for us. Given the timing of licenses, we have a number of licenses that are under review now. We are working with the Department of Commerce to get those reviewed. We do expect that once those licenses are approved, we will start MI308 shipments.

In terms of the supply chain, most of our inventory was not in finished goods, so it was work in process, and it will take us a couple of quarters to run through that. The exact timing of revenue and contribution will depend a bit on when those are — when the licenses are actually granted. But overall, I think this is a better position than we were 90 days ago. And we certainly view China as a market that we would like to service with MI308. And we’re working closely with the administration to do that.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question.

Vivek Arya

Thank you for taking my question. If we look into 2026, right, that’s when I think the Sovereign opportunity could get quite meaningful for AMD. What is the right way to size that? What does this JV structure mean with some of the contracts that you have signed? And would you consider this incremental to the kind of growth rate that you’re seeing with your current MI business, or would this be instead of? So just if you could give us a way to size, what is that incremental opportunity from a Sovereign customers when it comes to ’26, Lisa? Is it dependent on MI400, right? In which case, it might be more backup dated, etc. So just some ways to think about Sovereign for AMD next year.

Lisa Su

Yeah, absolutely, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So look, we’re really excited about the overall AI opportunity for us with MI355 and the MI400 series as we go through the back half of this year and into 2026. I think it’s — there’s a very large opportunity with, let’s call it hyperscalers, some of the leading AI companies, as well as Sovereign. I think Sovereign is additive to that, for sure. From the standpoint of what to expect, there are also some regulatory things that need to be worked through on the Sovereign side. But again, we’re working closely with the administration as they go through the various regulatory decisions that need to be made.

But from my perspective, I think the fact that countries want their own Sovereign computing capability is very, very clear. I think we see that all over the world. The HUMAIN opportunity that you’re referring to that we announced with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I think is a great example of where together with their ambitions, our technology, I think you heard from Tareq that was — he was at our event saying that would start with MI355, that we would expect that that would continue on. I think what’s attractive about our offering is our open ecosystem. And I think that really resonates with the Sovereign community. But to your original question, I think it’s an additive opportunity, and it’s one that we believe will continue to be very important for us going forward with both MI355 as well as the MI400 series.

Vivek Arya

Got it. And for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about gross margins for your MI product. So I understand in the early days, right, it has been dilutive. What kind of sales level is required for it to start becoming additive to margins? And let’s say if I fast-forward to Q4 and assume that your Q4 sales are growing year-over-year roughly the same rate as Q3 sales, should we expect gross margins kind of to stay at these Q3 levels, or are there other plus/minus drivers we should think about in terms of gross margins as you go into Q4? Thank you.

Jean Hu

Yeah, Vivek, thank you for the question. The gross margin of our MI product, we said it’s a little bit below corporate average. I think at this point, our priority is really to address the large, fast-growing revenue opportunities we have and provide customers a better TCO to really expand our presence in the marketplace. I think the way to think about our gross margin, there are different dynamics, right, different customers, different generations. But also, our operations team has been continuing to really drive operational efficiency to improve our MI family’s gross margin. That has been ongoing. So it’s not necessarily really tied to, okay, the revenue level each quarter, but you should think about it as a trend in the longer term. It should improve continually going forward.

Overall, the way I think about it is gross margin dollars, right, this is one of the fastest-growing market opportunities. For any financial metrics, gross margin dollars is what we try to grab as much as we can. Hopefully, that helped your question.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.

Timothy Arcuri

Thanks a lot. Lisa, so my question is on data center GPU. You did say that June is up year-over-year. So it sounds like it’s maybe a little more than $1 billion. And you use words like “strong ramp” into the back half of the year. Can you give us just any color on what that means? Can you get to, say, $7 billion for the year? And can you give us some maybe milepost on what you’re assuming for Q3? That would be great.

Lisa Su

Yeah, thanks, Tim, for the question. I think what we said in the prepared remarks is that, we are seeing a strong ramp from Q2 into Q3. MI355, we actually started production in June, so we had some shipments in sort of in the month of June, but it really is ramping as we go through this quarter in the third quarter. So in terms of guideposts, we said it would grow year-on-year from last year. And that I think is a strong ramp. And then we would expect it to grow into the fourth quarter as well.

The demand, I should say, what we’re seeing from customers is, I think really positive around MI355. Sort of the way I would contrast it with maybe the MI300 ramp, I think MI300 started with perhaps some smaller deployments. I think what we’re seeing with MI355 is very competitive versus the B200, GB200 family of products. I think there’s a strong desire to really use us at scale. MI355 is very strong for inferencing. We’re also working with a number of customers on training. And this is also an opportunity for us to build into the MI400 series as we go into 2026. So we’re bullish on MI355 and where the AI opportunity is for us. And I think we’re right on track to what we expected to be as we were going through the development of the roadmap.

Timothy Arcuri

Thanks a lot. And then, Lisa, just on that point, also, you did talk about a new Developer Cloud. So, obviously, you’re beginning to lease back some of the capacity that you’re selling into the clouds and the NIO clouds. Is that going to be a material portion of the revenue you’re going to recognize for MI355 in the back half of the year? Can you just talk about that and maybe how to think about how much demand that’s going to stimulate and what the ultimate goal is for that cloud? Thanks.

Lisa Su

Yeah. So there are a couple of things in that question. So let me answer. So the Developer Cloud is simply we want to make it super easy for developers to get on AMD Instinct GPUs. One could say — again, if we look back at the MI300 family, we were very focused on the largest hyperscalers and the largest customers. But there’s a lot of interest in our GPUs across a number of customers who just wanted easier access. So by ensuring that Developer Cloud is there, that it has, ready-to-deploy containers, you can run training and inference easily, you don’t necessarily have to make longer-term commitments, I think that’s the purpose of the Developer Cloud.

I don’t think it adds meaningfully to revenue in the second half of the year, but it certainly adds to customers getting experience with AMD. I think the larger revenue opportunities for us are really with large customer adoption as they ramp to larger deployments. And we’re very actively trying to get those deployments up and running as soon as possible.

One of the things, just as a reminder, that the MI355 is — given that it’s a similar infrastructure to MI300, we actually think it’s going to ramp very quickly and very well for customers. And I think that’s one of the attractive portions of it as well.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.

Ross Seymore

Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Lisa, I want to go back to the Instinct side of things, and the MI355 ramp. Looks like the second half is going to ramp really significantly. You said it’s going to be up year-over-year in the third quarter. I believe a quarter ago, you said roughly the same thing in the MI308 is out of both numbers. So that shouldn’t really matter and I guess it would be upside. But I just wondered how have things changed from a quarter ago as far as the MI350 family adoption, especially because you launched a little bit early? Is the growth a little bit more than you would have expected a quarter ago, about the same, or a little worse? Just any sort of color on that would be helpful.

Lisa Su

Yeah, Ross, thanks for the question. I think the main thing I would say is, I think the adoption is a bit faster than we might have expected. Again, whenever you launch a product, we want to make sure that we go through the full validation and all of that with our customers. I think there’s a lot of interest, broad-based interest in MI355. And so, I feel like over the last 90 days, I think we’ve had significant sort of new customer interest and that’s certainly positive.

I will say —

Ross Seymore

I guess —

Lisa Su

Oh, I’m sorry, Ross, I was just going to add, the — our engagements are — I think the other piece is, I think there’s also a lot of excitement around MI400 and what we can do with the Helios rack. And so, there are a number of customers who, based on the strong roadmap that we’re showing, want to get familiar and really work with us earlier in the life cycle, which, I think is again, positive.

Ross Seymore

Great. Thank you for that. I guess is my follow-up, an earlier question you talked about a little bit below seasonality in the second half of the year for your Client business. It seems like there’s just — I don’t even know if seasonality is a framework that matters. But how are you thinking about that for the second half as a whole for Client? And then Gaming, it was just up a huge amount sequentially. In the second quarter, you described a little bit of what you’re expecting there. But how do you think about seasonality for the second half in its entirety in the Gaming side as well?

Lisa Su

Yeah. Let me try, and then Jean might add if you want a little bit more color. So the way to think about it is, we do expect some growth — sequential growth in client as we go into the third quarter. I would say, single-digit-type growth. We continue to see good traction for our products in that portfolio. On the Gaming side, I would call it flattish to Q2. And we’re coming off of such a strong Q2 that I think flattish is actually to be expected.

As we go into the fourth quarter, the dynamics that we would see is, we would see that the console business would actually be down substantially. So think about it as down strong double digits. The customers usually build for the holiday season, sort of before that and then that will be completed by the fourth quarter. So we would expect as the Client and Gaming segment that the segment would probably be down in the fourth quarter.

So hopefully, that helps. Jean, did you want to add to that?

Jean Hu

No, I think you covered it.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.

Joshua Buchalter

Hey, guys, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about lead times on your — on the Instinct family, both for the MI350 family and MI400. As you move into larger cluster sizes, which it sounds like you’re doing at least with Oracle on 350, and then endeavor to do more so on 400, how much visibility and lead time do you need from your customers? Because I would imagine the lead time for your parts is measured in months. But on the infrastructure side, in particular for the larger-scale deployments, those things are measured in years at this point. So maybe you could speak to the visibility specifically on the 400. Thank you.

Lisa Su

Yes, sure, Josh. So, yes, I mean, our lead times are long, given all of the processing steps that we have to go through. Think about it as somewhere between eight, nine months, that type of thing. We have a very, very strong supply chain. We’ve been preparing for these ramps of both MI350 series and MI400 series and that preparation is ongoing. So we feel like we have a very strong supply chain there.

In terms of visibility with customers, we’re absolutely working with customers very closely on near-term MI350 series deployments, getting those deployments up as quickly as possible. Again, one of the things about the MI350 series that is good is that, it can go into existing data centers, given the — just given the platform that is — that it is in. So we have been certainly working with our customers there.

And then for the MI400 series, there are lots and lots of details in sort of full rack scale design implementation and we’re actively working with the largest customers right now on just ensuring that our Helios rack is fully compatible with their data center build out as we go into 2026. So that visibility is important. I think that co-development, co-engineering is important as we get into the rack scale architecture. And the ZT team that we’ve brought in has been extremely, extremely helpful in terms of both internal platform build out, as well as ensuring that we’re working closely with our customers on their data center needs.

Joshua Buchalter

Thank you for that, Lisa. And maybe for Jean, I wanted to follow up on Vivek’s question earlier on gross margins. So if we add back the charges in 2Q and then your gross margin implied in the guidance is roughly flat sequentially, and that’s despite what’s implied to be data center GPUs up meaningfully, sequentially. It doesn’t seem like consoles falling off in the third quarter. I mean, can you maybe talk to the underlying drivers of how you’re able to keep the flat gross margins despite what sounds like still margin-dilutive data center GPUs up significantly within the mix? Thank you.

Jean Hu

Yeah, Josh, thanks for the question. Yeah, we are guiding our Q3 gross margin around the 54% and Q2, you’re right, excluding the $800 million charge. It was close to 54%. I think the Gaming business actually is quite high. So the mix actually is unfavorable. But we do have some tailwinds we have been really driving. First is, we have been expanding our server business, which has really nice gross margin. And on the Client business side, we are expanding the commercial PC business. That really helps us to drive the gross margin up. In addition, we do have a really strong operational team. They are driving the gross margin improvement just from an operational efficiency perspective across the board. So overall, our objective is to continue to improve gross margin despite MI350 very strong ramp in Q3, we are able to continue to drive the margin up.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

Joseph Moore

Great. Thank you. You used this language before of the kind of tens of billions opportunity around MI400. Can you talk about the time frame when that might occur, and not to pin you down too much, and what would help you get to that level sooner rather than later? Should we think of that 2027 realistic outcome that you could be looking at $20 billion-plus? Just a little bit more color on that tens of billions comment.

Lisa Su

Yeah. Maybe without being specific, Joe, I can give you sort of the way I look at it and back to this notion of, are we incrementally more confident? I think we’re seeing a lot of positive signs in our AI customer adoption. I think the strength of the MI350 series, the very positive feedback that we’re getting on MI400 from customers, the work that we’re doing in terms of ensuring that we are fully ready for large-scale deployments of not just inference but training. I think when we get to tens of billions of dollars, we’re talking about significant gigawatt-scale type deployments. And those would be important for us to get there. And we’re certainly, I think, engaged with all the right customers that can enable that type of ramp. But I won’t necessarily speculate on the exact time other than to say certainly, that would be our set of aspirations.

Joseph Moore

Great, that’s helpful. Thank you. And then, as these workloads evolve, I mean, you’ve sort of talked about inference and training as different opportunities for AMD. Are you seeing those start to come together? It seems like with inference, there’s — the reasoning models are requiring much higher complexity. Is rack scale more important to the inference market than you thought it might be? Just any color around how that complexity of inference is impacting you guys.

Lisa Su

Yeah, I think that’s absolutely true, Joe. I think with the proliferation of models, I think what we’re seeing is, GPUs continue to be very — sort of the computing of choice as you think about all the models that are out there. And then as you go into distributed inference and some of the newer techniques, we are seeing the importance of the scale-up and scale-out architecture, which we are investing in. But I think the overarching thing is, I think we have a very competitive roadmap across the next couple of generations. I think that has now gotten strong customer validation. We’re getting a lot of feedback from customers on where they would like to see us continue to add more resources and add more focus. And so, that is very helpful. And the key is to be a full-scale solution provider for these large customer deployments and that’s what we’re working on.

And the next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.

Aaron Rakers

Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I do have a follow-up as well. I guess the first question is, when we look at the data center guide, Jean, you alluded to double-digit sequential growth. Obviously, the MI355 series kind of ramping, I’m curious, how could we conceptualize what you’re expecting in the server side, and where do you think your market share is today in traditional enterprise servers outside of cloud?

Jean Hu

Yeah, I think when you look at our Data Center business, we do have a strong double-digit growth. Both server and the MI, both sides are growing sequentially. Of course, MI ramp is the most significant one. As far as server market share, we do think we continue to drive the market share up compared to Q1. Third-party has not published report yet, but we feel really good about the Q2 market share increase versus Q1.

Lisa Su

And Aaron, if I just add to that, one of the things that — it’s important for people to understand is, in some of the cloud capex numbers that have come out that have been quite positive, that is not only a GPU statement, but there’s actually significant CPU capex in there as well. We’ve started to see more robust forecasts going out a number of quarters on the server CPU side, because all of that AI content really requires traditional CPUs as well. And so, we’re very bullish on the opportunity in servers. I think the team has really executed extremely well. I mean, if you look at our portfolio now, Turin Genoa, our very well-adopted broadening workloads. Enterprise adoption is also increasing. And so, I think all of those are positive for the server opportunity in the second half of ’25, as well as going into ’26 and beyond.

Aaron Rakers

Yeah. And then as a follow-up, I’m kind of thinking about the China, the MI308 opportunity. When we do see a license, I think you alluded to this earlier, it’s going to take a little bit of time to ramp and get the supply chain to satisfy the demand. But I’m curious, the $800 million write-down that you had taken, is there no kind of finished inventory there? Does that come back? Do you have any reversal aspects of that once a license gets approved?

Jean Hu

Let me start first, then Lisa can add. The first on the $800 million, majority of them are WIPs. We really don’t have on-the-shelf finished good we can ship immediately. So we do need to take time if we get a license.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.

CJ Muse

Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Lisa, I was hoping you could level-set us on the Instinct ramp into 2026. How are you thinking about the timing of the handoff 350 to 400? How are you thinking about Helios contributions? And I guess very importantly, from a customer contribution perspective, how you might see that evolve from traditional hyperscalers to perhaps more Sovereign and NIO cloud within the mix?

Lisa Su

Sure, CJ. So certainly, as second half this year, it’s all about MI355 ramp into first half of next year, I think the MI400 series development is right on track. The development of the Helios platform is also right on track. We would expect significant revenue contribution from Helios in 2026. And then relative to the contribution of the various things, hyperscalers, sort of some of the — versus NIO clouds versus Sovereign, I think it’s a little early to really talk about the different pieces other than to say, you would expect that hyperscalers and let’s call it NIO clouds that would be working for other large AI natives, maybe significant pieces of the initial ramp. And then Sovereign may come a little bit later in time, just given sort of the timing of when different build-outs would happen. So hopefully, that gives you some color, CJ.

CJ Muse

Yeah, very helpful. And then, Jean, I guess a question for you, with the sale of ZT for $3 million in cash and stock, and you only have $3 billion of debt outstanding, how are you thinking about the use of proceeds? Is there saving for a rainy day or bolt-on acquisitions, perhaps more aggressive share buyback? How are you thinking about it today?

Jean Hu

Yeah, thanks for the question. Our business model actually generates a lot of free cash flow. As you see in Q2, free cash flow generation was $1.2 billion. So if we close the ZT sale, and we’ll get more cash, overall, our capital allocation principle continues to be the first phase investing, especially with the tremendous AI opportunities ahead of us. And then we will continue to return cash to shareholders. We did a $1.2 billion repurchase in the first half of the year. We are committed to continue to return cash to shareholders through share repurchase.

Matthew Ramsay

Operator, I think we have time for one more caller, please.

Operator

Okay. The final question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.

Ben Reitzes

Hey, thanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to clarify a little bit on the $1 billion increase in sequential sales. It would seem like it’s coming from GPUs, primarily. I was wondering if you could back that. And that’s with nothing in China. And if the answer to the prior question that GPUs are over $1 billion, that kind of puts you at a $2 billion run rate. And I was just wondering if that was accurate in terms of thinking. And then I have just a very quick follow-up. Thanks.

Jean Hu

Hi, Ben, thanks for the question. If you look at the sequential revenue increase, as I mentioned during the prepared remarks, we see data center strong double-digit increase, which includes both GPU and CPU. But GPU definitely drives the largest incremental amount increase. We also mentioned the client actually is going to increase sequentially. In addition, the Embedded business will return to sequential growth. So multiple businesses contributed to sequential increase, but the majority of increase really driven by MI355′ strong ramp.

Ben Reitzes

Okay. Great. And then if indeed that gets you pretty close to a couple billion dollars, if the MI300 comes in, do you see it at the same run rate that you exited and then you have the ability to get at that $800 million run rate right away or do you think it’ll take several quarters to ramp when you get the license? Thanks.

Lisa Su

Yeah, Ben, it will take some time to ramp, just given — particularly, today, I mean, we’re sitting already in early August, so I don’t think you would see a lot of it in Q3. But certainly, as licenses would be approved, we would schedule that, and it would take a little while to ramp.

Matthew Ramsay

All right, operator. Thank you very much. We appreciate everybody that joined the call today. And we just like to end the call now. Thank you.

Riyadh Air launches cargo brand

Riyadh Air, Saudi Arabia’s new national carrier, has launched its cargo operations under the brand name Riyadh Cargo, marking its formal entry into the global air cargo market and the activation of belly-hold cargo services across its wide-body fleet.

Riyadh Cargo will leverage the substantial capacity available on Riyadh Air’s orderbook of more than 120 wide-body aircraft to move goods efficiently and reliably, strengthening connectivity between global markets. The cargo operation is being developed through a deliberate, phased strategy designed to build a scalable and fully integrated business anchored at the airline’s Riyadh hub. Growth will be aligned closely with network expansion and the airline’s increasing operational maturity.

The cargo division has already begun operations as part of the carrier’s wider ‘Pathway to Perfect’ process and has demonstrated early operational momentum on the Riyadh–London Heathrow route. During this initial phase, Riyadh Cargo has successfully transported significant volumes across a diverse range of commodities, including garments and textiles, fresh flowers, seafood, tea and coffee. These early movements highlight the operation’s ability to manage time-sensitive, perishable and high-value shipments with consistency and reliability.

Pravin Singh, Global Head of Cargo at Riyadh Air, said the cargo business has been designed with a long-term vision from the outset. “Riyadh Cargo has been built with a clear focus on operational discipline, reliability, and long-term scalability,” he said. “Launching within a live environment allows us to test, learn, and continuously refine how we operate, while delivering real value to our customers from the get-go. The launch of the brand is a foundational step in building a cargo business that grows alongside our network expansion and supports Saudi Arabia’s broader logistics ambitions.”

Walmart Keeps in Control

Walmart will cut its stake in PhonePe by about 12% to around 60%. Other stakeholders, Tiger Global and tech titan Microsoft (MSFT), plan to exit their stakes.

Walmart, which holds an about 72% stake in PhonePe, is selling nearly 46 million shares in the IPO. The three firms will together sell around 50.7 million shares in the offering. PhonePe will not issue any new shares in the IPO and will not receive proceeds from the sale. It aims to list by mid-2026, according to a Reuters report.

The company, founded in 2015, is the leading payments platform on India’s popular unified payments interface (UPI), commanding more than 45% market share by transaction volume, as of December 2025.

However, PhonePe’s loss widened to 14.44 billion rupees ($157.80 million) in the six-month period ended September 30, from 12.03 billion rupees a year ago, while revenue rose about 22% to 39.18 billion rupees, the filing showed.

Its main competitors in India are Google (GOOGL) Pay and Paytm.

Crucial Expansion Plans

PhonePe has more than 657 million registered users and offers payment solutions to over 47 million merchants.

PhonePe had been part of Flipkart, an India-based e-commerce group that is also majority-owned by Walmart. Both have been a crucial part of Walmart’s international expansion plans in the world’s most populous country.

PhonePe’s IPO plan comes amid buoyant Indian primary markets, where fundraising hit a record high in 2025. India ranked as the world’s second-largest primary market in 2025 after the United States, with 367 IPOs raising $21.8 billion, according to LSEG-compiled data.

NEW YORK (AP) — Skydance-owned Paramount is again extending the tender offer window in its $77.9 billion hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, while doubling down on a coming proxy fight.

Warner stockholders now have until Feb. 20 to sell their shares to Paramount for $30 apiece in cash — a price that remains unchanged, giving the offer a total enterprise value of over $108 billion including debt. It marks the second extension the company has made since challenging Warner’s merger agreement with Netflix last month.

As of late Wednesday, Paramount said that more than 168.5 million Warner shares had been tendered in support of its offer. But that’s still far below the 50% mark it would need to effectively gain control of Warner — which has about 2.48 billion shares outstanding in series A common stock today.

“Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix,” Warner said in an emailed statement Thursday — adding that it’s “clear our shareholders agree,” as more than 93% have so far rejected “Paramount’s inferior scheme.”

In December, Netflix agreed to buy Warner’s studio and streaming business for $72 billion — now in an all-cash deal that the companies say is more straight forward and will speed up the path to a shareholder vote by April. Including debt, the enterprise value of the deal is about $83 billion, or $27.75 per share.

But Paramount argues its offer is better than Netflix’s and has accused Warner leadership of not being transparent with stockholders. On Thursday, the company claimed Warner’s board was “rushing to solicit shareholder approval” for the Netflix merger, which it said could lead to a lower payout for shareholders if debt spanning from a previously-announced spinoff of Warner’s networks business makes its way to studio and streaming operations.

In an escalation of its hostile bid, Paramount is also moving forward with a proxy fight. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to nominate its own slate of directors to Warner’s board before the next shareholder meeting. And on Thursday, Paramount filed preliminary materials to solicit proxies in opposition to the Netflix merger.

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things. Netflix’s proposed acquisition includes only Warner’s studio and streaming business, including its legacy TV and movie production arms and platforms like HBO Max. But Paramount’s bid is for the entire company — which, beyond studio and streaming, includes its news and cable operations. That would put CNN under the same roof as CBS.

If Netflix is successful, Warner’s current networks would be spun off into their own company called Discovery Global, under a previously-announced separation.

Regardless of who wins the upper hand, a Warner Bros. Discovery sale could be a long, drawn-out process — likely attracting tremendous antitrust scrutiny. Politics are expected to come into play under President Donald Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement on whether a deal will go through.

Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery and Netflix both fell slightly Thursday. Shares of Paramount-Skydance rose nearly 3%.",https://www.pottsmerc.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Warner_Bros_11300.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2026-01-22 16:42:02.929145

Wired and The Wall Street Journal earlier reported some details of the exits of Mr. Zoph, Mr. Metz and Mr. Schoenholz from Thinking Machines.
Thinking Machines amassed $2 billion from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, the chip makers Nvidia and AMD, and others.
In the ensuing months, Thinking Machines struggled to raise new funding, for which it was seeking a valuation of $50 billion.","On Jan. 12, Mira Murati, the chief executive and co-founder of the artificial intelligence start-up Thinking Machines Lab, was asked by Sam Schoenholz, a leading researcher at the company, to join a meeting.

Ms. Murati sat down with Mr. Schoenholz and two other founders, Barret Zoph and Luke Metz. All four had worked together at OpenAI, the ChatGPT maker, where Ms. Murati had been the chief technology officer, before the creation of Thinking Machines in February.

But in less than a year, Mr. Zoph, Mr. Metz and Mr. Schoenholz had become deeply unhappy with the start-up’s direction. Thinking Machines lagged OpenAI and other rivals in releasing products, and was struggling to raise new funding at an eye-popping $50 billion valuation. The men had urged Ms. Murati to strike a deal — Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, had discussed buying Thinking Machines, and Ms. Murati had developed closer ties with the chief executive of Anthropic, a leading A.I. company — but no transaction had resulted.

At the meeting, the men lobbied for Mr. Zoph, Thinking Machines’ chief technology officer, to oversee decisions about the company’s technical direction. They threatened to leave if changes were not made, four people with knowledge of the discussion said.

Ms. Murati balked. She told Mr. Zoph that he was already the chief technology officer and should just do his job.

Two days later, Ms. Murati, 37, fired Mr. Zoph, 32, who had been talking behind her back since October with OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, about returning to the company. OpenAI immediately rehired Mr. Zoph, along with Mr. Metz and Mr. Schoenholz.

Another nine or so of Thinking Machines’ roughly 100 employees have decamped to OpenAI or have received offers to join the company, three people with knowledge of the situation said. Meta has also made offers worth hundreds of millions of dollars to some of the start-up’s employees, two people said.

The defections have set off furious mudslinging, as each side has cranked up its spin machine to portray its version of the story. A relationship that Mr. Zoph had with a Thinking Machines employee became public, and Ms. Murati — who posted a public message about having “parted ways” with Mr. Zoph — has faced questions over her reasons for firing him and the state of the company.

The turmoil at Thinking Machines, one of the highest-profile A.I. start-ups, is the latest episode in the perpetual soap opera that is the artificial intelligence industry, where young billionaires clash over professional and personal relationships as they vie for money, power and supremacy in the field. Occasionally, the drama spills into public view, riveting Silicon Valley.

“I am reminded of this line from ‘Anna Karenina’: ‘All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,’” said Venky Ganesan, a partner at the investment firm Menlo Ventures. “Happy companies require many things to go right simultaneously. You only need one or two things to go wrong to have an unhappy company.""

Wired and The Wall Street Journal earlier reported some details of the exits of Mr. Zoph, Mr. Metz and Mr. Schoenholz from Thinking Machines.

The A.I. industry, a relatively small world of technology specialists and wealthy executives and investors, has long dealt with internecine feuds. Elon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, clashed with Mr. Altman over the company’s direction in 2018 and left. Mr. Musk has since sued Mr. Altman and OpenAI, accusing them of breaching the company’s founding contract by putting commercial interests ahead of the public good.

(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims.)

In 2023, several OpenAI board members ousted Mr. Altman, saying they did not trust him to build A.I. for the benefit of humanity. Ms. Murati played a part in Mr. Altman’s firing and briefly took over as OpenAI’s chief executive.

Her timing was fortuitous. The A.I. industry was booming, and Ms. Murati had the name recognition in tech circles to gather funding for a new venture. Thinking Machines amassed $2 billion from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, the chip makers Nvidia and AMD, and others.

The financing, announced in July, valued Thinking Machines at $12 billion, though it had not released a product and Ms. Murati was tight-lipped about what the start-up would produce. In a social media post at the time, she said the start-up “exists to empower humanity.”

The company opened an office in San Francisco’s Mission District, a few blocks from OpenAI’s headquarters, and spared no expense on interior decorating. The in-house gym included “squat racks” for weight lifting, with iron barbells branded with “Thinking Machines” in bold white typeface.

Last summer, Mr. Zoph approached Ms. Murati about his relationship with a colleague who was not an A.I. researcher and who eventually left the company, three people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Zoph continued in his role.

Around then, Meta executives reached out to Ms. Murati about potentially buying Thinking Machines, five people with knowledge of the conversations said. Mr. Zoph wanted to sell, but Ms. Murati preferred to remain independent and viewed the discussions with Meta as not serious.

In October, Thinking Machines released a product that helps developers adjust A.I. models to better perform specific tasks. Offered to businesses and software developers over the internet, the product was similar to technologies from Google, Amazon and Microsoft.

Mr. Tulloch also pushed Ms. Murati to sell Thinking Machines, two people familiar with the matter said. No deal materialized, and he left for Meta, which was heavily recruiting A.I. talent. The talks between Meta and Thinking Machines were reported earlier by The Verge.

In the ensuing months, Thinking Machines struggled to raise new funding, for which it was seeking a valuation of $50 billion. Some of its investors have privately worried about whether the start-up has a path forward as an independent company, two people familiar with the discussions said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/20/multimedia/THINKING-MACHINES-OPENAI-zfjv/THINKING-MACHINES-OPENAI-zfjv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 13:42:25.162954

Yes, that means CPUs. The last time Nvidia tried its hand at non-graphics PC processors, it ended in a lasting failure. Times have changed, and now it’s ripe for Nvidia to once again enter the market for all-in Team Green machines. It could mark the moment when ARM-based PCs really take off, if only the ongoing RAM crisis wasn’t making this one of the worst moments for PCs in general.

Sure, Nvidia didn’t have much to say at CES 2026; however, a report from Digitimes (read via machine translation) claims that the company could have a notebook-ready chip early this year. This would be an ARM-based chip potentially akin to the Grace Blackwell SoC (system on a chip) found inside Nvidia’s DGX Spark AI-centric computers. Tom’s Hardware reported last week the same chip appeared in a shipping manifest for a sample Dell 16 Premium laptop.

This supposed “N1X” chip could be followed by several differently spec’ed CPUs later in the year. If Digitimes’ supply chain sources are correct, we could even hear about a supposed “N2” chip as a follow-up before the end of 2026. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang previously hinted at the N1 last year in a press conference with Intel’s new chief, Lip-Bu Tan. That’s where Nvidia promised to craft chips with Intel that would somehow combine the best of both companies. We’ll have to see how well that partnership goes if both chipmakers are actively competing with each other.

There’s a mountain of competition for Nvidia

Nvidia will be late to the party no matter what it does. Qualcomm, the other big ARM-based chipmaker for lightweight laptops, already has its Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme chip promising huge gains in graphics capability. Qualcomm also shared details on its Snapdragon X2 Plus chip at CES 2026. Nvidia’s only consumer-end announcements were tied to DLSS upscaler updates, more multi-frame gen for games, and computer vision technology for autonomous vehicles.

The N1X could still be a powerful chip, though with all the delays, Nvidia may be better off waiting to showcase a more powerful N2 chip if it wants to compete with Intel’s Core Ultra Series 3 laptop chips or whatever gamer-specific APU (accelerated processing unit) AMD has been cooking up. Of course, we’d be interested in a laptop that has RTX 50-series Blackwell capabilities without the need for a power-sucking discrete GPU.

Microsoft promises all ARM-based PCs will be good for gaming

On Wednesday, Microsoft declared that it was making its Xbox app work natively on “all” ARM-based PCs. That’s interesting rhetoric considering how much of its messaging previously centered on “Snapdragon on PCs” or “Copilot+.” Xbox now claims that 85% of Xbox apps are compatible on ARM, though that’s mostly thanks to improvements to the Windows Prism emulator. Prism can take x86 native apps and help them run by recreating that separate CPU microarchitecture as software. In a recent update, Microsoft added support for AVX and AVX2 extensions to the x86 instruction set. These are especially important for games that rely on AVX for tasks like video encoders and physics engines.

Microsoft is also advertising that ARM-based PCs will share compatibility with Epic Anti-Cheat. Lack of EAC support is why some of these computers and other Linux-based systems like Valve’s Steam Deck struggle to run games like the ever-popular Fortnite. We’re two years into Microsoft’s big ARM-based PC push, and Qualcomm is adamant it no longer needs to talk about compatibility issues. The chipmaker launched a Qualcomm Control Panel app last year that’s supposed to act as a launcher for various games and programs, ensuring they work natively or on emulators when necessary.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/nVidia-GeForce-5080-11-e1740161107263-1200x675.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 13:00:08.210261

Lines, also known as MOL, one of Japan’s biggest shipping companies, announced its first carbon removal results under its long-term environmental plan. This move marks a real step beyond reducing emissions. MOL aims to reach net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 under its Environmental Vision 2.2.

Shipping emissions are hard to cut, so removal methods help tackle the remaining CO₂. MOL’s actions also reflect the global growth of the carbon removal market. Companies and countries are investing more in solutions that take CO₂ out of the air for long-term storage. This trend is rising as climate targets push industries to go beyond emission cuts.

DAC, Ocean Capture & Rocks: A Trio of MOL’s First Carbon Removal

In fiscal 2024, MOL announced its first verified carbon removal achievements. This progress builds on its Environmental Vision 2.2 strategy. The shipping giant secured measurable removal commitments using several technologies.

In its LinkedIn post, the company notes:

“In FY2024, MOL reported credits equivalent to 2,000 tons of CO₂ emissions- marking the company’s first tangible achievement in CDR… As MOL continues to diversify its CDR portfolio, it remains committed to finding and scaling the most effective solutions- both natural and technological- to advance toward a decarbonized future.”

MOL partnered with Climeworks, a leading Direct Air Capture (DAC) company. Through this partnership, the company agreed to procure 13,400 tonnes of CO₂ removal by 2030 using Climeworks’ DAC systems.

MOL is the first shipping company globally to set up this type of DAC purchase. DAC pulls CO₂ directly from the air and stores it permanently.

MOL also signed an offtake agreement for 30,000 tonnes of carbon removal credits from Captura’s Direct Ocean Capture technology. This method removes CO₂ from seawater, which draws CO₂ from the air over time.

In addition, MOL made a deal with Alt Carbon for 10,000 tonnes of carbon removal credits. These credits come from enhanced rock weathering in India. Enhanced weathering helps pull CO₂ from the air into minerals in soil, a type of removal considered higher quality and more durable. This deal is the first of its kind between a Japanese shipping company and an Indian climate tech firm.

MOL is also buying enhanced rock weathering removal credits through another multiyear offtake. This brings added diversity to its removal portfolio. These deals help the company support different removal paths rather than relying on a single method.

Why Shipping Needs Removals

The global shipping industry carries about 90% of traded goods by volume. It also produces roughly 3% of global CO₂ emissions. If trade grows, emissions could rise unless action is taken.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) aims for shipping emissions to drop. The targets are: 20-30% reduction by 2030, 70-80% by 2040, and net-zero by 2050, all compared to 2008 levels.

Even with cleaner fuels like ammonia or hydrogen, some emissions will remain hard to avoid. Energy efficiency and fuel switches help, but they cannot remove all CO₂ from long ocean voyages. Carbon removal fills this gap. It helps shipping companies offset their leftover emissions while future fuel solutions scale up.

RELATED: Shipping Toward Net Zero: Maritime Turns to Green Hydrogen and Ammonia

MOL’s Environmental Vision 2.2 plan aims to remove 2.2 million tonnes of CO₂ by 2030. This goal covers all its removal initiatives. This creates demand for early‑stage removal solutions and helps scale emerging technologies.

Partnerships on the Horizon: Forests, Carbon Credits, and Cross-Industry Moves

MOL’s carbon removal work includes broader moves with partners and industry players. The company is supporting carbon credits to cut emissions and expand negative emissions. All credits are third-party certified and independently verified to ensure quality and impact.

In January 2025, MOL and Marubeni Corporation started Marubeni MOL Forests Co. This joint venture will create, trade, and retire nature‑based carbon credits. Its first project aims to plant around 10,000 hectares of new forest in India. This will generate credits from afforestation and reforestation. These forests will start producing removals around 2028. Nature‑based solutions help store carbon while boosting biodiversity and soil quality.

Also, MOL signed a deal with ITOCHU Corporation. This agreement aims to promote environmental attribute certificates. These certificates help cut Scope 3 emissions in transportation. This work is the first Japanese model linking shipping and aviation in environmental certificate use. Scope 3 emissions come from supply chains and end‑use.

Another related program is the NX‑GREEN Ocean Program by Nippon Express, launched in February 2025. It uses carbon inset certificates tied to low‑carbon shipping by MOL vessels. These certificates help companies reduce their Scope 3 freight emissions. The program shows how removal and decarbonization can work together for supply chains.

Together, these partnerships show MOL’s expanding role. The company is connecting technical and natural removal solutions with marine decarbonization and cross‑industry climate efforts.

Riding the Carbon Market Wave

The global carbon removal market is growing fast. Corporations and governments are investing more in long-lasting removal methods. These include DAC, ocean capture, enhanced weathering, and nature-based solutions. This growth matches scientific calls for big removals to keep warming under 1.5°C.

MOL is helping to expand the removal market by investing in multiple technologies. A joint venture for a NextGen CDR Facility, including MOL and other buyers, aims for over 1 million tonnes of certified removals by 2025. These projects include DAC and biomass removal with long-term storage. Early demand helps drive down costs over time and encourages more technological development.

Shipping companies are also investing in emission reduction technologies. These include more efficient ship designs, alternative fuels, and onboard carbon capture systems.

Global shipping firms continue to align with the IMO’s decarbonization goals through technology upgrades, fuel changes, and climate partnerships. This includes work on hull design, logistics efficiency, and fuel alternatives such as ammonia and hydrogen. Those efforts reduce emissions intensity and support long-term climate targets.

Challenges Ahead: Cost, Permanence, and MRV

Despite progress, carbon removal faces challenges.

High Costs and Early Stage Technology: Direct Air Capture and ocean capture remain expensive and are still early in deployment, making them less appealing than traditional emission reductions.

Need for Strong MRV and Certification: Measurement, Reporting, and Verification systems must stay robust to ensure credits reflect real and lasting CO₂ removal. Independent certification is critical for market trust.

Nature-Based Risks: Forest and land projects require careful planning. Carbon storage can be reversed if forests burn, degrade, or are mismanaged. High-quality MRV standards help protect long-term carbon value.

Sailing Toward 2050: MOL’s Vision for Net-Zero Maritime

Despite challenges, experts say removals will be necessary for sectors that cannot eliminate emissions by 2050. Shipping, aviation, and heavy industry will likely cut emissions and use durable removals to meet climate goals.

For MOL, investing in removal markets, partnerships, and strong MRV frameworks positions the company as a leader in maritime decarbonization. The first results under Environmental Vision 2.2 show how shipping firms can add new climate solutions to their sustainability plans.

By partnering with DAC, ocean capture, and enhanced weathering technologies, and by investing in nature-based solutions, MOL is expanding its climate action beyond traditional emission cuts.

As shipping and corporate climate planning evolve, carbon removal will remain a key part of long-term strategies. MOL’s progress with Environmental Vision 2.2 shows how companies can blend technology, nature, and market forces to achieve bold climate goals.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_1705906225.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 14:42:11.572861

Fortunately, I had saved partial copies of some conversations and materials, but large parts of my work were lost forever.
However, my case reveals a fundamental weakness: these tools were not developed with academic standards of reliability and accountability in mind.
If a single click can irrevocably delete years of work, ChatGPT cannot, in my opinion and on the basis of my experience, be considered completely safe for professional use.
OpenAI, in its responses to me, referred to ‘privacy by design’ — which means that everything is deleted without a trace when users deactivate data sharing.","Within a couple of years of ChatGPT coming out, I had come to rely on the artificial-intelligence tool, for my work as a professor of plant sciences at the University of Cologne in Germany. Having signed up for OpenAI’s subscription plan, ChatGPT Plus, I used it as an assistant every day — to write e-mails, draft course descriptions, structure grant applications, revise publications, prepare lectures, create exams and analyse student responses, and even as an interactive tool as part of my teaching.

It was fast and flexible, and I found it reliable in a specific sense: it was always available, remembered the context of ongoing conversations and allowed me to retrieve and refine previous drafts. I was well aware that large language models such as those that power ChatGPT can produce seemingly confident but sometimes incorrect statements, so I never equated its reliability with factual accuracy, but instead relied on the continuity and apparent stability of the workspace.

But in August, I temporarily disabled the ‘data consent’ option because I wanted to see whether I would still have access to all of the model’s functions if I did not provide OpenAI with my data. At that moment, all of my chats were permanently deleted and the project folders were emptied — two years of carefully structured academic work disappeared. No warning appeared. There was no undo option. Just a blank page. Fortunately, I had saved partial copies of some conversations and materials, but large parts of my work were lost forever.

At first, I thought it was a mistake. I tried different browsers, devices and networks. I cleared the cache, reinstalled the app and even changed the settings back and forth. Nothing helped.

When I contacted OpenAI’s support, the first responses came from an AI agent. Only after repeated enquiries did a human employee respond, but the answer remained the same: the data were permanently lost and could not be recovered.

Accountability gap

This was not a case of losing random notes or idle chats. Among my discussions with ChatGPT were project folders containing multiple conversations that I had used to develop grant applications, prepare teaching materials, refine publication drafts and design exam analyses. This was intellectual scaffolding that had been built up over a two-year period.

AI for research: the ultimate guide to choosing the right tool

We are increasingly being encouraged to integrate generative AI into research and teaching. Individuals use it for writing, planning and teaching; universities are experimenting with embedding it into curricula. However, my case reveals a fundamental weakness: these tools were not developed with academic standards of reliability and accountability in mind.

If a single click can irrevocably delete years of work, ChatGPT cannot, in my opinion and on the basis of my experience, be considered completely safe for professional use. As a paying subscriber (€20 per month, or US$23), I assumed basic protective measures would be in place, including a warning about irreversible deletion, a recovery option, albeit time-limited, and backups or redundancy.

OpenAI, in its responses to me, referred to ‘privacy by design’ — which means that everything is deleted without a trace when users deactivate data sharing. The company was clear: once deleted, chats cannot be recovered, and there is no redundancy or backup that would allow such a thing (see ‘No going back’). Ultimately, OpenAI fulfilled what they saw as a commitment to my privacy as a user by deleting my information the second I asked them to.",https://media.nature.com/lw1200/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04064-7/d41586-025-04064-7_51933892.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 16:41:58.773543

​Richard Glasson, currently global CEO of Hogarth, will oversee the new operation as CEO of WPP Production.
“Bringing all of WPP’s craft expertise together in WPP Production reinforces our position at the heart of WPP's integrated offering.
WPP Production will consolidate the group’s extensive and specialist production resources into a single global organisation, with all teams operating on one platform using WPP Open’s production technology and AI-powered workflows.
This is about delivering exceptional value and setting new benchmarks for the quality and scale of content production worldwide.” The transition to WPP Production will take effect on February 23rd 2026.","​WPP has launched WPP Production, a new global production platform that brings together Hogarth with production teams and capabilities from across the WPP network.

WPP said the new offering is designed to unify all creative producers into a single global organisation and combine production expertise with technology, including generative AI, virtual and hybrid production and data-driven workflows.

The move follows similar consolidation efforts by other holding companies, including Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, which operate as Publicis Production and Omnicom Production respectively.

​Richard Glasson, currently global CEO of Hogarth, will oversee the new operation as CEO of WPP Production. “This is a transformative moment for us and, more importantly, for our clients,” he said. “Bringing all of WPP’s craft expertise together in WPP Production reinforces our position at the heart of WPP's integrated offering. It allows us to activate the full collective power of WPP – its talent, creativity, technology and data – to redefine content creation. We are focused on delivering smarter, more innovative and world-class storytelling that drives business for our clients.”

WPP said the launch is built around four core areas: creating a “unified global team” of craft and production experts; integrating agency-based producers into a single global structure; investing in talent and technology to support “next-generation content origination”; and launching a “high-velocity content studio” that combines production and media capabilities, with a focus on performance and real-time optimisation.

WPP Production will consolidate the group’s extensive and specialist production resources into a single global organisation, with all teams operating on one platform using WPP Open’s production technology and AI-powered workflows. The company said this is intended to improve connectivity across markets and increase operational efficiency.

The group said the move establishes what it describes as the world’s largest creative production capability, comprising close to 10,000 people across more than 40 cities and designed to deliver large volumes of content across multiple channels and geographies.

The new offering reflects what WPP lays out as its broader strategy to provide more integrated and seamless services across creative, media and production, delivered through WPP Open. The company said this approach is intended to give clients access to a more connected ecosystem of creative, media and production expertise.

The company added that WPP Production will focus on the use of technologies including advanced AI, virtual production and sustainable production practices, with the aim of supporting next-generation content creation and premium content at scale.

WPP also said it will continue to invest in physical production infrastructure, building on the existing Hogarth Studios network and the recent development of a major content capture and virtual production studio in London. The company said it plans to open a number of additional major studio locations globally.

According to the announcement, clients will have access to faster turnaround times, greater cost efficiency and a wider range of production solutions through the new structure.

“The launch of WPP Production is a cornerstone of our strategic vision to integrate our services, making it easier for clients to access WPP’s full spectrum of capabilities,” said Cindy Rose, CEO of WPP. “In a rapidly evolving landscape where content is king, WPP Production will be the powerhouse that enables us to be the trusted growth partner for our clients. This is about delivering exceptional value and setting new benchmarks for the quality and scale of content production worldwide.”

The transition to WPP Production will take effect on February 23rd 2026.",https://d3q27bh1u24u2o.cloudfront.net/news/2026-01/wpp-prod.T6qcK-pV.png,N,,2026-01-22 13:42:32.493528

What Happened: Oracle Network Called Undervalued

Hougan's assessment focuses on Chainlink's function as a decentralized oracle network that delivers real-world data to blockchains.

Without this technology, financial applications on distributed ledgers cannot access external information like asset prices or payment confirmations.

The executive emphasized that major financial institutions already depend on Chainlink's services.

The stablecoin sector relies on its price feeds for maintaining pegs and conducting Proof of Reserves audits.

Tokenized real-world assets—including stocks, bonds and commodities—require the oracle network for regulatory compliance and accurate settlement.

The breadth of institutional adoption supports the undervaluation thesis. SWIFT, DTCC, JPMorgan, Visa, Mastercard and Fidelity have all integrated or experimented with Chainlink's technology for cross-chain interoperability and blockchain-based settlement.

Also Read: Ethereum Reserves Hit 10-Year Low Across Exchanges As Price Falls Below $3K

Why It Matters: Infrastructure Meets Wall Street

Hougan's analysis suggests that demand for oracle services will grow exponentially as real-world asset tokenization expands and decentralized finance markets continue developing.

The network maintains dominant market share, often cited above 50% of total value secured by oracles.

The LINK token functions as both payment for data services and collateral that node operators must stake against accurate performance. This economic model ties security directly to network demand.

The convergence of institutional adoption and DeFi growth positions Chainlink's infrastructure as increasingly critical to both blockchain and traditional finance systems.

OpenAI, Anthropic, SpaceX and Stripe are among the big names said to be considering an initial public offering (IPO) this year.

The success of their flotations – whether the shares maintain their value, rise or fall – could shape concerns about the AI race and whether the resulting market mania is a bubble.

Some may have had plans to float last year that were delayed or derailed by the US federal shutdown and sweeping government job cuts hitting the market watchdog. This year is shaping up to be similarly geopolitically choppy, with Trump’s latest tariff threats against European allies over Greenland casting a shadow over shares this week.

However, despite last year’s turmoil markets soared to near-record highs on the back of the AI boom, and investors are expected to keep betting big on the technology for now. Here are 10 of the companies most likely to take advantage of that enthusiasm with an IPO.

OpenAI

The San Francisco-based company is synonymous with AI, having triggered a frenzy of public interest in the subject with the launch of the ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022. It is a loss-making business but has attracted investment from big names including Microsoft and the Japanese group SoftBank, and its valuation has boomed from $29bn in 2023 to $500bn last year. If OpenAI floats it could be valued at as much as $1tn, according to Reuters.

Underpinning these numbers is a hope that demand for AI, and the transformative impact of its adoption by workplaces and individuals, more than pays back the multitrillion-dollar investment in the datacentres and computer chips that support it. OpenAI is committed to spending $1.4tn on such infrastructure over the next eight years, but must convince investors it can pay that back.

“OpenAI is clearly the single biggest test for the entire AI economy, the bubble idea and whether it’s all built on sand,” said Neil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets.

Anthropic

Like OpenAI, the San Francisco-headquartered startup behind the chatbot Claude and the now wildly popular Claude Code is also yet to turn a profit. This month, the company signed a term sheet for a $10bn funding round that puts its valuation at $350bn.

If Anthropic floats, it may have ramifications that go beyond the AI race. Many of its employees are aligned with the effective altruism movement, and energetic discussion on internet forums suggests that money could pour into causes aligned with this movement if its employees cash out.

SpaceX

Elon Musk’s company reportedly reached a $800bn valuation in December and is preparing to go public. However, “whether it actually happens, when it happens, and at what valuation are still highly uncertain”, according to comments from its chief financial officer, Bret Johnsen, in a letter obtained by Reuters.

On the one hand, geopolitical volatility is likely to make the nexus between tech, aerospace and defence more appealing to investors, said Mike Bellin at PricewaterhouseCoopers. This may have ramifications for SpaceX. On the other, Elon Musk’s reputation, and that of Tesla, make the outcome of the IPO somewhat harder to predict, said Mark Moccia, an analyst at research firm Forrester, although he expects “a huge mix of institutional and retail investors”.

“SpaceX in particular is what retail investors are homing in on this year as it’s got the buzz and it’s Musk,” said Neil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets.

Kraken

One of the world’s largest crypto exchanges – not to be confused with the software spin-off of the UK energy firm Octopus – Kraken submitted its paperwork for an IPO in November, and was valued roughly at $20bn. The crypto firm could face a race to float its stock before this year’s US midterm elections, say analysts, as there is a risk political changes in the US reverse Trump’s laissez-faire approach to crypto regulation.

Databricks

This company helps customers to build AI agents – tools that carry out tasks autonomously – using their own data. Its revenue grew more than 55% last year and last month it achieved a valuation of $134bn.

Ali Ghodsi, Databricks’ chief executive, says the company’s growth rate is due to businesses building “data-intensive applications that use AI”.

Canva

A bright light of Australia’s tech industry, Canva was valued last year at $A65bn, although it has moved its parent company domicile to the US in order to prepare for a flotation. The Sydney-based software design company, which calls its employees “Canvanauts”, has 240 million users and two of its co-founders – the wife and husband team Melanie Perkins and Cliff Obrecht – are sixth on the Australian rich list, according to the Financial Review, with a combined fortune of $14bn.

A Canva spokesperson said it had “nothing to share in terms of an IPO timeline”.

Anduril

Palmer Luckey, the chief executive of the defence-tech startup, has said Anduril is “definitely going to be a publicly traded company”, but has not given a timeline. Analysts cite the company’s close ties with the Trump administration and Trump’s decision to hike military spending as factors that may push it towards an offering this year.

“Trump’s 50% increase in defence spending announcement should be the green light to go for it,” said Wilson.

An Anduril spokesperson said “we don’t have a timeline for IPO” and called rumours about a 2026 flotation “pure speculation”.

Monzo

Monzo is an online bank that operates entirely through a mobile app. It reported more than 12 million customers in 2025.

The London-based fintech – the jargon for tech firms that offer financial services like banking or payments – was reportedly working with Morgan Stanley last summer to meet investors before a 2026 IPO – but this was later complicated by the exit of its chief executive, TS Anil.

Bolt

The Estonian rival to Uber, Bolt lined up an adviser for an IPO last year. The company has had a difficult few years, however, with reported losses of more than €102m in 2024. The company is reportedly considering whether to list in the EU or the US.

A Bolt spokesperson said: “Any date for listing will depend on favourable market conditions, which remains a significant factor in determining when Bolt goes public. Our teams are working to ensure the business is ready to IPO, should market conditions be right.”

Stripe

The online payment processing company was founded by the Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison in 2010. It has headquarters in California and Dublin and has long been a cornerstone of fintech. Last year it was reported that Stripe had attained a valuation of $107bn, a bounceback from when it was valued at $50bn in 2023. A Stripe spokesperson declined to comment.

Anthropic, Kraken, Monzo, SpaceX and Databricks did not respond to requests for comment.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52f28e3778e0def3eb14d4cf2f324385763c3788/467_0_2672_2138/master/2672.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8880a14137c62ac1f0b7024f95f4ae53",N,,2026-01-22 14:42:15.325435

Enterprises using the solution gain automated cryptographic discovery, risk scoring and prioritization, PQC-ready PKI and signing, lifecycle automation, and governance structures aligned with NIST, EU, and global PQC guidance.

PRESS RELEASE — Keyfactor, the leader in digital trust for modern enterprises, today announced a new joint solution with IBM Consulting that gives enterprises visibility into their cryptographic assets to help reduce operational and regulatory risk, and accelerate readiness for post-quantum cryptography (PQC). The joint solution combines Keyfactor’s industry-leading cryptographic discovery, PKI, digital signing, and certificate lifecycle automation capabilities with IBM Consulting’s global cybersecurity expertise, governance frameworks, and enterprise-scale quantum-safe delivery methods, accelerators, and AI-based assets.

Cryptography powers every connection, transaction, and digital interaction, yet it remains one of the most vulnerable and least understood dependencies in the modern enterprise. Certificates, keys, algorithms, protocols, and libraries span across infrastructure, networks, devices, applications, and third-party solutions, often with fragmented ownership and inconsistent controls. This lack of unified visibility leaves organizations vulnerable to outages, audit gaps, and rising security and compliance risks as quantum computing timelines accelerate. At the same time, emerging regulations and PQC guidance are increasing the pressure on enterprises to demonstrate control and modernization across their entire cryptographic landscape.

“Cryptography sits at the center of every digital interaction, yet most enterprises struggle to see or understand the full scope of their cryptographic footprint,” said Ted Shorter, Chief Technology Officer and Co-Founder of Keyfactor. “By combining Keyfactor’s ability to discover, automate, and modernize cryptography with IBM Consulting’s deep expertise in strategy, governance, and quantum-safe transformation, organizations get a practical, end-to-end path from cryptographic complexity to clarity and control. This partnership empowers enterprises to reduce risk today while preparing confidently for tomorrow.”

The joint solution provides enterprises with clarity, control, and a structured modernization path to transition from reactive cryptography management to a governed and automated approach to quantum-safe readiness. Joint clients can benefit from four key integrated areas:

End-to-end cryptographic discovery & inventory

Automated discovery reveals where cryptographic assets live across on-prem, cloud, hybrid, and DevOps environments, exposing blind spots and shadow cryptography. The solution enables enterprises to build a comprehensive cryptographic inventory and Cryptographic Bill of Materials (CBOM).

Risk scoring & prioritization

By combining IBM Consulting’s business and regulatory expertise and quantum-safe transformation services, including IBM Quantum Safe Migration Orchestrator, with visibility and risk-based insights from Keyfactor, organizations gain structured risk analysis, governance models, and prioritized remediation plans.

Modern PKI, signing, and lifecycle automation

Keyfactor’s EJBCA, SignServer, and Command solutions provide PQC-ready PKI, centralized signing, and automated certificate lifecycle management — replacing manual work with policy-driven processes that strengthen security, reduce operational friction, and significantly reduce outage risk.

Governance and long-term resilience

IBM Consulting establishes scalable operating models, including cryptographic Centers of Excellence (CCoEs), governance frameworks, KPIs, and training to drive sustainable modernization and quantum-safe transformation.

Together, these components create an actionable, phased modernization path aligned to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), EU, and global PQC guidance — from initial discovery to long-term crypto-agility.

“Quantum-safe transformation is more than a cryptographic upgrade; it’s a major operational shift that requires coordination across people, processes, and technology,” said Dinesh Nagarajan, Global Partner, Cybersecurity, IBM Consulting. “Enterprises shouldn’t shoulder that journey alone. Partnering with experts who have deep cryptographic expertise and a track record of delivering complex, enterprise-wide transformations facilitates a smoother, more secure transition. Working with Keyfactor, we can help organizations uncover hidden risks, modernize their trust infrastructure, and build long-term resilience as the quantum era approaches.”

The decision came after discussions between L’Oréal’s top management and a delegation from the state government during the World Economic Forum (WEF 2026).

Reuters reported that the group will invest more than Rs35bn ($383.4m) in the facility, which is being positioned as a global base for innovation, technology, data and supply-chain operations.

The centre is expected to underpin L’Oréal’s worldwide programmes in digital transformation, AI and analytics, and to generate 2,000 technology roles by 2030.

In November 2025, L’Oréal said it would set up one of its largest global capability centres (GCCs) in Hyderabad, separate from its Indian research operations in Mumbai and Bengaluru.

At the time, the company stated that the site would support global technology, innovation and research activities for the group, and that it had begun searching for senior executives for the project, including candidates from its Paris headquarters.

L’Oréal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus said the group was pleased to proceed with the development and that “tech solutions generated from the Hyderabad GCC will be supplied to our facilities all around the world”.

In a Facebook post, the Telangana delegation led by chief minister A Revanth Reddy said the project would take the form of a GCC focused on beauty technology.

Telangana IT minister D Sridhar Babu added that the state was prepared to offer full backing to international investors and pointed to Hyderabad’s growing presence as a host for GCCs across sectors such as med-tech, health-tech and hospitality.

Sanjay Kumar, special chief secretary for information technology, electronics, communications and industries, invited L’Oréal to also consider establishing manufacturing facilities in the state alongside the GCC.

According to the Facebook update from Telangana’s information and public relations department, Hieronimus responded favourably and indicated the company would examine the possibility of future investment in a production unit in Hyderabad.

Reports surfaced indicating that Peet’s Coffee (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., had been listed as an ‘executed person’ due to ongoing litigation.
Despite these challenges, JDE Peet's—the parent company formed through a merger between Jacobs Douwe Egberts and Peet's in 2019—continues to thrive on multiple fronts.
Known for housing over 50 brands including L'OR and Senseo alongside its flagship name, JDE Peet's operates across more than 100 countries worldwide.
In August 2025, Keurig Dr Pepper announced plans to acquire JDE Peet’s for €15.7 billion (approximately $17 billion).","In the bustling world of coffee, few names resonate as deeply as Peet's Coffee. Founded by Alfred Peet in 1966, this brand is often credited with igniting America’s specialty coffee movement. With its rich history and commitment to quality, Peet's has carved out a unique niche that appeals to discerning coffee lovers everywhere.

Recently, however, the company found itself navigating turbulent waters following some unsettling news regarding its operations in China. Reports surfaced indicating that Peet’s Coffee (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., had been listed as an ‘executed person’ due to ongoing litigation. This label can evoke concern among consumers and investors alike—what does it mean for such a beloved brand?

But here’s where things get interesting: shortly after these reports emerged, the information mysteriously vanished from public records. A spokesperson for Peet’s clarified that this was merely related to an active lawsuit and assured stakeholders that the situation was under control; indeed, they stated that any adverse listings were retracted once verified.

This incident highlights not only the complexities of operating within international markets but also how quickly perceptions can shift based on fleeting information. The legal landscape can be daunting for companies expanding globally—especially when dealing with different jurisdictions like China.

Despite these challenges, JDE Peet's—the parent company formed through a merger between Jacobs Douwe Egberts and Peet's in 2019—continues to thrive on multiple fronts. Known for housing over 50 brands including L'OR and Senseo alongside its flagship name, JDE Peet's operates across more than 100 countries worldwide.

The company's financial health remains robust; recent reports indicate organic sales growth of 5.3% along with significant cash flow generation—a testament to their strategic positioning within both developing and developed markets.

Moreover, exciting developments are on the horizon! In August 2025, Keurig Dr Pepper announced plans to acquire JDE Peet’s for €15.7 billion (approximately $17 billion). This acquisition will lead KDP into restructuring efforts aimed at creating two independent publicly traded entities focused solely on beverages and global coffee respectively—a move anticipated by many industry experts as beneficial given current market trends toward specialization.

As we look ahead at what lies in store for brands like Peet’s Coffee amidst corporate transitions and evolving consumer preferences one thing is clear: their dedication towards crafting exceptional coffee experiences continues unabated—even if external circumstances may momentarily cloud their path.",https://www.oreateai.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a6p7qra6p7qra6p7.png,N,,2026-01-23 02:38:33.586396

It marks the second extension the company has made since challenging Warner’s merger agreement with Netflix last month.
As of late Wednesday, Paramount said that more than 168.5 million Warner shares had been tendered in support of its offer.

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things.","New York — Skydance-owned Paramount is again extending the tender offer window in its $77.9 billion hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, while doubling down on a coming proxy fight.

Warner stockholders now have until Feb. 20 to sell their shares to Paramount for $30 apiece in cash — a price that remains unchanged, giving the offer a total enterprise value of over $108 billion including debt. It marks the second extension the company has made since challenging Warner’s merger agreement with Netflix last month.

As of late Wednesday, Paramount said that more than 168.5 million Warner shares had been tendered in support of its offer. But that's still far below the 50% mark it would need to effectively gain control of Warner — which has about 2.48 billion shares outstanding in series A common stock today.

“Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix,"" Warner said in an emailed statement Thursday — adding that it's “clear our shareholders agree,"" as more than 93% have so far rejected “Paramount’s inferior scheme.”

In December, Netflix agreed to buy Warner's studio and streaming business for $72 billion — now in an all-cash deal that the companies say is more straight forward and will speed up the path to a shareholder vote by April. Including debt, the enterprise value of the deal is about $83 billion, or $27.75 per share.

But Paramount argues its offer is better than Netflix’s and has accused Warner leadership of not being transparent with stockholders. On Thursday, the company claimed Warner’s board was “rushing to solicit shareholder approval” for the Netflix merger, which it said could lead to a lower payout for shareholders if debt spanning from a previously-announced spinoff of Warner’s networks business makes its way to studio and streaming operations.

In an escalation of its hostile bid, Paramount is also moving forward with a proxy fight. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to nominate its own slate of directors to Warner’s board before the next shareholder meeting. And on Thursday, Paramount filed preliminary materials to solicit proxies in opposition to the Netflix merger.

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things. Netflix’s proposed acquisition includes only Warner’s studio and streaming business, including its legacy TV and movie production arms and platforms like HBO Max. But Paramount’s bid is for the entire company — which, beyond studio and streaming, includes its news and cable operations. That would put CNN under the same roof as CBS.

If Netflix is successful, Warner’s current networks would be spun off into their own company called Discovery Global, under a previously-announced separation.

Regardless of who wins the upper hand, a Warner Bros. Discovery sale could be a long, drawn-out process — likely attracting tremendous antitrust scrutiny. Politics are expected to come into play under President Donald Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement on whether a deal will go through.

Warner stockholders now have until Feb. 20 to sell their shares to Paramount for $30 apiece in cash — a price that remains unchanged, giving the offer a total enterprise value of over $108 billion including debt. It marks the second extension the company has made since challenging Warner’s merger agreement with Netflix last month.

As of late Wednesday, Paramount said that more than 168.5 million Warner shares had been tendered in support of its offer. But that's still far below the 50% mark it would need to effectively gain control of Warner — which has about 2.48 billion shares outstanding in series A common stock today.

“Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix,"" Warner said in an emailed statement Thursday — adding that it's “clear our shareholders agree,"" as more than 93% have so far rejected “Paramount’s inferior scheme.”

In December, Netflix agreed to buy Warner's studio and streaming business for $72 billion — now in an all-cash deal that the companies say is more straight forward and will speed up the path to a shareholder vote by April. Including debt, the enterprise value of the deal is about $83 billion, or $27.75 per share.

But Paramount argues its offer is better than Netflix’s and has accused Warner leadership of not being transparent with stockholders. On Thursday, the company claimed Warner’s board was “rushing to solicit shareholder approval” for the Netflix merger, which it said could lead to a lower payout for shareholders if debt spanning from a previously-announced spinoff of Warner’s networks business makes its way to studio and streaming operations.

In an escalation of its hostile bid, Paramount is also moving forward with a proxy fight. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to nominate its own slate of directors to Warner’s board before the next shareholder meeting. And on Thursday, Paramount filed preliminary materials to solicit proxies in opposition to the Netflix merger.

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things. Netflix’s proposed acquisition includes only Warner’s studio and streaming business, including its legacy TV and movie production arms and platforms like HBO Max. But Paramount’s bid is for the entire company — which, beyond studio and streaming, includes its news and cable operations. That would put CNN under the same roof as CBS.

If Netflix is successful, Warner’s current networks would be spun off into their own company called Discovery Global, under a previously-announced separation.

Regardless of who wins the upper hand, a Warner Bros. Discovery sale could be a long, drawn-out process — likely attracting tremendous antitrust scrutiny. Politics are expected to come into play under President Donald Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement on whether a deal will go through.",https://assets.tegnaone.com/assets/AssociatedPress/images/a80fdaff-1f6d-4d41-a608-06ea429c5b2f/20260122T142505/a80fdaff-1f6d-4d41-a608-06ea429c5b2f.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 13:00:23.398682

It started several multi-year PPAs during the year, securing around 3 TWh of additional annual low-carbon electricity. This compares with 2.5 TWh signed in 2024.

The agreements are concentrated in regions with carbon-intensive power grids, including China and South Africa. In 2025, Air Liquide also signed its first PPAs in India, marking its entry into a market where electricity demand rose by nearly 75% between 2013 and 2023.

In South Africa, the company is working with chemicals and energy firm Sasol to source close to 700MW of renewable electricity for the Secunda site, described as the world’s largest oxygen production facility.

According to its 2024 figures, more than 40% of Air Liquide’s total purchased electricity now comes from low-carbon sources, including wind and solar.

Electricity sourcing is one of three pillars of the group’s decarbonisation roadmap, alongside asset optimisation to reduce energy consumption and the deployment of carbon capture and storage.

“[We aim to secure] additional low-carbon capacity on top of grid transition in geographies where we operate,” said Diana Schillag, a member of Air Liquide’s Executive Committee.

The strategy is complemented by the electrification of selected air separation units. In China, the electrification of the Shaanxi ASU, combined with low-carbon power sourcing, is expected to reduce the group’s emissions by up to 550,000 tonnes per year.

“European banks were on average very well managed, lean machines before rates inflected,” Wedekind says.","European banks enjoyed a record year for returns in 2025, in which the Euro Stoxx Banks index surged 98.1%.

Financials, and banking stocks in particular, was one of a narrow collection of sectors driving European market returns as a whole last year. Given the record run, investors are beginning to ask whether the sector continue its momentum in 2026.

Portfolio Adviser asks European and global fund managers for their views on the sector moving forward.

What has driven recent returns?

The rally in European banking stocks has been stark, with the sector up over 331.7% over the five years to the end of last year.

Société Générale was the highest returning stock within the 29-holding Amundi Euro Stoxx Banks ETF last year, returning 159.28%, according to Morningstar data. Names such as Commerzbank, Banco Santander and ABM AMRO Bank also returned over 100% last year alone. Strikingly, every member of the index fund was up for the year.

The sector has enjoyed multiple tailwinds which have contributed to the run since the Covid-19 pandemic. Looking at recent financial results from last year, Marc Stacey, a senior portfolio manager within RBC Bluebay Asset Management’s investment grade team, highlights a particular trend to demonstrate the remarkable run.

“The last quarter saw the vast majority of the sector report earnings, with trends continuing in line with our bullish view on fundamentals,” he says. “Pre-provision operating profits beat on aggregate by 4%. This is the 27th quarter in a row of outperformance. This is an incredible statistic, given it’s against increasingly lofty market expectations.”

European equities more broadly have also participated in a value rally, with financials one of the key beneficiaries.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, European financials were restricted by regulators on dividends and share buybacks. These limits, combined with uncertainty around the longer-term economic impact, pushed valuations to meaningfully depressed levels, notes Allspring Global Investments global equity portfolio manager Jonathan Drexel.

“As clarity returned and restrictions were lifted, valuations reverted toward more historical norms,” he says. “Since the pandemic, European banks have significantly improved both profitability and balance sheet strength, leading to a rerating of the sector alongside renewed earnings momentum.”

However, Frank Wedekind, global equity research analyst at William Blair Investment Management, says the outperformance in European Banks is not just part of a value rally or a ‘fluke’, rather it is due to a combination of sector dynamics.

He particularly notes the fundamental lack of economic growth in Western Europe, which has forced the sector to adapt to stay competitive. Management teams have had to become more efficient, adapt their product range and, in many cases, consolidate.

The changing interest rate environment has also contributed. “European banks were on average very well managed, lean machines before rates inflected,” Wedekind says. “The higher rates then fell on very fertile ground, that dropped through to the bottom line.”

What’s the investment case from here?

Moving forward, Mirabaud Discovery Europe fund portfolio manager Hywel Franklin says the sector still offers meaningful upside, with many European financials still set to deliver 10–15% annual earnings growth alongside substantial dividend payouts.

“Valuations remain compelling, especially versus the US, where parts of the market now trade at stretched multiples,” he says.

“With Europe continuing to rebound and investor flows gradually shifting, the environment remains supportive. Well-run banks such as Credem in Italy highlight how undervaluation and strong fundamentals can coexist.”

In terms of positioning, Franklin is maintaining the fund’s exposure to the sector.

“Earnings momentum is intact, valuations remain attractive, and the sector continues to benefit from improving macro conditions. More broadly, Europe appears to be in the early stages of a re-rating cycle, and financials remain one of the clearer beneficiaries.”

Considering the re-rating that has taken place within the sector already, however, William Blair’s Wedekind says the focus from here is on being selective with exposure.

“We continue to like the space and continue to see attractive investment stories for many individual names. But, as the sector valuation is not as attractive as it has been and as many stocks are trading close to or in some cases above what we would consider as fair value, we have become a lot more selective.”

Markus Hansen, portfolio manager at Vontobel Quality Growth, adds his focus within the sector is on countries with a disciplined competitive banking market set up, such as the UK, Scandinavian nations and Greece.

“We have been tactically adding to the names we own: NatWest Group, Den Norske Bank DNB, Svenska Handelsbanken and Eurobank Ergasias.

“We also think international investors have been cautious towards European banks given the recent history and there may still be political backdrop worries, hence focus on more quality, sustainable growth names is key for us.”

“We maintain our conviction in the banks over the medium term due to their high and attractive shareholder returns and modest valuation compared to historic averages, despite the recent strong performance,” adds Brian Hall, co-manager of the BlackRock Greater Europe Investment Trust.",https://s44696.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/euro-bank-notes-V1.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 08:40:01.082892

Société Générale didn’t detail the types of roles that could be affected by these changes but said that the change would occur within the framework of the measures set out in an Employment Agreement signed on in December last year with three trade unions.

The latest phase of the roadmap, which includes the role net reduction proposals, is a so-called “organisational simplification” project conducted by 2,000 employees throughout all areas of the bank.

According to the bank, its employees came up with thousands of ideas to “optimise tools and procurement, simplify processes and structures, pool teams, and strengthen automation and the use of artificial intelligence”.

The bank also wants to undergo what it calls an “organisational revolution”, in which it aims to simplify the way it operates to become “more efficient” and “agile”.

The bank claims the move is to better serve clients. Société Générale said this would affect how much of its headquarters operates and how it organises retail banking regionally, though its branch network will stay the same.

When it comes to retraining staff, the organisation plans to establish a mobility and skills campus. Focused on driving internal mobility, it will be designed to help staff forge and succeed in new careers at the bank.

Many of the new skills that staff will be required to acquire will be taught through the Société Générale University.",https://www.fstech.co.uk/fst/images/societe generale.png,N,,2026-01-22 09:40:18.722044

Attachment Liquid Carbon Dioxide Market","Dublin, Jan. 22, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Liquid Carbon Dioxide Market Report 2026"" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The liquid carbon dioxide market is poised for robust growth, with the market size increasing from $6.54 billion in 2025 to an anticipated $9.23 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.1%. This growth is driven by rising adoption of supercritical CO2 for sustainable processing, demand for liquid CO2 in precision cooling, and expansion in fire suppression solutions. The increased deployment of carbon capture infrastructure and advancements in liquefaction technologies are also crucial growth factors.

The food and beverage industry remains a significant driver, utilizing liquid CO2 for carbonation, refrigeration, and preservation. Statistics Canada reported in June 2025 that food and beverage sales comprised nearly one-quarter of Canada's total retail spending in 2024, highlighting rising consumer demand. This growth is further supported by technological innovations such as liquid carbon dioxide carriers, designed to optimize storage and reduce transportation costs, exemplified by Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co. Ltd.'s introduction of a new carrier in 2025.

Strategic acquisitions are also shaping the market landscape. In January 2025, Alto Ingredients Inc. acquired Kodiak Carbonic LLC, a move aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and profitability through the optimized use of byproduct CO2. Such acquisitions highlight the focus on securing sustainable revenue streams and expanding market presence.

Major companies such as Linde plc, Air Liquide Deutschland GmbH, and Praxair Inc. are leading innovations across various applications from food and beverage processing to metal fabrication and pharmaceuticals. North America was the largest market in 2025, but Asia-Pacific is expected to lead growth through the forecast period, reflecting the dynamic regional shifts within the industry.

However, the market faces challenges from global trade relations and tariffs, potentially reshaping dynamics by increasing import costs for industrial gases and related equipment. These factors have prompted local manufacturers to bolster regional capacities, enhancing supply security and competitiveness amid rising international costs.

Overall, the liquid carbon dioxide market offers considerable opportunities for growth and innovation. With advancements across multiple sectors and strategic actions by key players, the market is set to thrive despite potential geopolitical challenges. This market analysis provides a comprehensive exploration of current trends, future opportunities, and strategic insights for stakeholders invested in the future of the liquid carbon dioxide industry.

Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) has entered into a partnership with Precision Neuroscience to advance brain computer interface technology in neurosurgery.

The company has also agreed to acquire a significant stake in Anteris Technologies, a developer of a transcatheter aortic valve replacement device.

For a medical technology giant like Medtronic, these moves touch two core areas: neurosurgery and structural heart care. Brain computer interface tools aim to bring new options into the operating room, while transcatheter aortic valve replacement continues to be an area of focus for treating heart valve disease without open heart surgery.

The way these technologies progress through clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones will be important markers for how Medtronic’s product mix and risk profile could change over time.

What This Activity Could Signal for Medtronic Investors

The BCI partnership with Precision Neuroscience and the planned stake of up to US$90 million in Anteris point to Medtronic leaning further into neurosurgery and structural heart devices that are still early in their commercial journey. For you as an investor, it highlights that management is prepared to allocate capital to higher complexity procedures that could deepen Medtronic’s role in brain and heart interventions if clinical and regulatory progress stays on track.

How This Fits Into The Medtronic Narrative

Recent moves, including the spin off plan for the diabetes unit, regulatory clearance for the Hugo robotic surgery system, and now investments in BCI and transcatheter valves, all point to a tighter focus on hospital based B2B technologies. For investors who already view Medtronic as a broad medtech platform, this news can reinforce a story that is tilting more toward advanced surgery, neuroscience, and cardiology, while still backed by a long record of dividend increases.

Risks and Rewards To Keep In Mind

BCI integration with the StealthStation system and exposure to a new transcatheter valve could expand Medtronic’s addressable procedures in neurosurgery and structural heart care.

Management is supporting these bets from a position that screens as good value and with a dividend that has risen for 48 consecutive years, which some income focused investors may appreciate.

Clinical and regulatory timelines for both BCI systems and aortic valve devices can be long and uncertain, so payoffs may be uneven or delayed versus expectations.

More capital tied to new technologies adds execution risk, particularly if competitors move quickly or trial results and reimbursement decisions do not support broad adoption.

What To Watch Next

From here, the key things to track are progress in the PARADIGM trial for Anteris, clinical integration of Precision’s Layer 7 interface with StealthStation in real world neurosurgical workflows, and any updates around the diabetes spin off and Hugo robotic rollout, as these all shape how concentrated Medtronic’s future earnings mix becomes.

Summary

I conduct a comprehensive technical scan of all S&P 500 stocks to gauge macro market trends and sector rotation.

Current ETF analysis highlights DIA, QQQ, and SPY, with special attention to the democratization trend beyond the top 50 stocks.

RSP is rallying but has only recovered recent underperformance versus XLG; the sustainability of smaller stock outperformance remains uncertain.

Out of 500 S&P 500 stocks, I found only 15 to list that I'd say have ""good"" charts. Most of the rest are either high risk or going nowhere.

ICEYE satellite data will be used to monitor floods, fires and storms as it expands predictive risk services.

AXA DCP, which uses AI to assess threats, said the satellite data will be applied across areas including natural catastrophes, cybercrime and geopolitical risk analysis.

AXA DCP CEO Pierre du Rostu said: “We are responding to the challenge of the polycrisis by evolving. Our goal is to make use of the very best solutions available to move beyond response to prediction and prevention.

“ICEYE is a world leader in monitoring natural catastrophes and provides the real-time insights our clients require even when it is dark, when there are clouds, when there is dust, smoke, or volcanic ash.”

ICEYE runs what it describes as the world’s “largest” constellation of SAR microsatellites, providing imagery to governments, defence organisations, intelligence bodies and commercial clients.

Its satellites are capable of near real-time observation regardless of weather or daylight, offering global coverage, frequent revisit rates and image resolution of around 25cm, the press statement read.

AXA DCP said the agreement supports its shift towards greater emphasis on prediction and prevention, helping customers anticipate disruptive events and limit potential damage.

It added that the collaboration is intended to strengthen AXA DCP’s capacity to evaluate and manage weather-related exposures through satellite-derived insights.

ICEYE Solutions senior vice-president Stephen Lathrope added: “Scaling access to ICEYE’s advanced SAR technology through AXA DCP is a transformative step for the insurance and risk management sector. It enables organisations to harness cutting-edge innovation at scale, unlock new insights, and fundamentally change how they prepare for, respond to and recover from catastrophic events.”",https://www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2026/01/shutterstock_2655645491.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 05:59:55.260706

In his quest to gain more control over the Fed, Trump will have to jump though hoops in the Supreme Court and Congress while stomaching discontent from Wall Street, a tall task even for a president accustomed to blowing past rules and norms.

“The defenses against presidential intrusion are multilayered and very well designed,” said Gary Richardson, an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine, and the Fed’s historian from 2012 to 2016.

Trump is on a campaign to get the Fed to slash the interest rate at which banks lend money to each other overnight, which influences the interest rates consumers pay on credit cards, mortgages and car loans.

It currently sits between 3.5% and 3.75%, putting a slight damper on spending to keep inflation manageable.

The president told The Wall Street Journal in December he’d like that figure to fall to “1% and maybe lower than that.” He’s also insulted Fed Chair Jerome Powell as a “moron” and a “stubborn mule,” among other critical remarks, for supporting only slight reductions in interest rates.

Supply and demand

Bringing rates down fast likely would juice the economy in the short term while sowing long-run cost hikes, according to John Canavan, lead U.S. analyst at Oxford Economics. That may be a fine trade-off to term-limited presidents looking to project strength, but it’s a bad outcome in the view of economists.

“When demand exceeds supply, you get inflation,” Canavan said. “If rates are kept too low, the economy will overheat.”

Unduly cutting rates also would violate the Fed’s congressional mandate to pursue stable prices and maximum employment regardless of the political climate.

Yet, Trump has made several moves that critics view as pressure on the central bank to go along with his wishes for lower interest rates.

In August, he tried to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud. She has not been charged and denies the claims.

Cook sued the government in response, arguing the law only allows presidents to dismiss Fed officials “for cause.” The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case Wednesday and seemed to favor keeping Cook in her job, although a decision likely won’t come until the summer.

A ruling favorable to the Trump administration would eliminate evidence of wrongdoing as an obstacle to remaking the Fed’s seven-member board of governors.

“If an allegation alone is enough to define cause for removal, then that could be done to anybody sitting on the board,” said Loretta Mester, a University of Pennsylvania finance professor and head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland from 2014 to 2024.

The Cleveland district covers Western Pennsylvania along with Ohio, eastern Kentucky and the West Virginia panhandle. Its current head, Beth Hammack, declined to comment.

Powell is also the subject of a criminal investigation related to cost overruns during renovations at the Fed’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. The Department of Justice issued subpoenas Jan. 9 related to the probe, which Trump said he has no knowledge of and Powell has dismissed as politically motivated.

Even with the Supreme Court on his side, the Senate could stop Trump from handpicking Fed governors, which typically serve staggered 14-year terms.

Lawmakers have thrown up red flags, including many Democrats and several Republicans. U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., has said he won’t vote on any Fed nominees until the legal matter with Cook is resolved.

U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, Pennsylvania’s Republican senator, has pushed for continued Fed independence, even as he remains aligned with Trump on the need for lower rates.

Speaking with bankers in Juniata County last week, McCormick said he finds it “very hard to believe that Chairman Powell was involved in anything criminal.”

Presidential resistance

It’s a common impulse among presidents to resent Fed independence.

Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Richard Nixon all mounted attempts to influence the central bank’s key interest rate in their day.

Roosevelt was the most successful, but only because he got Congress to change the law, according to Richardson. None have leaned on the courts and personal threats against Fed members as heavily as Trump, he said.

Market reactions also could restrain Trump in his bid to chip away at Fed independence.

Rising long-term bond yields would be one sign that investors fear the central bank’s decision-making could become clouded by politics. That happened to only a limited extent following news of the Powell investigation.

“That may be because the reaction was so strong by the political class that Wall Street was reasonably assured that there’s not going to be much of a challenge to independence,” said Chester Spatt, a finance professor at Carnegie Mellon University.

But the topic is clearly on the minds of prominent bankers.

Robin Vince, CEO of BNY Mellon, has warned the erosion of Fed independence could be “counterproductive” to the Trump administration’s efforts to lower the cost of living.

“Questioning one of the tenets that underlies the bond market runs the risk of doing the opposite — pushing interest rates higher — because markets may feel they have to worry about something they frankly shouldn’t have to worry about,” Vince said on a call with reporters last week.

Jamie Dimon, head of JPMorgan Chase, has made similar comments, prompting Trump to say he’ll be suing the company for “debanking him” after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots.

PNC Bank declined to make an executive available for an interview.

Political conflict aside, many economists believe the Fed should hold firm on the interest rate, for now. Inflation clocked in at 2.7% last month, reflecting a jump in prices compared to December 2024.

The Fed typically targets a 2% rate of inflation.

“I haven’t been convinced by the data I’ve seen that it’s on its way back down to 2%,” Mester said. “I think they’re in a good spot. This is a good time to just wait.”",https://storage.googleapis.com/ownlocal-adforge-production/articles/external/600/722da09b-bc8b-4baa-a75a-1e5cd6c56e57.webp,N,,2026-01-22 06:39:07.539757

In the second half of 2025, OpenEvidence had secured a $200 million funding round at a $6 billion valuation. The round was led by Google Ventures, with participation from top-tier venture firms including Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, Blackstone, Thrive Capital, Coatue Management, Bond and Craft.

Founded in 2022 by Daniel Nadler, who previously founded an AI start-up that was sold to S&P Global for $550 million, and Zachary Ziegler, OpenEvidence has rapidly established itself as an indispensable tool for physicians and nurses by serving as what many users describe as “ChatGPT for medicine.” Its AI is trained on authoritative medical journals such as JAMA and the New England Journal of Medicine, enabling clinicians to access verified, evidence-based answers swiftly to support patient treatment decisions. The platform is offered free to verified medical professionals, supported through advertising revenue, and has expanded to more than 10,000 hospitals and medical centers nationwide.

“Without a technology like OpenEvidence, doctors may miss critical new findings or guidelines simply because they lack the time to find them,” said Nadler. “Doctors want to provide the best care to patients. OpenEvidence is the tool that safely allows them to do that. Our mission is to help doctors save lives and improve patient care.” The company also said a recent independent study by Offcall showed that OpenEvidence is used by more American physicians than all other AI tools for physicians combined.

OpenEvidence’s user metrics have been cited repeatedly by company spokespeople and business press: roughly 40%-45% of U.S. physicians now use the platform, which the company says reaches more than 10,000 hospitals and medical centers. Usage escalated sharply through 2025, with reports that the platform processed about 18 million clinical consultations in December, up from a few million per month a year earlier.

The company says it generates revenue primarily through advertising and reported more than $100 million in annualized revenue, driven largely by organic adoption and physician-to-physician referrals, and up to 30% month-on-month growth. OpenEvidence has emphasizes a high retention and referral rate, claiming that 95% of new users learn about the app from other doctors. Those figures are part of the company’s pitch to investors that a physician-first product can scale without enterprise sales teams.

Nadler has framed OpenEvidence as purpose-built for clinicians while drawing a contrast with products based on generalist large language (LLM) models. “If you only squint from a distance, OpenEvidence is ‘ChatGPT’ for doctors. If you look closely, it’s a very different organism,” Nadler told New York Post.

Uber is expanding its luxury ride service, Uber Black, in India. The company plans to double its fleet size by 2026 in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. This move targets urban commuters seeking comfort and reliability. Dedicated pickup zones are being established at major airports. Uber is also investing in fleet management firm Carrum to support this growth.

Uber is betting big on India’s growing appetite for premium mobility, announcing plans to double the fleet size of its Uber Black service in 2026 as it expands the availability of luxury rides across Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru.

The expansion marks a sharpened focus on high-end urban commuters willing to pay more for comfort, reliability and top-rated drivers, even as India remains one of the world’s most price-sensitive ride-hailing markets.

Uber Black, positioned as the “business class” of Uber’s offerings, currently operates in the three metros with a curated fleet of high-quality vehicles and drivers. The company said the service has seen strong demand from riders seeking elevated service standards, particularly for airport travel and business use.

As part of the push, Uber has set up dedicated Uber Black pickup zones at major airports, including Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport (Terminals 1 and 2) and Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (Terminal 2). The premium zones are designed to offer faster, more seamless pickups using luxury vehicles.

To support the scale-up, Uber said it has made a Series A investment in Carrum, a fleet management firm backed by the CarDekho Group. Carrum has been a long-standing fleet partner for Uber in India, and the investment will be used to expand its vehicle base and operational capacity.

Live Events

""We’re witnessing strong demand for premium mobility in India, driven by riders who value comfort and elevated service standards,"" said Prabhjeet Singh, President, Uber India and South Asia.

Uber has also rolled out its Reserve feature on Uber Black in Delhi, allowing riders to pre-book premium rides from two hours up to 90 days in advance — a move aimed at frequent flyers and corporate users who value certainty.

As competition intensifies in India’s ride-hailing market, Uber’s premium push suggests the company is looking beyond scale alone — betting that a slice of India’s fast-growing urban middle and upper-middle class is ready to pay extra for reliability, comfort and a smoother ride.

India, a key growth market

The expansion underlines India’s importance to Uber at a time when the company is sharpening its focus on profitability and higher-value services globally. While Uber built its scale in India on mass-market offerings such as autos, bikes and budget cars, premium products like Uber Black signal a maturing urban customer base and rising discretionary spending in large cities.

Uber entered India in 2013 and now operates across 125 cities, offering services that range from two-wheelers and autos to cars, transit tickets and intercity travel.

Alongside premium rides, Uber is also seeing traction for Uber One, its paid membership programme that offers savings across multiple mobility options. The company said more than one million riders in India are already enrolled, reflecting growing loyalty among frequent users.

In 2025, significant 3 TWh per year multi-year Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) were started, securing its long term decarbonization trajectory.
In 2025, the Group also signed its first PPAs in India, covering a new geography with a highly carbon-intensive energy mix.
This also allows Air Liquide to provide its customers with gases with a lower carbon footprint, thereby supporting their own decarbonization goals.
Air Liquide sources more than 40%1 of its total purchased power from low-carbon sources, underscoring its commitment to structurally transforming its energy mix on a global scale.","Air Liquide confirms the effectiveness of its voluntary low-carbon electricity sourcing program, a core lever of its Climate Transition Plan, delivering concrete and impactful results. In 2025, significant 3 TWh per year multi-year Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) were started, securing its long term decarbonization trajectory.

This proactive approach is particularly focused on geographies with carbon intensive power grids to maximize emission reduction and impact, such as China and South Africa. In 2025, the Group also signed its first PPAs in India, covering a new geography with a highly carbon-intensive energy mix.

Since 2020, as part of its Climate objectives, the Group has signed PPAs that represent a total reduction of 3.5 million tonnes of CO2 per year, with full ramp-up expected by 2027. This also allows Air Liquide to provide its customers with gases with a lower carbon footprint, thereby supporting their own decarbonization goals.

Air Liquide sources more than 40%1 of its total purchased power from low-carbon sources, underscoring its commitment to structurally transforming its energy mix on a global scale. The sourcing of massive amounts of low-carbon electricity is one of the three levers of its decarbonization roadmap, which also includes asset management to reduce energy consumption, but also carbon capture and storage.

This sourcing approach is further complemented by the electrification of the few remaining non-electrified Air Separation Units (ASUs). For example, the electrification of the Shaanxi ASU announced in December 2025 combined with low-carbon energy sourcing are projected to yield a significant annual reduction of the Group’s emissions by up to 550,000 tonnes.

Diana Schillag, member of Air Liquide's Executive Committee notably in charge of Sustainable Development, stated:

“The ongoing deployment of our voluntary low-carbon electricity sourcing program is concrete evidence of our commitment to transforming our energy mix, securing additional low-carbon capacity on top of grid transition in geographies where we operate. Our goal is to maximize the impact of our actions on overall emissions reduction. It highlights the Group’s agility in using the best levers at hand to lower emissions as effectively as possible, particularly in carbon-intensive countries, while providing our customers with low-carbon solutions and supporting their own decarbonization efforts.”

The leather-clad CEO said this during the first episode of the “A Bit Personal with Jodi Shelton” podcast, wherein Shelton asked him where he gets his confidence.
Shelton is a self-proclaimed ""longtime leader in the global semiconductor industry,"" and is also the CEO and co-founder of the Global Semiconductor Alliance.
“By the way, Morris will be happy to know Nvidia is TSMC’s largest customer now.” The AI GPU company was once TSMC’s top customer in the early 2000s.
But if the AI bubble pops and we’re left with a lot of AI data centers with no customers, then we expect Apple to retake its position as TSMC’s number one customer.","Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said in an interview that Nvidia is TSMC’s largest customer at the moment, dethroning Apple, which has previously held the record for some time. The leather-clad CEO said this during the first episode of the “A Bit Personal with Jodi Shelton” podcast, wherein Shelton asked him where he gets his confidence. Shelton is a self-proclaimed ""longtime leader in the global semiconductor industry,"" and is also the CEO and co-founder of the Global Semiconductor Alliance.

“I remember Morris Chang has a similar story when he first met you, that you immediately said, ‘I’m going to be your biggest customer or one of your biggest customers. And he’s like, ‘Wow, that’s a lot of gumption.’ So, where did that confidence come from at such an early age?” Shelton asked. “Well, you know, it’s rough to know everything — I’m just kidding,” Jensen said with a laugh. “By the way, Morris will be happy to know Nvidia is TSMC’s largest customer now.”

The AI GPU company was once TSMC’s top customer in the early 2000s. However, it was overtaken during the 2010s by Apple when TSMC took it on as a customer to build the iPhone and iPad processors, after Intel fumbled the potential partnership with Cupertino. This was especially true during recent years when the iPhone overtook Samsung in market share across the globe.

But even if Apple’s smartphones, tablets, and even the legendary Apple silicon on Macs and MacBooks are driving record sales for the company, the AI boom is also pushing demand for Nvidia’s AI GPUs, resulting in skyrocketing revenue for the company. More than that, enterprise customers are willing to pay billions and billions to Team Green to get as many AI processors as they can, whereas many consumers have a price ceiling after which they will go with another brand if a smartphone, tablet, or laptop is priced too high.

Aside from losing its top spot, there are also rumors — reported by WCCFTech from the Apple leaker Fixed Focus Digital — that TSMC is hiking up the prices it’s charging Apple for chips, especially as the AI demand is squeezing capacity for other semiconductors. Furthermore, Cupertino might no longer have production priority. However, this is just speculation, and even if it’s true, the companies will likely keep information like this confidential.

Nvidia’s success is directly tied to the AI hype, with many tech companies pouring money into acquiring thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of GPUs just to get the horsepower to train the most advanced models. And with Team Green cornering the market for AI processors, it’s basically printing cash as long as companies feel that they can make more money by adding more computing power. But if the AI bubble pops and we’re left with a lot of AI data centers with no customers, then we expect Apple to retake its position as TSMC’s number one customer.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gmoK3D8rdHXmLPVrrh8tTk-2000-80.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 03:38:27.180915

Amid intensifying competition pressures across its core creative markets, analyst sentiment surrounding Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) remains cautious. On January 14, 2026, Baird reduced its price target on the stock from $410.00 to $350.00, while reiterating a ‘Neutral’ rating.

The cautious sentiment was reinforced on January 9, 2026, when BMO Capital downgraded Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) from ‘Outperform’ to ‘Market Perform’ and reduced its target from $400.00 to $375.00. While acknowledging that competition among smaller businesses, students, and freelancers remains heightened, the investment firm believes the stock appears reasonably priced. However, the firm expects the shares to remain range-bound due to the lack of near-term catalysts.

Some analysts also hold a bearish stance. On January 12, 2026, Goldman Sachs initiated coverage on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), assigning a ‘Sell’ rating with a $290.00 price target. The investment bank attributed its sentiment to growth slowing down among high-end users and the company’s limited exposure to the growing, budget-conscious segment.

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) leverages its Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing segments to provide digital marketing and media solutions. With its offerings, the company enables content creation, customer experience optimization, and digital collaboration worldwide.

While we acknowledge the potential of ADBE as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Donald was born on March 18, 1938, in Albany, New York, to Jay and Beatrice Dillenbeck. He spent his childhood on a farm in Greene, New York, where he developed a lifelong love of land, hard work, and self-reliance.

On June 29, 1957, he married Rose Ann Snitchler at the Binghamton Pilgrim Holiness Church. Their marriage was a true partnership that spanned nearly seven decades and was marked by shared work, adventure, and devotion.

Donald and Rose raised four children: Judy Dillenbeck; Donna (Robert) Dunning; Denise (Mark Goodenberger) Dillenbeck, and Donald (Marlena) Dillenbeck Jr. He was a proud grandfather to eleven grandchildren and a great-grandfather to seven great-grandchildren.

He is survived by his sister, Joyce Knefley, and her husband, Michael. He was predeceased by his brothers Jay, David, and Mark.

From 1956 through 1987, Donald worked as an engineer at IBM in Glendale, Endicott, and Owego, New York. After retiring from IBM, he continued a life of purposeful work, including driving school buses for the Johnson City School District, managing receiving and maintenance at The Bon Ton department store at the Oakdale Mall, driving buses in Denali National Park, driving trucks for the American Red Cross and Midstate Litho, and working on various construction projects over the years. In his later years, he devoted himself to managing and caring for the woodland and farming acreage he and Rose called home.

Donald possessed a meticulous, engineering-minded approach to every project he undertook. He was always ready to help neighbors, assisting with road clearing after Hurricane Irene in 2011, volunteering more than 800 hours at Endicott Nazarene Church following the 2001 flood, and contributing to maintenance and building projects at Community Bible Church in Binghamton. A true pioneer at heart, he built his home with his own hands alongside Rose. Together, they shared adventures across the country, including working in Denali National Park, a cherished highlight.

Donald found deep joy in caring for his land and watching wildlife pass through it. A faithful and loyal husband, he took great pleasure in working side by side with Rose throughout their life together. He passed away at home after a day spent doing what he loved—working on the land that meant so much to him.

A funeral service will be held on Saturday, January 24, at 11:00 a.m. at Community Bible Church, 602 Chenango Street, Binghamton. The family will receive friends on Saturday at 10:00 am until the time of the service.

Barclays has said it has initiated plans to relocate its European headquarters from Dublin to Paris.

The banking giant said it was “confident this is the right step forward” in its efforts to be strategically closer to growing markets.

The move from the Irish to the French capital is not likely to be completed until the first half of 2027, and is subject to approval by regulators.

It is understood to be expected to have a minimal impact on staff in Ireland.

Barclays shifted billions of pounds worth of assets to Dublin and increased the size of its workforce in the city in the wake of Brexit.

But it first raised the possibility in 2023 of it relocating the European base to Paris which has blossomed into a trading hub for the bank.

The shift is expected to bring the bulk of its decision-making closer to the majority of its investment banking activity on the continent.

Francesco Ceccato, the chief executive of Barclays Europe, described the move as a “strategic milestone” that will help it better meet the needs of its clients.

“After extensive discussions at all levels of the organisation, we are confident this is the right step forward – both for the entity and for our clients,” he said.

“We are very excited about the opportunities ahead.”

The disclosure arrived only months after Kraft Heinz announced plans to split into two public companies and was met with immediate market pressure, sending the shares sharply lower in early New York trading.

The filing reflects a gradual but deliberate pullback by Berkshire after years of frustration with the investment's performance. Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) has previously said the 2015 merger that created Kraft Heinz did not unfold as hoped and voiced disappointment last year when the company opted to separate. Berkshire, which partnered with 3G Capital to back the original deal, has already taken steps to unwind its involvement, giving up board seats in May and recording a $3.8 billion impairment charge in August to reflect the stock's decline. At the time, some analysts suggested the writedown could open the door to a full exit, a view that now appears increasingly relevant.

For Kraft Heinz, the potential overhang comes during a period of strategic reset following years of underperformance. After the stock fell 21% last year, lagging the S&P 500 Index's 16% gain, the company announced in September that it would unwind its $46 billion mega-merger by separating into two businesses. One entity will house faster-growing global brands such as Heinz ketchup and other condiments, generating $15.4 billion in annual sales, while the other will include slower-growing grocery products like Oscar Mayer and Lunchables, which currently produce $10.4 billion in revenue. The split is expected to be completed in the second half of this year, alongside a leadership change and a renewed effort to simplify the corporate structure and sharpen capital allocation, though investor sentiment could remain sensitive as Berkshire's next move takes shape.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 12:40:54.586246

It said this week's combined investment shows defence is an ""engine for growth"" that can create skilled jobs and strengthen national security.
""This contract secures 300 highly skilled jobs at Leonardo's Edinburgh site, and 100 at our Luton site.","(Alliance News) - UK Defence Secretary John Healey is set to announce a GBP453 million investment to fit Typhoon fighter jets with ""cutting-edge"" radar systems, securing up to 1,300 jobs.

The Defence Secretary is visiting the Edinburgh site of Rome-based Leonardo Spa's UK subsidiary on Thursday morning, where he will confirm the award of a contract to upgrade the Royal Air Force's Typhoon fleet.

Under the new contract, defence firms including London-based BAE Systems PLC, Leonardo UK and Cleveland, Ohio-based Parker-Hannifin Corp subsidiary Parker Meggitt will equip the aircraft with state-of-the-art radar systems over the coming years.

In addition to securing 300 skilled roles in Edinburgh, the work will secure 120 jobs in Lancashire and more than 100 in Luton.

In all, the full Typhoon programme supports more than 20,000 jobs across 330 UK companies.

The announcement comes amid growing pressure on Nato as a result of US President Donald Trump's stated intention to acquire Greenland.

Healey said: ""Our Typhoon fleet is the backbone of UK and Nato air defence, operated across Europe by the Royal Air Force and our allies to protect our skies and security.

""As the threats we face increase, and as Russian drones continue to strike Ukraine and violate Nato airspace, this cutting-edge radar capability will keep Britain secure at home and strong abroad for many years to come.

""In Edinburgh and across the UK, we're backing more than 20,000 skilled workers on the Typhoon programme who ensure our RAF remains ready to protect Britain.

Earlier this week, the government announced a GBP205 million contract for the long-term provision of specialist Typhoon engineering support by QinetiQ Group PLC.

It said this week's combined investment shows defence is an ""engine for growth"" that can create skilled jobs and strengthen national security.

Healey added: ""Our government has backed their high-skilled work with more than GBP650 million of investment this week alone, securing British jobs and making defence an engine for growth in Scotland and beyond.

""This massive workforce will be sustained for years following the biggest fighter jet exports deal in a generation, worth GBP8 billion which we secured with Turkiye in October.""

The latest contract will see 40 advanced European Common Radar System Mk2 radars fitted to RAF Typhoons, including 38 new systems and modifications to two test systems.

The radars will simultaneously detect, identify and track multiple targets in the air and on the ground.

The government said the technology will ensure the RAF maintains its operational advantage in contested environments by providing high-powered jamming capability whilst engaging targets beyond the reach of threats.

Scotland Secretary Douglas Alexander said: ""This GBP453 million contract award to build state-of-the-art radar systems for Typhoon fighter jets shows just how vital Scottish expertise is to the UK's national security, and why Scotland is globally recognised as a centre of defence excellence.

""This upgrade to the RAF fleet – sustaining 300 jobs at Leonardo in Edinburgh and many more in the supply chain – is the latest in an impressive line of defence dividend wins for Scotland.

""The UK government is transforming our defence sector into an even more powerful engine for growth, because when we back our service personnel and Scottish industry, we keep ourselves and our allies secure whilst delivering skilled jobs and growth for communities and workers.""

Mark Stead, senior vice-president of radar and advanced targeting at Leonardo UK, said: ""ECRS Mk2 isn't just an exceptional radar – it's equipped with advanced electronic surveillance and electronic attack capabilities which will make RAF's Typhoons more potent against their adversaries, adapting to new and unpredictable threats.

""This contract secures 300 highly skilled jobs at Leonardo's Edinburgh site, and 100 at our Luton site.

""As well as supporting over 71 UK-based suppliers, we hope ECRS Mk2 will see wider adoption by other Typhoon export users given its advanced capabilities against current and future threats.""

The UK government committed to continue upgrading RAF Typhoons as part of its strategic defence review, and the planes are set to continue protecting British skies until at least the 2040s.

George Noble says 'the low-hanging fruit is gone'

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman pictured on February 3, 2025. Ex-Fidelity manager George Noble says the AI researcher is ""falling apart in real time.""

Bearing the brunt of Tuesday's steep 2% retreat in the S&P 500 was tech, as the Magnificent 7 shed a collective $683 billion in market cap, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Our call of the day from ex-Fidelity manager George Noble warns of an ""astronomical"" risk profile from adjacent investment plays to AI researcher and developer OpenAI.

Flagging his post on X was ""The Big Short's"" Michael Burry, a steady critic of the AI boom who shot to fame for accurately calling the housing bust. ""This is not surprising and will not end with OpenAI,"" he said of Noble's post.

A respected Wall Street veteran, Noble's career began in the early 1980s at Fidelity, where he worked alongside legendary investor Peter Lynch and ran the company's first international fund, the Fidelity Overseas Fund FOSFX, which was the No. 1 fund in the U.S. for several years. He also launched two billion-dollar hedge funds.

Noble's Monday post - ""OPENAI IS FALLING APART IN REAL TIME"" (yes, all caps) - is a rundown of the warning signs he sees over OpenAI, such as rising competition and falling traffic for ChatGPT. He also flags its heavy losses, quoting Deutsche Bank estimates that the company would see $143 billion in cumulative negative cash flow before turning a profit.

""I've watched companies implode for decades. This one has all the warning signs,"" he wrote.

Noble said there's been little discussion of the vast energy needed to keep these AI companies going, saying it will cost five times the energy and money to make models two times better.

""The low-hanging fruit is gone. Every incremental improvement now requires exponentially more computer, more data centers, more power,"" said Noble. Add to that its failures with GPT-5, a ""talent exodus,"" and then a lawsuit by Elon Musk, he said.

""Here's what I think happens next: The AI hype cycle is peaking. The diminishing returns are becoming impossible to hide. Competitors are catching up,"" he said.

""OpenAI needs to generate $200 billion in annual revenue by 2030 to justify their projections. That's 15x growth in five years while costs keep exploding,"" said Noble.

He sees high risk in AI adjacent plays, warning that valuations are way too elevated. ""If you're exposed to the Magnificent 7 through AI infrastructure bets, consider trimming. The gap between promised revolution and delivered reality has never been wider,"" he says.

""The smart money is rotating into sectors where valuations actually reflect fundamentals. Small and midcaps are trading near decade lows relative to Big Tech while earnings growth is only marginally lower,"" he said. ""Markets can price risk, but they can't price chaos.""

Echoing concerns by others over the U.S.-Greenland feud, Noble wrote in a separate post on X that Big Tech is in trouble if Europe rolls out its Anti-Coercion Instrument or ""trade bazooka.""

""$108 billion in counter-tariffs. Plus restrictions on U.S. services, procurement access, regulatory approvals, and IP protections. This hits Big Tech, financial services, and the digital economy where U.S. dominance actually lives,"" he said.

""Smart money is repositioning: Trimming U.S. large-caps. Adding gold and silver. Building positions that don't require transatlantic trade stability. Again: NOT because Greenland matters... But because when foreign policy becomes a domestic political release valve, and trade partners respond with credibility wars instead of negotiations, you're in uncharted territory,"" he said.

In May 2024, Noble told Fox News that gold was a ""suitable replacement for bonds,"" because the U.S. was ""spending money like drunken sailors."" He flagged SPDR Gold Shares GLD and VanEck Gold Miners ETF GDX at the time as inflation hedges.

In a separate interview in May 2025, he discussed his bearish view on Mag 7 stocks, which would go on to rally following the Liberation Day selloff.

They also point to data showing institutional allocation to stocks - $16 trillion - beat a high seen in 2007 ""and has only been higher in the three quarters preceding the dot-com top."" Finally, foreign investors holding of U.S. stocks jumped to a record $20.8 trillion in the period.

A good starting point is our analysis highlighting investors are optimistic about regarding Ralph Lauren.","Ralph Lauren (RL) drew fresh attention after appointing Cesar Conde, Chairman of NBCUniversal News Group, to its Board of Directors. This move may influence how investors think about the company’s direction.

Ralph Lauren’s latest board appointment comes as the share price trades at $369.58, with a 1-day share price return of 2.6% and a 90-day share price return of 9.9%. Over a longer horizon, the 1-year total shareholder return of 49.45% and 5-year total shareholder return of 305.66% point to strong compounding. This may indicate that positive momentum has been building rather than fading.

If this kind of boardroom shift has caught your attention, it could be a good moment to broaden your search and check out .

With Ralph Lauren trading at $369.58, sitting about 5% below the average analyst price target and following years of strong shareholder returns, investors may ask whether there is still a buying opportunity or if the market is already pricing in future growth.

Price to Earnings of 26.2x: Is it justified?

Ralph Lauren shares last closed at $369.58, and the company is trading on a P/E of 26.2x, which screens as expensive against some benchmarks, despite strong recent returns.

The P/E ratio compares the current share price with earnings per share, so at 26.2x, investors are paying a relatively higher price for each dollar of earnings. For a consumer durables and luxury brand like Ralph Lauren, this often reflects what the market is willing to pay for its profitability profile and brand strength rather than just current earnings alone.

On one hand, Ralph Lauren is described as expensive versus its estimated fair P/E of 18.6x, a level the market could potentially move toward if sentiment cools. On the other hand, the same 26.2x P/E is labelled good value against a peer average of 48.2x, suggesting investors are paying a lower earnings multiple than for some other luxury names even though Ralph Lauren shows high quality earnings and a 33.1% return on equity.

Compared with the broader US Luxury industry, Ralph Lauren’s 26.2x P/E is higher than the industry average of 19.6x, which is a strong premium. That premium sits alongside its high return on equity and recent profit growth, so the market appears willing to pay more for Ralph Lauren’s earnings than for the typical luxury peer.

Result: Price-to-Earnings of 26.2x (OVERVALUED)

However, you also have to weigh risks, such as any slowdown in annual revenue or net income growth or a shift in luxury spending that pressures earnings.

Another View: Cash Flows Point To A Rich Price

Our DCF model takes a different angle by focusing on Ralph Lauren's future cash flows rather than today’s earnings multiple. On this view, the current share price of $369.58 sits above an estimated value of $295.08, which flags the stock as overvalued on cash flow assumptions.

That gap suggests less room for error if growth or margins come in below expectations. It also raises a simple question for you as an investor: are you comfortable paying a premium today for a business the SWS DCF model values lower on its own numbers?

From 31 March 2026, HMRC and Companies House will permanently close their free joint online filing service for company accounts and Corporation Tax returns – commonly known as the CATO portal. Once it’s switched off, you won’t be able to use the service or access any previously submitted returns through it.

From 1 April 2026, all companies will need to use commercial software to file their annual accounts and Corporation Tax return.

For many one-person businesses and micro-companies that currently file for free, this represents a significant shift. With less than three months to go, here’s what you need to know – and how to prepare.

Why is the free service being withdrawn?

HMRC’s official reasons are that the current service:

No longer meets modern digital standards;

Doesn’t align with changes to company law or the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act, which push towards tagged digital accounts and more detailed data from companies.

In practice, this move also fits with HMRC’s wider direction of encouraging businesses to use advisers and recognised software.

While this may improve accuracy, it will inevitably increase costs for small businesses. This will be particularly frustrating for affected businesses given that many inaccuracies stem from the complexity of the tax system itself!

What is changing?

From 1 April 2026:

Corporation Tax

All companies must file their CT600 using HMRC-recognised commercial software.

Accounts to Companies House

For now, accounts can still be filed via Companies House WebFiling, on paper, or through commercial software.

Companies House has been working towards software-only accounts filing from April 2027, although this may yet be scaled back following concerns raised by small business groups about cost and data disclosure. Watch this space.

What is certain is that the free joint filing portal will close on 31 March 2026, and Corporation Tax filing will move entirely to paid third-party software from that point.

What should you do next?

If you already use an accountant or commercial software to file your company accounts and tax returns, you’re unlikely to notice much difference.

However, if you currently file your returns yourself using the CATO portal, you should start preparing now.

Download and securely save at least the last three years of tax returns before 31 March 2026 – you won’t be able to access them afterwards.

Treat 31 March 2026 as a hard deadline. HMRC has provided a list of commercial software suppliers that can produce one or more of the elements required for a Company Tax return.

Need Support?

Managing company accounts and Corporation Tax can be complex and time-consuming. If you’d prefer not to deal with the transition yourself, we can prepare and file your annual accounts and company tax returns on your behalf, ensuring everything is accurate, compliant, and submitted on time using the appropriate software.",https://www.cowgills.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/AdobeStock_208067609.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 06:39:14.188404

H.H. Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum used a World Economic Forum 2026 panel in Davos to stress that trust, credibility, and values now define soft power. Speaking to global leaders, Sheikha Latifa linked storytelling, culture, and lived practice to how countries and cities shape influence in a fragmented world.

The session, held at the Congress Centre in Davos and livestreamed worldwide, formed part of the World Economic Forum’s 2026 programme. Titled ‘Stories and Strength,’ it examined how narratives guide confidence, cooperation, and resilience across governments, markets, and societies, especially as geopolitical and economic competition intensifies.

The panel brought together senior voices from business and media alongside H.H. Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed. Maurice Lévy, Emeritus Chairman of Publicis Groupe and Chair of the France Community of Chairpersons, and Richard W. Edelman, Chief Executive Officer of Edelman, joined the discussion. Brendan Vaughan, Editor-in-Chief of Fast Company, moderated the session and focused debate on innovation and influence.

H.H. Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed explained that soft power in a polarised global landscape no longer comes from scale or force. It grows from credibility that is earned, not claimed. She pointed to integrity, consistency, and authenticity as the key conditions for sustaining trust when audiences face many competing messages.

""When we speak of soft power at the city level, it must begin with a purpose that goes beyond the institution itself to genuinely serve people and society. Once that purpose is clear, the responsibility is to act with integrity, authenticity, and consistency. Regardless of external pressures or changing circumstances, trust is built when values remain steady, and actions align with intent.""

Sheikha Latifa stated that actions carry more weight than visibility in this environment. When values are lived through policies and conduct, credibility follows. When they are only communicated, trust weakens. She linked this view to how leadership decisions shape public confidence and long-term partnerships across borders.

Drawing on the UAE’s record, H.H. Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed said the country’s soft power is rooted in daily practice rather than promotion. Residents from 195 nationalities live side by side, coming from different cultural, religious, and socio-economic backgrounds. They are able to speak their languages, follow their religions, and celebrate their cultures in public life.

She highlighted that this environment is guided by leadership that promotes deep respect and openness towards other traditions. According to Sheikha Latifa, this approach creates strong belonging and shared ownership of the emirate’s success. People can live, work, and contribute while feeling valued for who they are, not just for their roles.

At the centre of Sheikha Latifa’s reflections was the link between heritage and openness. She described this balance as central to how the UAE defines its identity and manages its diversity in practice, especially as more cultures and viewpoints interact every day in the country’s cities and communities.

""UAE is home to people from many cultures and nationalities; as Emiratis, we carry a deep responsibility to ensure that every voice feels seen and valued. UAE is often recognised for being forward-thinking, innovative, and progressive, but what truly defines us is our deep-rooted culture and traditions. We live our values every day in how we dress, how we welcome others, and how we interact with one another through hospitality, respect, and integrity. These values shape the fabric of our society and create a ripple effect across our communities. With so many stories and perspectives coexisting in one place, the unifying principle is a shared belief in collective success. In the UAE, when one person succeeds, that success is felt by all, and it is this spirit of mutual uplift that strengthens our society,"" H.H. Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed said.

World Economic Forum Davos 2026 culture, creativity and storytelling

H.H. Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed also described culture and creativity as powerful bridges between societies at the World Economic Forum 2026 discussion. She said creativity encourages curiosity, which she called the opposite of fear. At a time of anxiety and division, curiosity makes people listen, and listening can open a route to understanding.

Sheikha Latifa added that effective storytelling for policy or strategy starts with listening carefully. In her work with the creative and cultural sectors, engagement begins with dialogue. Stakeholders are involved from the start, their challenges are mapped, and solutions are designed jointly across government entities and private organisations to build shared ownership.

Reflecting on how the UAE presents its story internationally, H.H. Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed said credibility always starts with delivery. She noted that trust comes when governments and institutions meet commitments rather than issue statements. Clear expectations from the UAE’s leadership require that each strategy produces measurable outcomes with defined accountability.

""The guiding purpose behind everything we do is the happiness and well-being of people; it is this principle that shapes our decisions and informs how we engage with the world,"" she said.

The panel formed part of the wider World Economic Forum summit programme, held under the theme ‘A Spirit of Dialogue.’ The theme calls for renewed cooperation and rebuilding trust as global systems face complexity and fast change. Narrative, trust, and dialogue were presented as linked tools for navigating this environment.

H.H. Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed’s role in Davos 2026 marked the second year in which Sheikha Latifa led the UAE delegation to the World Economic Forum, after heading the delegation in 2025. This ongoing presence signals the UAE’s intention to contribute views grounded in culture, collaboration, and human connection to international discussions.

Her engagement at the World Economic Forum 2026 underlined how the UAE pairs its internal experience of diversity and heritage with a wider global dialogue on soft power and storytelling. By aligning values, policies, and narratives, the UAE aims to build trust-based relationships while navigating a more complex and competitive international landscape.

According to the FDA website, Boston Scientific sent a letter on Dec. 19, 2025, to all affected customers recommending the immediate halt of use and distribution of any remaining impacted devices.

Boston Scientific reported that certain AXIOS Stent and Electrocautery-Enhanced Delivery Systems have shown increased reports of difficulty with stent deployment and expansion.

These complications arise at the time of delivery and do not affect stents that have already been successfully implanted.

In some cases, difficulty deploying the stent may extend procedure times and require the device to be replaced. If the first flange fails to deploy or expand, additional endoscopic or surgical intervention may be necessary to remove the stent and close the puncture site.

The AXIOS Electrocautery-Enhanced Stent and Delivery System is used to enable endoscopic drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts or walled-off necrosis.

Certain models are also indicated for gallbladder drainage in high-risk patients with acute cholecystitis who are not suitable candidates for surgery.

The company instructed facilities to remove the products from inventory, segregate them in a secure location, and arrange for their return.

The agency emphasized that patients with successfully implanted AXIOS stents should continue standard follow-up care, as the reported issue occurs only during delivery, not after implantation.

Boston Scientific also advised healthcare providers to prominently post the notification near affected products to ensure visibility for all users and handlers.

While this programming model offers flexibility, it often results in repetitive boilerplate code.

This post explains the shift from this API to the new CUB single-call API introduced in CUDA 13.1, which simplifies development by managing memory under the hood without sacrificing performance.

What is CUB?

If you need to run a standard algorithm (such as scan, histogram, or sort) on a GPU, CUB is likely the fastest way to do it. As a principal component of the NVIDIA CUDA Core Compute Libraries (CCCL), CUB is designed to abstract away the complexity of manual CUDA thread management without sacrificing performance.

While libraries like Thrust provide a high-level, “host-side” interface similar to the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) for quick prototyping, CUB provides a set of “device-side” primitives. This enables developers to integrate highly optimized algorithms directly into their own custom kernels. To learn how to use CUB, check out the NVIDIA DLI course Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with Modern CUDA C++.

The existing CUB two-phase API

CUB is widely recommended for harnessing the full computational capabilities of NVIDIA GPUs. Nevertheless, it carries some intricacies in its usage that may feel non-trivial. This section takes a step back to put these underlying mechanisms in perspective.

A straightforward, single-pass execution flow is often assumed, where a single-call to a function primitive suffices to execute the underlying algorithm and retrieve the results right after. The function’s side effects, such as modifying a variable or returning a result, are expected to be immediately visible to the next statement.

The CUB execution model diverges from this familiar single-pass pattern. Invoking a CUB primitive is a two-step process that requires first calculating the necessary device memory size (the first call), and second, explicitly allocating and then executing the kernel (the second call).

The following is a conventional CUB call:

// FIRST CALL: determine temporary storage size cub::DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum(nullptr, temp_storage_bytes, d_input, d_output, num_items); // Allocate the required temporary storage cudaMalloc(&d_temp_storage, temp_storage_bytes); // SECOND CALL: run the actual scan cub::DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum(d_temp_storage, temp_storage_bytes, d_input, d_output, num_items);

The CUB interface introduces a practical challenge. The primitives must be invoked twice: first to determine the amount of temporary memory needed, and then a second time to execute the actual algorithm with the allocated storage.

A significant drawback of the traditional two-phase API is the lack of clarity regarding which arguments must remain consistent between the estimation and execution steps. Taking the snippet above for reference, it’s not programmatically clear which parameters influence the internal state and can change between the calls, because the function signatures for both phases are identical. For example, the d_input and d_output arguments are only actually being used during the second call.

Despite its intricacies, the existing design serves the following fundamental purpose: by keeping allocation separated from execution, the user can allocate a chunk of memory and reuse it multiple times or even share between different algorithms.

While this design is important for a non-negligible subset of users, the overall user base leveraging this feature is rather limited. That is why many users wrap their CUB calls, to abstract away the two-step invocation required for every use. PyTorch is a case in point, which employs macros to wrap its CUB invocations into single-calls and provide automatic memory management.

The following source code is from the pytorch/pytorch GitHub repo:

// handle the temporary storage and 'twice' calls for cub API #define CUB_WRAPPER(func, ...) do { \ size_t temp_storage_bytes = 0; \ AT_CUDA_CHECK(func(nullptr, temp_storage_bytes, __VA_ARGS__)); \ auto& caching_allocator = *::c10::cuda::CUDACachingAllocator::get(); \ auto temp_storage = caching_allocator.allocate(temp_storage_bytes); \ AT_CUDA_CHECK(func(temp_storage.get(), temp_storage_bytes, __VA_ARGS__));\ } while (false)

The use of macros presents its own drawbacks, as they can obscure control flow and parameter passing, resulting in opaque code that is difficult to understand and significantly hinders debugging.

The new single-call CUB API

Given the wide usage of wrappers throughout many production codebases, there is a recognized need to extend CUB by introducing the new single-call API:

// SINGLE CALL: allocation and execution on a single step cub::DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum(d_input, d_output, num_items);

The example shows that no explicit memory allocation is required. Note that the allocation process is still occurring under the hood, nevertheless. Figure 1 shows that the single-call interface—which includes temporary storage estimation, memory allocation, and invoking the algorithm—introduces zero overhead compared to the two-phase API.

Figure 1 compares the GPU runtime for the original two-phase ExclusiveSum call against the newly introduced single-phase call. The x-axis represents multiple input sizes, while the y-axis shows the normalized execution time for each type of invocation. Two major conclusions drawn from this performance data:

The new API introduces zero overhead

Memory allocation remains under the new API; it just happens under the hood

The second point can be verified by peeking inside the implementation of the new API. Asynchronous allocation is embedded within the device primitive:

cub::DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum(d_input, d_output, num_items, env = {}) { . . . d_temp_storage = mr.allocate(stream, bytes); mr.deallocate(stream, d_temp_storage, bytes); . . . }

The two-phase APIs have not been removed—those are still valid calls of existing CUB APIs. Rather, the single-phase calls are added on top of existing APIs. It’s expected that the majority of users will use these.

The environment and memory resources

Beyond resolving the problems previously mentioned, the new single-call CUB API also expands the execution configuration capabilities of the invoked primitive. It introduces an environment argument, which can either customize memory allocation using memory resources or just provide a stream to execute on (like the two-phase API).

Memory resources are a new memory utility for allocating and freeing memory. The environment argument to single-call APIs can optionally contain a memory resource. When a memory resource is not provided using the environment argument, the API will use a default memory resource provided by CCCL. Conversely, you can elect to pass one of the non-default CCCL memory resources provided as part of the codebase, or even pass your own custom memory resource.

// Use CCCL-provided memory resource type cuda::device_memory_pool mr{cuda::devices[0]}; cub::DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum(d_input, d_output, num_items, mr);

// Create and use your custom MR my_memory_resource my_mr{cuda::experimental::devices[0]}; // Use it with CUB cub::DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum(d_input, d_output, num_items, my_mr);

With the new API, the execution CUDA stream handling is not alleviated but rather encapsulated within the new env variable. Of course it can also be passed explicitly as before, even if temp allocation handling is removed. CUB now also provides cuda::stream_ref that is type safe and its usage should be preferred. You can also pass cuda::stream which owns the underlying execution stream.

Combining execution options

The single-call API enables more than just passing a memory resource or a stream as a last argument. Going forward, the environment argument will be the place for all execution-related knobs, including deterministic requirements, guarantees, user-defined tunings, and much more.

With the introduction of the single-pass API, CUB has unlocked a massive suite of execution configuration features. With the plethora of new execution features, the question becomes: What is the best way to combine them all?

The solution lies in the new env argument. By leveraging cuda::std::execution, CUB provides a central endpoint that acts as a flexible “control panel” for your algorithm. Instead of rigidly defined function arguments, the environment enables you to create a combinatorial mix of any features you need. Whether you want to pair a custom stream with a specific memory pool, or combine strict deterministic requirements with a custom tuning policy, the env argument handles it all in a single, type-safe object.

cuda::stream custom_stream{cuda::device_ref{0}}; auto memory_prop = cuda::std::execution::prop{cuda::mr::get_memory_resource, cuda::device_default_memory_pool(cuda::device_ref{0})}; auto env = cuda::std::execution::env{custom_stream.get(), memory_prop}; DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum(d_input, d_output, num_items, env);

CUB currently provides the following algorithms that support the environment interface, with more to come:

The company's shares have outpaced broader equities over this period.

However, a lot is changing within Intuitive Surgical's competitive landscape. Can the medical device leader still perform well over the next five years? Let's find out how things might unfold for the company through 2031.

The da Vinci 5 will make progress

Intuitive Surgical is best known for its da Vinci systems, robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) devices that help physicians perform minimally invasive surgical procedures. In 2024, the company earned clearance for the fifth generation of this famous system. The rollout of the da Vinci 5 is still ongoing, but over the next five years, we could see it gain significantly more traction. Intuitive Surgical will launch software updates and other upgrades for the da Vinci 5 based on real-world data and physician feedback. The device should also earn additional indications for its use over the years.

This matters for Intuitive Surgical's prospects, as it will help boost its installed base and procedure volume, which are important drivers of revenue growth. Intuitive Surgical makes the majority of its revenue from instruments and accessories needed for the da Vinci systems, as well as servicing the devices and training. The more of its devices are out in hospitals and medical offices, the more surgeries are performed with it, and the more instruments and accessories it sells, and the more servicing and training are needed. Intuitive Surgical's work with the da Vinci 5 should be an important thing to watch over the next five years, though its older devices will still play a role.

There will be even more competition

Intuitive Surgical has had little competition over the past couple of decades. That is now changing. Last year, Medtronic received U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance for its Hugo RAS system for urologic procedures, an indication for which the da Vinci system is also approved. Medtronic won't stop there. It is already running additional clinical trials, including in hernia repair, to expand the device's approved indications.

By 2031, Medtronic's Hugo will likely have a much longer list of approved indications. Then there is Johnson & Johnson, which is inching closer to earning approval for its own robot device, the Ottava system. These new devices could steal some market share from Intuitive Surgical and put pressure on revenue and earnings growth over the next five years.

Is Intuitive Surgical stock a buy?

Even with mounting competition, Intuitive Surgical could produce strong returns over the medium term. Here are two reasons why. First, the RAS market is underpenetrated. More competition might help drive broader adoption of robot systems, which would be good for Intuitive Surgical and its peers. Second, Intuitive Surgical arguably benefits from a wide moat. It already has a vast installed base and real-world data demonstrating its value for patient outcomes.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F851078%2Fphysicians-in-an-operating-room.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-21 19:02:20.854773

It elevated search into a new sphere and gave billions of people the tools to ask anything.

Unsurprisingly, many of these queries concerned health. According to OpenAI, more than 230 million people worldwide ask ChatGPT health- or wellness-related questions weekly. Yet, this unprecedented access to health advice hasn’t been without its controversies.

There are ethical concerns around accountability, inaccurate information, the threat of hallucinations, a lack of contextual awareness, and transparency. And there are the obvious security, compliance, and privacy concerns that come with unsolicited health information.

Now, OpenAI is addressing these issues by announcing the upcoming launch of a dedicated health experience, ChatGPT Health, grounded in two core concepts: security and expert guidance.

ChatGPT Health

OpenAI describes ChatGPT Health as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together, to help you feel more informed, prepared, and confident navigating your health.”

The ChatGPT Health experience is a dedicated feature within the ChatGPT interface that provides additional layers of protection for users. It includes built-in safety measures and conversation isolation features, ensuring that health discussions remain separate from other chats. Users can also connect wellness apps, such as Apple Health, and access their medical records.

OpenAI says that the purpose of ChatGPT Health is not to replace medical care, diagnose conditions, or provide treatment plans. Instead, it is designed to assist users with everyday health questions and monitor health patterns over time as a supportive resource.

AI Agent & Copilot Summit is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents. Building on its 2025 success, the 2026 event takes place March 17-19 in San Diego. Get more details.

Ethics and Security

While conversations within ChatGPT already benefit from blanket encryption, ChatGPT Health introduces purpose-built encryption and isolation, ensuring that no data is used for model training. Furthermore, users can enhance access security by deploying multi-factor authentication (MFA). For secure access to U.S. medical records, OpenAI has partnered with b.well, a leading connected healthcare provider.

From an ethical standpoint, OpenAI has developed ChatGPT Health alongside more than 260 physicians who have practiced in 60 countries. Collectively, these physicians have provided OpenAI with feedback on “model outputs over 600,000 times across 30 areas of focus.” This expert guidance has helped OpenAI to develop ChatGPT Health into a service that not only has an inexhaustible knowledge base, but can respond in a manner that prioritizes safety, delivers clear advice, and understands the context of when to suggest follow-up with a registered clinician.

Outputs are measured against the HealthBench framework, developed by OpenAI in collaboration with medical professionals. This framework ensures that responses are evaluated using physician-developed rubrics that incorporate essential criteria for answers, rather than relying on basic Q&A.

Closing Thoughts

There was no doubt that users would quickly turn to ChatGPT to ask health-related questions. In 2022, the same year ChatGPT was launched, a study by The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) found that 58.5% of adults used the internet to find health or medical information.

However, with the emergence of GenAI, the depth of knowledge available instantaneously, as well as the way users actively seek advice, has changed both the methods and consequences of delivering online health information. The AI Era is constantly evolving. What matters most is that companies leading the field adapt to these changes, remain responsive to user feedback, and sometimes even make U-turns. They must evolve their services to create an ecosystem of AI tools that prioritize user safety, privacy, and agency and to that end, OpenAI is making major strides.",https://cloudwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/OpenAI.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:45:32.747725

Supergoop! Sunscreen Hit With False Ad Class Action Claiming ""Mineral"" Products Contain ""Unnatural"" Ingredients

FTC Sets Aside Rytr Order, Finding Prior Order Was Not Supported by the Complaint

New York AG Scrutinizes Instacart's Algorithmic Pricing Practices

On January 8, 2026, the New York Attorney General's Office sent a formal information request to Instacart seeking details about its pricing practices and compliance with New York's recently enacted Algorithmic Pricing Disclosure Act. The AG's letter follows a December 2025 report by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative alleging that Instacart users were shown materially different prices for identical products at the same stores and at the same time.

The AG's letter raises concerns that Instacart's pricing experiments—and the tools it offers to retailers and CPG brands—may constitute ""personalized algorithmic pricing"" under New York law, which requires a clear and conspicuous disclosure whenever an algorithm sets prices using personal data. The Attorney General specifically questions whether Instacart's current disclosures, which appear only through fine-print links on certain pages, satisfy the statute's disclosure requirements.

Although Instacart has publicly stated that it ended item-level price testing in December and that its testing did not rely on personal or behavioral data, the AG notes that Instacart has also acknowledged that retail and brand partners may continue to test promotions and discounts on the platform. The letter seeks extensive information about Instacart's pricing tools (including Eversight and smart cart technology), agreements with retailers and brands, the scope of any price experiments, and how consumer data may be used in pricing or promotions.

Why it matters: This inquiry signals heightened enforcement attention on algorithmic pricing and transparency—particularly where platforms, retailers, or brands rely on automated tools to test prices, discounts, or promotions. Companies operating in New York should carefully evaluate whether any pricing variability could be viewed as ""personalized algorithmic pricing"" and whether disclosures are sufficiently clear, prominent, and consistently presented wherever prices are displayed.

New York Adopts Two Bills Regulating Commercial Use of AI-Generated Content

New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed two bills on December 11, 2025, that together expand New York's approach to AI transparency and post-mortem rights of publicity in entertainment-adjacent contexts.

Synthetic performers in advertising (S.8420-A / A.8887-B). The first law amends New York's General Business Law to require a clear and conspicuous disclosure when an advertisement includes an AI-generated ""synthetic performer."" The law includes carveouts for certain audio advertisements and for situations where AI is used solely to translate the language of a human performer, and it generally does not apply to ads or promotional materials for certain expressive works (e.g., films/TV/streaming/video games) where the use of the synthetic performer is consistent with its use in the expressive work. A first violation may result in a $1,000 civil penalty, with $5,000 for subsequent violations. The disclosure requirement becomes effective 180 days after enactment (approximately June 2026, based on the December 11, 2025, signing).

Post-mortem name/image/likeness and digital replicas (S.8391 / A.8882). The second law strengthens New York's right of publicity framework by requiring consent from heirs or executors for the commercial use of a deceased individual's name, image, or likeness after death. In addition, it updates the definitions and liability standards applicable to digital replicas—including tightening the rules for using a deceased performer's digital replica in certain expressive works by moving from a disclaimer-oriented approach toward a prior-consent model. The bill takes effect immediately.

Key Takeaways

These bills illustrate an accelerating state-level push to address AI-enabled impersonation and consumer confusion in advertising while simultaneously expanding protections against unauthorized post-mortem commercialization. For advertisers and studios, the practical compliance focus is (i) auditing whether campaigns use synthetic performers (and whether an exception applies), (ii) building disclosure into production workflows ahead of the June 2026 effective date, and (iii) obtaining appropriate rights and permissions—particularly where a campaign uses a deceased individual's identity or a digital replica in a way that could trigger New York's consent requirements.

Supergoop! Sunscreen Hit With False Ad Class Action Claiming ""Mineral"" Products Contain ""Unnatural"" Ingredients

Supergoop! was the target of a proposed California class action alleging that its marketing of certain sunscreen products as ""100% Mineral"" and ""Mineral"" is false and misleading under state consumer protection laws.

According to the complaint, the plaintiff alleges that reasonable consumers interpret ""100% Mineral"" claims to mean that the entire product formula, not just the active sunscreen ingredients, consists solely of mineral or natural ingredients and does not contain synthetic, chemically altered, or otherwise non-mineral components. The plaintiff further alleges that Supergoop's use of ""100% Mineral"" language creates a net impression that the products are free from non-mineral or highly processed ingredients.

This complaint challenges labeling and marketing for more than a dozen Supergoop sunscreen products sold nationwide, including products marketed for adults and children. Plaintiff alleges that, contrary to the challenged representations, the products contain numerous non-mineral ingredients. In addition, the complaint asserts that certain ingredients derived from minerals or natural sources have been subjected to significant chemical processing or modification, resulting in ingredients that are materially different from their original mineral or natural form.

The lawsuit asserts claims under California's Unfair Competition Law and False Advertising Law and seeks restitution, injunctive relief, punitive damages, and attorneys' fees on behalf of a proposed statewide class of California purchasers. Supergoop denies the allegations, and the case is in its early stages.

Key Takeaways

The case reflects continued litigation risk around ""100%"", ""free-of,"" ""natural,"" and ""mineral"" claims—particularly where plaintiffs argue that consumers reasonably interpret such claims to apply to an entire formulation rather than discrete components. While some courts have been open to crediting reasonable consumers with the ability to read ingredient declarations, this isn't universal and frequently turns on the specifics of the label. One thing is certain, which is that ingredient-based claims remain the most common risk point for CPG claims. Brands can manage this risk through thoughtful use of qualifiers and marketing copy.

FTC Sets Aside Rytr Order, Finding Prior Order Was Not Supported by the Complaint

The Federal Trade Commission has reopened and set aside its December 2024 consent order against Rytr LLC, concluding that the complaint underlying the order failed to plead facts sufficient to support a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act.

Rytr offers an AI-enabled writing assistance service, including functionality that could be used to generate draft consumer reviews. In 2024, the FTC alleged that this service provided the ""means and instrumentalities"" for deception and constituted an unfair practice because it could generate large volumes of reviews without regard to accuracy. Rytr agreed to settle those allegations through a consent order that broadly barred it from offering any AI-enabled service designed to generate consumer reviews or testimonials.

In its December 2025 Order Reopening and Setting Aside the 2024 Order, the Commission determined that the complaint did not adequately plead either theory of liability. With respect to the means-and-instrumentalities claim, the FTC concluded that the complaint failed to allege that Rytr itself created deceptive marketing content, that its service was inherently deceptive, or that Rytr knew or had reason to know its customers would use the tool to violate the law. The Commission emphasized that providing a general-purpose tool with legitimate, pro-consumer uses—such as assisting users in drafting or editing review content—does not, without more, establish liability under Section 5.

The FTC also concluded that the complaint failed to plead an unfairness violation. The allegations did not establish that Rytr's service caused or was likely to cause substantial consumer injury, nor did they plausibly allege that any such injury outweighed countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Because the complaint failed to plead a cognizable Section 5 violation, the Commission found that the consent order provided no consumer benefit and was therefore not in the public interest.

In reaching this conclusion, the FTC also cited recent federal policy directives calling on agencies to review and, where appropriate, set aside final orders that unduly burden artificial intelligence innovation. The Commission stressed, however, that its decision rested on the legal insufficiency of the complaint itself. The FTC reiterated that it would continue to pursue enforcement where AI tools are used to deceive consumers or where companies misrepresent the capabilities or outputs of AI-enabled products.

Key Takeaways

The FTC's decision reflects both legal pleading concerns and a broader policy shift favoring AI innovation.

While the Commission grounded its analysis in Section 5 doctrine, the Order repeatedly cites Executive Order 14179 and the Administration's AI Action Plan, suggesting that current federal AI policy materially informed the public-interest analysis.

The outcome should not be read as a blanket rejection of means-and-instrumentalities theories.

The FTC's criticism focused on the specific allegations pleaded against Rytr and the nature of its AI tool; it remains unclear whether the Commission would apply the same analysis to non-AI companies or to tools with fewer legitimate consumer uses.

General-purpose AI tools appear to receive particular solicitude under the current framework.

The Commission emphasized that Rytr's product had pro-consumer applications and rejected theories premised on hypothetical misuse, but it is uncertain whether products outside the AI context—or AI tools marketed more aggressively for consumer-facing claims—would be treated similarly.

The Order narrows—but does not eliminate—unfairness and scienter theories in the AI context.

The FTC signaled skepticism toward speculative harm and attenuated knowledge allegations, yet stopped short of announcing new standards, leaving open how future complaints may be pleaded to address these deficiencies.

The decision is best viewed as fact- and moment-specific rather than a durable safe harbor.

Companies should be cautious about extrapolating broadly from Rytr, particularly given the role of current executive policy and the possibility that a future Commission could revisit similar conduct under a different enforcement posture.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.7498_5140.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 17:05:19.636862

What powered that gap: strong underwriting profits (with a P&C combined ratio below 91%), robust investment income benefiting from higher interest rates, disciplined cost control, and shareholder returns (dividends and buybacks).

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

AXA has kept growth steady rather than flashy, with consistent mid-single–digit topline growth. In 2024, it grew gross written premiums and other revenues by 7% and increased underlying earnings per share (UEPS) by 8%.

Management’s “Unlock the Future” plan targets 6%–8% UEPS CAGR through 2026. The building blocks are pretty clear: pricing actions in P&C, favorable net flows in Life & Savings, and the €0.5 billion acquisition of Prima to strengthen its direct franchise in Italy.

Other growth drivers include continued rate increases in P&C, expansion in higher-growth markets (Asia and North America), digital distribution initiatives, and selective bolt-on acquisitions to deepen specialist capabilities (for example, climate advisory and cyber insurance).

Quality & Moat

AXA’s moat comes from doing a lot of different insurance businesses, in a lot of different places, at serious scale. That diversification helps smooth out bumps from any single market.

On the balance sheet, AXA reports a Solvency II ratio above 216%, which is a meaningful capital buffer. Profitability also looks strong: return on equity (ROE) is around 16.7% (vs. a sector median of 12.9%), and that’s improved from its five-year average of 11.6%.

Return on invested capital (ROIC) is more modest at 1.2%, but still above the sector median, pointing to efficient capital use in select lines.

AXA has also been returning cash to shareholders aggressively: over €5 billion of share buybacks in 2025 and a 9% dividend increase. That supports free cash flow generation and helps explain the current 5.3% dividend yield.

Valuation

AXAHF trades at a P/E of approximately 10.4x trailing earnings and 10.0x forward earnings. That’s below sector medians of about 14x and 12.1x, respectively.

On other measures, the discount shows up too: price/sales is 0.83x (vs. the market average of 4.48x), and price/free cash flow (P/FCF) is 3.8x, sitting at a multi-year low.

That cheaper price can be justified by AXA’s conservative underwriting approach and modest ROIC. But it also gives investors a margin of safety, especially if AXA keeps delivering stability and hits its growth targets.

Market Sentiment

Sentiment is upbeat. Of 17 sell-side analysts, 15 rate AXA a Buy, and the average 12-month price target implies about 15% upside.

Positioning looks calm: short interest is negligible at 0% of float. Ownership looks broad too, with over 450 institutional investors holding AXA.

Recent moves — including the Prima acquisition and capital return programs — have landed well with investors. Social media commentary on AXA’s digital initiatives has also stayed constructive.

Key Risks

Underwriting Volatility: AXA’s P&C combined ratio can come under pressure from large natural catastrophes and reserve development. If catastrophe experience is worse than expected, underwriting profits could take a hit.

Interest Rate and Investment Risk: Higher interest rates help investment income, but they can also create mark-to-market losses on fixed-income portfolios. Rates normalizing can also affect client savings products.

Currency Exposure: With major operations across Europe, Asia, and North America, AXA carries FX risk. A strengthening euro, in particular, can weigh on reported earnings in USD.

Regulatory and Capital Requirements: Insurance regulation can shift quickly. Changes such as Solvency II updates could raise capital charges or restrict product offerings, which would affect returns and growth flexibility.

Market Sensitivity: AXAHF is relatively more sensitive to equity market swings, with a beta of 1.45 and volatility of about 33% vs. a 24.6% market average. That can amplify share price drawdowns during downturns.

Bull Case

Attractive Valuation: The stock trades at a multi-year low multiple (about 10x P/E and 0.8x P/S), offering a margin of safety compared with peers.

Strong Capital Position: AXA’s Solvency II ratio above 216% and net debt/EBITDA of zero give it financial flexibility and resilience.

Robust Shareholder Returns: A 5.3% dividend yield plus €5 billion of buybacks in 2025 can support total returns and help offset dilution.

Consistent Profit Growth: AXA targets 6%–8% UEPS CAGR through 2026, supported by P&C pricing, net flows in Life & Savings, and cost efficiency gains.

Global Diversification: Six operating segments spanning mature and higher-growth markets can reduce the impact of regional downturns and create cross-selling opportunities.

Strategic Acquisitions: The Prima Italy acquisition, plus a focus on specialty lines like cyber and climate, expands AXA’s addressable market and can lift margins.

Bear Case

Catastrophe Risk: A surprise spike in natural disasters could damage underwriting profits and push the combined ratio above target.

UK Market Softness: Weaker pricing in UK motor insurance and higher claims frequency may squeeze P&C margins in an important market.

Currency Headwinds: A stronger euro or weaker major emerging-market currencies could reduce translated earnings from overseas operations.

Asset Management Divestiture Impact: Selling AXA IM cuts fee income and may reduce earnings variability, putting pressure on management to replace that income elsewhere.

Regulatory Uncertainty: If the proposed Solvency II recalibration tightens capital rules, AXA could face higher required capital and lower returns.

Economic Downturn: A global slowdown could weaken premium growth, increase lapse rates in savings products, and reduce investment returns.

On Our Radar

Q4 2025 Earnings Release: Scheduled for Feb 26, 2026. Investors will be watching the combined ratio, UEPS growth, and any updated guidance.

Ex-Dividend Date: May 5, 2026. This can affect near-term share demand around the payout.

Integration of Prima Italy: Watch for synergies and net flows from the January 2025 acquisition. Initial results are expected by mid-2026.

Regulatory Developments: The EU consultation on Solvency II reforms is expected in H1 2026, and could change capital requirements.

Investment Conclusion

AXA SA offers a compelling risk-reward setup. Its diversified, scale-driven business and robust balance sheet support steady mid-single–digit earnings growth. At the same time, the stock’s discount to peers and strong capital returns create attractive total return potential.

Still, this isn’t a “set it and forget it” situation. Underwriting volatility, currency swings, and evolving regulation can all move the story — and the share price.

For long-term, income-oriented investors, AXAHF’s 5.3% dividend yield, ongoing buyback programs, and valuation discount may look like an appealing entry point. That appeal needs to be weighed against AXA’s cyclical sensitivities and its dependence on the broader macro backdrop.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2026-01-21 18:02:32.618048

According to a recent filing, Berkshire is seeking to sell its 28 per cent stake in the packaged foods company, marking the end of a decade-long period of underperformance. This move follows Berkshire’s decision last May to relinquish its seats on Kraft Heinz’s board. Kraft Heinz is a global food and beverage company, offering a diverse portfolio of brands.

Abel has already initiated changes within the management team, including the addition of a general counsel, a first for the company in many years. He also oversaw the departure of two key executives.

Furthermore, Berkshire Hathaway is currently holding $US382 billion in cash reserves, which has led to renewed calls from investors for the introduction of a dividend, a move that was historically against Buffett’s policies.

Here's why,"Zev Fima, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/21/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-says-ai-wont-be-the-job-killer-everyone-fears-heres-why.html,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday that artificial intelligence will lead to more jobs, not fewer.
At the heart of the exchange, the CEO of Club name Nvidia said that AI is a platform shift.
Tempering the not-so-irrational fears out there about AI replacing human workers, Jensen offered a more optimistic view.
Asked about investments in AI, Jensen pretty much put to bed the idea of a spending bubble.
We remain in the early stages of the AI infrastructure buildout, before we even start to really think about the application layer of the stack touching every aspect of our daily lives.","Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday that artificial intelligence will lead to more jobs, not fewer. In an interview with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jensen methodically explained how AI differs from other technological innovations of the past and how it can be an incredible engine for economic growth and prosperity. Jensen's sitdown with Fink, who co-chairs the WEF, was a high-level conversation about what AI is and what it is not, and what investments are needed and why, and how much. At the heart of the exchange, the CEO of Club name Nvidia said that AI is a platform shift. Examples of platforms include personal companies, the internet, smartphones, and the cloud — both physical and digital infrastructure that applications that we all use in our daily life are built on top of. Just as those platforms laid the foundation for so much economic growth, so too will AI. While ChatGPT and other large language models may technically be applications themselves, the difference is that new, AI-oriented applications will be built on top of these LLMs. Jensen sees five layers to the buildout of the AI platform: (1) enough energy to run everything; (2) chips/compute infrastructure, where Nvidia dominates; (3) cloud infrastructure/services; (4) AI models; and (5) the application layer, which is the key layer where the economic benefits of AI will be realized. Tempering the not-so-irrational fears out there about AI replacing human workers, Jensen offered a more optimistic view. Outside of the jobs being created by the physical build-out of AI infrastructure — such as electricians, plumbers, construction workers, and so on — Jensen said that implementing AI will lead to more demand for goods and services that, in turn, will lead to more hiring. Not as many employees per customer may be needed, but the customer growth that comes with a more efficient corporation can still result in demand for more workers For example, Jensen said that the number of radiologists has increased because hospitals can now process more patients thanks to AI. While AI may be reading the scans, humans are still needed to review and confirm diagnoses. More patients, more scans to review, more human radiologists needed. The bonus is that with AI doing the scans, the radiologists have more time to spend with patients or to discuss results with peer clinicians. Jevons Paradox ? Seeing a radiologist becomes easier as the radiologist becomes better and more efficient at their job, resulting in an overall increase in demand from patients looking to see radiologists. Radiology was a timely analogy as Club name Bristol Myers Squibb said Tuesday it will work with Microsoft's AI-powered radiology platform to develop and launch imaging algorithms aimed at accelerating early detection of lung cancer. These new tools, which can be used to analyze X-rays and CT scans, will help clinicians see hard-to-spot lung nodules and identify patients with earlier stages of disease. The alliance is the latest way health care and artificial intelligence are rapidly intersecting. On stage with Fink on Wednesday, Jensen noted a similar dynamic in nursing to what's going on in radiology. Nurses spend about half of their time charting. Thanks to AI, however, Jensen said nurses can spend more time visiting patients and providing that human touch that is often lacking when a hospital suffers a staffing shortage. By reducing the nursing bottleneck, hospitals can see more patients more quickly. As a result, more demand for hospitals leads to improved financials and, in turn, the ability to hire more nurses. In Jensen's view, the key to understanding how AI will impact a given job is to first differentiate between the purpose and the task. Going back to the radiology example, he said the purpose of a radiologist is to diagnose patients — and that at the end of the day, the job for both radiologists and nurses is to care for people. Reading charts and scans is crucial to that purpose, but it is a task that needs to be done to achieve the job's ultimate objective. By automating certain tasks, we can make people better at their actual jobs. So, AI, in the context of medical settings, should not result in fewer doctors and nurses, Jensen argued, but should lead to more doctors and nurses spending more time with their patients while providing better outcomes. Asked about investments in AI, Jensen pretty much put to bed the idea of a spending bubble. So, when asked instead if investment levels are too low, he provided an easy way to think about the spending and whether there's a bubble or if more spending is warranted. He said it comes down to the fact that despite millions of Nvidia GPUs (graphics processing units) now available in the cloud, the spot price for GPU rentals is increasing, not only for the latest generation, but even for those chips two generations in the rear view mirror. He attributed this to the number of AI companies being created. When a two-generation-old GPU is seeing its rental price increase, it's clear that supply (overall, not just as it relates to the latest chips) is falling well short of demand. Bottom line While there may be bubble-like areas of the market, that word has no place in the conversation when discussing names like Nvidia or the mega-cap cloud infrastructure players that generate real earnings and trade at reasonable valuations. We remain in the early stages of the AI infrastructure buildout, before we even start to really think about the application layer of the stack touching every aspect of our daily lives.

Dive Brief:

Almost eight in 10 executives believe 2030 will be the year AI starts significantly contributing to enterprise revenue, more than double the number of executives — 40% — who say AI is currently boosting revenues, according to a study published Friday by the IBM Institute for Business Value.

AI investment as a percentage of revenue will more than double over the next four years,but 68% of executives fear that integration issues will cause AI efforts to fail, according to the global study of 2,000 C-suite executives.

Still, AI is anticipated to drive enterprise growth through 2030, the study found. “AI won’t just support businesses, it will define them,” Mohamad Ali, SVP of IBM Consulting, said in a press release.

Dive Insight:

AI’s return on investment remains a question mark for business executives who believe in the technology’s potential, yet struggle to predict when its full value will be realized.

While 2030 appears to be a promising year for AI’s contribution to revenues, only 24% of executives can clearly identify where that revenue will derive from, according to IBM.

Executive views on when new technology investments will pay off vary, with some anticipating only a 27% benefit realization in the next two years, according to a Rimini Street C-suite survey published last month.

Spending on AI is not slowing, despite ROI concerns. In 2026, global AI spend is anticipated to increase 44% year over year to $2.52 trillion, according to a Gartner report. In the enterprise, IBM found that 47% of executives’ AI spend is currently focused on driving productivity and efficiency gains, while 62% believe their AI spend will be dedicated to product and service innovation between 2026 and 2030.

The financial services industry has been heavily investing in AI, with big banks including Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachsbetting on future efficiency gains.

“There’s going to be teething pain on this stuff,” Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick said in the company’s Q4 2025 earnings call. However, the “technological advancement is real,” he added.

Indeed, executives are sold on the value of AI when it comes to bolstering productivity, according to IBM. Surveyed executives expect AI will boost productivity by 42% in the next four years. Two-thirds of leaders expect to realize most AI-driven productivity gains by 2030.

The technology will also redefine leadership roles within the enterprise by 2030, according to 74% of executives surveyed by IBM.

WMT continues to sharpen the strategic edge of its third-party Marketplace by expanding into higher-value, specialized categories, with the launch of a Premium Musical Instrument Shop. While musical instruments represent a relatively small category, the move reflects Walmart Marketplace’s broader push to move beyond everyday essentials and into curated, brand-led verticals that can support faster online growth.

Premium Instruments Join Walmart’s Curated Digital Offerings

The new digital storefront features professional-grade instruments and accessories from globally recognized brands such as Fender, Roland, Boss and Zildjian. The offering spans guitars, amplifiers, pedals, drum accessories and related gear, adding a curated assortment that sits alongside WMT’s broader general merchandise selection. It shows Walmart Marketplace’s effort to add well-known brands in categories where customers care about quality and delivery.

Marketplace strength was evident in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, when Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales increased 28% year over year, driven by Marketplace, advertising and store-fulfilled pickup and delivery. Marketplace-led categories, including electronics, apparel, toys and hardlines, grew more than 40% during the quarter, underscoring the platform’s role in driving general merchandise growth amid a shifting consumer mix.

Marketplace activity is also closely linked to Walmart’s expanding digital revenue streams. In the third quarter, Walmart’s global advertising business grew more than 50%, with U.S. advertising up more than 30%, supported in part by increased seller participation on the Marketplace. Advertising and membership income together represented approximately one-third of consolidated adjusted operating income during the quarter, reflecting the rising contribution of seller-driven services.

The addition of premium musical instruments broadens Marketplace’s category mix while leveraging Walmart’s existing fulfillment and traffic scale. Although the category itself may be relatively small, it aligns with WMT’s focus on strengthening assortment quality and supporting sustained e-commerce growth.

Shares of global pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) jumped 3.5% in the afternoon session after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted a Breakthrough Therapy designation for its drug, sofetabart mipitecan, intended to treat a specific type of ovarian cancer.

This designation aimed to speed up the development and review process for drugs designed to treat serious conditions. It was granted when initial clinical evidence indicated that a drug might offer a significant improvement over available therapies. The treatment targeted adult patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. For investors, this news was positive as it signaled a potentially faster path to market for a promising new treatment, suggesting confidence from regulators in the drug's early results.

After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $1,080, up 3.7% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us

Eli Lilly’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 9 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago when the stock dropped 4.5% on the news that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) delayed its decision on the company's new oral weight-loss pill, Orforglipron. The regulator pushed its decision date to April 10 from a prior expectation of late-March. Markets often react negatively to such postponements as they delay a product's market launch and extend uncertainty over its potential sales, which can limit revenue growth. The drug was part of the administration's fast-track review program, which promised quicker decisions for medicines considered critical to public health.

Eli Lilly is flat since the beginning of the year, and at $1,080 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $1,110 from November 2025.

Walmart currently controls about 21 percent of the U.S. grocery market, data from research firm Numerator shows. Its two biggest challengers are Kroger, which accounts for 8.5 percent of the market, and Costco, which accounts for 8.2 percent. Amazon and Whole Foods, with 1.6 percent each, trail behind the pack.

While an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider these figures “underrepresent” the e-commerce company’s market share, it seems to be on a mission to improve its standing.

Just last week, Amazon announced the launch of its first big-box retail store, which will be located in the suburbs of Chicago. Walmart already operates more than 4,000 big-box stores, including 3,500 supercenter locations and 600 Sam’s Club locations, according to its website.

Risk Disclosures: Investing in the stock market involves risks, including the potential loss of principal. Growth stocks may be more volatile than other stocks as their prices tend to be higher in relation to their companies’ earnings and may be more sensitive to market, political, and economic developments. Investing in companies of medium capitalizations involves the risk that such issuers may have limited product lines or financial resources, lack management depth, or have limited liquidity. Companies involved in, or exposed to, AI-related businesses may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel as they face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence, and many depend significantly on retaining and growing their consumer base. These companies may be substantially exposed to the market and business risks of other industries or sectors, and may be adversely affected by negative developments impacting those companies, industries or sectors, as well as by loss or impairment of intellectual property rights or misappropriation of their technology. Companies that utilize AI could face reputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability, and/or an adverse effect on business operations as content, analyses, or recommendations that AI applications produce may be deficient, inaccurate, biased, misleading or incomplete, may lead to errors, and may be used in negligent or criminal ways. AI technology could face increasing regulatory scrutiny in the future, which may limit the development of this technology and impede the future growth. AI companies, especially smaller companies, tend to be more volatile than companies that do not rely heavily on technology. A significant portion of assets may be invested in securities of companies in related sectors, and may be similarly affected by economic, political, or market events and conditions and may be more vulnerable to unfavorable sector developments. Assets may be focused in a small number of holdings, making them susceptible to risks associated with a single economic, political or regulatory event than a more diversified portfolio. Active trading may increase transaction costs, brokerage commissions, and taxes, which can lower the return on investment. At times, cash may be a larger position in the portfolio and may underperform relative to equity securities.

ETF shares are based on market price rather than net asset value (“NAV”), as a result, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund may also incur brokerage commissions, as well as the cost of the bid/ask spread, when purchasing or selling ETF shares. The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruption in the creation and/or redemption process of the Fund. Any of these factors, among others, may lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV. Thus, you may pay more (or less) than NAV when you buy shares of the Fund in the secondary market, and you may receive less (or more) than NAV when you sell those shares in the secondary market. The Manager cannot predict whether shares will trade above (premium), below (discount) or at NAV. The Fund may affect its creations and redemptions for cash, rather than for in-kind securities. Therefore, it may be required to sell portfolio securities and subsequently recognize gains on such sales that the Fund might not have recognized if it were to distribute portfolio securities in-kind. As such, investments in Fund shares may be less tax-efficient than an investment in an ETF that distributes portfolio securities entirely in-kind. Brokerage fees and taxes will be higher than if the Fund sold and redeemed shares in-kind. Certain shareholders, including other funds advised by the Manager or an affiliate of the Manager, may from time to time own a substantial amount of the shares of the Fund. Redemptions by large shareholders could have a significant negative impact on the Fund.

New York

With a Ph.D. in biology from MIT and the Whitehead Institute, where she was a NSF fellow, Irena represents plaintiffs and defendants in their most complex pharmaceutical and biotech patent cases. Over the last 20 years, pharmaceutical and biotechnology innovators have relied on Irena again and again for cases involving small molecules, biologics, recombinant DNA technology, gene therapy, gene editing, manufacturing processes, formulations and drug-eluting medical devices, including numerous multi-billion dollar cases involving many of the world’s best-selling drugs.

Irena has significant experience in litigation under the Hatch-Waxman Act (ANDA and 505(b)(2) actions) and the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), as well as inter partes review (IPR) proceedings, license disputes and matters with parallel ex-U.S. litigation and proceedings in foreign patent offices. Irena also helps life sciences companies and organizations develop the law in the most important cases for the biopharma industry. She has been principal counsel on numerous amicus briefs to the United States Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit in key biopharma cases.

For plaintiffs, Irena has successfully defended generic challenges to patents protecting blockbuster medical therapies, including multi-billion dollar cancer, antiviral, diabetes and anti-psychotic drugs, including recently obtaining attorneys’ fees in a hard-fought ANDA action. She also represents innovators in biosimilar litigation from its outset, including in some of the first cases under the BPCIA involving antibodies. Irena also represents clients in innovator vs innovator disputes. For defendants, she defeated a $530 million claim of patent infringement of a competitor’s biotech patent, obtaining dismissal of all claims and discovery sanctions against the patent owner. In another high-stakes case, she obtained summary judgment of noninfringement and exclusion of plaintiff’s experts under Daubert as well as a full award of attorneys’ fees. A registered patent attorney, Irena also handles inter partes review (IPR) proceedings. For patent owners, she has obtained denial of IPR for patents protecting blockbuster drugs and has leveraged IPR for defendants to obtain freedom to operate.

Irena also coordinates U.S. proceedings with parallel ex-U.S. litigation and proceedings in foreign patent offices, recently obtaining freedom to operate for a biotech innovator’s gene therapy. She provides strategic counseling in biologics and pharmaceuticals and advises clients on their IP portfolios and transactions. Irena also represents clients in high-stakes license disputes involving biotech patents, and, in a dispute concerning the use of a recombinant protein as an enzyme replacement therapy, obtained one of the largest settlement awards over the life of the contract.

Chambers USA has recognized Irena as a leading lawyer in intellectual property, where clients have described her as “excellent,” “knowledgeable, aggressive,” “knows the science forward and backward” and “an incredibly smart lawyer.” Benchmark Litigation named her one of the “Top 250 Women in Litigation” for the last eight years and a litigation star in intellectual property. Irena was also named to the Crain’s New York Business list of “Notable Women in Law.” She is also recognized as a leading lawyer by Legal 500. Irena writes and lectures widely on biopharma patent issues and biosimilar litigation. Irena also is frequently quoted on patent-related issues, including in the Washington Post, Financial Times, Nature Biotechnology, Bloomberg and Pink Sheet.

The bank ended the year with record net revenue of $28.7 billion, driven by a powerful combination of realized synergies from its MUFG Union Bank acquisition and a sophisticated ""payments-first"" strategy that has significantly decoupled its earnings from the volatility of interest rate cycles. As the financial sector enters 2026, US Bancorp’s results signal a successful pivot from a traditional regional player to a diversified financial services powerhouse.

The year-end performance highlights a bank that has successfully navigated the ""higher-for-longer"" interest rate environment of early 2025 while preparing for the easing cycle that began in the fourth quarter. With a Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) reaching 18.4% and an efficiency ratio improving to 57.4%, the firm has demonstrated that its multi-year investment in digital infrastructure and specialized commercial niches is paying off. This solid finish across consumer and commercial segments sets a high bar for the industry as 2026 begins with shifting macroeconomic expectations.

The Year of Optimization: US Bancorp's 2025 Performance

US Bancorp’s stellar 2025 was not an overnight success but the culmination of a three-year strategic overhaul. The headline figure for the fourth quarter—a record $7.4 billion in quarterly revenue—was supported by an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.26, handily beating the consensus analyst estimate of $1.18. The timeline leading to this moment began in late 2022 with the $8 billion acquisition of MUFG Union Bank from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (NYSE: MUFG). By the end of 2025, the bank had finally fully integrated these operations, capturing the promised $900 million in annual cost synergies and vaulting to the fifth-largest deposit market share in the lucrative California market.

A key player in this success was the bank’s Payment Services division, which emerged as the star performer of 2025. Merchant processing revenue grew 5.0% year-over-year, while credit card fee revenue rose 5.3%, fueled by the bank’s ""Payments Transformation"" initiative. This program effectively embedded payment tools directly into the software used by its 1.4 million small business clients, making US Bancorp as much a fintech provider as a traditional lender. Meanwhile, the Wealth and Institutional Banking segment saw a 7.6% increase in fee income, further diversifying the top line.

Initial market reactions to the year-end report have been overwhelmingly positive. Shares of USB traded up 4.2% in early morning trading following the announcement, as investors cheered the bank's ability to maintain a healthy Net Interest Margin (NIM) of 2.71% even as the broader industry faced narrowing spreads. Analysts noted that the bank’s disciplined underwriting kept its net charge-off ratio at a modest 0.54%, despite lingering concerns about the commercial real estate (CRE) sector that have plagued other mid-sized lenders.

Winners, Losers, and the Battle for the Middle Market

In the wake of US Bancorp’s results, a clear divide is emerging between ""diversified"" regional banks and ""interest-rate-dependent"" peers. US Bancorp stands as a clear winner, alongside larger money-center banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), which also benefit from vast non-interest income streams. By generating 42% of its total revenue from fees—significantly higher than the 30% industry average for regional banks—US Bancorp has insulated its shareholders from the ""NII trap"" where earnings collapse when interest rates fall.

Conversely, the ""losers"" in this environment appear to be smaller regional institutions that lack the scale for significant payment processing or wealth management divisions. Banks heavily concentrated in traditional lending and those with significant exposure to maturing commercial real estate loans may find the 2026 environment challenging. As US Bancorp continues to gain market share in California and the Midwest, these smaller competitors face the prospect of either aggressive consolidation or margin compression as they compete for high-quality deposits.

The middle-market commercial space is also seeing a shift. US Bancorp’s Commercial and Industrial (C&I) loans grew by over 7% in 2025, largely at the expense of regional competitors. By offering a unified platform that combines lending with sophisticated treasury and payment solutions, USB is increasingly winning clients that previously might have utilized multiple smaller banks. This ""one-stop-shop"" appeal is proving to be a formidable competitive advantage in the current economic landscape.

A Shifting Industry Landscape: Beyond the Net Interest Income Trap

US Bancorp’s 2025 performance fits into a broader industry trend toward ""fee-income resiliency."" Historically, regional banks were the most vulnerable to Federal Reserve policy, seeing their margins expand rapidly when rates rose and contract just as quickly when they fell. US Bancorp has provided a blueprint for breaking this cycle. By investing heavily in its Global Fund Services (GFS) and its ""Payments-as-a-Service"" model, the bank has created a revenue stream that is often counter-cyclical or at least rate-neutral.

This shift has significant regulatory and policy implications. As the Federal Reserve moves toward a more accommodative stance in 2026, regulators are closely watching how banks manage the transition. US Bancorp’s stable 34% deposit beta—the rate at which it passes interest rate changes to depositors—suggests that its high-quality, ""sticky"" consumer deposit base from the Union Bank acquisition provides a lower-cost funding source than its peers. This stability is likely to be viewed favorably by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve as they evaluate systemic risk in the post-2023 banking environment.

Historically, US Bancorp’s success mirrors the path taken by Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) in the early 2000s, focusing on deep customer relationships and ""cross-selling"" (now rebranded as ""ecosystem integration""). However, USB has avoided the pitfalls of its predecessors by prioritizing digital transparency and compliance-first growth. The comparison to historical precedents highlights that while the tools have changed—from branch-based cross-selling to software-embedded payments—the fundamental strategy of diversifying revenue remains the gold standard for banking stability.

Looking Toward 2026: Navigating the Easing Rate Cycle

Looking ahead to 2026, the primary challenge for US Bancorp will be managing the transition as the Federal Reserve is expected to implement two to three rate cuts, bringing the benchmark rate toward the 3.50%–3.75% range. The bank has issued a ""cautiously optimistic"" 2026 outlook, forecasting total net revenue growth of 4% to 6% and loan growth of 3% to 4%. Unlike many of its competitors, US Bancorp expects its Net Interest Margin to actually expand in 2026, targeting a NIM of over 2.80%.

This optimistic NIM forecast is based on ""balance sheet remixing."" As fixed-rate loans originated during the ultra-low-rate era of 2020-2021 mature, they are being replaced by new assets with significantly higher yields. Simultaneously, the bank expects to lower its deposit costs more aggressively than its loan yields fall. Furthermore, the bank’s $1 billion acquisition of institutional broker-dealer BTIG, announced in early January 2026, is expected to close in the second quarter. This move is a strategic pivot to capture more capital markets and institutional trading revenue, adding an estimated $175 million to $200 million in quarterly fee revenue by the end of the year.

Strategic adaptations will be required if the economy faces a harder-than-expected landing. While current GDP projections sit at a steady 2.0%, any spike in unemployment could test the bank’s consumer credit card portfolio, which saw balances grow 15.7% in 2025. However, US Bancorp’s management appears confident that their disciplined credit culture will allow them to lean into market opportunities while others are forced to retrench.

A Blueprint for Regional Banking Success

The takeaway from US Bancorp’s 2025 results is clear: scale and diversification are the new prerequisites for regional banking survival. By finishing the year with solid performance in both consumer and commercial segments, and specifically by supercharging its fee-based income, USB has proven it can thrive regardless of the Federal Reserve’s next move. The integration of MUFG Union Bank has not only provided the necessary scale but has also refreshed the bank’s deposit franchise in a way that will pay dividends for years to come.

As the market moves forward into 2026, the significance of US Bancorp’s results lies in its role as a bellwether for the ""super-regional"" class. Investors should watch for the closing of the BTIG deal and the continued expansion of the payments segment as key indicators of whether the bank can maintain its momentum. If US Bancorp can achieve its NIM expansion targets in a falling-rate environment, it will likely be rewarded with a valuation premium that separates it from the rest of the regional banking pack.

Ultimately, US Bancorp enters 2026 from a position of undeniable strength. Its ability to balance the traditional requirements of commercial banking with the high-growth potential of fintech-style payment services makes it a unique entity in the financial landscape. For investors and industry observers, the coming months will reveal if this diversified model can indeed provide the consistent, ""all-weather"" performance that management has promised.

IDC expects PC vendors to increase selling prices as cost pressures intensify in the second half of 2026. IDC expects PC shipments to contract between 2.2% and 8.9% in 2026 compared with 6.6% growth in 2025 due to challenging memory supply issues. So, PC vendors best able to manage their supply chain are expected to benefit in 2026. Nevertheless, rising demand for AI-powered PC is expected to be a key catalyst. So, Apple or HP, which PC vendor is well-positioned to ride these trends?

The Case for Apple Stock

Apple’s Mac business is benefiting from the latest macOS Tahoe 26 and the M5 chip. The company’s macOS Tahoe 26 introduces a stunning new design and powerful capabilities that enable users to get even more done with their Macs. Tahoe 26 offers personalized features, including an updated Control Center and new color options for folders, app icons and widgets. The Phone app on Mac now allows users to access familiar features from iPhone — including Recents, Contacts and Voicemails — and new ones like Call Screening and Hold Assist.

The M5 chip is built using 3 nm technology and introduces a next-generation 10-core GPU architecture, with a Neural Accelerator integrated into each core. This design enables GPU-based AI workloads to run, offering more than four times the peak GPU compute performance of M4. The new GPU also brings enhanced graphics capabilities and third-generation ray tracing, together delivering up to 45% higher graphics performance compared to M4. In October, Apple launched the new 14-inch MacBook Pro, powered by the M5 chip.

Apple’s strong Mac portfolio helped it gain market share in calendar 2025. Per IDC, Apple had a market share of 9%, up 30 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis. Shipment grew 11.1% year over year to hit 25.6 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal Mac sales is currently pegged at $8.43 billion, which indicates 9% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.

Apple’s diversified manufacturing base, which now includes India and Vietnam, is expected to help the iPhone-maker manage its supply chain. The company is now expanding its Apple Manufacturing Academy with new virtual programming as a part of its plan to invest $600 billion in the U.S. economy over the next four years.

The Case for HP Stock

Growing interest in Generative AI-enabled PCs might give a fresh boost to HP’s PC sales. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, AI PCs accounted for more than 30% of HP’s total PC shipments, reaching this milestone a quarter earlier than expected. These devices also deliver 5-10% higher average selling prices (ASPs) than traditional PCs, improving revenue mix and margins. Partnerships with Microsoft, Adobe and Zoom are accelerating adoption, as more applications are optimized for AI functionality. HP expects AI PCs to represent 40-50% of shipments in fiscal 2026, indicating a continued mix shift to richer configurations and higher ASPs.

HP’s forecast for fiscal 2026 PC demand raises concerns about the company’s growth prospects in the near term. The company expects PC unit volumes to fall in fiscal 2026, with only slight revenue growth coming from higher specifications, not from more buyers. The PC demand boost from the Windows 11 upgrade cycle is anticipated to fade in the second half of fiscal 2026, raising concern for investors. Rising DRAM and NAND prices may weigh on HP’s bottom-line performance in fiscal 2026. The company expects about 30-cents hit to non-GAAP earnings from higher memory costs in fiscal 2026.

Per IDC, HPQ had a market share of 20.2%, up 10 bps on a year-over-year basis in calendar 2025. Shipment grew 8.4% year over year to hit 57.5 million.

Earnings Estimate Revision Trend Positive for AAPL & HP

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HPQ’s fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $3.00 per share, down by 15 cents over the past 60 days, indicating an 4% decrease over fiscal 2025’s reported figure.

Albertsons Media Collective announced in early January the launch of an in-store measurement system designed to assess the incremental sales impact of in-store advertising. The company said the approach uses a matched-market framework to compare sales results at stores running in-store ads with a control group of stores that do not display advertising. The method aims to isolate the effect of advertising by estimating how sales would have performed without media exposure.

Ahold Delhaize USA is expected to launch Edge, a custom-built advertising technology platform, this month. The platform will create new ways for consumer packaged goods suppliers to connect with the more than 26 million shoppers who interact with Ahold Delhaize USA banners each week through on-site display, sponsored search and in-store digital screens.

Is the retail media market entering a new phase of development and maturity? Coresight believes so and says 2026 will mark a critical inflection point. The firm attributes this shift to the need for existing retail media networks to scale more effectively and to growing advertiser demand for stronger performance, improved capabilities and greater standardization.

The global advisory and research firm released its “10 Trends Driving Retail Media” report on Jan. 9, grouping the trends into three categories: retail media platform expansion and channel evolution; technology, data and measurement transformation; and market structure and organizational realignment. The trends span topics ranging from in-store media to AI-driven ad formats.

1. Retail media networks expand beyond incrementality to support full-funnel advertising: As retail media networks improve audience reach, frequency control and insight into shopper behavior, brands are likely to increase their use of retail media for brand-building objectives.

2. In-store media accelerates as the next major retail media growth frontier: By 2026, retailers will expand in-store media through deeper partnerships with signage and content platforms and use AI to tailor messages to real-time traffic and shopper behavior. As cross-retailer frameworks link in-store impressions to basket-level outcomes, standardized measurement will strengthen advertiser confidence.

3. Closed-circuit television (CTV) emerges as a catalyst for retail media’s full-funnel expansion: Conversion in the lower funnel represents CTV’s primary value, given its ability to move viewers from awareness to action, often referred to as performance-driven CTV. This approach reflects the evolution of television advertising into a measurable, optimizable and commerce-connected channel, allowing advertisers to apply performance marketing discipline to premium video environments. With the introduction of shoppable features such as interactive overlays, QR codes and TV-to-cart experiences, CTV enables retailers to test and refine ways to shorten the path from discovery to purchase. These features give viewers a direct way to engage with ads and complete transactions.

4. Marketplaces continue to expand as key enablers of retail media scale: Retail marketplaces are driving retail media network growth by allowing retailers to expand product assortments, increase traffic and attract new advertisers. By opening online platforms to third-party sellers, retailers broaden coverage and expand visibility and conversion opportunities, lifting incremental media revenue.

5. Measurement standardization advances as industry frameworks and third-party solutions take hold: This year, the market is expected to move toward a more standardized, transparent and independently measured retail media ecosystem.

6. Self-service and programmatic capabilities expand, reshaping retail media operations: Retailers will continue expanding self-service tools that allow brands to control audience targeting, creative optimization, pacing and budgets. Programmatic integrations and automated workflows, supported by connections to demand-side platforms, identity solutions and planning tools, will bring greater consistency and transparency to pricing, reporting and optimization. These capabilities will connect on-site, off-site, CTV and in-store channels through a single interface and help unlock additional advertiser revenue.

7. AI transforms ad formats, targeting and workflow automation: The combination of AI-driven automation and real-time consumer targeting will enable retailers, brands and shoppers to engage more efficiently at every stage of the purchase journey.

8. First-party data grows in importance in a privacy-first environment: Retail media first-party data will play a critical role in shaping advertising strategies. As retailers and brands strengthen data partnerships and incorporate AI, ads are expected to deliver stronger results in both performance and privacy.

9. Emerging retail media networks gain traction through category and audience differentiation: Networks will need to continue investing in measurement, attribution and advanced targeting capabilities to demonstrate value to advertisers and capture greater market share.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt58a1f8f560a1ab0e/blt2b1ed4be71aeeda6/6971189eaeb0362e5b115bbe/A_hand_typing_on_a_laptop_with_shopping_cart_symbols.webp?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-21 15:07:13.376845

On 8 January 2026, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) announced that it will return £400,000 to nine victims of a global email fraud dating back more than two decades. The move, achieved through a civil recovery order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA), highlights an innovative use of the SFO's powers: enabling victim compensation, rather than remittance to HM Treasury, and deploying flexible legal tools where prosecution is impracticable.

A novel route to restitution

The fraud, orchestrated by Abdallah Ali Jammal between 2001 and 2002, was essentially an advance fee fraud and involved unsolicited emails promising commissions for helping release funds from overseas accounts. Some £4.4 million was stolen from 18 individuals worldwide. Jammal fled before he could be charged and is believed to remain in Lebanon.

Investigators froze assets during the original probe, including funds linked to Jammal Trust Bank; a bank later liquidated after US sanctions were imposed for its links to a terrorist organisation. With no realistic prospect of a criminal conviction, the SFO applied to the High Court on behalf of the victims for a declaration that the money was recoverable property under section 281 POCA.

Under this section, if certain statutory conditions are met – namely that the applicant was deprived of the property by unlawful conduct, the property was not recoverable property immediately before they were deprived of it, and the property belongs to the applicant – the court may declare the property as belonging to the victim. The ruling, obtained in 2023, enabled the SFO to redirect frozen funds to victims rather than HM Treasury. This approach was appropriate as the victims could establish a proprietary claim to funds traceable to their losses, rather than the funds being treated as general criminal assets to be forfeited to the state. It also avoided the complexities associated with criminal prosecution, particularly where the perpetrator remains outside UK jurisdiction.

This is the first time that the SFO has used POCA in this way, and their announcement states that they will “now seek to use this technique across other relevant cases.”

How does this fit with the SFO's wider posture?

This novel method of enforcement illustrates two themes running through the SFO's 2024-29 Strategy and 2025-26 Business Plan: a commitment to international partnership and a willingness to use every tool available to deliver tangible outcomes. The latter has been a strategic focus of Nick Ephgrave since he became Director of the SFO. In his first speech as Director in February 2024, Ephgrave emphasised the need for innovative investigative techniques and a results-driven approach.

In this case, tracing and verifying victim accounts required multi-agency cooperation. The SFO worked with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Australian Federal Police, Belgian Police, the French Liaison Magistrate and the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office to locate the victims and secure their consent for the action. This level of collaboration highlights the complexity of cross-border fraud cases and reflects the SFO's ambition to be “the partner of choice both domestically and internationally”.

More broadly, the restitution move aligns with a discernible shift in the SFO's approach: flexibility, pragmatism, and victim-centric outcomes. Historically, the agency's enforcement model has been criticised for lengthy timelines and limited visible impact. Recent developments, however, suggest a recalibration.

In 2025, the SFO secured its first Unexplained Wealth Order and executed coordinated dawn raids in connection with its investigation into Basis Markets, signalling a more assertive use of powers and a determination to accelerate case progression. The agency also issued new guidance on cooperation and enforcement, introducing a presumption in favour of Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPAs) for corporates that self-report and cooperate fully, alongside commitments to faster timelines.

The restitution initiative now adds a third dimension to this evolving approach: prioritising victim compensation even where criminal prosecution is not viable. Taken together, these developments point to a pragmatic enforcement model that combines speed, partnership, and tangible outcomes, reshaping expectations of how the SFO will deploy its powers in the years ahead.

Practical implications for corporates

Expect civil recovery to feature more often where prosecution is impractical, with implications for disclosure and asset-tracing support.

Victim compensation is now a priority in enforcement outcomes and may influence DPA negotiations.

Cross-border readiness matters: multi-agency cooperation brings accelerated timelines and complex data requests.

Legacy risks can persist: old issues can resurface if money was frozen at the time – or if it can still be traced.

Conclusion

The SFO's return of £400,000 to victims is more than a one-off. It signals a broader shift toward flexible enforcement, international collaboration, and victim-centric outcomes. For corporates, that means recalibrating expectations and readiness for an enforcement landscape where civil recovery and international partnership are firmly part of the toolkit.

I'm your host, Arnold Davick, reporting from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Here are the top IT stories you need to know for Wednesday, January 21st.

Up first, Google just launched a new AI shopping standard called the Universal Commerce Protocol, or UCP. It's an open standard that enables different AI agents, payment systems and stores to collaborate through a common language with partners like Shopify, Etsy, Walmart and Target and payment giant Visa and MasterCard.

UCP aims to make checkout frictionless. Soon, instant checkout could be coming to AI mode in search and the Gemini app. The big change is fewer redirects and less tab hopping. From CIO, IBM is stepping up its push into sovereign computing with Sovereign Core.

It is a software stack designed to run across multiple cloud platforms, not just one provider's environment. Sovereign deployments typically try to combine cloud benefits with strategic autonomy. The focus is on keeping data encryption keys and access policies under local authority.

Meanwhile, applications would still move between on prem systems, regional partners and major clouds. IBM is also emphasizing continuous compliance and support for sovereign AI as regulations tightening. And from CSO Online, the World Economic Forum warns cyber risk is accelerating in 2026 and AI is a major driver.

The widespread integration of AI systems adds an expanded attack surface that creates novel vulnerabilities that traditional security controls were not designed to address. Attackers can scale phishing fraud and exploit supply chain weak spots faster.

New title: President and CEO, BVI

Previous title: CEO, Insulet

Ophthalmic device business BVI has named former Insulet CEO Jim Hollingshead as its next leader, the company said Monday.

Hollingshead led Insulet, which sells the Omnipod insulin pump, for three years before resigning in 2025. Ashley McEvoy, the former head of Johnson & Johnson’s medtech business, replaced Hollingshead.

Hollingshead will now replace Shervin Korangy as CEO of BVI. The change in leadership comes after BVI raised $1 billion in capital last year. BVI is using the money to accelerate product innovation and expand its global footprint. The company makes cataract and retina surgery products from manufacturing sites in China, Europe, Mexico and the U.S.

RoundTable Healthcare Partners created BVI, which was originally called Beaver-Visitec International, by rolling up ophthalmology products acquired from Aspen Surgical, BD and Medtronic. The private equity firm acquired Aspen in 2006 and combined its ophthalmology business with eye disease assets bought from BD and Medtronic in 2010.

TPG Capital, another private equity firm, acquired BVI from RoundTable in 2016. As a TPG portfolio company, BVI has expanded in the intraocular lens market by acquiring PhysIOL Group and Benz Research & Development. BVI launched its first intraocular lens, the monofocal IPure, in the U.S. in 2020. The Food and Drug Administration approved the company’s Finevision HP trifocal intraocular lens last year.

BVI said in a statement that the Finevision approval brought its global leadership position in premium intraocular lenses to U.S. patients. Finevision has been CE marked since 2010 and has a history of use in the European Union and beyond.

Adobe Systems (ADBE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.

Shares of this software maker have returned -17.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.4% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Adobe belongs, has lost 7.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Adobe is expected to post earnings of $5.88 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.44 points to a change of +11.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $26.56 indicates a change of +13.3% from what Adobe is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Adobe is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Projected Revenue Growth

Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.

In the case of Adobe, the consensus sales estimate of $6.28 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +9.9%. The $26.03 billion and $28.46 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.5% and +9.4%, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Adobe reported revenues of $6.19 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.5%. EPS of $5.5 for the same period compares with $4.81 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.1 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.5%. The EPS surprise was +2.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.

Valuation

Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Adobe is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Adobe. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

The company, which relied on in-store displays for decades, shifted to media ads in 1970 to confront competition. Brand campaigns have been intermittent — “Hershey. It’s Your Happy Place” — is the first since 2018.

The new work launches with five U.S. Winter Olympic and Paralympic athletes and their families ahead of the 2026 Winter Olympic (Feb. 6) and Paralympic Games (March 6). The athletes are Brenna Huckaby, parasnowboarding, Erin Jackson, speedskaking, Hilary Knight, ice hockey, Jason Brown, figure skating, and Jordan Stolz, speedskating.

Two spots are here and here.

IPG's The Martin Agency is producing creative throughout the year, with various social and digital executions. The spots position Hershey's as a familiar source of happiness. MiltonONE is a dedicated team formed by Publicis Groupe specifically to handle U.S. media for The Hershey Company. Digitas, part of that team, handles integrated media.

""It’s actually a pretty bold statement to say you exist as a brand to make people happy, and it’s refreshing to help make work that’s able to follow through. Also, I definitely didn’t cry on set. My eyes just got really watery for some reason,"" Patrick Wells, associate creative director, The Martin Agency, told Agency Daily.

Jerry Hoak, Chief Creative Officer at The Martin Agency, added: ""The Opening Ceremony of the Olympics is the perfect place to launch a new brand platform for one of America’s most storied brands. We’ve spent decades telling athletes that gold is everything. Win gold. Happiness follows. But this first brand work proves that it goes way deeper than that. It’s the journey, the memories and the people who got you there that represent your true Happy Place.""

In addition to ads, limited-edition Hershey’s chocolate medals, crafted with embossed designs and wrapped in gold foil, will drop on Feb. 13 at The Hershey's Store and TikTok Shop.

Hershey's has a sizable candy line, including Reese's, Kisses, KitKat, Jolly Rancher and Twizzlers, which propel more than $11.2 billion in annual revs, per the company.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2026/01/19/brown_hersheys_l0T8PWS.png,N,,2026-01-21 11:09:50.716330

She then went back in 2012 as part of Expedition 32/33 and became the space station commander for Expedition 33.
Williams had 608 days in space, the second-longest cumulative time in space by a NASA astronaut.
She has done something that no one else has: run a marathon in space, NASA said.
She was the director of Operations in Star City, Russia, and established a helicopter training platform to help future astronauts for moon missions, NASA said.","Suni Williams, one of the NASA astronauts whose trip to the International Space Station was extended from days to months, has retired from the agency.

NASA announced her retirement, saying that it was effective on Dec. 27, 2025.

“Suni Williams has been a trailblazer in human spaceflight, shaping the future of exploration through her leadership aboard the space station and paving the way for commercial missions to low Earth orbit,” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in a news release. “Her work advancing science and technology has laid the foundation for Artemis missions to the Moon and advancing toward Mars, and her extraordinary achievements will continue to inspire generations to dream big and push the boundaries of what’s possible. Congratulations on your well-deserved retirement, and thank you for your service to NASA and our nation.”

Williams is originally from Needham, Massachusetts, and has a bachelor’s degree in physical science from the U.S. Naval Academy.

She earned a master’s degree in engineering management from Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, Florida.

The retired Navy captain is also a helicopter pilot and fixed-wing pilot, logging more than 4,000 flight hours in 40 different aircraft, NASA said.

But space is her place.

“Anyone who knows me knows that space is my absolute favorite place to be,” Williams said in the announcement. “It’s been an incredible honor to have served in the Astronaut Office and have had the opportunity to fly in space three times. I had an amazing 27-year career at NASA, and that is mainly because of all the wonderful love and support I’ve received from my colleagues. The International Space Station, the people, the engineering, and the science are truly awe-inspiring and have made the next steps of exploration to the Moon and Mars possible. I hope the foundation we set has made these bold steps a little easier. I am super excited for NASA and its partner agencies as we take these next steps, and I can’t wait to watch the agency make history.”

Williams first went into space on the shuttle Discovery in 2006 and returned on the shuttle Atlantis. She then went back in 2012 as part of Expedition 32/33 and became the space station commander for Expedition 33.

Williams had 608 days in space, the second-longest cumulative time in space by a NASA astronaut.

She also performed the sixth-longest single spaceflight by an American. Williams and is tied with Butch Wilmore. Both were on the Boeing Starliner as part of a test mission and then returned to Earth as part of SpaceX Crew-9 in March 2025, after there were issues with the Starliner, which kept the pair on the ISS for 286 days.

Williams also completed nine spacewalks for 62 hours and six minutes, the longest amount of time for a female astronaut and the fourth most cumulative hours.

She has done something that no one else has: run a marathon in space, NASA said.

Williams didn’t just contribute to NASA with her trips into space. She was part of the NEEMO crew, or NASA Extreme Environments Mission Operations, living for nine days in an underwater habitat.

She was the director of Operations in Star City, Russia, and established a helicopter training platform to help future astronauts for moon missions, NASA said.

For a profitable company, the P/E ratio is a straightforward way to gauge how much investors are paying for each dollar of earnings, which makes it a useful cross check against a DCF model.

What counts as a “normal” P/E depends a lot on how fast earnings are expected to grow and how risky those earnings are. Higher growth and lower perceived risk can justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty usually calls for a lower one.

Eli Lilly currently trades on a P/E of 50.64x. That compares with a Pharmaceuticals industry average P/E of 20.49x and a peer average of 17.07x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Eli Lilly is 42.00x, which is its proprietary estimate of a suitable P/E given factors such as earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk profile. This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple comparison to peers or the industry, because it adjusts for company specific characteristics rather than assuming all firms deserve similar multiples. On this basis, Eli Lilly’s current P/E sits above its Fair Ratio, which points to the shares looking expensive on earnings.

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Eli Lilly Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simply your story about Eli Lilly linked directly to your own numbers for future revenue, earnings, margins and a fair value estimate. A Narrative starts with how you see the company, turns that story into a financial forecast, then ties that forecast to a fair value you can compare with the current share price to help you decide whether the stock looks attractive or stretched for your goals. On Simply Wall St, Narratives sit inside the Community page, where millions of investors share and refine these story plus numbers views in an accessible format you can copy, adjust and make your own. Each Narrative automatically refreshes its fair value when new information arrives, such as news or earnings, so your view stays aligned with the latest data rather than a static spreadsheet. For Eli Lilly, one investor might set a relatively high fair value based on optimistic assumptions about future margins while another might choose a lower fair value with more cautious expectations, and you can see both side by side.

Livingston S. A compounding pharmacy hits back at Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk with antitrust lawsuit.","An Arizona-based compounding pharmacy has filed an antitrust lawsuit accusing Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk of unlawfully restricting competition in the market for GLP-1 medications, escalating a legal battle over compounded versions of blockbuster obesity and diabetes drugs.

Strive Compounding Pharmacy filed the complaint on January 14, 2026, in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas, alleging that the 2 pharmaceutical manufacturers engaged in exclusionary conduct designed to suppress compounded GLP-1 products and preserve market dominance for their branded therapies.

Allegations of Anticompetitive Conduct

According to the lawsuit, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk entered into exclusive agreements with telehealth companies that prohibited those platforms from working with compounding pharmacies. Strive claims these arrangements prevented clinicians from prescribing, and patients from accessing, compounded GLP-1 medications—particularly personalized versions tailored to individual patient needs.

The complaint alleges that Lilly also disparaged compounded GLP-1 drugs by falsely characterizing them as unsafe and grouping them alongside “counterfeit” or “fake” medications. Strive contends this messaging was intended to discourage prescribers and telehealth providers from issuing prescriptions for compounded GLP-1 therapies.

“Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk’s conduct has unlawfully restricted competition and directly harmed GLP-1 patients in the United States,” the complaint states. Strive alleges that patients have been forced to pay higher prices and have faced reduced access to GLP-1 medications as a result.

Background: GLP-1 Shortages and Compounding Practices

Compounding pharmacies have historically produced customized versions of branded medications during periods of drug shortages or when patients require formulations not commercially available, such as alternative dosages or the removal of allergenic ingredients. While compounded drugs are not US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, compounding facilities are regulated by the FDA and state boards of pharmacy.

Between 2022 and 2025, shortages of GLP-1 medications created an opportunity for compounding pharmacies to produce copies of semaglutide and tirzepatide products to fill gaps in patient access. Although the FDA later declared the shortages resolved, many compounding pharmacies continued producing customized GLP-1 formulations.

Strive argues that it introduced meaningful competition by offering compounded GLP-1 medications “at a fraction of the price” of branded alternatives. The lawsuit claims Lilly and Novo responded not by competing on price or access, but by working to limit prescriptions for compounded drugs.

Prior Litigation Between the Parties

The lawsuit follows earlier litigation initiated by Eli Lilly against Strive. In April 2025, Lilly sued Strive over its compounded tirzepatide products, alleging the pharmacy made false claims regarding safety, efficacy, and personalization. That case was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, though Lilly refiled the lawsuit in Arizona in October.

A Lilly spokesperson responded to Strive’s antitrust filing by stating that the lawsuit is “wrong, on both the facts and law,” and characterized it as an attempt to deflect attention from Strive’s own conduct. Novo Nordisk did not immediately comment on the lawsuit.

Claims of Market Interference

Strive’s complaint also alleges that Lilly interfered with its relationships with medical practitioners, technology platforms, and payment processors. According to the filing, public disparagement of compounded GLP-1 drugs contributed to social media platforms removing GLP-1-related groups and prompted payment processors such as Tebra and Stripe to warn prescribers that payment processing could be paused for issuing prescriptions for compounded medications.

Strive claims these actions collectively restricted its ability to operate and limited patient access to compounded GLP-1 therapies.

Key Takeaways

Antitrust scrutiny is expanding into pharmaceutical manufacturers’ relationships with telehealth companies and their impact on compounded drug access.

Compounding pharmacies continue to face legal and regulatory pressure following the resolution of GLP-1 drug shortages.

Pharmacy professionals should monitor how exclusive contracting and product disparagement claims may influence prescribing practices and patient access to personalized medications.

Those deals include the $13.1 billion purchase in 2024 of Shockwave Medical and its intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) technology that uses sonic waves to treat calcified arterial plaque. J&J continues to report positive data on Shockwave technology. The Shockwave purchase followed J&J’s $400 million acquisition of left atrial appendage (LAA) device maker Laminar in 2023 and the $16.6 billion purchase of Abiomed and its catheter-delivered Impella heart pumps to treat heart failure in 2022.

As part of that effort, the company has launched a new Request for Proposals (RFP) focused on US-based manufacturing across key parts of the AI supply chain, including data center inputs, consumer electronics, and robotics. The goal is to identify and enable domestic manufacturing capacity that can help shorten timelines, strengthen resilience, and extend technology leadership as AI infrastructure scales.

OpenAI is making these investments to accelerate US capability building in this critical sector. Over the next 10 years, OpenAI seeks to localize significant portions of the manufacturing for its hardware devices and data centers, including key components, modules, and final assembly. This Request for Proposals (RFP) seeks strategic US partners who can scale advanced manufacturing in support of OpenAI hardware programs in consumer electronics, AI data centers, and robotics, aligned with long-term US industrial goals and OpenAI commercial roadmaps.

The company views building the infrastructure required to power advanced AI as a historic opportunity to strengthen domestic supply chains and reindustrialize the country by catalyzing US manufacturing, modernizing the energy grid, creating well-paid jobs, and strengthening American leadership.

The company is seeking proposals from manufacturers, suppliers, and partners who are building—or are prepared to build—critical components and systems for the AI ecosystem in the United States, including:

Modules, tooling and equipment, and final assembly for consumer electronics.

Manufacturing for compute, power, cooling, and supporting data center hardware.

Critical inputs for advanced robotics (e.g., gearboxes, motors, power electronics).

When people talk about AI infrastructure, the conversation often stops at chips and data centers. But advanced AI depends on a much broader ecosystem of physical components: the racks, cabling, networking gear, cooling systems, power systems, power electronics, electromechanical modules, and testing and assembly capacity are all required to bring it online at scale. This RFP aims to build on momentum that already exists by identifying where targeted partnerships, demand signals, and coordination can help unlock faster growth, larger scale, and more durable US leadership in AI.

Responses to the RFP will help inform partnerships, procurement strategies, and infrastructure planning as part of a broader reindustrialization effort. The company will review proposals on a rolling basis and follow up with selected respondents on next steps. The deadline to submit a proposal is June 2026.

Summary

IREN Limited has executed a successful AI pivot, outperforming peers like MARA Holdings and positioning itself as a leading data center provider. It is a first mover, like Nvidia in 2021.

My DCF-based valuation model suggests IREN is worth $80–$580 per share, with a current price near $55 presenting a compelling entry point.

IREN's upside depends on scaling data center capacity, prudent capital allocation, and sustained AI demand; risks include overleveraging and a potential slowdown in AI.

I assign IREN stock a Buy rating, viewing it as a relatively safe investment rather than an asymmetric bet, given current market expectations.

MARA may outperform IREN going forward, but I find IREN's investment case more compelling today. I entered a position in the stock and partially reallocated from MARA.

Throughout 2025, I made the mistake of stubbornly focusing on MARA Holdings (MARA) as an asymmetric AI bet. My fundamental investment thesis was not incorrect: moving data center capacity from Bitcoin (

I like to write about Macro and Fundamentals, with the (painful) awareness that Momentum and Sentiment are what really matters. That’s why I never try to time the market and I only buy stocks if I am willing to hold them for at least 10 years.When it comes to fundamentals, everybody knows the market is forward looking, but few understand what that means. I don’t look at a P/E number and decide to buy if a stock is “cheap”. I see markets as literally just the meeting point between demand and supply. Predicting human behavior is key.I always try to understand what the market is seeing in a stock beyond the numbers, which often implies trying to understand sectors, industries and long term growth trends. My approach requires ingenuity, curiosity and a good dose of naivete, as well as being comfortable in (sometimes) going against the current.I am based in Geneva, Switzerland (hence my SA name) and I have a Master’s Degree in Business.

The investment from NPS into the Single Family Housing Fund will be used by Long Harbour to deploy up to £600 million, including leverage, into single-family homes across the UK.
Jack Spearman, managing director of single-family housing at Long Harbour, said: “Scaling [the fund’s] portfolio and meeting our ambitious deployment targets requires well-structured debt funding that can support forward funding for our investments.","Long Harbour has obtained a £66.8 million (€76.5 million) development facility from UK lender Barclays, Real Estate Capital Europe can reveal.

The loan will fund the development costs for the current and pipeline schemes associated with the London-headquartered manager’s Single Family Housing Fund.

Barclays’ loan finances the first two transactions by the manager on behalf of the vehicle, which totalled £180 million in acquisition costs. The first deal was the forward funding of 105 homes in Newhall, Derbyshire, in May 2025, followed by the purchase in December of 369 rental homes from Dandara in Horsham and Great Dunmow, and Miller Homes in Kent.

Barclays was an active lender in the residential sector in 2025. The bank lent across UK residential rental, build‑to‑rent and social housing schemes, typically via corporate and fund‑level facilities. In May, the bank provided a £50 million revolving credit facility to the Urban Splash Residential Fund to support the continued creation of UK rental homes, replacing a £20 million facility issued by Barclays in 2023.

During the first three quarters of 2025, Barclays lent a total of €7.96 billion and had a loan book of €12.9 billion, according to REC Europe’s Active Lenders 2025.

Single-family housing fund

In January 2025, Long Harbour secured a seed equity commitment of £300 million from South Korea’s National Pension Fund. The vehicle, which is targeting £1.2 billion of capital commitments over the next 18 months, will acquire new-build family homes across the UK, focussing on the south and southeast of England.

The investment from NPS into the Single Family Housing Fund will be used by Long Harbour to deploy up to £600 million, including leverage, into single-family homes across the UK. The deployment target for the fund is £1.6 billion.

The manager anticipates holding a second close for the vehicle during 2026 with a final close expected in 2027. Should it reach its target size, the fund will be Long Harbour’s largest-ever closed-end fundraise, as per affiliate title PERE.

Jack Spearman, managing director of single-family housing at Long Harbour, said: “Scaling [the fund’s] portfolio and meeting our ambitious deployment targets requires well-structured debt funding that can support forward funding for our investments. The option to extend the size on the loan with Barclays based on future acquisitions gives us flexibility while we focus on identifying the best opportunities in the market.”

Established in 2009, Long Harbour has £3.3 billion of residential assets under management across the UK and Europe. Its first investment in single-family assets was in 2013, with the acquisition of a portfolio of homes from Lloyds Bank, and it subsequently invested in the sector through its LHIF I fund, which was fully divested by 2022.",https://media.recapitalnews.com/uploads/2026/01/02-Corner-Turner.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 11:08:57.740348

These companies represent breakthrough innovations across quantum computing, artificial intelligence, biotech, and other foundational technologies, and will participate in Alchemist’s flagship six-month program designed to accelerate fundraising outcomes, expand enterprise traction, and prepare startups for scalable growth.

Selected from a competitive pool of nearly 400 applicants, Alchemist Chicago’s Phase 1 featured 27 startups representing more than 10 cities and five countries. Following the program’s customer validation and proof of concept curriculum, startups in Phase 2 have demonstrated exceptional technical strength, market potential, and readiness for commercialization

“Alchemist Chicago was built to help deep tech founders bridge the gap between breakthrough science and real-world impact,” said Samir Mayekar, managing director of the Polsky Center. “These teams have shown not only technical excellence, but also the discipline and market focus required to build lasting companies.”

Phase 2 of Alchemist Chicago is designed to help founders sharpen commercial readiness, build traction, and prepare for fundraising by aligning technical innovation with clear customer value. During this phase, teams receive customized 1:1 coaching, curated investor introductions, and direct access to Alchemist’s global investor and enterprise network, culminating in Demo Day in May 2026.

“This is where we see founders translate their technology into compelling commercial opportunities,” said Shyama Majumdar, senior director of science accelerators and investments at the Polsky Center. “These startups are tackling some of the hardest problems in science and engineering, and this next phase provides the tailored support, capital exposure, and partnerships needed to move from proof to market.”

QodeX Quantum and SQK, two startups participating in Alchemist Chicago, also benefit from the University of Chicago’s collaboration with IBM Ventures to advance quantum computing software and algorithm development through Duality, the nation’s first quantum startup accelerator.

Through this collaboration, these startups will have access to IBM technical expertise, plus funding support, and may gain access to IBM’s cloud-based quantum computing resources, including the opportunity to work on the IBM Quantum System Two that’s planned to be deployed at the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park (IQMP).

“We’re looking forward to collaborating with Qodex Quantum and SQK and equipping them with the resources, mentorship, and strategic connections they need to succeed,” said Emily Fontaine, global head of venture capital at IBM. “By providing access to IBM quantum technology, valuable networks, customer ecosystems, and clear pathways to practical applications, we aim to help these founders drive sustainable, long-term growth. This effort is strengthened by the University of Chicago’s collaboration with IBM, which reflects our shared commitment to advancing breakthrough technologies and accelerating real-world impact through quantum computing.”

Launched last year, Alchemist Chicago combines Alchemist’s global track record of launching category-defining B2B companies with the University of Chicago’s research leadership, national laboratory affiliations, and commercialization expertise.

Alchemist Chicago operates as part of Alchemist’s flagship accelerator platform, enabling founders in the Midwest and beyond to tap into a global venture ecosystem while remaining closely connected to the University of Chicago’s research enterprise. The program is open to founders worldwide, with no University affiliation required.

“Deep tech – the novel bits, atoms and science powering the future’s most impactful innovations – has never been more relevant or important,” said Ian Bergman, partner and managing director at Alchemist. “We’re thrilled to see a group of founders who have shown remarkable vision and momentum advance to Phase 2 of Alchemist Chicago, joining Alchemist’s flagship Class 41 and accessing the network, resources, and community that will help them take the important next steps on their journey.”

LLY's oral obesity drug is expected to differentiate the company, expand patient access, and accelerate global scaling, particularly in markets where injectables face adoption barriers.

LLY faces intensifying generics competition and price wars, especially in ex-US markets like China, which could pressure margins despite its robust pipeline and diversification.

LLY's forward multiple has compressed to 33x, near its 10-year average, indicating the market has priced in execution risks but still supports a Buy given healthy consolidation and upcoming catalysts.

A new report, Watering the New Economy: Managing the Impacts of the AI Revolution, provides what Xylem calls the most comprehensive assessment to date of how AI is reshaping global water use.
It also highlights practical ways to meet that demand while strengthening water security for communities.
By the middle of the century, this expansion is projected to add 30 trillion liters of water demand, annually, fueled by a surge in power generation (~54% of the increase), semiconductor fabrication (~42%), and data center expansion (~4%).
“Our projections examine water use across the full AI value chain – from chip fabrication and data center operations to indirect demand from power generation – and assess how technology choices shape future demand,” said Christopher Gasson, CEO, Global Water Intelligence.","The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence is set to drive a 129% increase in global water demand across the AI value chain by 2050, according to new research by Xylem and Global Water Intelligence (GWI).

A new report, Watering the New Economy: Managing the Impacts of the AI Revolution, provides what Xylem calls the most comprehensive assessment to date of how AI is reshaping global water use. It also highlights practical ways to meet that demand while strengthening water security for communities.

Citing a report from Gartner, the research notes spending on AI is forecasted to approach $2 trillion in 2026, accelerating the modernization of infrastructure across the world. By the middle of the century, this expansion is projected to add 30 trillion liters of water demand, annually, fueled by a surge in power generation (~54% of the increase), semiconductor fabrication (~42%), and data center expansion (~4%).

On one important note, the report finds that this additional demand does not have to result in competition between industry and communities.

Today, global water systems process roughly 320 trillion liters of wastewater annually and lose an estimated 100 trillion liters through aging infrastructure – volumes that, if recovered through targeted investment, could substantially offset AI’s projected growth in water use and reduce strain on freshwater resources, the report says.

The report calls for a coordinated “water transition” centered on water reuse, digital infrastructure, and cross-sector partnerships – to ensure water is a resilient foundation for economic growth, rather than a constraint on innovation.

“AI is placing new demands on water supplies, but many of the tools needed to address the challenge already exist,” said Matthew Pine, Xylem’s president and CEO. “Advanced treatment technologies, for example, allow us to recycle water rather than waste it. Digital systems can help better manage supply in real time, reducing water lost to leaks. It’s time for a water transition built on targeted investment and collaboration between industry, utilities, and governments to ensure water systems can support both growth and community resilience.”

The analysis also highlights rising geographic risk. Nearly 40% of existing data centers are already located in regions experiencing high water stress, and future growth is expected to concentrate in similarly constrained watersheds, citing a report from S&P Global. This underscores the need for localized, basin-level solutions, even as global efficiency gains create headroom for growth.

“Our projections examine water use across the full AI value chain – from chip fabrication and data center operations to indirect demand from power generation – and assess how technology choices shape future demand,” said Christopher Gasson, CEO, Global Water Intelligence. “The greatest pressure points emerge in semiconductor manufacturing and in fast-growing data center hubs in the United States, East Asia, and South Asia. In these regions, expanded wastewater reuse, leakage reduction, and targeted infrastructure investment can fully offset future growth.”

The report points to early examples of how collaboration can deliver shared benefits. In Mexico, for example, utilities in Mexico City and Monterrey worked together with Amazon and Xylem on smart pipeline upgrades to reduce leaks. A system of sensors and advanced analytics will save more than 1.3 billion liters of water a year and help improve the reliability of water supplies for residents.

Nvidia was a $5 trillion company, but only briefly Nvidia entered 2025 valued at just over $3 trillion, so it would take a significant gain for it to breach the $5 trillion mark.
Following President Trump's tariff announcements in April, this prediction was in even worse shape as Nvidia was nearly a $2 trillion company.

The reasons for this prediction were rather simple: The AI hyperscalers would continue spending at a rapid pace, and I was right on that account.

However, I was wrong about Nvidia's valuation multiples. Nvidia breached the $5 trillion market cap level, and although it's below that threshold right now, I think it will return in 2026.

Nvidia was a $5 trillion company, but only briefly

Nvidia entered 2025 valued at just over $3 trillion, so it would take a significant gain for it to breach the $5 trillion mark. Following President Trump's tariff announcements in April, this prediction was in even worse shape as Nvidia was nearly a $2 trillion company.

However, as the market rallied throughout the year, Nvidia became the first $5 trillion company in October, although it is no longer at that level.

What drove it there was the insatiable demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), and AI hyperscalers willing to spend a near-unlimited amount of money on computing equipment. That trend didn't shift throughout 2025, and there are no indications it will change in 2026. As a result, I think Nvidia will end the year solidly in the $5 trillion club.

Nvidia's valuation is cheaper than I expected

At the end of 2024 (when I made the initial prediction), Nvidia had a price-to-forward earnings ratio of 45. I called that a bit expensive, but it's slightly cheaper now at 40 times forward earnings.

Make no mistake; Nvidia's stock still isn't cheap. However, the other big tech stocks' valuation levels have climbed to around the 30 times forward earnings level. That gives Nvidia a slight premium over its peers, but I still think that it's a much better buy. After all, which big tech company will be able to match Nvidia's growth this year?

The fourth quarter earnings season is picking up speed.

After several big banks reported last week, more financials will deliver results, with reports from Charles Schwab (SCHW) and regional banks like Fifth Third (FITB) on the schedule. But the attention will likely shift to Netflix (NFLX) and Intel (INTC), headlining the earnings calendar.

An optimistic consensus is forming: As of Jan. 16, 7% of S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies have reported fourth quarter results, according to FactSet data, and Wall Street analysts estimate an 8.2% increase in earnings per share for the fourth quarter. If that rate holds, it would represent the 10th consecutive quarter of annual earnings growth for the index.

Heading into the reporting period, analysts were expecting an 8.3% jump in earnings per share, down from the third quarter's 13.6% earnings growth rate. Wall Street has raised its earnings expectations in recent months, especially for tech companies, which have driven earnings growth in recent quarters.

Although Big Tech continues to set the tone, this earnings season promises to test the improved stock market breadth that has emerged at the start of 2026. Plus, the themes that drove the markets in 2025 — artificial intelligence, the Trump administration's tariff and economic policies, and a K-shaped consumer economy — will continue to provide plenty for investors to parse.

In addition to quarterly reports from Netflix and Intel, the earnings releases highlighting this week's schedule include United Airlines (UAL), 3M Company (MMM), D.R. Horton (DHI), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), GE Aerospace (GE), Procter & Gamble (PG), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), and Capital One (COF).

Netflix stock falls as Warner Bros. Discovery bid adds pressure

Netflix (NFLX) stock dropped more than 4% in after-hours trading as the company's fourth quarter earnings were closely scrutinized amid Netflix's bid to purchase Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD).

The creator of ""Squid Game"" and other popular shows said it would ramp up new content in the year ahead and pause its share repurchase program, given the M&A deal with Warner Bros. Discovery.

Netflix posted diluted earnings per share of $0.56, coming in ahead of Wall Street's forecasts of $0.55 per share. Revenue of $12 billion also beat estimates of $11.96 billion, according to Bloomberg data.

The company's operating margin declined slightly to 24.5% from 28.2% last quarter but increased from Q4 2024. For the current quarter, Netflix guided for an operating margin of 32.1%, which was a bit lighter than the Street expected.

Charles Schwab stock rises as trading volume boosts results

Charles Schwab (SCHW) stock rose over 1.7% on Wednesday after the brokerage and asset manager posted 22% annual revenue growth, supported by record trading volumes, but missed the high expectations set by Wall Street.

Fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.33 fell short of analyst estimates of $1.35 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue of $6.33 billion also came up short of expectations for $6.39 billion.

""While we had anticipated some moderation in client trading activity towards the back end of the year, we instead saw an acceleration in activity, which contributed to higher volume-related costs, inclusive of performance-based compensation,"" Charles Schwab CFO Michael Verdeschi said on the earnings call.

Net interest revenue grew 25% year over year to 3.1 billion. Asset management revenue increased 14% to $1.7 billion. And revenue from trading surged 22% to $1 billion.

Schwab brought in record client assets during the quarter, the company said, as total client accounts grew 6% year-over-year to 46.5 million.

Halliburton stock climbs after the oil services giant posts better-than-expected profits

Oil services provider Halliburton (HAL) posted better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter, sending its shares up 2%.

The Houston-based company reported profits of $0.70 per diluted share, beating Wall Street estimates of $0.55 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Profits were flat from a year ago, when the company also posted earnings of $0.70 per share.

Revenue of $5.7 billion also came in stronger than the $5.4 billion estimated. It was also higher than the $5.6 billion in revenue reported a year ago.

Halliburton's revenue in its Completion and Production segment was roughly unchanged from a year ago at $3.3 billion, while revenue in the Drilling and Evaluation unit was $2.4 billion, also flat.

While the oil majors have shown reluctance in exploring Venezuelan oil following the US's removal of Nicolás Maduro (ExxonMobil's (XOM) CEO called it ""uninvestable""), oil infrastructure companies like Halliburton have shown more eagerness to revisit the country.

Reuters reported on Tuesday that the company has started looking at resumes for roles in the country, in a sign that Halliburton may be ready to reenter Venezuela.

The stock has started the year off strong, with an 11% gain since the beginning of 2026.

Fastenal stock declines after execs note headwinds in the 'sluggish industrial economy'

Industrial bellwether Fastenal (FAST) is battling a ""sluggish industrial economy,"" the company's executives said on an earnings call on Tuesday.

After reporting earnings per share of $0.26, in line with analyst estimates, the company's new CFO Max Tunnicliff said that the industrial sector has ""continued to see mixed signals."" Tunnicliff noted that ""while some areas showed resilience, others faced continued headwinds that impacted demand and supply chains.""

Shares of Fastenal, which produces an array of products such as bolts, nuts, screws, and studs for industrial manufacturing and construction materials, fell more than 2.5% in afternoon trading Tuesday.

Sales of $2.02 billion slightly missed analyst estimates for $2.04 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Touching on the company's heavy manufacturing markets, Fastenal president Jeffery Watts added that, while the company hasn't seen declines, demand has been flat.

""We're not really seeing [the economy improve], but we're also not seeing any declines in our manufacturing as far as the year-over-year usage,"" he said.

U.S. Bancorp earnings beat on record consumer deposits, CEO says credit card rate limit would be 'detrimental' to 'crushing' for consumers

U.S. Bancorp (USB) gained about 1% in midmorning trading on Tuesday after the Minneapolis-based super-regional bank reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter on the back of strong consumer deposits.

The U.S. Bank parent reported $4.31 billion in net interest income, a 3.3% annual rise that topped Wall Street estimates for $4.28 billion. Revenue of $7.36 billion also beat estimates of $7.31 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Earnings of $1.26 per share came in higher than the $1.19 per share the Street was expecting.

U.S. Bancorp said it achieved record consumer deposits in the fourth quarter and saw green shoots in the beaten-down commercial real estate sector.

""The effectiveness of products like bank smartly, more sophisticated pricing capabilities, and a significant overhaul of skills, training, digital tools and incentives, together with investments in our branches drove our performance,"" CEO Gunjan Kedia said on the earnings call. ""Additionally, commercial real estate loans also showed modest growth after 11 quarters of decline.""

Like other bank executives, Kedia weighed in on the proposed 10% credit card rate limit President Trump has floated. Kedia estimated that over 90% of U.S. Bancorp's clients would see ""a detrimental impact"" if that rate cap were enacted, and that 50% would face a ""crushing"" impact.

""We have observed that just in the last few days, the conversation around the rate cap has shifted more productively to options for customers to help them in the short term,"" Kedia added.

D.R. Horton stock rises on better-than-expected earnings

Homebuilder D.R. Horton's (DHI) first quarter earnings were better than expected, but a sluggish housing market marked by affordability concerns weighed on results.

The company reported earnings per share of $2.03, beating estimates of $1.93, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue of $6.8 billion also topped expectations of $6.6 billion, but fell from $7.6 billion a year ago.

Net sales orders increased 3% to 18,300 homes, which was slightly below estimates. Homebuilders have increased sales incentives in recent months to try and entice buyers off the sidelines. That, coupled with lower mortgage rates, has sparked some optimism that the housing market could improve.

D.R. Horton reiterated its full-year 2026 guidance for revenue in a range of $33.5 billion to $35 billion. The company expects to close 86,000 homes to 88,000 homes by the end of the year.

3M adjusted earnings beat, but the stock is sinking

Post-it Note maker 3M (MMM) reported adjusted earnings per share that beat Wall Street expectations on Tuesday, but the stock fell 5% as part of a broader market sell-off.

The Minnesota-based company posted adjusted earnings, which strip out one-time costs, of $1.83, compared to analysts' forecasts of $1.80, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The company expected temporary charges from tariffs and stranded costs from removing PFAS materials from its products. In Q4, 3M realized $0.56 per share in net costs from litigation.

Sales grew 2.1% in Q4 to $6.1 billion, topping expectations for $6 billion in sales.

For 2026, the company expects adjusted sales growth of around 4% for full-year adjusted EPS of $8.06. Full-year operating cash flow is expected to be $2.3 billion.

""2025 was an important year for 3M as we build a strong foundation that is reshaping our operating model and driving sustainable value creation,"" 3M CEO William Brown said.

J.B. Hunt stock falls after revenue declines year over year

Freight and logistics company J.B. Hunt (JBHT) reported a 2% decline in revenue year over year, led by weaker volumes and revenue in its main Intermodal segment.

The Arkansas-based company posted diluted earnings per share of $1.90 for the fourth quarter, topping Wall Street analysts' expectations of $1.82 per share, according to estimates on S&P Global Market Intelligence. Total revenue of $3.1 billion came in line with estimates but declined slightly from $3.15 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024.

In the Intermodal segment, its largest by revenue, the company reported a 2% decline in volume, driven by a 6% decrease in transcontinental network loads between US ports, Mexico, and Canada year over year (though eastern network loads increased 5%). J.B. Hunt also saw weakness in its last-mile segment due to softer demand in end markets, the company said.

Morgan Stanley results show boom in Wall Street dealmaking

Like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley's (MS) fourth quarter benefited from a boom in Wall Street dealmaking.

Morgan Stanley reported an 18% lift in profits in Q4 as its total client assets in wealth and investment banking grew by $350 million to reach $9.3 trillion. Net income rose to $4.4 billion, or $2.68 per diluted share, from $3.7 billion a year ago. Analysts were expecting earnings per share of $2.45, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The standout in the quarter was Morgan Stanley's investment banking revenues, which increased 47% year over year to $2.4 billion. The company's debt underwriting revenue, in particular, nearly doubled year over year to $785 million.

Revenue in the wealth management unit also surged 13% to $8.4 billion, compared with $7.5 billion a year ago.

For the full year, Morgan Stanley reported record net revenue of $70.6 billion and net income of $16.9 billion. However, the stock wavered in premarket trading.

To determine the best-regarded companies, Korn Ferry asked executives, directors and analysts to rate companies within their industry on nine criteria, including management quality, product quality, social responsibility and talent attraction. A company’s score must rank in the top half of its industry survey to be listed.

To select the top 50, Korn Ferry asked senior executives, directors and industry analysts to select the 10 companies they admired most and rank each one on various attributes. They chose from a list made up of the companies that ranked in the top 25% in last year’s surveys; ranked in the top 3 within their industry the previous year (top 4 for non-U.S. companies); or a company that ranked among the top 50 All-Stars last year and did not make any of the above cuts.

By Tony DiZinno

DETROIT – Before they get started racing in this weekend’s 64th Rolex 24 At Daytona, General Motors IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship drivers Jack Aitken and Alexander Sims paid a visit to Detroit for a double duty round of promotional efforts for both the 64th Rolex 24 At Daytona and Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix.

Aitken, co-driver of the No. 31 Cadillac Whelen Cadillac V-Series.R in the Grand Touring Prototype (GTP) class and Sims, defending Grand Touring Daytona Pro (GTD PRO) champion and co-driver of the No. 3 Corvette Racing by Pratt Miller Motorsports Corvette Z06 GT3.R, finished this weekend’s Roar Before the Rolex 24 test at Daytona International Speedway and departed for Detroit.

They started off the week at Monday night’s Boston Celtics vs. Detroit Pistons’ game, part of NBC and Peacock’s return to broadcasting the NBA for the first time in more than two decades, sitting courtside across from the Detroit Pistons bench at Detroit’s Little Caesars Arena. The Pistons won by one point, 104-103, in a thriller over their Eastern Conference rivals to extend their lead in the conference to 5.5 games.

Aitken and Sims moved onto the Detroit Auto Show’s annual “Racing Day” on Tuesday to participate in a pre-event media tour for both this weekend’s Rolex 24 to kick off the 2026 WeatherTech Championship season, and also for the Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix held in downtown Detroit encircling the Renaissance Center in late May.

Aitken and Sims toured the show with Auto Show and Detroit GP executives and key stakeholders, participated in several rounds of media interviews, engaged in fan Q&As at the Cadillac and Chevrolet displays, and took fans around an indoor “DGP” track in Chevrolet E-Rays and Cadillac CT-4s. The key word here is “indoor” with temperatures in the low single digits and “feels like” temperatures below zero on a sunny, yet cold Tuesday in Detroit.

“It’s been great fun,” Sims said. “It started off last night with the NBA game with the Pistons playing in a pretty tight contest. Being courtside for that was a really cool experience. Today, to see the Auto Show for the first time, see all the cars on display and all the amazing GM products is really nice. To meet some of the IndyCar guys, meet the fans, do some hot laps, see some smiles on some faces, it’s been really good fun.

“We were given some (Corvette) E-Rays to thrash around for a while and give some hot laps to the fans with some controlled drifting and putting some rubber down, which the fans seemed to love. It was good fun for everyone.”

Aitken added, “It’s been a fun time. It’s been great to see such a big presence from GM and Cadillac. We did some hot laps on a scale circuit of the GP Track and it’s been a great show put on by the Detroit GP. I had a lot of fun and met a lot of new people and hopefully we’re going to see them again in May. I can’t wait to get back on the streets of Detroit. We got to see a bit of a corker; it was tight down to the wire. We had courtside seats and I’ve never had that before. It was really cool and got us into the spirit of the hometown heroes. It was a fun day.”

The two IMSA drivers weren’t alone, as four full-time IndyCar Series drivers also made the voyage. That included David Malukas, Rinus VeeKay, Marcus Armstrong and Kyffin Simpson. Simpson, of note, is also competing in the Rolex 24 this year as part of the Tower Motorsports No. 8 ORECA LMP2 07 in Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) entry.

Türkiye's annual inflation fell to 30.9% in December 2025, while the policy rate stands at 38%, implying a 7.1% real return gap.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) 56th Annual Meeting in Davos, Keller told the state-run Anadolu Agency that the Turkish central bank’s monetary policy, which is steering the country’s disinflation path, has begun to yield results.

Real returns rise in Türkiye, supporting monetary easing

Keller said he expects inflation to continue declining steadily this year, adding that the central bank only changes policy rates when it sees, or can clearly anticipate, that inflation is falling. ""This prevents the bank from trailing behind developments and gives investors confidence that the real interest rate will stay at a certain level,"" he said.

Türkiye's annual inflation fell to 30.9% in December 2025, while the policy rate stands at 38%, implying a 7.1% real return gap. This situation allows the central bank to implement further cuts at the next Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting on Thursday, with market participants expecting a 150 basis point reduction. As of Wednesday, Türkiye’s two-year treasury yield declined to 35.44%.

Keller noted that the current macro framework is functioning effectively. ""There is money flowing into Türkiye, the central bank is able to accumulate reserves, and at the same time, the country’s competitiveness does not appear to have been hurt,"" Keller added.

As of the week ending Jan. 9, the central bank’s total reserves rose to $196.08 billion, while net reserves excluding swaps reached $70.1 billion. Preliminary data indicate that total reserves have reached a new record above $200 billion this week, with net reserves excluding swaps above $80 billion. During the same period, the total carry trade volume also increased to $54.78 billion.

Türkiye gains ground on stability, growth, global resilience

Keller said the Turkish economy frequently surprises to the upside in terms of growth, citing its underlying dynamism. The Turkish economy grew by 3.7% in the third quarter of 2025, and according to government estimates, the full-year growth rate was 3.3%.

He stressed the importance of continuing the ongoing macroeconomic stabilization program and underscored the central bank’s performance in rebuilding policy credibility. ""The central bank is doing a good job in regaining trust,"" he noted. According to Keller, Türkiye is historically well-positioned to manage periods of global uncertainty. ""Türkiye is one of the best countries in coping with uncertainty, and it has been that way for a long time,"" he said.

Keller highlighted that Türkiye’s geopolitical standing may offer a buffer against escalating international tensions. He pointed out that Türkiye is not currently in the ""negative spotlight"" compared to economies such as China, Russia, or European Union member states under U.S. pressure.

Emerging markets that maintain balance in global relations may be better placed to navigate volatility, Keller added.

Well, let's talk a little bit about your business in India, you know. Sukses one of your key markets, not j. Some logistics point of view and mobility point of view, but also from a technology perspective, layout for me what the year ahead for India for Uber will look like. So you're, you're right from a technology perspective, I mean, First off, I'd say we have tremendous talent in India. The Uber team in India is great. It's our largest engineering center outside the Bay Area and we're continuing to grow, grow the center. We're doing a lot of our new AI work out of our India team. So we've got a, a program called Uber AI Solutions. Which is really participating almost as a human in the loop in AI development and that's being innovated out of India and for Uber globally, for Uber globally, clients all over the world's. Most of the team is in India that's building that, that offering. But it's super compelling, it's new, it's interesting. We're participating in government technology schemes like ODBC, which I think is a really interesting approach to try to grow marketplace businesses across a number of sectors. And a lot of our global products actually debut in II is a tremendously competitive. Environment competition brings the best out of us and and we're seeing a lot of awesome. That's the competitive intensity increase or you know, is, is, is it status quo there? India has always been competitively intense. You know, it's not a question of growth for us in India. It's, you know, how sustainable is that growth? And would I give credit to the ecosystem for is there's new players that pop up, they innovate, they bring new business models, they bring lower cost products, which I think are popular with Indian consumers. So it's as intense as ever, but I think we're faring. Well, in that competition, and again, a lot of what we're learning in India is making its way into our 75 countries around the world and, and that's a good thing. What's been the biggest learning from India that you're taking to the world? I think your ability to continue to innovate on the consumer experience while being mindful of price is really, really critical. I mean, we, we're a marketplace business at the end of the day, we're trying to meet the needs of both the drivers and couriers who unearned money on our platform and consumers who depend on us for services. And actually that balancing act is, is challenging. And in India, I think it's probably the hardest market for that balancing act and it's made us better on both fronts. You know, you have now restarted M&A. Is India likely to see some action on that front for you? You know, I never love speculating on M&AI. Think there's lots of interesting technology companies in India that of course we'll take a look at. And and you know, for us, we've been doing the deals that make sense for our customers, that makes sense for our platform. You know, Uber is increasingly becoming a daily use case. And so if we can plug more modes of moving or give you more access to local selection in your city, then we're going to do that either organically or through M&A. Well, you know, you talked about how Uber wants to position itself as a daily use service. What will that mean in India? You know, you exited the Uber Eats business, but you're now re entering that space while ODC take me through the new bets and the new avenues that you hope to double down on in India. We've we've got a tremendous driver base in India, right? And we've got drivers who use cars as their vehicles, 3 Wheelers or two Wheelers and increasingly that sort of two and three Wheeler section in the market is also doing deliveries. And so our ability to actually give our drivers more opportunity to either do consumer to consumer package delivery or. The full fulfill for retailers, I think that's interesting in India. So no plans to re enter the food delivery market, but I do think you'll see us experimenting and growing some segments that sort of further complement our offering.

U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is included on our list of the best undervalued wide moat stocks.

On January 13, 2026, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) announced that it will acquire Wall Street brokerage BTIG for up to $1 billion in cash and stock. With this move, the company marks a strategic expansion into capital markets.

In addition to $725 million upfront, the deal includes an additional $275 million contingent on performance over three years. BTIG has served as the bank’s equity capital markets referral partner since 2014, bringing strengths in investment banking, institutional sales and trading, research, and prime brokerage. The firm has helped U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) diversify beyond traditional banking. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2026.

Within this context, Piper Sandler analysts noted,

While U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) certainly has capital markets capabilities, they have historically been ‌much ‌more limited than those of several peers. This transaction therefore rounds out USB’s offerings to become more competitive with those of other large banks.

On the same day, Keefe Bruyette spoke out on the recent development, viewing it as a modest positive for U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB). The firm noted the company’s strategy of gradually growing its internal capital markets capabilities amid rising industry-wide demand. The firm maintained its ‘Market Perform’ rating with a $58 price target.

U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), founded in 1929 and headquartered in Minneapolis, offers comprehensive banking services, including lending, deposits, wealth management, mortgages, credit cards, and brokerage services across the U.S.

While we acknowledge the potential of USB as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

U.S. Bancorp Earnings Call Signals Strong Momentum Despite Regulatory Clouds

U.S. Bancorp’s latest earnings call carried a distinctly upbeat tone, as management emphasized record revenues, double‑digit adjusted EPS growth, and broad-based business strength. Executives highlighted improving net interest income and margin trends, solid fee income, disciplined expense control, and better asset quality, all underpinned by clear forward guidance that points to continued revenue growth and positive operating leverage. While they acknowledged meaningful near-term pressures—from merger-related costs, regulatory uncertainty, and select segment softness—the overall message was that the bank’s earnings power and strategic positioning are improving faster than the risks are building.

Record EPS and Revenue Underscore Earnings Power

U.S. Bancorp posted adjusted diluted earnings per common share of $1.26 in the fourth quarter, up roughly 18% year over year, underscoring robust underlying profitability. Net revenue reached a record $7.4 billion for Q4 and $28.7 billion for the full year, with quarterly total net revenue climbing 5.1%. Management framed these results as evidence that the company is executing well on both sides of the balance sheet, even as it absorbs integration and investment costs. The combination of strong top-line growth and firm cost control is driving operating leverage and supporting attractive returns on capital.

Net Interest Income and Margin Trends Turn Favorable

Net interest income (NII) moved higher, a key point for bank investors focused on rate and spread dynamics. NII rose 3.3% year over year on management’s commentary, with fully taxable-equivalent NII at $4.3 billion—up 1.4% from the prior quarter. Net interest margin ticked up 2 basis points sequentially to 2.77%, a modest but important sign that pressure from funding costs is easing. Management pointed to mix improvements and balance sheet discipline as drivers, while cautioning that a large investment portfolio and lower long-term rates will moderate how quickly margin can expand from here.

Fee Revenue Delivers Broad-Based Growth

Fee revenue was a bright spot, reinforcing the bank’s status as a diversified franchise rather than a pure rate play. Fourth-quarter fee income rose 7.6% year over year, with full-year fee revenue up 6.7% and accounting for about 42% of total net revenues in 2025. Growth was broad-based across payments, institutional, and consumer fee businesses, reducing reliance on NII and improving earnings stability. Management stressed that this balanced revenue mix is strategic, positioning U.S. Bancorp to generate growth even in less favorable rate environments.

Positive Operating Leverage and Tight Expense Control

The bank delivered meaningful positive operating leverage, signaling that revenue is growing much faster than costs. Adjusted operating leverage reached 440 basis points in the quarter and about 370 basis points for full-year 2025, aided by nine consecutive quarters of largely stable expenses. Productivity initiatives and disciplined cost management helped absorb severance and other one-off items while still supporting technology and growth investments. Looking ahead, management expects to maintain positive operating leverage of at least 200 basis points in 2026, a key pillar of their long-term earnings story.

Asset Quality and Credit Metrics Improve Further

Credit performance remains a support rather than a drag on results. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and ORE fell to 0.41%, improving both sequentially and year over year. The net charge-off ratio improved to 0.54%, down 2 basis points from the prior quarter, suggesting losses are well-contained despite credit card and commercial growth. The allowance for credit losses stood at $7.9 billion, or 2.03% of period-end loans, giving management comfort that the reserve is appropriate for the current environment. Investors worried about late-cycle credit deterioration likely took some reassurance from these trends.

Balance Sheet Growth in Deposits and Loans

U.S. Bancorp showed healthy balance sheet momentum, with total average deposits up 0.7% sequentially to $515 billion. The bank reported record consumer deposit growth, while noninterest-bearing deposits rose both sequentially and year over year, holding around 16% of total deposits—an important offset to higher funding costs. Average loans climbed 1.4% quarter over quarter to $384 billion, led by strong year-over-year growth in commercial (about 10%) and credit card loans (roughly 15.7%). Those faster-growing categories now make up around 48% of total loans, helping support NII growth but also requiring tight credit discipline.

Capital Strength and Attractive Returns

Capital levels and shareholder returns remained robust. Tangible book value per common share increased 18.2% year over year, reflecting both retained earnings and balance sheet marks moving in the right direction. Return on tangible common equity was a healthy 18.4%, while return on average assets was 1.19% for the quarter—both solid figures for a large regional bank. The efficiency ratio improved to 57.4%, highlighting management’s success in extracting more revenue from each dollar of expense. Together, these metrics support a narrative of a well-capitalized bank generating strong, improving returns.

BTIG Acquisition Targets Fee Upside and Capital Markets Scale

The pending acquisition of BTIG was presented as a strategic bolt-on that deepens U.S. Bancorp’s capital markets capabilities and fee revenue potential. The two firms have already worked together on more than 350 deals over a decade-long partnership, giving management confidence in cultural and operational fit. BTIG is expected to contribute $175 million to $200 million of fee revenue per quarter once integrated, though current guidance for 2026 excludes this upside. Executives highlighted expected revenue synergies and the ability to offer a broader set of advisory and trading services to institutional and corporate clients.

Global Fund Services Delivers High-Growth Niche

Global Fund Services (GFS) continues to emerge as a fast-growing, strategically important niche. GFS total net revenue grew about 12% in 2025 and has delivered an approximately 11% compound annual growth rate since 2021. The platform onboarded nearly half of all new U.S. ETF launches in 2025, underscoring its competitive positioning. Beyond fee income, GFS is attracting operational deposits and money market assets under management, creating additional balance sheet and revenue benefits. Management portrayed GFS as a scalable, high-return business that enhances the overall growth profile of the franchise.

Merger Costs and BTIG Capital Impact Temper Near-Term EPS

While broadly bullish on BTIG’s strategic benefits, management acknowledged near-term financial trade-offs. They expect merger-related costs over the coming quarters to offset the initial pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) contribution, making earnings per share effectively neutral in the short run. The BTIG transaction will reduce the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio by approximately 12 basis points, modest but not immaterial as the bank balances growth, regulatory expectations, and shareholder returns. Near-term buyback capacity could be somewhat muted while integration costs flow through, though management framed these as manageable and temporary.

Regulatory and Tailoring Uncertainty Looms Over Growth

A key overhang discussed on the call was regulatory and supervisory uncertainty, particularly around capital and tailoring rules. With period-end assets at $692 billion—close to the $700 billion threshold associated with tighter Category Two treatment—management is closely monitoring potential changes that could affect capital, liquidity, and operational requirements. While no specific rule outcomes were predicted, leadership acknowledged that shifting regulatory expectations could influence how aggressively the bank grows, manages its balance sheet, and returns capital to shareholders.

Expenses and One-Off Items Could Pressure Margins

Noninterest expense rose about 0.7% sequentially to roughly $4.2 billion, as severance charges and other one-time items partly offset favorable FDIC expense. Management emphasized that strategic investments—in technology, infrastructure, and growth businesses—will ramp up in 2026. While the plan assumes revenue continues to outpace expenses, there is recognition that if top-line growth slows, these investments could temporarily pressure expense ratios and margins. Still, the bank’s track record of nine quarters of stable expenses gives management confidence in its ability to calibrate costs to conditions.

Policy Risk: Credit Card Rate Caps and Competition Act

Executives flagged macro policy risk, especially around proposals to cap credit card interest rates and the Credit Card Competition Act. Using a hypothetical 10% rate cap as an example, management estimated that more than 90% of their clients would be negatively affected, arguing such caps could restrict access to credit rather than protect borrowers. They view aspects of these proposals as materially negative for both customers and earnings, given U.S. Bancorp’s meaningful credit card exposure and growth ambitions in that segment. While still in the legislative and regulatory arena, these policy developments were framed as real risks that investors should track.

Mixed Results Across Payments Segments

Despite overall payments strength, not all segments are firing equally. Corporate payments, including corporate card and treasury-related activity, remained negative year over year and are expected to stay weak into the first half of 2026 before recovering. Management suggested that broader macro conditions and client spending patterns are weighing on this line, even as other parts of the payments franchise improve. Investors were encouraged to view these headwinds as cyclical and transitory, but they do add some noise to the otherwise strong fee growth narrative.

Investment Portfolio Size Limits Near-Term NIM Upside

The bank’s sizable $171 billion investment portfolio remains a swing factor in net interest margin performance. Management noted that the portfolio can flex depending on loan growth opportunities, but a larger fixed-rate book means more assets will reprice in 2026 at narrower spreads given lower long-term interest rates. This dynamic may cap how quickly NIM can expand, even as deposit mix improves and higher-yielding loans grow. For investors, the message was that NIM progress will likely be gradual rather than explosive, shaped as much by asset repricing as by rate cuts or loan growth.

Guidance Points to Continued Growth and Capital Returns

Looking ahead, U.S. Bancorp guided to full-year 2026 total net revenue growth of 4%–6%, with at least 200 basis points of positive operating leverage, excluding any benefit from BTIG. Management expects mid-single-digit growth in both NII and fees for the year, supported by projected loan growth of 3%–4%, led by commercial and card. For the first quarter of 2026, they see NII (on an FTE basis) up 3%–4% versus 2025, fee revenue up 5%–6%, and noninterest expenses up roughly 1%. Capital return plans call for increasing share repurchases from about $100 million to $200 million this quarter, on a glide path toward an approximately 75% payout target over time. They also reiterated a path for net interest margin expansion from the current 2.77% toward around 3% by 2027, though BTIG-related merger costs and a roughly 12-basis-point CET1 impact will offset some near-term benefits as integration proceeds.

In closing, U.S. Bancorp’s earnings call painted the picture of a bank with rising earnings power, strong balance sheet and credit metrics, and a clear plan to grow both interest and fee income while keeping expenses in check. Strategic moves like the BTIG acquisition and the expansion of Global Fund Services aim to deepen high-value fee streams, even as management navigates regulatory uncertainty, policy risk, and pockets of weakness in corporate payments. For investors, the story is one of solid, diversified growth with manageable near-term headwinds—making U.S. Bancorp a name to watch as it executes on its 2026 and 2027 targets.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/shutterstock_1150180799-750x406.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 15:07:53.318615

Once completed, Buj will be the largest battery energy storage asset in Hungary, playing a key role in enhancing grid flexibility and supporting the integration of renewable energy into the national power system.

João Manso Neto, CEO of the Greenvolt Group, responded: “Battery storage is already an essential pillar of modern energy systems, providing the flexibility and resilience needed to support the growing share of renewables. This financing reinforces Greenvolt’s strategy to scale up storage assets across key European markets and strengthens our position in a segment that is increasingly central to the energy transition.”

Balázs Toldi, Head of Corporates Division at UniCredit Bank Hungary, added: “I strongly believe that Europe’s strength lies in sustainable and predictable energy sources, and I am proud that our group’s commitment enables us to play an active role in driving this progress.”

László Lakos, Director of Structured Finance at UniCredit Bank Hungary, noted: “The financing of Greenvolt's landmark Buj project demonstrates UniCredit Bank’s commitment to supporting Hungary’s energy transition and to driving innovation in sustainable financing. We are proud to support Greenvolt as one of Europe’s largest renewable energy developers and to deepen our excellent group partnership covering multiple geographies and assets, and we look forward to further co-operation.”

Adrian Góralski, Director of M&A and Project Finance at Greenvolt Power, concluded: “Our teams, together with the highly experienced professionals at UniCredit Bank Hungary, worked closely to structure a tailored project finance solution that meets the needs of both parties and supports the delivery of Project Buj.”

Greenvolt Group currently has a 14.1 GW probability-weighted pipeline across Europe, the US, and Asia, covering solar, wind, and BESS projects, of which around 1.7 GW is under construction.

The chocolate maker said CEO Peter Feld would leave his role on 26 January “to pursue other career opportunities” after less than three years on the job.

The CEO change signals the business is still not developing as hoped, analysts from Zeurcher Kantonalbank said in a note to investors.

One of the world’s top cocoa processors, which supplies chocolate for Magnum ice cream and Nestlé’s Kit Kat bars, said its sales volume fell 9.9% to 509,401 metric tonnes in the first quarter that ran from September to November.

Analysts were expecting 512,000 tonnes on average in a company-provided poll.

Shares of the company, which also confirmed its outlook for the financial year, were trading 3.4% higher at 0957 GMT, a move than analysts attributed largely to the CEO change.

Vontobel analysts wrote, “The appointment of Hein Schumacher lands like a small bombshell.”

‘In The Right Position At The Right Time’

Talking to analysts on a call, chairman Patrick De Maeseneire said Barry Callebaut was undergoing the biggest transformation in its history, having been unable to foresee the volatile geopolitical situation and record cocoa prices that have shaken the market.

De Maeseneire said, “People often forget the right leader is in the right position at the right time.

“And the right time is often forgotten. And doing a transformation requires a certain profile of leader.”

He however denied that the company was exploring a separation of its global cocoa unit from the rest of the group, as reported by Reuters last month.

AlphaValue analyst Filippo Ercole Piva noted that Schumacher was behind the separation of Unilever’s ice cream business Magnum.

He said, “They are hiring a guy that has experience spinning off certain businesses, so I think they are paying for that.”

Leadership Change

Barry Callebaut’s change of leadership is the latest of several for leading consumer companies over the last 18 months.

Schumacher, a Dutch national ousted by Unilever in February 2025, will benefit from already having deep industry relationships with Barry’s key customers, Vontobel said in a note.

Feld began his role as CEO in April 2023 and has steered the company through high cocoa prices, to which Barry is more exposed than consumer-facing firms, and a subsequent fall in demand.

The latest quarterly data on cocoa grind, a proxy for chocolate demand, showed a slum in Asia and fell 8.3% year-on-year in Europe, which represents roughly two-fifths of Barry’s revenue.

Barry buys cocoa beans that it processes into cocoa butter and powder.

Manufacturers then use its product to produce chocolate and candy which is sold to consumers directly.

After three cuts to the company’s volume guidance last year, it guided in November for a mid-single-digit percentage decline in sales of cocoa products in 2025/26.",https://img.resized.co/checkout/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLm1hZGlzb25wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMuZXVcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDIxXFxcLzA5XFxcLzAxMTI1ODM2XFxcL0hlaW4tU2NodW1hY2hlci1Gcmllc2xhbmRDYW1waW5hLmpwZWdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6MTIwMCxcImhlaWdodFwiOjYyNyxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LmNoZWNrb3V0LmllXFxcL2lcXFwvbm9pbWFnZS5wbmdcIixcIm9wdGlvbnNcIjpbXX0iLCJoYXNoIjoiMzEyNTJjZGYwZGU2MTdlMzQwMjcwMTU4Yzc5NjQzNWExYjM1MjEzOSJ9/barry-callebaut-taps-ex-unilever-boss-schumacher-as-ceo-checkout.jpeg,N,,2026-01-21 11:09:32.166984

According to GSK in a Jan. 20, 2026, press release, IgE is the only clinically validated systemic target shown to protect against harmful allergic and inflammatory immune responses, with approximately 94% of severe food allergies mediated through this pathway (1).
“Food allergies cause severe health impacts to patients with existing treatment requiring injections as frequently as every [two] weeks.
What could this deal mean for the future food allergy treatment landscape?
Food allergies impose a substantial economic and societal burden, with US families facing an estimated $33 billion in annual costs (5).","GSK’s newly announced $2.2 billion acquisition of RAPT Therapeutics reflects a broader industry shift toward immunology assets that pair validated biological targets with improved treatment durability. Central to the transaction is ozureprubart, a long-acting anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) monoclonal antibody (mAb) in Phase IIb development for prophylactic protection against food allergens (1).

As food allergy prevalence continues to rise, the deal highlights how dosing frequency, manufacturability, and late-stage risk reduction are shaping biopharmaceutical acquisition strategies (1,2).

According to GSK in a Jan. 20, 2026, press release, IgE is the only clinically validated systemic target shown to protect against harmful allergic and inflammatory immune responses, with approximately 94% of severe food allergies mediated through this pathway (1). Existing therapies require injections every two to four weeks, however, which creates challenges for patients in terms of adherence, care delivery, and healthcare utilization—particularly given that most patients with severe food allergies are children (1).

“We are excited to enter into this agreement with GSK, which offers an attractive path forward for our programs, particularly the opportunity we envision for ozureprubart in food allergy,” said Brian Wong, president and CEO, RAPT Therapeutics, in the release (1). “This transaction has the potential to provide access to the global development and commercialization capabilities, resources and infrastructure that GSK has to offer and ultimately bring added value to our pipeline, patients, and stockholders.”

Why does extended-interval anti-IgE dosing matter for food allergy care?

Ozureprubart is designed to extend dosing intervals to approximately 12 weeks, a change that could materially alter prophylactic treatment paradigms. Less frequent dosing may reduce treatment burden for patients and caregivers while also influencing how healthcare systems manage chronic allergy care (1).

From a development perspective, long-acting biologics require precise control over formulation stability, pharmacokinetics, and batch consistency, placing added emphasis on mature manufacturing platforms (3).

Data from a Phase IIb trial (prestIgE) evaluating ozureprubart as monotherapy are expected in 2027, and Phase III trials are planned across adult and pediatric populations at risk of severe reactions. In the United States, more than 17 million people are diagnosed with food allergies, and over 1.3 million experience severe reactions annually, resulting in more than 3 million emergency and hospital visits each year (1).

“The addition of ozureprubart brings another promising new, potential best-in-class treatment to GSK’s pipeline,” said Tony Wood, chief scientific officer, GSK, in the release (1). “Food allergies cause severe health impacts to patients with existing treatment requiring injections as frequently as every [two] weeks. Ozureprubart offers the opportunity to bring sustained protection to patients with dosing every 12 weeks and is consistent with our approach to acquire assets that address validated targets and where there is clear unmet medical need.”

How does this acquisition reflect shifts in biopharmaceutical development strategy?

The transaction underscores growing industry preference for mid-stage clinical assets with established mechanisms of action. Anti-IgE therapies benefit from regulatory and clinical precedent, allowing innovation to focus on durability, patient eligibility, and long-term safety rather than target validation.

Approximately 25% of patients are currently ineligible for existing therapies, suggesting potential for broader access if late-stage trials support ozureprubart’s clinical profile (1). Long-acting mAbs also introduce new considerations for manufacturing scale-up and lifecycle planning.

Extended dosing intervals may stabilize demand forecasting, but they require early alignment between development, formulation science, and global supply infrastructure to ensure consistent product availability (4).

What could this deal mean for the future food allergy treatment landscape?

Food allergies impose a substantial economic and societal burden, with US families facing an estimated $33 billion in annual costs (5). For biopharma developers and manufacturers, therapies offering sustained protection with fewer administrations may improve adherence while reducing variability in production and distribution.

If confirmed in late-stage trials, ozureprubart could help redefine expectations for durability in allergy biologics and reinforce industry momentum toward differentiated, long-acting immunology therapies (1).

The Nasdaq-listed company said it will invest $50m in development capital through Glenfarne Alaska Partners, while also lining up as the preferred tonnage provider for at least six LNG carrier newbuilds to support the export phase of the project.

Under the agreement, Danaos would construct and operate the LNG carriers that will ship cargoes from Alaska to global markets once the project moves into its export phase.

Glenfarne is developing Alaska LNG in two standalone stages. Phase one centres on a 765-mile pipeline from Alaska’s North Slope to supply the state’s domestic gas demand. Phase two adds liquefaction and export infrastructure designed to handle up to 20m tonnes per annum of LNG.

Glenfarne took over as lead developer of Alaska LNG in March last year and has since secured preliminary offtake commitments for around 11m tpa from buyers in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. The project’s partner list also includes Baker Hughes and POSCO International. Glenfarne holds a 75% stake in Alaska LNG, with the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation owning the remaining 25%.

For Danaos, the move marks a step into LNG shipping and energy-linked investments, adding another leg to a business best known for its containership exposure.

Chief executive John Coustas said the project opens up a new supply source for the North Pacific and gives Danaos an opportunity to deploy its shipping expertise in LNG transportation.

The deal comes as Danaos continues to build out its wider fleet. The company currently controls 75 containerships and has more than 20 newbuildings on order. It has also been expanding in dry bulk, recently confirming the purchase of a capesize bulker due for delivery in late first-quarter 2026, taking its capesize fleet to 11 ships.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ALASKA-LNG-Alaska-Gasline-Development-Corporation.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 07:01:02.521051

French personal care giant L’Oréal announced plans to invest Rs 3,500 crore (350 million euros) over the next five years in Telangana, with its new Global Capability Centre (GCC) set to be inaugurated in Hyderabad this November. The facility will focus on advanced beauty-tech solutions, artificial intelligence, and digital innovation.

The company said the Hyderabad GCC will create around 2,000 highly skilled jobs, including positions for AI specialists, data scientists, and technology engineers. The hub is expected to accelerate the development of AI-driven beauty products and services, positioning Hyderabad as a key centre for global digital operations.

L’Oréal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus made the announcement on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland. He described the GCC as “the world’s first Beauty Tech Hub of its kind,” serving as a flagship for AI-powered beauty innovations. “With an initial investment of over Rs 3,500 crore through 2030, this hub will become a global powerhouse, integrating AI, generative AI, and other emerging technologies,” Hieronimus said.

The centre will function as L’Oréal’s innovation, technology, data, and supply chain hub, supporting the company’s global digital transformation. Telangana Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy welcomed the investment, highlighting its alignment with the state’s “Telangana Rising: 2047 Vision” and the creation of high-value jobs. “This decision reflects the confidence global leaders have in Telangana’s innovation ecosystem and talent pool,” he said.

Industry Minister D. Sridhar Babu noted that Hyderabad’s selection for the GCC was a “strong endorsement” of the state’s ability to attract leading global companies. He added that the state government is committed to extending full support to L’Oréal and other international investors.

Hieronimus emphasized India’s strategic role in the company’s global plans, citing over three decades of L’Oréal’s presence in the country. “The future of beauty lies at the intersection of science, technology, and creativity. Hyderabad will now sit at the heart of our AI and digital ambitions,” he said.

The new hub will operate alongside L’Oréal’s global technology network in countries including France, the US, China, Singapore, Spain, Poland, Canada, Brazil, and Mexico. Officials said the GCC will foster collaboration across L’Oréal’s global teams to co-create innovations for the beauty industry.

Telangana’s Special Chief Secretary (Industries) Sanjay Kumar also invited L’Oréal to explore potential manufacturing opportunities in Hyderabad, in addition to the GCC investment. Hieronimus expressed interest in expanding the company’s footprint in the state, signaling further potential investments in the near future.

Further, with AI lowering entry barriers, he said that when it comes to content, quality now matters more than quantity.","With user search now shifting towards an agentic web, the World Wide Web is no longer what it once was. As a result, it has become important for brands to build digital experiences not just for humans but also for AI, as per Vyshak Venugopalan, Senior Director, India & JAPAC Partner at Adobe India. While this is worrying for brands, as they lose some control over how they are represented, it also means they must adapt to how discovery is changing.

“Brands should recognise that they are now building for both humans and AI. This is not the end of SEO; it is about combining SEO with generative optimisation. Without this, brands risk not being accurately represented in AI-driven environments,” said Venugopalan.

There are risks here. If a company’s content is not structured and AI-readable, their brand can be misrepresented, as per Venugopalan. “We have already seen this happen to platforms that once dominated user journeys. Revenue models are changing because consumer opinions are being shaped elsewhere. What brands need are guided and trusted conversations when users finally arrive on their apps or websites,” he added.

Further, with AI lowering entry barriers, he said that when it comes to content, quality now matters more than quantity. He added that while the demand for content has grown exponentially, it also goes stale far more quickly than it did even six months ago.

If a company has eight products, once you factor in channels, languages, and formats, this can translate into hundreds of thousands of content assets, he added. “Many enterprises are unprepared for this. Creating content that is authentic, structured, brand-aligned, and scalable is very different from producing generic material,” he further explained.

This means companies must assess whether they have a content supply chain that is AI-accelerated but human-led. While AI can generate volume, human oversight is essential to ensure brand integrity. According to Venugopalan, this is a journey rather than a quick fix and requires a clear roadmap to create content that is efficient, cost-effective, compelling, and conversion-driven.",https://media.assettype.com/outlookbusiness/2025-08-07/eqqbeqtn/ABC.avif?w=1200&amp;ar=40%3A21&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;ogImage=true&amp;mode=crop&amp;enlarge=true&amp;overlay=false&amp;overlay_position=bottom&amp;overlay_width=100,N,,2026-01-21 08:59:37.639876

A great starting point for your Kraft Heinz research is our analysis highlighting that could impact your investment decision.
If Kraft Heinz has sparked more questions than answers, do not stop here.","What Kraft Heinz’s Recent Returns May Signal for Investors

Kraft Heinz (KHC) has seen its share price under pressure recently, with negative returns over the past month, past 3 months, year to date, and past year, even as annual revenue and net income figures remain positive.

At a share price of $23.76, Kraft Heinz’s momentum looks muted, with a 30 day share price return of a 3.06% decline and a 1 year total shareholder return of a 14.58% loss, pointing to fading enthusiasm despite positive annual revenue and net income figures.

If this kind of mixed performance has you looking around the market, it could be a good moment to broaden your search with .

With Kraft Heinz trading at $23.76 and indicators like analyst targets and intrinsic value estimates suggesting a discount, the key question is whether this is a genuine value opportunity or whether the market already sees limited future growth.

Price-to-Sales of 1.1x: Is it justified?

On a P/S of 1.1x at a share price of $23.76, Kraft Heinz screens as good value against peers in some checks, but looks more expensive in others.

The P/S ratio compares what investors are paying for each dollar of revenue. It is often used for companies where earnings are weak or volatile. For Kraft Heinz, this tilt toward sales-based metrics fits with its current unprofitable status and the reliance on future earnings improvement rather than present profits.

Against its own fair P/S estimate of 1.3x, Kraft Heinz trades at a lower level. This suggests the market price is sitting below where our fair ratio work indicates it could settle. Yet when you stack that 1.1x P/S next to the broader US Food industry average of 0.8x, the stock looks more expensive than many peers, hinting that investors are still assigning a premium even with recent share price pressure.

Result: Price-to-Sales of 1.1x (ABOUT RIGHT)

However, you also need to weigh risks such as Kraft Heinz’s recent net income loss of $4.4b and a 30.7% three-year total shareholder return decline.

Another View: What the SWS DCF Model Suggests

While the P/S of 1.1x makes Kraft Heinz look roughly in line with its fair ratio work, our DCF model points in a different direction. It estimates future cash flows at $68.79 per share versus today’s $23.76 price, which flags a sizeable potential undervaluation.

That kind of gap can signal either an opportunity or that the cash flow assumptions are too optimistic, so it is worth asking which story you think fits Kraft Heinz better, and why.

As The New York Times reported, Delta planned to have premium-cabin revenue supplant main cabin by 2027.

Now, that option is coming to its premium cabins as well.

The airline revealed during a Q4 earnings call last week that it will soon begin offering tiered fares for both Business and First class, becoming the first U.S.-based airline to do so.

Although the details have not yet been revealed, it's likely that these fares will operate similar to Basic Economy, which unbundles the airline seat itself from other perks like lounge access, seat selection, and the ability to earn SkyMiles. An exact timeline has not been announced, but the company plans to launch the new offerings sometime this year.

Delta is also set to offer an Extra tier for its premium cabins, mirroring a tier already offered in its Main cabin. The Extra Economy tier currently offers boarding and SkyMiles upgrades as well as increased ticketing flexibility.

No other U.S. airline currently offers lower-cost options for its premium cabins, although international carriers like Qatar Airways, Emirates, and Etihad offer similar products for their Business class fares.

Airline President Outlines New Strategy

Delta President Glen Hauenstein said in the call that the airline plans to offer “three categories for every product, which is basic, main, and extra.”

Hauenstein explained his reasoning, saying passengers will appreciate the added flexibility across all of its cabins.

“I think that if you were offered a $500 ticket, there was no reason for you to ever want to pay more than $500 because it was fully loaded,"" he said. ""Now that seat is $500, but you can buy it for $450 if you’re willing to get the seat assignment at 48 hours, if you’re willing to have it non-refundable, and then all the way up to extra where it’s fully refundable and you get the best seats unlocked at that time.""

Ticket Update Comes Amid Changing Airline Economics

Delta's decision to offer both pared-back and premium options for all its tickets comes as the economics of air travel have changed. The airline sold over a billion dollars less in main cabin tickets last year, but still had its most profitable year ever due to jumps in business and first class ticket sales as well as co-branded credit cards. As The New York Times reported, Delta planned to have premium-cabin revenue supplant main cabin by 2027. It ended up happening by 2025, two years earlier than projected.

Meanwhile, budget airlines like Spirit and Frontier are struggling. Spirit continues to teeter on the verge of bankruptcy, while low-cost carriers Sun Country Airlines and Avelo Airlines recently announced plans to merge in order to better compete against its larger rivals. The introduction of Basic fares like Delta offers is largely credited with the shift, and it seems likely that new Business and First class ticketing tiers are likely to further shake up the economics of air travel.",https://s.yimg.com/os/en/men_s_journal_718/fe5a537ad50284f02595b35bda60c09a,N,,2026-01-21 02:58:39.421065

Scheduled for a November 2026 opening, the facility marks a significant shift in how beauty giants integrate technology. Rather than a traditional administrative office, this hub is designed as a global powerhouse for innovation, data science, and supply chain logistics.

The announcement followed a meeting at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2026 between L'Oréal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus and the `Telangana Rising’ delegation, led by Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy.

A Global Nerve Center for Digital Transformation

The Hyderabad GCC will not merely serve regional interests but will act as the digital backbone for L'Oréal’s global operations. CEO Nicolas Hieronimus highlighted that the solutions developed in Telangana—ranging from Artificial Intelligence (AI) to advanced data analytics—will be exported to L'Oréal facilities worldwide. ""This facility will support our digital transformation on a global scale. Tech solutions generated here in Hyderabad will be supplied to our facilities all around the world,"" Hieronimus explained during the summit.

Highlights of the Strategic Discussion

The meeting between the Telangana delegation and L'Oréal leadership covered several key pillars of growth:

The Beauty-Tech Niche: Minister D Sridhar Babu emphasized that while Hyderabad is already a leader in med-tech and health-tech, L'Oréal’s entry creates an entirely new category—Beauty-Tech—expanding the state’s GCC portfolio.

The AI Connection: The delegation presented the newly launched Telangana AI Innovation Hub (TAIH). Hieronimus expressed a strong interest in the hub, noting that AI is central to L'Oréal’s future strategy for personalized beauty and virtual ""try-on"" experiences.

Future Manufacturing: Beyond the tech hub, special chief secretary Sanjay Kumar formally invited L'Oréal to establish a manufacturing unit in the state. Citing Telangana’s robust infrastructure and existing ecosystem, the proposal was met with a positive response, with L'Oréal agreeing to explore future investments in local production.

A Growing Ecosystem: The Minister noted that L'Oréal joins an elite group of global giants—including Netflix, Vanguard, and Marriott—that have recently chosen Hyderabad as their global base.

What is a Beauty-Tech GCC?

To understand the scale of this investment, it helps to look at the ""Beauty-Tech"" ecosystem L'Oréal has been building. The Hyderabad center is expected to focus on:

Hyper-personalization: Using AI to analyze skin and hair types for custom product recommendations

Smart Supply Chain: Real-time data tracking to optimize global distribution and reduce carbon footprints

Augmented Reality: Developing the next generation of virtual makeup and hair color testing tools

Big Data: Analyzing global consumer trends to predict the next big beauty movements

Looking Ahead

Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy and Minister D Sridhar Babu have been officially invited to lead the inauguration ceremony in November 2026.

Despite the positive brand news, Levi Strauss’ recent share price performance has been subdued, with a 1-day share price return decline of 3.68% and a 30-day share price return decline of 3.45%. At the same time, the 1-year total shareholder return of 23.02% and 3-year total shareholder return of 36.90% point to momentum that has built over a longer stretch.

If brand strength and sustainability are on your radar, this could be a good moment to widen the lens and check out as another corner of the market to research.

With Levi Strauss posting a 1-year total shareholder return of 23.02%, trading at $20.96, and sitting at roughly a 30% discount to the average analyst price target, you have to ask: is there real value here, or is the market already baking in future growth?

Price to earnings of 15.7x, is it justified?

At a last close of US$20.96, Levi Strauss trades on a P/E of 15.7x, which screens as good value against both its own fair P/E and key peer groups.

P/E compares the company’s share price to its earnings, so it is a quick way to see how much investors are paying for each dollar of profit. For a branded apparel group like Levi Strauss, this matters because earnings quality, return on equity and growth expectations often influence how far that multiple can stretch.

Here, the 15.7x P/E sits below the estimated fair P/E of 18x, which suggests the market price is not fully reflecting the level of earnings being generated. It also comes alongside high quality earnings, a 24.2% return on equity and earnings that grew much faster than their 5 year average. This provides some context for why a higher multiple could potentially be supported over time.

Against the wider market, the P/E appears more compressed. It is lower than the US Luxury industry average of 20.1x and well below the peer average of 31.9x. This points to a gap that could close if sentiment shifts toward companies with stronger profitability metrics.

Result: Price-to-earnings of 15.7x (UNDERVALUED)

However, you still need to weigh risks such as recent short term share price weakness, as well as the possibility that brand driven expectations outpace actual revenue and earnings trends.

Another view on value

Our DCF model points in the same direction as the P/E comparison but from a different angle. With Levi Strauss trading at US$20.96 versus an SWS DCF fair value estimate of US$25.52, the shares sit at about an 18% discount on this method as well. If both signals are pointing to value, what factors could potentially influence the story from here?

The packaged food giant has been struggling with sluggish sales amid a lack of innovation, underinvestment in brands, fierce competition from healthier alternatives, and rising food prices. The filing does not confirm a sale but enables the selling shareholder to dispose of its holding.

Why Is Berkshire Exiting Its Stake?

Warren Buffett first acquired shares during the 2015 merger between Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz, alongside Brazilian private equity group 3G Capital. However, the combined company did not progress as expected. Buffett has called the investment a mistake due to excessive optimism about its prospects.

Under Buffett’s leadership, Berkshire already wrote down the KHC investment twice and took huge losses: a $3 billion write-down in 2019 and another $3.76 billion in August 2025.

Kraft Heinz Prepares for a Split

Berkshire’s potential sale comes ahead of Kraft Heinz’s planned split in the second half of this year. In September 2025, KHC announced the breakup, citing the merged company’s complex structure, which has hindered effective capital allocation, initiative prioritization, and scaling of promising areas.

The split will create two companies, one for groceries and the other for sauces and spreads, so each can focus resources better and improve results. Kraft Heinz also pointed to shifting consumer tastes toward healthier foods and weak sales, including a 3% drop in 2024, as factors driving the decision.

KHC appointed new CEO Steve Cahillane on January 1, 2026, to oversee the split, the same day when Greg Abel took over Berkshire’s helm from Buffett. Both Abel and Buffett have opposed the split, which could also be one of the reasons for Berkshire’s potential exit.

Why Is Kraft Heinz Stock So Low?

KHC stock has lost 19.4% over the past year amid ongoing challenges. On TipRanks, Kraft Heinz has a Hold consensus rating based on zero Buys, 13 Holds, and one Sell rating. The average Kraft Heinz price target of $25.38 implies 6.8% upside potential from current levels.

The announcement was made following a high-level meeting at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2026 between D. Sridhar Babu, Hon’ble Minister for IT, Electronics & Industries, Sanjay Kumar, Special Chief Secretary, Government of Telangana, and Nicolas Hieronimus, CEO of L’Oréal.

Billed as the first Beauty Tech hub of its kind globally, the Hyderabad facility will serve as a flagship centre for developing the next generation of AI-powered beauty innovation and services. With an initial investment of over ₹3,500 crores (€350 million) through 2030, the hub will focus on Data, AI, Generative AI, Agentic AI, and other emerging technologies. It is expected to create 2,000 highly skilled jobs, including roles for AI specialists, tech engineers, and data scientists, while accelerating the global deployment of AI-led beauty solutions at scale.

The partnership between L’Oréal and the Government of Telangana was formalised at Davos and stands as a key milestone in the 2026 India–France Year of Innovation. Beyond infrastructure investment, the collaboration emphasises talent development and upskilling, with the vision of building “from India, for the world” AI-driven beauty solutions. By establishing the hub in Hyderabad, L’Oréal aims to contribute to Telangana’s growing stature as a centre for digital excellence and high-value technology talent.

The India Tech Hub will also play a strategic role within L’Oréal’s integrated global AI and Tech ecosystem, complementing existing hubs in France, the USA, China, Singapore, Spain, Poland, Canada, Brazil, and Mexico. Together, these centres are designed to foster global collaboration and co-create the future of Beauty Tech.

Welcoming the development, Revanth Reddy, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Telangana, said, “We are delighted that L’Oréal has chosen Hyderabad for its new global tech hub, a decision that reflects the deep confidence global leaders place in Telangana’s innovation ecosystem and highly skilled talent pool. This partnership directly supports our ‘Telangana Rising: 2047 Vision’ by creating 2,000 high-value jobs and positioning our state as a global epicentre for AI and digital excellence.”

At ServiceNow, we’re actively realigning our Finance & Strategy organization for an AI-native future. As AI becomes embedded in how decisions are made, our workforce must evolve just as quickly. For us, AI fluency is now table stakes. Every role in Finance & Strategy must confidently leverage agentic tools—from research platforms and summarization engines to forecasting copilots and modeling assistants—to accelerate insight and execution. But fluency alone is not sufficient. The real shift is toward hybrid talent: professionals who combine deep financial and strategic judgment with the ability to work with, interrogate, and govern AI at scale.

ServiceNow just signed a three-year deal with OpenAI. This is the specialization model playing out in real time. ServiceNow is excellent at workflow platforms. OpenAI is excellent at AI models. Neither is trying to do the other's job. Each focuses on what they do best and partners for the rest. This validates what I keep hearing from vendors: ""We don't have the bandwidth to build everything."" ServiceNow could have tried building their own models. They have the resources. They did if I recall correctly. But building world-class AI models would pull focus from what actually differentiates them - their workflow platform and enterprise integration capabilities. OpenAI gets distribution into one of the largest enterprise software platforms without building workflow tools. ServiceNow gets leading AI models without years of R&D investment. Both win because they're not trying to own layers they don't need to own. The article (link in comments) mentions ServiceNow has similar deals with OpenAI's competitors. That's the point. They're platform-agnostic because their value isn't the AI models themselves. Their moat is the workflow layer, the data layer, and how well they integrate into enterprise operations. When AI models commoditize, differentiation comes from everything around the models. This includes the workflows, the context, and the integration quality. This is the same model Unito operates on. We specialize in the integration layer so vendors can focus on what they do best while their systems actually talk to each other. ServiceNow's partnership with OpenAI is a blueprint for how enterprise AI gets built at scale. Not by vendors trying to own the entire stack, but by specialists focusing on their layer and partnering for the rest. The vendors that figure this out will ship products people actually adopt. The ones still trying to build everything will keep struggling with complexity.

OpenAI and ServiceNow’s three-year deal embeds AI models and agents directly into enterprise workflow software. ServiceNow made a revenue commitment to OpenAI; customers will access OpenAI intelligence within ServiceNow platforms. The deal reflects AI agents becoming standard business software infrastructure, not standalone products but embedded capabilities. ∙ Distribution Strategy: OpenAI gains enterprise reach through ServiceNow’s installed base rather than selling direct. The revenue commitment structure guarantees OpenAI income while ServiceNow absorbs adoption risk—a favorable arrangement for the model maker expanding beyond consumer chatbots. ∙ Computer-Use Integration: ServiceNow will embed OpenAI’s computer-use model, enabling agents to perform IT tasks autonomously—restarting computers, accessing legacy mainframe data. This targets real enterprise pain: unlocking information trapped in old systems without costly custom integration. ∙ Voice Agent Development: ServiceNow will build customer service voice agents using OpenAI’s speech models. The workflow software + voice AI combination creates end-to-end automation for call centers and IT helpdesks—high-volume, high-cost functions ripe for agent replacement. ∙ Competitive Positioning: OpenAI faces Anthropic, Google, and Microsoft in enterprise AI. ServiceNow’s “open platform” stance—maintaining relationships with multiple model providers—means this deal provides distribution without exclusivity. OpenAI must compete on capability within ServiceNow’s multi-model environment. ∙ IT Labor Implications: The article explicitly notes AI agents will “disrupt the IT labor market, which has been in steady decline.” ServiceNow deploying “forward deployed engineers” to help customers implement automation acknowledges the product’s purpose: reducing human IT headcount through agent substitution. The partnership structure previews enterprise AI’s distribution model: workflow platforms become the surface where agents operate, model makers provide intelligence, and customers pay through existing software relationships rather than new AI contracts https://lnkd.in/ekr98TKb

It was only a matter of time, but still ""newsworthy""...not quite ""breaking news"" worth though.. #ServiceNow's deal with #OpenAI allows them to enhance their platforms by integrating the ChatGPT-maker’s AI models into ServiceNow’s products. In other words, ServiceNow doesn't have to build out the #AI capabilities on their own. Of course, this comes at a cost...for ServiceNow and ServiceNow customers. Based on the reporting, ServiceNow has made a revenue commitment to OpenAI. Specifics were not shared, but did we expect them to be? ServiceNow customers should expect an accelerated push to get adoption and usage of ServiceNow ""AI"" offerings. ServiceNow customers, that have not properly protected themselves, should also expected meaningful price increases imposed come renewal time.

Boston Scientific’s Big Bets On Growth Versus Valuation In Focus

Simply Wall St

Reviewed by Bailey Pemberton

January 21, 2026

Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) announced a $14.5b agreement to acquire Penumbra, expanding into neurovascular and mechanical thrombectomy markets.

The company also agreed to acquire Valencia Technologies, adding the FDA approved eCoin System for overactive bladder to its Urology portfolio.

Both deals mark some of the largest transactions for Boston Scientific in recent years and target underpenetrated medical device segments.

Boston Scientific comes into these acquisitions with shares at $91.2 and a long run of strong multi year returns, including 99.0% over 3 years and 148.9% over 5 years. Recent performance has been softer, with a 9.6% decline over 1 year and smaller declines over the past week, month and year to date, so investors may be watching how these transactions influence sentiment.

For shareholders and potential investors, a central consideration is how effectively Boston Scientific can integrate Penumbra and Valencia Technologies and scale the new platforms. The deals meaningfully widen NYSE:BSX exposure to neurovascular, thrombectomy and urology devices, so future updates on regulatory, clinical and commercial execution around these assets are likely to be important catalysts.

Summary:

The dollar weakened as Greenland tensions and tariff threats escalated.

Barclays warns euro faces greater risk in a severe US–EU fallout.

NATO cohesion and European defence spending are key concerns.

Export-heavy economies like Germany are seen as most exposed.

Analysts expect limited US asset divestment even in worst case.

The US dollar weakened on Tuesday as markets reacted to an escalation in geopolitical tensions linked to President Donald Trump’s renewed push to assert control over Greenland, including threats to impose tariffs on European countries opposing the move.

While the greenback softened on the day, some strategists argue the longer-term risks from a deterioration in US–Europe relations may fall more heavily on the euro. Analysts at Barclays said that in an extreme scenario, the Greenland dispute could become a far greater problem for Europe and the single currency than for the United States.

Barclays noted that the situation has sharpened investor focus on strains within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, raising tail risks around alliance cohesion. European governments, already under pressure to lift defence spending following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, have this month deployed troops to Greenland and now face the prospect of trade retaliation from Washington. In a worst-case outcome, Barclays warned that relations between the US and its NATO partners could deteriorate to the point where Washington effectively disengages from the alliance.

Other analysts echoed the view that a tougher trade environment would be more damaging for Europe than the US. Export-heavy economies such as Germany, the region’s largest, are seen as particularly exposed, with tariffs likely to hurt European corporates and growth prospects more than their US counterparts. That dynamic, strategists argue, would ultimately pressure the euro more than the dollar.

Market moves on Tuesday reflected near-term risk aversion. The ICE US Dollar Index fell around 0.8%, extending its decline over the past year to nearly 10%, while US equities and bonds also sold off sharply.

Barclays cautioned against over-interpreting these initial reactions, arguing that knee-jerk market moves often differ from longer-term outcomes. Its base case remains that the US and Europe eventually find a compromise allowing Washington to meet its security objectives in Greenland without a full rupture in relations.

Even in a more adverse scenario, the bank does not expect a wholesale exit from US assets. Instead, any dollar weakness would likely reflect low hedging ratios among foreign investors rather than a mass divestment. Barclays added that Europe’s fiscal constraints mean the bar for policy-driven euro support remains high unless there is coordinated joint issuance to fund common defence capabilities.",https://images.investinglive.com/images/eurusd%20charrt%20update%2021%20January%202026_id_5809a09a-faac-4251-8005-82cfeef4dfac_size975.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 21:01:00.789090

Despite recent challenges, Kraft Heinz maintains a robust market position with a market capitalization of approximately $28.12 billion.

Kraft Heinz (KHC) has announced in a recent regulatory filing that it has taken steps to register the possible resale of up to 325,442,152 shares of its common stock. This action is in accordance with the terms outlined in the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, which dates back to July 2, 2015. This agreement involves The Kraft Heinz Company, 3G Global Food Holdings LP, and Berkshire Hathaway. The company submitted a prospectus supplement to the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 20, 2026, to facilitate this registration exclusively for the Selling Stockholder. This move potentially positions these shares for resale in the open market.

The Kraft Heinz Company, formed through the merger of Kraft and Heinz in July 2015, stands as one of North America's largest food and beverage manufacturers. The company is strategically positioned in the Consumer Defensive sector, specifically within the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. Its extensive portfolio includes well-known brands such as Oscar Mayer, Velveeta, and Philadelphia. With a market capitalization of approximately $28.12 billion, Kraft Heinz operates a vast distribution network that spans over 190 countries and territories, contributing to nearly 25% of its consolidated sales base outside North America.

Financial Health Analysis

Kraft Heinz's financial performance reflects a complex landscape. The company's revenue stands at $25.16 billion, with a three-year revenue growth rate of 0%. Despite a gross margin of 33.71%, the company faces challenges with a net margin of -17.35% and an EPS of -3.73. The operating margin is relatively strong at 19.45%, but the EBITDA margin is negative at -18.65%.

On the balance sheet, Kraft Heinz exhibits a current ratio of 1.13 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.51, indicating moderate leverage. The Altman Z-Score of 0.42 places the company in the distress zone, suggesting a potential risk of bankruptcy within the next two years. Insider activity reveals a trend of selling, with 250,000 shares sold in the past three months.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

In terms of valuation, Kraft Heinz's P/S ratio of 1.12 and P/B ratio of 0.68 are close to their historical lows, suggesting potential undervaluation. The forward P/E ratio is 9.47, indicating a cautious market outlook. Analyst recommendations average at 2.9, reflecting a hold sentiment. Technical indicators such as the RSI of 42.76 and moving averages suggest a neutral to slightly bearish trend.

Institutional ownership is robust at 83.5%, while insider ownership is relatively low at 0.96%. Recent insider activity has been predominantly selling, with no insider purchases in the past year.

IBM Deepens Enterprise AI Push With Governance Focus And GRAMMY IQ

Simply Wall St

Reviewed by Bailey Pemberton

January 20, 2026

IBM launched IBM Enterprise Advantage, a new offering focused on enterprise AI adoption and governance.

The company announced a collaboration with e& to deploy one of the region's first enterprise-grade agentic AI governance solutions.

IBM also worked on GRAMMY IQ, applying its AI capabilities to fan engagement in entertainment.

International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is leaning further into enterprise AI with products and partnerships that aim to embed AI into core business and compliance workflows. The company’s recent moves come with the stock around $291.35 and a 1 year return of 33.3%, along with multi year gains of 129.7% over 3 years and 206.3% over 5 years.

IBM Enterprise Advantage and the e& collaboration point in the same direction: IBM is leaning into agentic, governed AI as a core part of how large organizations run workflows, particularly in risk, compliance, and complex data environments. GRAMMY IQ then shows the same toolset applied to a consumer facing setting, which may help IBM showcase watsonx and its Granite models to a wide audience while still focusing on enterprise grade use cases behind the scenes.

How This Fits the International Business Machines Narrative

These announcements line up closely with existing narratives that emphasize IBM’s focus on hybrid cloud, AI and software execution, with consulting used as the delivery engine. Enterprise Advantage, in particular, speaks to the idea that IBM aims to be the partner that helps clients weave AI into day to day decision making, while the e& deployment and GRAMMY IQ give concrete proof points that may matter to investors who are tracking execution rather than just high level AI messaging.

Risks and Rewards Investors Are Weighing

Enterprise Advantage could support IBM’s push toward higher value consulting and software style engagements if clients adopt internal AI platforms at scale.

The e& deployment and GRAMMY IQ give IBM reference cases in both regulated and consumer settings, which may help win future AI and hybrid cloud work.

Analysts have highlighted execution risk around software and AI, and these offerings still need to translate into sustained revenue growth and margins to support more optimistic narratives.

IBM’s debt level remains a consideration for some investors when assessing how much flexibility the company has to keep investing in AI, quantum and acquisitions.

What To Watch Next

From here, it is useful to watch how many large clients adopt Enterprise Advantage, how broadly the e& governance solution is rolled out, and whether high profile projects like GRAMMY IQ lead to repeat work in other industries.

The companies said the consortium is open to engagement with project developers, investors, and stakeholders active in ecological restoration.","Scor, a French global reinsurance company headquartered, providing life, health, property, and casualty reinsurance services worldwide, and Axa, a French multinational insurance and financial services group, have launched a Lloyd’s consortium focused on ecological restoration, targeting a segment of environmental risk long left outside mainstream insurance coverage.

The consortium aims to support financing for ecological restoration projects by reducing investment risk tied to implementation phases.

By providing insurance protection, the partners intend to unlock capital for projects restoring ecosystems damaged or destroyed by prior activity.

The initiative, branded Restore, is led by Scor Syndicate 2015 at Lloyd’s and managed by Scor Managing Agency. Capacity support comes from Axa XL Syndicate 2003.

Combined reach and balance sheet strength allow the structure to underwrite larger and more complex restoration projects across multiple regions.

Scor and Axa said the consortium addresses a gap in the insurance market where projects aimed at ecosystem recovery struggle to secure protection during early and execution-heavy stages.

Restore underwrites the phase where conditions for ecological recovery are established, a point where uncertainty often deters investors.

The launch builds on Scor’s Nature Restoration and Conservation initiative introduced in May 2024. That programme focuses on insurance solutions designed to support restoration and rehabilitation projects built around long-term environmental resilience.

Jean-Paul Conoscente said the Restore structure increases the probability of project completion by improving confidence for developers and financiers.

Partnering with Axa, allows Scor to expand capacity and address environmental challenges at greater scale.

The companies said the consortium is open to engagement with project developers, investors, and stakeholders active in ecological restoration.

The aim is to build a pipeline of insurable projects where risk transfer helps convert environmental ambition into deployable capital.",https://beinsure.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2-25.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 20:00:08.575978

Greater Wellington Chair Daran Ponter says that the strong rating during a time of major government reforms and uncertainty is a valuable indicator of Greater Wellington’s fiscal responsibility.

“This rating makes it clear that while Greater Wellington is doing everything it can to deliver value for money services to our ratepayers, the proposed rate caps and other pressures from central government are putting a huge strain on our ability to do so,” says Cr Ponter.

Chair of the Finance, Risk and Audit Committee, Yadana Saw, says reforms are likely to erode existing core services while also threatening the viability of longer-term strategic projects.

“Changes to the Resource Management Act, rate capping and a review of the role of regional councils could negatively affect our future financial landscape, which makes it harder for us deliver on a cleaner environment, a more flood resilient region and critical public transport improvements.”

New York Adopts Two Bills Regulating Commercial Use of AI-Generated Content

Supergoop! Sunscreen Hit With False Ad Class Action Claiming ""Mineral"" Products Contain ""Unnatural"" Ingredients

FTC Sets Aside Rytr Order, Finding Prior Order Was Not Supported by the Complaint

New York AG Scrutinizes Instacart's Algorithmic Pricing Practices

On January 8, 2026, the New York Attorney General's Office sent a formal information request to Instacart seeking details about its pricing practices and compliance with New York's recently enacted Algorithmic Pricing Disclosure Act. The AG's letter follows a December 2025 report by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative alleging that Instacart users were shown materially different prices for identical products at the same stores and at the same time.

The AG's letter raises concerns that Instacart's pricing experiments—and the tools it offers to retailers and CPG brands—may constitute ""personalized algorithmic pricing"" under New York law, which requires a clear and conspicuous disclosure whenever an algorithm sets prices using personal data. The Attorney General specifically questions whether Instacart's current disclosures, which appear only through fine-print links on certain pages, satisfy the statute's disclosure requirements.

Although Instacart has publicly stated that it ended item-level price testing in December and that its testing did not rely on personal or behavioral data, the AG notes that Instacart has also acknowledged that retail and brand partners may continue to test promotions and discounts on the platform. The letter seeks extensive information about Instacart's pricing tools (including Eversight and smart cart technology), agreements with retailers and brands, the scope of any price experiments, and how consumer data may be used in pricing or promotions.

Why it matters: This inquiry signals heightened enforcement attention on algorithmic pricing and transparency—particularly where platforms, retailers, or brands rely on automated tools to test prices, discounts, or promotions. Companies operating in New York should carefully evaluate whether any pricing variability could be viewed as ""personalized algorithmic pricing"" and whether disclosures are sufficiently clear, prominent, and consistently presented wherever prices are displayed.

New York Adopts Two Bills Regulating Commercial Use of AI-Generated Content

New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed two bills on December 11, 2025, that together expand New York's approach to AI transparency and post-mortem rights of publicity in entertainment-adjacent contexts.

Synthetic performers in advertising (S.8420-A / A.8887-B). The first law amends New York's General Business Law to require a clear and conspicuous disclosure when an advertisement includes an AI-generated ""synthetic performer."" The law includes carveouts for certain audio advertisements and for situations where AI is used solely to translate the language of a human performer, and it generally does not apply to ads or promotional materials for certain expressive works (e.g., films/TV/streaming/video games) where the use of the synthetic performer is consistent with its use in the expressive work. A first violation may result in a $1,000 civil penalty, with $5,000 for subsequent violations. The disclosure requirement becomes effective 180 days after enactment (approximately June 2026, based on the December 11, 2025, signing).

Post-mortem name/image/likeness and digital replicas (S.8391 / A.8882). The second law strengthens New York's right of publicity framework by requiring consent from heirs or executors for the commercial use of a deceased individual's name, image, or likeness after death. In addition, it updates the definitions and liability standards applicable to digital replicas—including tightening the rules for using a deceased performer's digital replica in certain expressive works by moving from a disclaimer-oriented approach toward a prior-consent model. The bill takes effect immediately.

Key Takeaways

These bills illustrate an accelerating state-level push to address AI-enabled impersonation and consumer confusion in advertising while simultaneously expanding protections against unauthorized post-mortem commercialization. For advertisers and studios, the practical compliance focus is (i) auditing whether campaigns use synthetic performers (and whether an exception applies), (ii) building disclosure into production workflows ahead of the June 2026 effective date, and (iii) obtaining appropriate rights and permissions—particularly where a campaign uses a deceased individual's identity or a digital replica in a way that could trigger New York's consent requirements.

Supergoop! Sunscreen Hit With False Ad Class Action Claiming ""Mineral"" Products Contain ""Unnatural"" Ingredients

Supergoop! was the target of a proposed California class action alleging that its marketing of certain sunscreen products as ""100% Mineral"" and ""Mineral"" is false and misleading under state consumer protection laws.

According to the complaint, the plaintiff alleges that reasonable consumers interpret ""100% Mineral"" claims to mean that the entire product formula, not just the active sunscreen ingredients, consists solely of mineral or natural ingredients and does not contain synthetic, chemically altered, or otherwise non-mineral components. The plaintiff further alleges that Supergoop's use of ""100% Mineral"" language creates a net impression that the products are free from non-mineral or highly processed ingredients.

This complaint challenges labeling and marketing for more than a dozen Supergoop sunscreen products sold nationwide, including products marketed for adults and children. Plaintiff alleges that, contrary to the challenged representations, the products contain numerous non-mineral ingredients. In addition, the complaint asserts that certain ingredients derived from minerals or natural sources have been subjected to significant chemical processing or modification, resulting in ingredients that are materially different from their original mineral or natural form.

The lawsuit asserts claims under California's Unfair Competition Law and False Advertising Law and seeks restitution, injunctive relief, punitive damages, and attorneys' fees on behalf of a proposed statewide class of California purchasers. Supergoop denies the allegations, and the case is in its early stages.

Key Takeaways

The case reflects continued litigation risk around ""100%"", ""free-of,"" ""natural,"" and ""mineral"" claims—particularly where plaintiffs argue that consumers reasonably interpret such claims to apply to an entire formulation rather than discrete components. While some courts have been open to crediting reasonable consumers with the ability to read ingredient declarations, this isn't universal and frequently turns on the specifics of the label. One thing is certain, which is that ingredient-based claims remain the most common risk point for CPG claims. Brands can manage this risk through thoughtful use of qualifiers and marketing copy.

FTC Sets Aside Rytr Order, Finding Prior Order Was Not Supported by the Complaint

The Federal Trade Commission has reopened and set aside its December 2024 consent order against Rytr LLC, concluding that the complaint underlying the order failed to plead facts sufficient to support a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act.

Rytr offers an AI-enabled writing assistance service, including functionality that could be used to generate draft consumer reviews. In 2024, the FTC alleged that this service provided the ""means and instrumentalities"" for deception and constituted an unfair practice because it could generate large volumes of reviews without regard to accuracy. Rytr agreed to settle those allegations through a consent order that broadly barred it from offering any AI-enabled service designed to generate consumer reviews or testimonials.

In its December 2025 Order Reopening and Setting Aside the 2024 Order, the Commission determined that the complaint did not adequately plead either theory of liability. With respect to the means-and-instrumentalities claim, the FTC concluded that the complaint failed to allege that Rytr itself created deceptive marketing content, that its service was inherently deceptive, or that Rytr knew or had reason to know its customers would use the tool to violate the law. The Commission emphasized that providing a general-purpose tool with legitimate, pro-consumer uses—such as assisting users in drafting or editing review content—does not, without more, establish liability under Section 5.

The FTC also concluded that the complaint failed to plead an unfairness violation. The allegations did not establish that Rytr's service caused or was likely to cause substantial consumer injury, nor did they plausibly allege that any such injury outweighed countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Because the complaint failed to plead a cognizable Section 5 violation, the Commission found that the consent order provided no consumer benefit and was therefore not in the public interest.

In reaching this conclusion, the FTC also cited recent federal policy directives calling on agencies to review and, where appropriate, set aside final orders that unduly burden artificial intelligence innovation. The Commission stressed, however, that its decision rested on the legal insufficiency of the complaint itself. The FTC reiterated that it would continue to pursue enforcement where AI tools are used to deceive consumers or where companies misrepresent the capabilities or outputs of AI-enabled products.

What could change if CMS updates its Medicare policies for TAVR?

CMS first finalized its national coverage determination (NCD) for TAVR back in 2012 and then revisited that policy in 2019. Now, after receiving a formal request from Edwards Lifesciences, CMS is once again reconsidering the NCD to determine if any major updates are needed.

It is not exactly clear how far CMS is thinking about going with its changes to the TAVR NCD, but multiple major updates appear to be on the table.

The end of CED requirements

TAVR techniques and technologies have evolved significantly in recent years, and Edwards said in its request that coverage policies need to evolve as well. For example, the TAVR NCD has always included coverage with evidence development (CED) rules that require patient data to be gathered through clinical trials or registries. CED requirements are meant to be temporary, Edwards argued, and the TAVR has matured enough as a therapy that these restrictions are no longer necessary.

“TAVR is among the most rigorously studied medical device technologies subject to CED,” according to the Edwards. “Through this NCD reconsideration, CMS has an opportunity to demonstrate responsiveness to the extensive evidence collected to date by establishing a successful end to CED for TAVR.”

Approved TAVR procedures for asymptomatic patients

Edwards also asked CMS to consider fully covering TAVR in asymptomatic patients. TAVR was initially approved for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS)—no symptoms meant no procedure—but there has been a push in recent years to approve treatment in asymptomatic patients who present with signs of severe AS on medical imaging results.

Edwards has been leading that particular charge, pointing to clinical evidence from the EARLY TAVR clinical trial—which it sponsored—as proof that treating these patients right away provides significant value.

In May 2025, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officially approved Edwards’ balloon-expandable Sapien 3 TAVR platform for the treatment of asymptomatic AS, it became clear the company would be pushing CMS to rethink its current coverage policies.

Even experts who do not necessarily agree with treating asymptomatic patients with TAVR still largely believe CMS and the FDA should to be on the same page. When the FDA is approving medical devices for specific therapies, but CMS does not cover the therapy in question, it creates the potential for considerable confusion.

A changing approach to multidisciplinary heart teams

For Medicare to cover any TAVR procedure, there are rules in place that required at least one cardiac surgeon to be consulted. Now that the procedure has evolved, however, there is a belief among some TAVR advocates that surgeon evaluations are no longer necessary and an interventional cardiologist can handle any treatment decisions.

The Edwards request pointed to positive outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, a time when collaborations were harder in healthcare for logistical reasons, as evidence that surgeons only need to be consulted on more complex cases. CMS now appears to be considering changes to these requirements.

Potential changes receive mixed feedback

CMS announced its intention to reconsider the current NCD for TAVR in December, urging stakeholders to share public comments by Jan. 14. Medical societies, medtech vendors, cardiologists, surgeons and many other stakeholders all stepped forward to share their perspective.

Leading medical societies share unified statement

Five leading U.S. medical societies responsible for the treatment of patients with severe AS collaborated on a unified response to the CMS request. The American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS), American College of Cardiology (ACC), Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA), Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) and Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) all signed on to the statement

One key takeaway from the statement is that the societies think it is still too early to end the CED requirements. Registry data and clinical trials have provided substantial evidence that directly led to TAVR being offered to additional patient populations, the groups wrote. They emphasized that real-world evidence and clinical data remain necessary as the procedure continues to evolve.

“The societies strongly believe that continuation of the CED paradigm is essential to address existing and emerging clinical questions,” they wrote. “Submission of data on all TAVR procedures to a national registry should remain a requirement.”

The five societies also appear to accept that TAVR may be covered for the treatment of asymptomatic patients in the near future. This remains a relatively controversial topic among cardiologists and cardiac surgeons, with some embracing the use of asymptomatic TAVR and others fearful that it could put patents at risk, but it does appear to be inevitable in the wake of the FDA’s approval of the Edwards platform.

Instead of arguing against the treatment of asymptomatic patients, the groups highlighted the importance of maintaining high-quality patient care. Treating AS requires a “comprehensive, team-based approach,” they wrote, and multi-disciplinary teams should remain at the center of any treatment decisions.

Medtronic shares its own perspective on potential TAVR coverage changes

Medtronic and Edwards are largely seen as the two leading TAVR vendors in the United States. Edwards was the company that initially got this process started, but what does Medtronic think about these potential changes? The company shared a public comment that summarized where it stands.

Overall, Medtronic said it remains in support of CED as “a mechanism to support coverage and evidence generation.” Data can be captured in a “minimally burdensome manner,” the company wrote, and doing so is beneficial for both providers and the patients they serve.

In addition, Medtronic shared its concerns about Medicare coverage being approved for symptomatic patients. While the initial approval of TAVR in symptomatic patients was based on a significant amount of data, the company wrote, there is still only limited data on the treatment of patients who present without symptoms.

“While promising, the evidence of efficacy of TAVR in asymptomatic patients is focused on one trial plus another which is noted to have inadequate statistical power, with two more randomized controlled trials currently enrolling,” according to the Medtronic comment.

Medtronic also said it still wants cardiac surgeons to be involved in treatment decisions, highlighting the importance of their experience and expertise when it comes to surgical aortic valve replacement.

Edwards provides an additional comment

Edwards did issue a public comment of its own. The company reiterated that it believes 1.) the NCD’s CED requirements have been satisfied, and 2.) TAVR should be covered for the treatment of asymptomatic severe AS.

However, Edwards also said it believes cardiac surgeons should remain a central part of any multidisciplinary heart team. Removing surgeons from TAVR discussions is one potential change the company does not appear to support.

The full Edwards statement is available here.

Other public comments show a variety of responses

CMS received a total of 170 public comments about the TAVR NCD. Many of those comments cheered the possibility that there could soon be fewer restrictions on patient car, but others included genuine concerns about how things might unfold if too many changes are put into place.

For now, CMS certainly has a lot of feedback to consider. A proposed decision memo is expected in June 2026.

SUMMARY

U.S. Bancorp (USB 0.04%) reported record revenue and earnings, citing broad-based growth in both net interest income and fee revenue. Strategic focus included disciplined expense management, sustainable operating leverage, and continued investments in technology and productivity. Management emphasized deposit growth, especially in consumer and operational accounts, along with improved capital and credit quality metrics. The planned BTIG acquisition is projected to meaningfully increase quarterly fee revenues and support capital markets growth, with minimal initial impact on capital ratios or EPS due to merger-related costs. Guidance for 2026 reflects confidence in both net interest and fee income expansion, further supported by flexibility in expense controls if revenue growth slows.

John Stern stated, ""We expect merger-related costs to happen in the next quarter or two. And so as that occurs, that will keep the EPS neutral. And so, after that, then we expect to have some, obviously, we'll see margin expansion in this business once we get through those costs.""

Loan growth expectations for 2026 are in the 3%-4% range, led by commercial, credit card, and improving commercial real estate segments.

Gunjan Kedia described robust client demand in digital assets and highlighted the launch of custody offerings for cryptocurrency and stablecoin, supporting GFS and ETF growth.

The company expects deposit growth to track loan growth, with ongoing reductions in CDs and a focus on more accretive consumer and operational deposits.

Management highlighted that productivity gains from digital investments and AI are generating cost flexibility while allowing continued investment in fee-based growth areas.

The net interest margin outlook maintains a targeted path to 3% by 2027, with contribution from asset repricing and further deposit mix improvements.

Consumer deposit balances rose $7 billion, and the company noted momentum in acquiring new client accounts and leveraging digital tools nationally.

Global Fund Services achieved nearly half of all new U.S. ETF launches in 2025, demonstrating market share gains in a high-growth, capital-efficient business.

Branch strategy centers on modernizing existing locations and achieving top-five market share in core geographies, with $200 million allocated to continuous branch investments annually.

Full Conference Call Transcript

Gunjan Kedia: Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. I will begin on Slide three. This quarter, we delivered strong earnings per share of $1.26, an increase of approximately 18% year over year on an adjusted basis. Net interest income this quarter increased 3.3% year over year, supported by strong consumer deposit growth. Fee revenue grew 7.6% year over year with broad-based strength across most of our fee businesses. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, we posted record net revenues of $7.4 billion and $28.7 billion, respectively. More specifically, in the fourth quarter, total net revenue grew 5.1%, and we delivered meaningful positive operating leverage of 440 basis points as adjusted.

John will provide more details on our financial performance in his opening remarks. Moving to Slide four. A clear focus this year has been on restoring investor confidence in our ability to deliver strong and more consistent financial results. For the second consecutive quarter, more focused execution on our three key priorities resulted in us operating within all of our medium-term target ranges. On Slide five, we highlight steady progress against our expense management priority. Four signature productivity programs have helped us deliver nine straight quarters of largely stable expenses. This has meaningfully contributed to our ability to deliver positive operating leverage of 370 basis points for the full year of 2025.

Our expense initiatives continue to generate sustainable productivity in our operations and will remain foundational disciplines going forward. In 2026, we will make strategic investments necessary to drive our growth, particularly in technology, sales, and marketing. As such, we expect revenue growth to be a stronger driver of continued positive operating leverage for the year. Slide six highlights our strong fee growth and improving mix. For the full year, fee income represented 42% of total net revenues for the company and grew 6.7% year over year. A highly diversified mix of fee revenue business is a core differentiator for our franchise.

Our organic growth strategy has focused on the principle of interconnected product solutions that have created unique value propositions and deeper relationships with our 15 million clients. In '26, we will remain highly focused on executing the initiatives that we launched in 2025. In addition, we are excited to close on our acquisition of BTIG and capture the considerable revenue synergies offered by that combination. On Slide seven, we recap the strategic rationale for this bolt-on acquisition. We've had a ten-year partnership with BTIG and have completed 350 deals or more together in that time frame.

Last week, after we announced, I heard from many of our clients who applauded this next step in our partnership, which gives us confidence around the cultural fit between our two organizations and our ability to build an extraordinary capital markets franchise that can support an even broader array of client needs. We look forward to updating you on our progress there at a future analyst conference. Let me turn to Slide eight. We briefly spotlight our global fund services business, which generated strong fee revenue growth for the company this year. GFS is a highly capital-efficient business that serves our institutional clients, in particular private capital, and asset managers across the U.S. and Europe.

The products offered by GFS attract high-quality operational deposits, money market assets under management, and capital markets business such as foreign exchange. BTIG capabilities will further support growth in this business. As you can see from the chart on the left, GFS total net revenue has grown at a healthy 11% CAGR since 2021 and grew at 12% in 2025. We have some unique product capabilities for start-up and first-time ETFs and have onboarded nearly half of all new U.S. ETF launches in 2025. The underlying drivers of performance within this business are continuing to gain momentum as ETFs stay in favor with investors for their cost efficiency and recent favorable regulatory changes.

And we continue to innovate in areas like digital assets and derivative-based ETF products. Moving to Slide nine. Our payments transformation is a strategic and long-term priority for the company. Today, a payments product is oftentimes the first and the most frequent engagement with clients, especially with Gen Z. Embedded interconnected payments capabilities are fundamental to retaining, deepening, and growing our future client franchise. The chart on the left shows the steady strengthening of growth rates for our payments businesses as we execute our transformation. With our payments leadership team now fully in place, we have hit our stride on execution.

In '26, we expect to maintain momentum on our transformation and add additional focus on the small business segment for both card and merchant. Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income and margin are both improving. We delivered record consumer deposits this quarter. The effectiveness of products like BankSmartly, more sophisticated pricing capabilities, and a significant overhaul of skills, training, digital tools, and incentives together with investments in our branches, drove our performance. Additionally, commercial real estate loans also showed modest growth after eleven quarters of decline. Today, our balance sheet is poised for continued NII growth. On the loan side, we will drive commercial and credit card loans to deepen client relationships.

On the deposit side, we'll drive consumer and operational deposits to improve our funding mix. Turning to Slide 11. Operating within our medium-term target ranges has resulted in leading EPS growth as adjusted in 2025, even with more modest buybacks as compared with the industry. Let me now turn the call over to John, who will take you through more details of the quarter.

John Stern: Thank you, Gunjan, and good morning, everyone. This was another strong quarter for us, driven by continued new business momentum and an improving macroeconomic environment. If I could turn your attention to Slide 12, I'll start with some highlights for the quarter followed by a discussion of fourth-quarter earnings trends. As Gunjan mentioned, we reported earnings per common share of $1.26 and achieved record net revenue of $7.4 billion this quarter. Revenue growth benefited from improved spread income, and all fee categories performed well. Key credit quality metrics improved both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. As of December 31, our tangible book value per common share increased 18.2% on a year-over-year basis. Slide 13 provides our key performance metrics.

This quarter, we delivered a return on tangible common equity of 18.4%, a return on average assets of 1.19%, and an efficiency ratio of 57.4%. All improvements on a year-over-year basis. Slide 14 provides a balance sheet summary. Total average deposits increased 0.7% linked quarter to $515 billion as we continue to emphasize growth in our consumer and relationship-based deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased both sequentially and year over year, as we gained traction across several institutional fee businesses, like treasury management and Global Corporate Trust. Our percentage of noninterest-bearing to total average deposits remained stable at approximately 16%.

Average loans totaled $384 billion, up 1.4% from the prior quarter, on accelerating year-over-year growth in our focus areas of commercial and credit card loans, which grew 10% and 15.7%, respectively. On an ending basis, these loans now represent approximately 48% of total loans for the bank, compared to approximately 45% last year. The ending balance on our investment portfolio as of December 31 remained at $171 billion. Turning to Slide 15. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $4.3 billion, an increase of 1.4% on a linked quarter basis, primarily driven by favorable deposit mix shift.

Net interest margin increased two basis points sequentially to 2.77% as we look to achieve greater margin expansion in the medium term. Slide 16 highlights fee revenue trends within noninterest income. Total fee income was approximately $3.05 billion, an increase of 7.6% on a year-over-year basis with broad-based growth across our payments, institutional, and consumer fee businesses. For the full year, fee income increased 6.7% compared to the prior year. In 2025, we benefited from high single-digit growth in our institutional fee businesses, continued strength within Impact Finance, and stronger payments revenue. Turning to Slide 17. Noninterest expense totaled approximately $4.2 billion, up 0.7% linked quarter as FDIC expense favorability was partially offset by severance charges.

Slide 18 highlights improved asset quality trends. This quarter, our ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.41% at December 31, an improvement of two basis points linked quarter and seven basis points year over year. The net charge-off ratio improved to 0.54%, a two basis point decrease sequentially, while our allowance for credit losses of $7.9 billion represented 2.03% of period-end loans. Turning to Slide 19. As of December 31, our common equity Tier one capital ratio was 10.8%, or 9.3%, including AOCI. On Slide 20, we provide a comparison of our fourth quarter and full-year results to our previous guidance.

For the fourth quarter, net interest income, fee revenue, and noninterest expense all exceeded our previous guidance. Taken together, this resulted in another quarter of meaningful positive operating leverage for the company. For the full year, revenue growth of 4% hit the midpoint of our full-year guidance expectations, while positive operating leverage meaningfully outperformed our full-year 2025 outlook. Moving to Slide 21, I'll now provide full-year and first-quarter 2026 forward-looking guidance. Starting with the full year of 2026, we expect total net revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 6% compared to the prior year. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage of 200 basis points or more for the full year.

Our guidance excludes the impact of the BTIG acquisition, which is expected to contribute $175 million to $200 million of fee revenue per quarter. I have provided some additional details on page 30 of the appendix. Let me now provide first-quarter 2026 guidance. Net interest growth on a fully taxable equivalent basis is expected to be in the range of 3% to 4% compared to 2025. Total fee revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 5% to 6% compared to 2025. And we expect total noninterest expense growth of approximately 1% compared to 2025. Turning to Slide 22. We continue to operate within our medium-term target ranges.

Our consistent execution against these ranges will remain a key focus entering 2026, and we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to strengthen our performance and build on these results over time. Let me now hand it back to Gunjan for closing remarks.

Gunjan Kedia: Thank you, John. We are wrapping up 2025 with a significant leadership transition behind us and strong momentum going into 2026. The banking industry will likely see meaningful shifts in capital supervision, digital assets, AI, and novel banks in the coming years. Our scale, business mix, and culture position us for success. We remain focused on executing our priorities to drive organic growth, high returns, productivity, and strong risk management. Finally, I would like to offer a special thanks to many of you for your well wishes for Minneapolis, where we are headquartered. With all the challenges this community is facing, we remain focused on our clients and our teams.

With that, we will now open the call for your questions.

Operator: At this time, as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, press star and the number one on your telephone keypad. And our first question comes from Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Scott Siefers: Let's see. John, let's thought I'd start with you. Can you please speak to how you might think about the pace of share repurchase as this year plays out given you're increasing the capital ratio toward the 10% CAT two target? You'd, of course, dipped your toe back in at the end of last year, but would love to hear your thoughts on the go forward.

John Stern: Sure, Scott, and good morning. In terms of share repurchases, we've made a tremendous amount of progress in our capital build over the last several years, and we obviously have business momentum behind us. And of course, our first priority is going to be client and loan growth as we move forward with obviously then a focus on capital return to our shareholders. But knowing all that, our intention is to grow our share repurchase amount starting this quarter in a gradual way. Likely go from $100 million or so to $200 million and then the commitment to glide into our 75% payout target that we have over time.

Scott Siefers: Terrific. Okay. Good. Thank you. And then just sort of a broader question. Given all the noise regarding whether it's credit card rate caps and then, you know, newer chatter regarding the Credit Card Competition Act. Could you speak to how you all are thinking about how, I guess, how USD is thinking about these possible responses in you know, how are these granted they're all sort of in flight, but, you know, what are you all thinking about at this point?

Gunjan Kedia: Scott, good morning. You know, our estimate is that 90 plus percent of our clients will see a detrimental impact if there was an across-the-board 10% rate cap on credit cards. The impact to 50% of the clients will be crushed as it will be for the economy. We have observed that just in the last few days, the conversation around the rate cap has shifted more productively to options for customers to help them in the short term. So just as a reminder, our shield credit card offers twenty-four months of 0% APR for consumers. And in fact, most card issuers have some product of that sort.

So we think that's a productive conversation and we are thinking of ways to increase communications, financial education to try and make sure people know what options they have. But that's sort of the momentum. The CCCA, as you asked, has come and gone many times. There are very credible reasons why that would be very costly for many small merchants and not achieve the goal intended. So at this point, we continue to it, but it is not a meaningful planning that we are focused on.

Scott Siefers: Gotcha. Okay. Terrific. Thank you very much for the color.

Operator: Our next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

John Pancari: Morning. I just wanna ask a bit around the revenue growth expectation of 4% to 6% for 2026. I appreciate the color you gave around the first quarter. In terms of the spread income versus the fee growth expectation. Could you possibly help us and kind of how that think about how that could play out for the full year in terms of some of the, you know, the balance sheet dynamics in terms of the growth expectations and your margin outlook. Then the same thing on the fee side, how should we think about the breakout of that total revenue when you look at '26?

John Stern: Sure. It's John. Thanks, John. So the way we think about the revenue growth this year, obviously, we gave you the 4% to 6% on that side of the thing. But given the momentum that we have and what we see today, we think that mid-single-digit growth is appropriate for both net interest income and fee revenue growth. So maybe just to break it out a little bit. So on net interest income, as an example, we expect that to strengthen over time. We have 3% to 4% here in the first quarter. But with the increase in loan pipelines that we see as well as NIM expansion as that continues, we do expect that to grow.

And then fees, we expect that to have a more consistent approach and performance as we look through the course of the year. Of course, that's gonna be led by many of our key businesses like trust capital markets, impact finance, and payments. So overall, we see a lot of momentum in the businesses. We've had several good quarters here in a row, our job is now to continue to execute on the strategy.

John Pancari: Got it. Alright. Thanks for that, John. And then, Gunjan, you mentioned that revenue rather than expenses may be a bigger driver of the expected positive operating leverage in 2026. If revenue doesn't cooperate, can you discuss the flexibility that you still may have to achieve the 200 basis points plus and positive operating leverage? Like, what are your levers and do you have flexibility around the strategic investments that you that you emphasized?

Gunjan Kedia: John, good morning. The short answer is yes. Our productivity and expense management is being created in a very fundamental way. You'll remember that for six years, we have been investing very heavily in digital capabilities. Nearly all back-end platforms have been upgraded, and that creates a lot of productivity once you start getting the operations aligned. You add to it the AI boost we are seeing in big expense pools. So we are very confident about expense management. We have aggressive plans to invest back in the business, just to drive the revenue growth, especially fee revenue growth in businesses like capital markets and payments that attract more expenses. But we have a lot of ability to flex that.

Those are not long-term investments. Things like sales and marketing are quarterly investments. So we are very committed to our meaningful positive operating leverage, and we expect it to come from revenue. But something happens in the macroeconomic environment, we have levers on expenses.

John Pancari: Great. Thank you.

Gunjan Kedia: Thank you. Thanks, John.

Operator: Next question comes from John McDonald from Truist.

John McDonald: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering, John, if you could expand a little bit about your outlook for balance sheet growth in 2026 and any mix shifts or trade-offs that you want to highlight between loans within loans and also loans earning assets. You had given a forecast last year, early last year about balance sheet growth by the end of the year and it had some mix shift. So I just wanna get an update on that.

John Stern: Sure. Good morning, John. Yeah. So largely, I think you're talking about the slide that we had in the first quarter of last year, talking about our asset growth and things like that. I think that still holds. We still feel like that's that range is the appropriate range for our balance sheet. Maybe just to go into some of the pieces, you know, we do expect loan growth to be stronger this year. Probably more in the 3% to 4% loan growth area led by commercial and card again. But, you know, we also see that commercial real estate is starting to grow, and we expect that to be a help in terms of growth there.

We do expect that deposits will continue to grow consummate with loans. That should be kind of one for one in the way we're looking at it. And in terms of other assets, I expect the investment portfolio to kind of flex based on if loan growth is faster, we'll probably have fewer investment portfolio and other earning assets. And if it's less, then perhaps we kind of keep the balances the same. So those are going to be kind of as we go manage through the quarter, we'll go and see how that progresses.

But all this is to say that the mix is improving in the balance sheet, and that's going to continue throughout 2026, and that's what gives us confidence in the NIM expansion as well.

John McDonald: Great. And maybe just on that note, you could give us your updated thoughts on the timeline for the NIM expansion, you know, to get to 3% over the next year or two. And in addition to that loan mix shift, what are just an update on some of the fixed asset reprice drivers. Thank you.

John Stern: Sure. Yeah. So, I think, first of all, there's no change to our outlook. We still feel there's definitely a path to 3% in 2027. The drivers of net interest margin are going to be the mix that I just mentioned as well as the fixed asset repricing. What I would say there on the fixed asset repricing is that we'll have slightly or we'll have more balances that should reprice this year than last year. But it'll be likely at a lower spread just because the nature of long-term rates have come down over the course of the year, and based on our forecast. So those are kind of the pieces.

And then the deposit mix is gonna continue to improve with the focus on consumer deposit growth, which we've been very successful at growing this year, as well as commercial deposits that are tied to strong fee categories like treasury management, institutional businesses, and things like that. So that's all, again, a big focus for us as we look into 2026 and continued NIM expansion.

John McDonald: Okay. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Ebrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I guess good morning. Maybe, John, just hey, John. Following up on the slide 10 on the deposit growth, just spend some time talking about drivers of deposit growth. You're having the mix towards consumer deposits. What's driving that net? Is that accretive as we think should we continue to think about that mix shifting to the consumer side? And how accretive is that when we think about either deposit margin or the overall margin? Thanks.

John Stern: Sure. So, you know, on the deposit, a couple of things are going on in the deposit growth. This over the course of the year, we saw steady growth in the consumer deposits. And as that Slide 10 illustrates, we continue to believe that is accretive and it is helpful to bring in new accounts and clients to the bank typically that are younger, more affluent base that we have, and this is particularly in our BankSmartly product, which is a savings and a card tied together. We've seen very good success in growing that savings product over the course of the year. We find these clients to be stickier, and that's going to be overall long periods of time.

That's gonna be very helpful from our funding cost perspective. The other thing we're focused on the commercial side is a reduction in CDs. We reduced our CD count by $6 billion this quarter. We are at the lowest point in CD usage in the last ten quarters. So that has been that will be helpful going forward to our mix. In our wholesale and institutional balances are gonna be really driven by our core institutional and, like, fund services, corporate trust, treasury management, and other middle market and other type of accounts that's gonna give us. So the mix is gonna be very important for us as we move forward.

Gunjan Kedia: And, Ebrahim, I can just add that we are very intentional about using the balance sheet to drive deeper relationships and fee-based businesses. An expansion in the core client franchise brings a lot of payments and card revenue and merchant revenue at the back end of it. So it's very accretive in the long run and very strategic for us as well. So the focus is very much on consumer deposits and operational wholesale deposits, which come with expansion of treasury management, investment services, and some of the fee-based products. That's one of the reasons we wanted to highlight the global fund services business.

While it's, you know, billion-dollar-like business for us, so not huge enough with it's a very important source of operational deposits.

Ebrahim Poonawala: That's helpful. And just a separate question, I guess, I think last quarter you all established a digital assets organization. Just talk to us. You put out a few press releases. A lot of energy around tokenization. Is there a role for USB to play there? And is that a needle mover as we think about either fees or deposit growth outlook for the bank?

Gunjan Kedia: Yes. Thank you. So let me just describe the world here a little bit from our perspective. We are obviously taking it seriously as an industry shock. That's why we stood up an organization called Digital Assets and Money Movement, and it's led by a very seasoned payments executive for us. We have seen progress in two very distinct areas. The first is on capital markets where the investment side around cryptocurrency stablecoins is leading to demand for core custody type of capabilities. We have almost $12 trillion in assets there. We were very quick to stand up a cryptocurrency custody offer. Last year, we stood up a stablecoin custody offer.

Ibrahim, I'll tell you, last year has been a very brisk place of new ETF launches, and a large majority of them have been to take advantage of the digital assets. And we are seeing the revenue model come through in a very real way. And we think that's real and there's momentum. On the bigger conversation of payments, it's more speculative. So we do press releases because there's a lot of interest every time we actually conduct a stable coin transaction with some partner platforms. We have done many of those. I can't point to a specific revenue-generating use case.

The demand specifically from the client base is not very strong or real yet, the revenue model is still to be figured out. There's enough momentum there, both from a supervisory and commercial side that we expect to be very front-footed as this world evolves around payments.

Ebrahim Poonawala: That's good color. Thank you.

Gunjan Kedia: Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Mike Mayo: Hi. Well, you announced the acquisition of BTIG. And I think there's a little confusion. Is that the reason why you're slowing down buybacks? And just more generally, there's a few covered U.S. Bancorp for a while, and this is over two decades after you spun off Piper, and now you're you know, going back into the capital markets business a little bit more than you're already there. So if you can also just talk about the investments that you'll be making with BTIG, the business lines, what else that requires. I imagine this is kind of like a link and leverage deal where you buy a firm and you leverage it over your entire franchise, but I'm not sure.

On the other side, this, you know, what do you expect in terms of cap to market fees? Other opportunities for balance sheet growth? Thank you.

John Stern: Sure, Mike. I'll start on your share repurchase comment, then maybe I'll Gunjan will comment on the other side of questions that you had. There's no impact to our buyback. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, we'll be increasing our share repurchases from $100 million to $200 million this quarter. And then, thereafter, we'll glide into our eventual target of 75% that we've talked about. And so, this transaction is a 12 basis point impact on the CET one ratio. No more, no less. That's, that will be the impact no matter what the earnout or anything else. So, we feel really good about the financials, and it's not material to EPS.

This year, simply because there will be some merger-related costs that will offset any revenues for this or margin. So as we look to the following year, that will shift.

Gunjan Kedia: Mike, good morning. I'll just step back and maybe recap the strategic rationale. You know, our clients use both bank balance sheets and capital markets to manage their own balance sheets. We have had a lot of success with the fixed income side of our capital markets business that has grown organically over the last fourteen years or so, and it's now grown to about $1.4 billion in revenues for us. It's a sizable business. The last gap in our product lineup was the BTIG set of products. We've had a partnership with them for ten years. And it is true twenty years back Piper Jaffray was acquired.

And just as a reminder, we retained all of the wealth and asset management sites of Piper Jaffray, and those have become sizable businesses for us today with a lot of cultural fit. The capital markets wasn't appropriate for us at the time. It is very much more culturally aligned with what we do plus we know the property. On your balance sheet question, I think the issue is you're already deploying a very sizable balance sheet today against our commercial and corporate clients. And a broader lineup of fees leverages that balance sheet more. We do not expect the BTIG business in itself to be a big driver of additional sort of balance sheet usage.

But otherwise, lots of revenue synergies across our IS business, across our family office business. And we'll report on that more to you once the deal closes. And we give better guidance on what the economics of that deal will be like.

Mike Mayo: Alright. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Erika Najarian from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Erika Najarian: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. First question, period end assets ended at $692 billion for the year. And I guess this is a two-part question. First is, as you understand it, you know, how do the tailoring for proposals or the removal of tailoring proposals in you know, Washington, how would that positively impact that $700 billion crossing? And additionally, you know, as we think about John, that path to 3%, does that consider the currently more stringent liquidity requirements that you would need to adhere to if nothing changed on tailoring?

John Stern: Sure, Erica. Thanks for the question. So on the asset side, yes, we're continuing to grow. Obviously, as you know, it's a four-quarter average of assets that is the deciding factor in how when you trip into category two. You know, we're running our business without any regard to that level. We are growing our loans consummate with the industry. We wanna make sure we're there for our clients. Any rule that happens or change to the tailoring rules over this process will take in stride. We understand there's obviously been chatter about that. As folks on, in the regulatory spheres have talked about those perhaps being reindexed, but we don't know that for sure.

So in the meantime, we're gonna continue to do what we need to do on the growth and supporting our clients through that. And then, in terms of the consideration that you had, I'm just trying to remember your second question. It was on the LCR that you LCR. I'm sorry. Yeah. Thank you. On the LCR, there is no impact to that. We have that fully loaded into our calculus here as we think about the NIM. So, as we jump from a more modified LCR to a full LCR, there's no impact, and that's all incorporated into our guidance.

Erika Najarian: That was very helpful. Thank you. And just as a follow-up question, Gunjan, during prepared remarks, you talked about, you know, faster evolution of the banking industry and also in your, you know, responses to the other analyst questions, it seems like, you know, you have a very nimble organization in terms of how you're responding to these changes.

And, you know, as we think about the investments that you have to make you know, in terms of moving the continuing to move the company forward, you know, is there just enough productivity savings that you can identify where you can continue to invest for the future, whether it's nearer term like capital markets or medium term like you know, the digital asset transformation, you know, and still deliver on that positive operating leverage, you know, of 200 plus that it has been clear message to your investor base.

Gunjan Kedia: Thank you, Erica. Good morning. It's a very thoughtful question. And let me start really by the new investments in AI and stablecoin. They are actually very capitalized. There is so much support that is being provided to us from a whole suite of sort of partners who really like our business mix, our payments, and capital markets. You know, we are unusual in having sizable capabilities on both of those. And we've organized that data. As you know, we are on the cusp of category two transition, and that has given us a lot of imperative over the last two or three years to have better data. Collectively, we are a very important partner.

So we are getting a lot of support when we do these pilots on stablecoins. They're not huge investments yet. However, we stand ready to invest as needed when the market flexes. You have to learn. You have to have your products set ready. So I would say to you that for some time, at least, you're getting a lot of benefit of industry-wide investments to just scale up our product capability. The real investments we are making is to support our fee business growth. We are doing bigger deals, they come with more upfront cost. The payments transformation, if you think about the revenue model of payments, we are looking at acquired, but not installed business.

We are looking at sales pipelines, and the revenue model follows twelve to eighteen months after you sold the business. So we are very prepared for that kind of expense inflection. But also creating productivity. So I feel very comfortable with both investing heavily for organic growth and delivering a positive operating leverage. And again, I always want to remind when you spend 5 or 6 billion upgrading your digital investments, which we did over the last six years. You have a long runway to drive productivity out of them. Which we will.

Erika Najarian: Got it. Thank you for that.

Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Usdin from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Ken Usdin: Thanks. Good morning. A follow-up on that last point. So as you've made these all these investments, it's nice to see a little bit of improvement year over year in payments business fees in aggregate. I was just wondering just what's the pace of improvement that we could expect as you think about next year and to John's prior point about mid-single-digit growth on the fee side overall? How much does payments play a part of that? If you can kind of just talk through each of the each of the three businesses areas there. Thanks.

John Stern: Sure. Thanks. Appreciate the question. You know, absolutely, payments has a role in our mid-single-digit call for fees overall. But take it piece by piece, you know, card, we have a lot of progress with the Smart Leap program and other cards that we've introduced into the market. There's a tremendous focus on small business that we are very much focused on internally. So we have a lot of momentum there. We do expect mid-single-digit growth in this business for the year of 2026.

On the merchant side, as we talked about on our strategy, at a recent investor conference, we talked about, you know, increasing our margins through more distribution, and direct model, really being thoughtful about what verticals that we want to be a part of. And really focusing on that embedded software, and having that be a key component of our growth. And so, again, here, we think that mid-single-digit growth for the year is appropriate for this business as well. And then on the corporate payment side, clearly, you know, we saw improvement this year on a year-over-year basis, but it's still negative growth.

Just given the spend levels on the government side as well as just some caution just on the corporate T and E side of the equation. That will likely continue into the first half of the year, but should overall strengthen as we get through that. And that will, by the time we exit that, that will be more in the mid-single-digit range. So overall, single-digit for this business is what we should expect, and we're looking forward to executing our strategy.

Ken Usdin: Okay. Great. Thanks. Thanks, John. And just one follow-up on the credit card side on and charge-offs. That loss line has really settled down a little bit. Are we at kind of a new I know there's some seasonality, but, like, what's your expectations for card losses? You know, versus where we kinda ended the year and averaged for 25?

John Stern: Yeah. Thank you. So, you know, card, if I think about there's seasonality, so you should expect a little bit higher charge-off rate on card in the first half of the year just given that seasonality. But overall, if I just kind of look big picture on card 25 versus 26, we expect stability in that charge-off rate based on what we know today.

Ken Usdin: Okay. Got it. Alright. Thanks, John.

Operator: Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Gerard Cassidy: Good morning, Gunjan. Good morning, John.

John Stern: Good morning.

Gerard Cassidy: John, you talked about the commercial loan growth, and you talked a bit about commercial real estate. I think you said maybe the first time in the November, it may have seen a little bit of growth. Can you expand upon that for 2026 along with the commercial loan growth? Are the 10% year over year is quite nice. And can that continue, do you think, in 2026?

John Stern: Thanks, Gerard. Short answer is yes. On the continuation on the commercial side of the equation. But let me start with the commercial real estate side. Since you talked about that, I'll mention that we do expect growth in the real estate line. As you said, the first growth that we've had in eleven quarters in that line item, which is great to see. I think what we're seeing here is the continuation of the pipeline building, particularly as it relates to multifamily and industrial. I think those have been strong areas of growth. And I would also say that paydowns have actually slowed down as well.

Our office numbers, our CRE office has dropped $3 billion over the last three years and at a pretty rapid pace. And so that has started to slow down. So that has been helpful. I'll also say that this growth is not driven by data centers and things like that. We have less than a billion dollars of data centers in our portfolio, and we do select high quality in that sense. So that's kind of the story on real estate. On the C&I side, we're just seeing growth in a number of different areas. I'd just say it's very broad-based.

Even though utilization has been pretty flat, we've seen growth in subscription lines, supply chain, some of the M&A activity is picking up with our clients. And so there's just core growth on that side of the equation. We've also been going into business banking and SBA, seeing very strong growth as well as our expansion markets and middle markets. So a combination of all these things, we think, persists into 2026, and so we're looking forward to that growth.

Gerard Cassidy: Very good. And Gunjan, one of your peers in asking this question called me a curmudgeon. So I'll try to ask the question a little less negative. But the setup for you folks and your peers is really good this year. Investors see that. But being bank people that we are, we're always looking over our shoulders. Aside from the obvious geopolitical risks, do you guys keep your eye on just, you know, in case of a surprise comes up that we're not expecting right now?

Gunjan Kedia: Well, thank you, Gerard. I will not call you a curmudgeon. We worry about what's coming around the corner as much as you do. You know, the economic backdrop going into 2026 is broadly constructive. The consumer did very well through the holiday cycle, and that was all ranges of FICO scores and across discretionary and spending. As John just described, the delinquencies are coming down. While the employment picture is a little bit muddy, it's still strong, and we are not yet seeing the impact of the one big beautiful bill and some of the new tax provisions like tips and overtime, etcetera, will come into the consumer's balance sheet. So we expect that to be good.

The sentiment on the corporate side too has moved to sort of more M&A and real CapEx rather than just sort of a pause and replacement CapEx waiting for tariff uncertainty. I would say the economic backdrop feels like tailwinds rather than headwinds going into the year. So our attention really is on unexpected policy changes. In front of us is a very big capital bill. In front of us are some real discussions around stablecoin bank industry, novel charters. And so I would say our attention is really focused on the policy side with some relief on the economic front.

Gerard Cassidy: Very good. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Betsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning.

Gunjan Kedia: Good morning.

Betsy Graseck: I had one question on BTIG. I know we talked about it earlier in the call. But I wanted to get an understanding of how much of a capital call do you think this piece of the business will be? And just from my vantage point, it feels like it's a little bit less than what the fixed income would be, which you already have. But I'm not sure how much you're looking to lean in and grow, what they have and increase the balance sheet items associated with the equity book. So some color there would be helpful. Thank you.

John Stern: Sure, Betsy. So maybe just as a starting point for BTIG, they have a very low balance sheet. There's not a lot of loans and balance sheet with that. I think that potentially could be one of the synergies that's not built into our current forecast. We think the synergies are really gonna be around areas like our fund services, our capital markets as well as our ICG or our institutional client group. There could be loans associated with that. But, you know, we'll treat that in the context of the entire capital market suite.

And so this will be just another component of how we manage and have grown in the capital markets space methodically over the last fifteen years. This is another component of that journey, and so we'll grow as the market allows, and we'll be taking it into consideration with our risk management framework.

Betsy Graseck: Okay. And is it a self-funded capital call or does it pull from other parts of the organization?

John Stern: Yeah. It's self-funded. I mean, we are there's no other parts of the organization. It's all contained here at the bank.

Betsy Graseck: Okay. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Saul Martinez from HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Saul Martinez: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I'll ask also on this is more of a clarification. John. It's expected to close in the second quarter. You mentioned there are some merger costs embedded in the guidance. For it being PPNR neutral. But with that, I guess, can we surmise that it will be PPNR accretive by year-end and into early 2027, especially considering, you know, some of the synergies that you just mentioned in your response to Betsy's question.

John Stern: Yeah. Thanks, Saul. The answer is yes. We expect merger-related costs to happen in the next quarter or two. And so as that occurs, that will keep the EPS neutral. And so, after that, then we expect to have some, obviously, we'll see margin expansion in this business once we get through those costs.

Saul Martinez: Okay. That's helpful. And then, you know, I hate maybe beating a dead horse here would be the question on BTIG, and you kind of addressed this. But it does really change the composition of your capital markets business adding equities and I think, you know, one of your competitors said that this really isn't a business that makes a lot of sense. For a large regional bank. It's what we've given that, at least in their view, it really does require massive scale and there's more suitable for, you know, for a larger bank. Guess, what makes you think that these businesses, especially equity makes sense for U.S.

Bancorp and that you why are you confident that you'll be successful in extracting value with that business under your umbrella?

John Stern: Yeah. I thanks for the question. You know, I think I'll and Gunjan, you can add on here. But, you know, our view is that these businesses, we added because we had an opportunity here with a partner that we know, a known that fits into our risk management. But, also importantly, it's what our clients have been asking for. We have had very good reach out from clients across the board that have wanted to have us participate more in their financings, have us participate more in their broader activities, but have not been able to give that to us freely, in terms of the full spread and wallet share that they would have liked or intended to do.

So this is something that's really gonna, it's something that our clients have asked for. It fits well within our risk management profile as that has been built up internally here over the last several years. And so it is a great fit for us.

Gunjan Kedia: You know what I'll add, Saul, that you have to look at our track record in growing the fixed income book, which not all regionals have been able to do. So everybody has a different strategy here. Our confidence in leaning in heavily into the capital markets comes not just from the client conversations. From the real success we have seen just holding our own. The market is not uniform. There's a lot of need for family offices, for middle market clients that are unique, that require high touch, and so we think at our size, we definitely have the ability to carve out a very nice business given the size of our balance sheet here.

Saul Martinez: Great. That's helpful. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Steven Chubak: Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So I wanted to start off with one on Global Fund Services, and I appreciate the additional disclosure that you provided in the slides. You noted you're seeing strong growth in GFS. You outlined the strength of the ETF servicing capabilities. I was hoping you could speak to the competitive landscape in that area. How much of the growth that you've seen since '21 is tied to organic efforts versus some of the rate and market tailwinds that transpired and just how that informs what you believe is the sustainable growth rate or outlook over the medium term relative to the mid-single-digit guidance that you offer at the firm level?

Gunjan Kedia: Steven, thank you for that. Let me start. GFS has a very niche specific set of products for highly complex small boutique type of firms around private capital, private credit. So you have to play the game right. We have done this for now many, many years, and there's a very sustainable competitive path for this business going forward. We do like to highlight smaller businesses don't get airtime. Just to teach you last quarter, we just gave you some visibility to our impact finance business. So we see this being a real engine of growth as the whole world of investments overall growth. Obviously, when you have good strong equity markets, do slightly better.

In other times, you do slightly worse. But the core organic growth and market share gains here are very real.

Steven Chubak: That's great. And for my follow-up, on deposit mix, looking at noninterest-bearing deposits, you saw solid growth 4%, sequential increase on average. Recognizing some of that is gonna be seasonal. But do you feel we've reached a sustained inflection in noninterest-bearing deposits? And within the NII guidance for the full year, what are you assuming for deposit remixing and shrinkage in time deposits? As well as betas with some of the upcoming rate cuts.

John Stern: Sure. Thanks. Appreciate that. In terms of noninterest-bearing, and yes, we have grown both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. That year-over-year basis has not been achieved in quite some time. So it was very nice to see that. And we do expect that to continue into 2026. So in our call here for growth, on both loan and deposit, I would anticipate it's both a mix of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits with roughly the mix probably being in the same area that it is today is kinda how we think about it.

You know, in terms of deposit mix and rates and things like that, I'm just gonna kinda go back to, you know, we're focused very much on growing our consumer business as well as these key areas that are gonna help us grow in our fee revenues, the treasury management areas, the institutional businesses, and several and select corporate clients. So that's gonna be our focus as we think about deposits this upcoming year.

Steven Chubak: That's great color. Thanks for taking my questions.

Operator: Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I was hoping you could give a quick update on your branch strategy. Your branch count, I think, is down about four or 5% versus a year ago. I think you've talked about kind of not being that interested in bank deals. So kind of bringing that all together and in lieu of some other banks maybe announcing branch expansion strategies. You know, just talk about the branch strategy and, you know, again, if there's any change on the M&A, I think. Thanks.

Gunjan Kedia: Matt, thank you. Let me begin. So just for historical context, U.S. Bank had a very, very heavy presence in-store branches. And before our digital tools, that's what provided servicing access to people over the weekends and after hours. You don't need that anymore. So the vast majority of our branch closures is really these small servicing units. What we are building instead is multi-client hubs that have many products represented in more hub-like branches. We invest about $200 million in our branches. We find that to be a very effective channel, continuing to be a very effective channel.

So our strategy, though, is to try and get to top five market share in the places that we are in and create sort of modern interconnected branches in those areas. So for example, in Denver, we've just finished the renovation of all our branches into the new format. We are continuing to lean in on branches as a source of growth and client service. It's just our starting point was slightly different. So we have to close all these sort of in-store branches and then rebuild from that point onwards. And on your second question, there's no change in our strategy. We are very focused on our organic growth opportunities and seeing a lot of momentum there.

Matt O'Connor: Okay. That's all helpful. And then so if we strip out the in-store branches. Any numbers on kind of the remaining branch network, and then from your perspective, like, how much more refurbishing or retrofitting is there still to do for the traditional branches? Thanks.

John Stern: Sure. So on how much to do, you know, the $200 million is going to be kind of a consistent always-on approach to remodeling, to adding and branches and things of that variety. So we've had several hundred branches remodeled this year. We expect to have that occur next year as well, and that'll be just a continuation of our strategy that Gunjan just laid out.

Gunjan Kedia: Matt, it's very much always on, you know, because you refresh these formats over and over again. So it's not sort of one and done. But the message here really is we are investing very much in our branch. It's an important channel for us.

Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you.

Operator: Our last question will come from Chris McGratty from KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris McGratty from KBW. Your line is open.

Chris McGratty: Oh, sorry about that. Was on mute. John, when you look at your top five goal for market share, and across your footprint, the metro market, where would you not be where you need to be? Where do you need to invest a little bit more to get the market share?

John Stern: You know, in terms of are you speaking more on the consumer side or on the commercial side?

Chris McGratty: Consumer side?

John Stern: Sure. So, you know, like Gunjan just laid out, the Denver area, we've certainly been making investments here in our hub here in headquarters here in Minneapolis, Nashville, Arizona, areas, of course, in California, given the Union acquisition where we've combined, where locations were very close to each other and obviously, took the premier spot or refurbished those areas. So, what we're doing is really we're refurbishing and we're building branches in areas where there's high growth in those MSA areas. So not every area is, of course, the same, so you have to go kinda market by market. But that's been the course of our strategy over the last couple of years.

Chris McGratty: Great. And my follow-up would be on just consumer checking account growth. It's gotten a lot of attention this quarter. You guys had good consumer deposit growth in the quarter. Can you share any statistics about the checking account growth over the past, you know, year or two that would give you optimism? It's gonna be this could continue?

John Stern: Thank you. Yeah. So I think the important thing is really, I mean, accounts are good, of course, and we watch that. But it's really about the balances is what we're really focused on. And so our consumer amounts were up two and a half percent, or $7 billion or so this past year. Not many peers grew consumer deposits this year. It's a very competitive market. And I think what's important for us is we've developed a very nice set of products that can meet a number of different clients. And we have pricing capability tools that we've been building over the last several years that have helped us in this regard as well.

So the combination of all that is really, I think, is what is giving us strength in that consumer number. As well as our capability digitally to compete anywhere across the country. So it doesn't have to be just our footprint. That is necessarily the case. So all those are leading factors to where why we think that consumer growth will continue.

Gunjan Kedia: I'll just add that the branch performance has inflected very nicely too with all of the investments that we have made, all the tools that we've put in the hands, all the AI-powered next best solutions, you know, collectively that has created a fair amount of momentum, and we've been building towards those capabilities all of 2025. And beginning to show up in our results here.

Chris McGratty: Great. Thank you so much.

Whether driven by growth, aging facilities, or new research directions, redesigning or moving a laboratory can feel overwhelming, especially for managers tackling their first major project. The challenge is not just about fitting equipment into a new footprint. It’s about balancing staff workflows, safety requirements, budget realities, and future flexibility, often under tight timelines.

By understanding why space planning matters, defining clear decision criteria early, and learning from lessons others have already experienced, lab managers can approach planning with greater confidence and fewer surprises.

Understanding the “why” behind laboratory space planning

Space planning directly affects safety, productivity, and long-term adaptability. Hastily planned labs may technically function on day one, but they often carry hidden costs, like inefficient workflows, operational workarounds, compliance challenges, and staff frustration that builds over time.

Organizations increasingly prioritize flexible layouts, shared equipment zones, and smarter use of utilities to support changing research demands and sustainability goals. Instead of placing equipment simply where it fits, lab users should consider how the space supports science and workflow.

Many labs operate in spaces that have barely changed in decades, says Chris Orlando, BSN, RN, president of VOC Associates, a Cleveland-based laboratory equipment planning firm. “They've been following the same process, same protocol, with just minor modifications as equipment has come online. They've kind of rigged it up so it works, but they're so used to that that we've heard quite often, ‘Well, that's just not going to work.’”

Through careful discussions and visits to comparable sites, Orlando notes, the tone often shifts to “I guess that could work.” He explains that reluctance to change doesn’t stem from pure doubt, but from a need for more information and exposure to new ideas.

Key lab planning decision criteria for lab managers

While every project is unique, several decision criteria consistently shape successful outcomes.

Start with workflow mapping

Effective lab planning begins with understanding how people, samples, and materials move through the lab. This means involving the people who do the work (not just leadership) in mapping current and future workflows.

Orlando emphasizes that excluding end users often backfires. “The people that actually do the work, as you get deeper into operational planning and get into the meat and potatoes of actually planning the lab move, may say, ‘Wait a second, that's not how we do it. How did this get designed that way?'” Ensuring the right people are involved early allows the lab to be designed correctly from the start, rather than retrofitting or adjusting operational workflows later.

Plan equipment placement in detail

Equipment planning goes beyond large, floor-mounted instruments. Even smaller benchtop equipment consumes space, power, and clearance—and overlooking it adds up quickly.

Danielle Benford, senior vice president at VOC Associates, cautions against relying solely on cut sheets: “Spec sheets, while great, don’t actually account for the real-time use of a piece of equipment.” Handles, hinges, monitoring devices, and seismic bracing can add inches that derail layouts if not planned for early.

Prioritize safety and compliance

Environmental health & safety (EHS) teams, chemical safety professionals, and regulatory stakeholders should be involved from the earliest design phases. For example, flammable cabinets are sometimes positioned based on available space rather than volume calculations and fire barrier requirements—both essential for proper smoke compartmentation. Delaying EHS involvement can lead to costly redesigns and user resistance.

“Make sure you have your EHS folks at the table in schematic design,” says Benford. “I think the biggest issue we see is when those folks aren't involved until later. They have a lot of knowledge that they bring to the table.”

Lab staff moving from grandfathered spaces may also struggle to understand why updated rules now apply. “A lot of these groups have lived in their space for decades, so regulations were very different 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago,” Benford notes. Taking the time to explain the reasoning behind these requirements, rather than simply enforcing them, is essential.

Design for flexibility and growth

Resist the urge to fill every available space, Benford advises. “If at all possible, try not to fill every single inch of space that you have in your design.” Overpacking layouts leaves no room for growth and magnifies the impact of even modest equipment changes.

Projects that rely on “cookie-cutter” bench and shelving layouts frequently result in the removal of costly, unused casework after move-in because equipment lids interfere with shelves or required clearances were overlooked.

Get utilities and infrastructure right early

Power, HVAC, data, and specialized utilities must align with both current and legacy equipment. Orlando notes how often teams discover late in design that facilities lack required power: “‘We did an inventory and we’ve got a bunch of 240V equipment.’ And the first thing the product team says is, ‘We don’t have 240V power.’” These gaps often lead to unplanned costs and operational compromises.

Lessons from the field: what successful projects have in common

Across projects, a few consistent themes emerge.

First, be transparent and involve staff in the process. “Good projects have good communication,” says Orlando. “Things can't be overcommunicated enough, whether it's meeting minutes, whether it's having recurring meetings with the individual laboratories to plan out their moves so that they understand the subtleties.”

Second, be honest about internal capacity. Moving or redesigning a lab is labor-intensive. Organizations that assume they can handle everything internally often realize too late that planning has consumed thousands of hours and stretched staff beyond sustainable limits. “Moving your lab should not be an experiment,” Orlando says.

Third, budget realistically up front. Improper budgeting often leads to value engineering that saves capital dollars but increases operational costs for decades. Projects may finish on budget, but workflows suffer, and staff dissatisfaction grows because early trade-offs have long-term consequences.

Actionable takeaways for lab managers

While no checklist replaces thoughtful planning, several practical steps can help guide the process:

Define “must-haves” versus “nice-to-haves” early. This clarity supports better decisions when budgets tighten.

Inventory everything, no matter its size. “Almost no equipment is too small to include in your planning,” Benford emphasizes.

Document current and future states. Understand what processes look like today and what you want them to become.

Leave room to grow. Plan layouts closer to 80–85 percent capacity rather than at maximum fill.

Invest in communication tools. Meeting minutes, site visits, and visual aids help users envision change and reduce resistance.

Utilize smart design tools and software. Tools such as space audits, utilization tracking, digital modeling, and even VR walkthroughs help stakeholders visualize workflows and catch issues before construction or move-in.

Seek outside perspective when needed. Change management specialists and lab planning experts can ask difficult questions that internal teams might overlook or avoid.

Thoughtful laboratory space planning is more than a logistical exercise. It’s a chance to create safer, more efficient, and future-ready environments that truly support science. By understanding the drivers behind space planning, involving the right voices early, and designing with flexibility in mind, lab leaders can turn redesigns or relocations from stressful disruptions into opportunities for improvement.",https://cdn.labmanager.com/assets/image/55728/lab-planning-m.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 18:01:36.319324

NVIDIA and AMD Rumoredly Informed AICs About Higher GPU Memory Prices; NVIDIA's Price Increase is Reportedly Lower Than AMD

Higher GPU prices are imminent, and we have not just been tracking the prices of the latest-gen GPUs, but have been continuously reporting on the new pricing and supply strategy by the GPU giants. Most reports have centered on NVIDIA GPUs, as there have been rumors regarding the discontinuation of some RTX 50 series GPUs temporarily, which have ultimately been denied and put to rest by NVIDIA itself. Though there is no doubt about the reports that suggest higher GPU prices in the coming days.

On January 16th, NVIDIA officially notified its AIC partners that all bundled GDDR6 and GDDR7 memory packages are now increasing in price. We have been informed of the price increase through familiar AIC partners, but we won't specify the exact price here. What we can say is that NVIDIA's new prices are still lower than those announced by AMD to its AIB partners.

via Benchlife

NVIDIA promised that it would absorb the memory costs to ensure gamers can still get GPUs at an affordable price, and so did AMD. It appears that both GPU manufacturers have now informed their board partners about the price hike in memory chips. Both supply the GPU and memory chips to their board partners, and therefore, the AIBs will have no choice but to increase the GPU prices. However, it's said that NVIDIA's newly announced GPU memory prices are still lower than what AMD told its board partners.

So, if higher costs are passed down to the AIBs, one can expect a noticeable increase in AMD GPU prices vs NVIDIA. That said, the AIBs can decide how much they want to charge for various editions, and we have already seen NVIDIA's high-end RTX 50 series GPUs costing nearly twice as much. AMD RX 9000 GPUs have also seen a significant price change in recent days, and since AMD is expected to focus more on the 16 GB cards, the GPUs may see a higher price hike.

On the other hand, the shipment volume of the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT has consistently exceeded that of the Radeon RX 9070, so the focus on the Radeon RX 9070 XT is somewhat puzzling... After all, they both use the same NAVI 48 chip, differing only in XTX, XT, XL, and XTW versions...

via Benchlife

Keep in mind that it's reported that neither NVIDIA nor AMD is changing their MSRP for the GPUs, which means the suggested retail prices will remain the same. As of right now, NVIDIA & their partners have denied special treatment to a specific line of GPUs. AMD, on the other hand, is said to have increased the shipment capacity of its higher-end RX 9070 XT GPUs rather than focusing on more mainstream models such as the RX 9070.

United joined its rival Delta Air Lines in forecasting potential record earnings for the year. The two carriers accounted for almost all of the U.S. airline industry's profit in the first nine months of 2025. Other airlines are set to report later this month.

United's unit revenue fell 1.6% in the fourth quarter compared with last year. Still, United said premium revenue rose 9% in the fourth quarter and 11% for the full year over 2024. Restrictive basic-economy ticket sales, which compete with discount airlines, were up 7% in the last three months of 2025.

Most airlines are chasing revenue from higher-priced tickets like first class, racing to add in fresh, new cabins that command a premium.

Here is what United Airlines reported for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on estimates compiled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $3.10 adjusted vs. $2.94 expected

Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.4 billion expected

The carrier's fourth-quarter profit rose 6% from a year earlier to $1.04 billion, or $3.19 a share, while capacity rose 6.5% from the same period in 2024. Adjusting for one-time items, United posted earnings of $1.01 billion, or $3.10 a share.

Jan 20 (Reuters) - All three major Wall Street indexes ended Tuesday with their biggest one-day drops in three months, in a broad selloff triggered by concerns that fresh tariff threats from President Donald Trump against Europe could signal renewed market volatility.

The risk-off trade was pervasive, helping vault gold to fresh record highs, and pushing up debt costs with U.S. Treasuries wobbling under renewed selling pressure. Bitcoin, which can find favor when traditional markets waver, fell more than 3%.

All three U.S. equity benchmarks registered their worst one-day performance since October 10, with both the and slipping below their 50-day moving averages.

The S&P 500 lost 143.15 points, or 2.06%, to end at 6,796.86 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gave up 561.07 points, or 2.39%, to 22,954.32. The fell 870.74 points, or 1.76%, to 48,488.59.

UNCERTAINTY RISES

Tuesday was the first opportunity for U.S. investors to act on Trump’s weekend comments, given the market holiday for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.

This included Trump saying additional 10% import tariffs would take effect on February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Great Britain — all already subject to U.S. tariffs.

The tariffs would increase to 25% on June 1 and continue until a deal was reached for the U.S. to purchase Greenland, Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. Leaders of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, and Denmark have insisted the island is not for sale.

The reinjection of tariff threats into global markets harkens back to April’s ""Liberation Day,"" when Trump’s levies on global trade partners pushed the S&P 500 to near bear market territory.

The CBOE Volatility Index, also known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, spiked to 20.09 points, its highest close since November 24.

Trading volumes were also higher: around 20.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Tuesday, up from the 17.01 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

While investor sentiment was frayed on Tuesday, the question being asked is whether Greenland represents a knee-jerk selloff, or something that will have longer-term implications for markets.

Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, said he was not seeing indications investors were fleeing.

""I’m not at the point yet where I’m willing to say what is happening with Greenland, and the resurgence of the tariff threat back and forth, is going to precipitate a correction in the equities markets,"" he said, adding he would be surprised if there was a 3% to 5% drop this week.

BOND MARKETS SPILLOVER

A potentially more significant action, in Cox’s eyes, would be whether Japanese authorities intervene in financial markets.

Japanese government bonds plunged on Tuesday, sending yields to record highs, while Tokyo stocks and the yen also fell after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s call for a snap election shook confidence in the country’s fiscal health.

The moves helped push the cost of longer-term European government bonds higher, while a selloff in U.S. Treasuries was more pronounced on the long end of the curve.

Despite tariff talk, and notable bond movements, the U.S. economy remains in a strong position.

Investors are due a host of fresh data this week on the state of the U.S. economy, including the third-quarter U.S. GDP update, January PMI readings and the Personal Consumption Expenditures report, which is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge.

Earnings season is also kicking into higher gear, with several industry bellwethers set to report their quarterly earnings this week.

Over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for HBAN’s quarterly earnings has been unchanged at 39 cents per share.
Over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for BOH’s quarterly earnings has been unchanged at $1.25 per share.","U.S. Bancorp’s USB fourth-quarter 2025 earnings per share of $1.26 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19. The bottom line increased 24.7% from the prior-year quarter.

Results benefited from lower expenses and higher non-interest income. Also, a rise in net interest income (NII) and a strong capital position were tailwinds. However, a rise in provision was concerning.

Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp was $2.04 billion, up 22.9% from the prior-year quarter.

In 2025, earnings of $4.62 per share surpassed the consensus estimate of $4.55 and rose from $3.79 in 2024. Net income was $7.6 billion, up 20.2% from the prior-year quarter.

USB’s Revenues Rise, Expenses Decline

Total revenues in the reported quarter were $7.36 billion, up 5.1% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.6%.

For 2025, total revenues were $28.54 billion, which marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28.61 billion. The top line rose 4.4% year over year.

Tax-equivalent NII totaled $4.31 billion, up 3.2% from the year-ago quarter. The increase primarily resulted from loan growth and fixed asset repricing.

The net interest margin of 2.77% expanded 6 basis points year over year.

Non-interest income moved up 7.8% year over year to $3.05 billion. The upside was driven by a rise in almost all components.

Non-interest expenses declined 1.9% year over year to $4.23 billion. The decrease was due to lower compensation and employee benefits expenses, partially offset by higher marketing and business development expenses, technology and communications expenses and other expenses.

The efficiency ratio was 57.4%, lower than the year-ago quarter’s 61.5%. A decline in the ratio indicates an improvement in profitability.

U.S. Bancorp’s Loan & Deposit Balances Increase

Average total loans rose 1.3% to $384.3 billion from the previous quarter. Average total deposits moved up slightly from the previous quarter to $515.1 billion.

USB’s Credit Quality Improves

Total allowance for credit losses was $7.94 billion, down marginally year over year. As of Dec. 31, 2025, U.S. Bancorp’s non-performing assets amounted to $1.59 billion, down 13.2% from the year-ago period.

Net charge-offs were $527 million, down 6.2% from the year-ago quarter.

The provision for credit losses in the reported quarter was $577 million, up 3% from the prior-year quarter.

U.S. Bancorp’s Capital Ratios Improve

The Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.3% as of Dec. 31, 2025, up from 12.2% in the prior-year quarter. The Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel III standardized approach was 10.8% as of Dec. 31, 2025, up from 10.6% in the year-ago quarter.

The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.7%, up from the prior-year quarter’s 5.8%.

Our Take on USB

U.S. Bancorp’s diversified revenue streams, solid balance sheet and disciplined cost control continue to support its strong financial performance. Growth in NII and non-interest income, coupled with improved efficiency, bodes well for future profitability. Although provisions rose modestly, USB remains well-positioned to deliver steady returns on tangible common equity and maintain positive operating leverage in the upcoming quarters.

After 53 years on this earth, bringing happiness and laughter to everyone she knew, our beloved Marla Kleinheinz passed away peacefully on January 11, 2026.

Marla was the youngest of seven children raised by John and Jane Kleinheinz in Lake Oswego, OR. She was born with Down syndrome but never let that stop her from living a full life. Her older brothers and sisters loved her unconditionally, and she thrived off the energy that constantly filled the house at 74 Touchstone — a home always full of kids, parents, and friends.

From the beginning, her mother Jane insisted that Marla lead as normal a life as possible. She attended Uplands Elementary and graduated from Lake Oswego High in 1993. In 1996, John Janko, then store manager at Albertsons in Lake Grove, gave her a chance, and she worked there for the next twenty-three years. She was always quick with a “hi” and a hug to everyone she met.

Marla had boundless energy. She competed in Special Olympics skiing, swimming, and occasionally track and field. She loved bowling and golfing. She also enjoyed dancing and singing and was never shy to grab the microphone and make a speech. She savored life and was rarely angry. She taught all of us to love everyone and, most importantly, not to take ourselves too seriously.

Marla is survived by her mother Jane; sisters Anne (Steve Andersen), Kathy, Laura (Mark Yockey), Patrice (Mark Echols); and brothers John (Marsha Kleinheinz) and Michael (Rachèle Lamontagne), as well as numerous nieces, nephews, and friends.

Elon helps Microsoft win OpenAI Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI has been one of its key strategic advantages in the cloud.
“Good,” Nadella wrote.
The other slots were “still up in air.” Altman asked, “would [redacted] be ok with you?” “No,” Nadella wrote.
“We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Nadella posted on X.","The launch of the AI lab that would redefine Microsoft caught the tech giant by surprise.

“Did we get called to participate?” Satya Nadella wrote to his team on Dec. 12, 2015, hours after OpenAI announced its founding. “AWS seems to have sneaked in there.”

Nadella had been Microsoft CEO for less than two years. Azure, the company’s cloud platform, was five years old and chasing Amazon Web Services for market share. And now AWS had been listed as a donor in the “Introducing OpenAI” post. Microsoft wasn’t in the mix.

In the internal message, which hasn’t been previously reported, Nadella wondered how the new AI nonprofit could remain truly “open” if it was tied only to Amazon’s cloud.

Within months, Microsoft was courting OpenAI. Within four years, it would invest $1 billion, adding more than $12 billion in subsequent rounds. Within a decade, the relationship would culminate in a $250 billion spending commitment for Microsoft’s cloud and a 27% equity stake in one of the most valuable startups in history.

New court filings offer an inside look at one of the most consequential relationships in tech. Previously undisclosed emails, messages, slide decks, reports, and deposition transcripts reveal how Microsoft pursued, rebuffed and backed OpenAI at various moments over the past decade, ultimately shaping the course of the lab that launched the generative AI era.

More broadly, they show how Nadella and Microsoft’s senior leadership team rally in a crisis, maneuver against rivals such as Google and Amazon, and talk about deals in private.

For this story, GeekWire dug through more than 200 documents, many of them made public Friday in Elon Musk’s ongoing suit accusing OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman of abandoning the nonprofit mission. Microsoft is also a defendant. Musk, who was an OpenAI co-founder, is seeking up to $134 billion in damages. A jury trial is scheduled for this spring.

OpenAI has disputed Musk’s account of the company’s origins. In a blog post last week, the company said Musk agreed in 2017 that a for-profit structure was necessary, and that negotiations ended only when OpenAI refused to give him full control.

The recently disclosed records show that Microsoft’s own leadership anticipated the possibility of such a dispute. In March 2018, after learning of OpenAI’s plans to launch a commercial arm, Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott sent Nadella and others an email offering his thoughts.

“I wonder if the big OpenAI donors are aware of these plans?” Scott wrote. “Ideologically, I can’t imagine that they funded an open effort to concentrate ML [machine learning] talent so that they could then go build a closed, for profit thing on its back.”

The latest round of documents, filed as exhibits in Musk’s lawsuit, represents a partial record selected to support his claims in the case. Microsoft declined to comment.

Elon helps Microsoft win OpenAI

Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI has been one of its key strategic advantages in the cloud. But the behind-the-scenes emails make it clear that Amazon was actually there first.

According to an internal Microsoft slide deck from August 2016, included in recent filings, OpenAI was running its research on AWS as part of a deal that gave it $50 million in computing for $10 million in committed funds. The contract was up for renewal in September 2016.

Microsoft wanted in. Nadella reached out to Altman, looking for a way to work together.

In late August, the filings show, Altman emailed Musk about a new deal with Microsoft: “I have negotiated a $50 million compute donation from them over the next 3 years!” he wrote. “Do you have any reason not to like them, or care about us switching over from Amazon?”

Musk, co-chair of OpenAI at the time, gave his blessing to the Microsoft deal in his unique way, starting with a swipe at Amazon founder Jeff Bezos: “I think Jeff is a bit of a tool and Satya is not, so I slightly prefer Microsoft, but I hate their marketing dept,” Musk wrote.

He asked Altman what happened to Amazon.

Altman responded, “Amazon started really dicking us around on the T+C [terms and conditions], especially on marketing commits. … And their offering wasn’t that good technically anyway.”

Microsoft and OpenAI announced their partnership in November 2016 with a blog post highlighting their plans to “democratize artificial intelligence,” and noting that OpenAI would use Azure as its primary cloud platform going forward.

Internally, Microsoft saw multiple benefits. The August 2016 slide deck, titled “OpenAI on Azure Big Compute,” described it as a prime opportunity to flip a high-profile customer to Azure.

The presentation also emphasized bigger goals: “thought leadership” in AI, a “halo effect” for Azure’s GPU launch, and the chance to recruit a “net-new audience” of developers and startups. It noted that OpenAI was a nonprofit “unconstrained by a need to generate financial return” — an organization whose research could burnish Microsoft’s reputation in AI.

But as the ambition grew, so did the bill.

‘Most impressive thing yet in the history of AI’

In June 2017, Musk spoke with Nadella directly to pitch a major expansion. OpenAI wanted to train AI systems to beat the best human players at competitive esports, Valve’s Dota 2. The computing requirements were massive: 10,000 servers equipped with the latest Nvidia GPUs.

“This would obviously be a major opportunity for Microsoft to promote Azure relative to other cloud systems,” Musk wrote in an email to OpenAI colleagues after the call.

Nadella said he’d talk about it internally with his Microsoft cloud team, according to the email. “Sounds like there is a good chance they will do it,” Musk wrote.

Two months later, Altman followed up with a formal pitch. “I think it will be the most impressive thing yet in the history of AI,” he wrote to Nadella that August.

Microsoft’s cloud executives ran the numbers and balked. In an August 2017 email thread, Microsoft executive Jason Zander told Nadella the deal would cost so much it “frankly makes it a non-starter.” The numbers are redacted from the public version of the email.

“I do believe the pop from someone like Sam and Elon will help build momentum for Azure,” Zander wrote. “The scale is also a good forcing function for the fleet and we can drive scale into the supply chain. But I won’t take a complete bath to do it.”

Ultimately, Microsoft passed. OpenAI contracted with Google for the Dota 2 project instead.

‘A bucket of undifferentiated GPUs’

Microsoft’s broader relationship with OpenAI was starting to fray, as well. By January 2018, according to internal emails, Microsoft executive Brett Tanzer had told Altman that he was having a hard time finding internal sponsors at Microsoft for an expanded OpenAI deal.

Altman started shopping for alternatives. Around that time, Tanzer noted in an email to Nadella and other senior executives that OpenAI’s people “have been up in the area recently across the lake” — a reference to Amazon’s Seattle headquarters.

The internal debate at Microsoft was blunt.

Scott wrote that OpenAI was treating Microsoft “like a bucket of undifferentiated GPUs, which isn’t interesting for us at all.” Harry Shum, who led Microsoft’s AI research, said he’d visited OpenAI a year earlier and “was not able to see any immediate breakthrough in AGI.”

Eric Horvitz, Microsoft’s chief scientist, chimed in to say he had tried a different approach. After a Skype call with OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, he pitched the idea of collaboration focused on “extending human intellect with AI — versus beating humans.”

The conversation was friendly, Horvitz wrote, but he didn’t sense much interest. He suspected OpenAI’s Dota work was “motivated by a need to show how AI can crush humans, as part of Elon Musk’s interest in demonstrating why we should all be concerned about the power of AI.”

Scott summed up the risk of walking away: OpenAI might “storm off to Amazon in a huff and shit-talk us and Azure on the way out.”

“They are building credibility in the AI community very fast,” the Microsoft CTO and Silicon Valley veteran wrote. “All things equal, I’d love to have them be a Microsoft and Azure net promoter. Not sure that alone is worth what they’re asking.”

But by the following year, Microsoft had found a reason to double down.

The first billion

In 2019, OpenAI restructured. The nonprofit would remain, but a new “capped profit” entity would sit beneath it — a hybrid that could raise capital from investors while limiting their returns.

Microsoft agreed to invest $1 billion, with an option for a second billion, in exchange for exclusive cloud computing rights and a commercial license to OpenAI’s technology.

The companies announced the deal in July 2019 with a joint press release. “The creation of AGI will be the most important technological development in human history, with the potential to shape the trajectory of humanity,” Altman said. Nadella echoed that sentiment, emphasizing the companies’ ambition to “democratize AI” while keeping safety at the center.

So what changed for Microsoft between 2018 and 2019?

In a June 2019 email to Nadella and Bill Gates, previously disclosed in the Google antitrust case, Scott cited the search giant’s AI progress as one reason for Microsoft to invest in OpenAI. He “got very, very worried,” he explained, when he “dug in to try to understand where all of the capability gaps were between Google and us for model training.”

Nadella forwarded Scott’s email to Amy Hood, Microsoft’s CFO. “Very good email that explains why I want us to do this,” Nadella wrote, referring to the larger OpenAI investment, “and also why we will then ensure our infra folks execute.”

Gates wasn’t so sure. According to Nadella’s deposition testimony, the Microsoft co-founder was clear in “wanting us to just do our own” — arguing that the company should focus on building AI capabilities in-house rather than placing such a large bet on OpenAI.

Nadella explained that the decision to invest was eventually driven by him and Scott, who concluded that OpenAI’s specific research direction into transformers and large language models (the GPT class) was more promising than other approaches at the time.

Hood, meanwhile, offered some blunt commentary on OpenAI’s cap on profits — the centerpiece of its new structure, meant to limit investor returns and preserve the nonprofit’s mission. The caps were so high, she wrote, that they were almost meaningless.

“Given the cap is actually larger than 90% of public companies, I am not sure it is terribly constraining nor terribly altruistic but that is Sam’s call on his cap,” Hood wrote in a July 14, 2019, email to Nadella, Scott, and other executives.

If OpenAI succeeded, she noted, the real money for Microsoft would come from Azure revenue — far exceeding any capped return on the investment itself.

But the deal gave Microsoft more than cloud revenue.

According to an internal OpenAI memo dated June 2019, Microsoft’s investment came with approval rights over “Major Decisions” — including changes to the company’s structure, distributions to partners, and any merger or dissolution.

Microsoft’s $1 billion made it the dominant investor. Under the partnership agreement, major decisions required approval from a majority of limited partners based on how much they had contributed. At 85% of the total, Microsoft had an effective veto, a position of power that would give the company a pivotal role in defining the future of the company.

‘The opposite of open’

In September 2020, Musk responded to reports that Microsoft had exclusively licensed OpenAI’s GPT-3. “This does seem like the opposite of open,” he tweeted. “OpenAI is essentially captured by Microsoft.”

Nadella seemed to take the criticism seriously.

In an October 2020 meeting, according to internal notes cited in a recent court order, Microsoft executives discussed the perception that the company was “effectively owning” OpenAI, with Nadella saying they needed to give thought to Musk’s perspective.

In February 2021, as Microsoft and OpenAI negotiated a new investment, Altman emailed Microsoft’s team: “We want to do everything we can to make you all commercially successful and are happy to move significantly from the term sheet.”

His preference, Altman told the Microsoft execs, was “to make you all a bunch of money as quickly as we can and for you to be enthusiastic about making this additional investment soon.”

They closed the deal in March 2021, for up to $2 billion. This was not disclosed publicly until January 2023, when Microsoft revealed it as part of a larger investment announcement.

By 2022, the pressure to commercialize was explicit.

According to a transcript of her deposition, Mira Murati, then OpenAI’s vice president of applied AI and partnerships, had written in contemporaneous notes that the most-cited goal inside the company that year was a $100 million revenue target. Altman had told employees that Nadella and Scott said this needed to be hit to justify the next investment, as much as $10 billion.

Murati testified that Altman told her “it was important to achieve this goal to receive Microsoft’s continued investments.” OpenAI responded by expanding its go-to-market team and building out its enterprise business.

Then everything changed.

The ChatGPT moment

On Nov. 30, 2022, OpenAI announced ChatGPT. The chatbot became the fastest-growing consumer application in history, reaching 100 million users within two months. It was the moment that turned OpenAI from an AI research lab into a household name.

Microsoft’s bet was suddenly looking very different.

OpenAI’s board learned about the launch on Twitter. According to deposition testimony, board members Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley received no advance notice and discovered ChatGPT by seeing screenshots on social media.

McCauley described the fact that a “major release” could happen without the board knowing as “extremely concerning.” Toner testified that she wasn’t surprised — she was “used to the board not being very informed” — but believed it demonstrated that the company’s processes for decisions with “material impact on the mission were inadequate.”

Altman, according to one filing, characterized the release as a “research preview” using existing technology. He said the board “had been talking for months” about building a chat product, but acknowledged that he probably did not send the board an email about the specific release.

As its biggest investor, Microsoft pushed OpenAI to monetize the product’s success.

In mid-January 2023, Nadella texted Altman asking when he planned to activate a paid subscription. “Overall getting this in place sooner is best,” he wrote.

Two weeks later, Nadella checked in again: “Btw …how many subs have you guys added to chatGPT?”

Altman’s answer revealed what they were dealing with. OpenAI had 6 million daily active users — their capacity limit — and had turned away 50 million people who tried to sign up. “Had to delay charging due to legal issues,” he wrote, “but it should go out this coming week.”

ChatGPT Plus launched on Feb. 1, 2023, at $20 a month.

In the meantime, Microsoft invested another $10 billion in OpenAI. The companies had begun negotiating the previous summer, when OpenAI was still building ChatGPT. The product’s viral success validated Microsoft’s bet and foreshadowed a new era of demand for its cloud platform.

Ten months later, it nearly collapsed.

‘Run over by a truck’

On Friday afternoon, Nov. 17, 2023, OpenAI’s nonprofit board fired Altman as CEO, issuing a terse statement that he had not been “consistently candid in his communications with the board.” Greg Brockman, the company’s president and cofounder, was removed from the board the same day. He quit hours later.

Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest investor, was not consulted. Murati, then OpenAI’s chief technology officer and the board’s choice for interim CEO, called Nadella and Kevin Scott to warn them just 10 to 15 minutes before Altman himself was told.

“Mira sounded like she had been run over by a truck as she tells me,” Scott wrote in an email to colleagues that weekend.

The board — Ilya Sutskever, Tasha McCauley, Helen Toner, and Adam D’Angelo — had informed Murati the night before. They had given her less than 24 hours to prepare.

At noon Pacific time, the board delivered the news to Altman. The blog post went live immediately. An all-hands meeting followed at 2 p.m. By Friday night, Brockman had resigned. So had Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI’s head of research, along with a handful of other researchers.

A “whole horde” of employees, Scott wrote, had reached out to Altman and Brockman “expressing loyalty to them, and saying they will resign.”

Microsoft didn’t have a seat on the board. But text messages between Nadella and Altman, revealed in the latest filings, show just how influential it was in the ultimate outcome.

At 7:42 a.m. Pacific on Saturday, Nov. 18, Nadella texted Altman asking if he was free to talk. Altman replied that he was on a board call.

“Good,” Nadella wrote. “Call when done. I have one idea.”

That evening, at 8:25 p.m., Nadella followed up with a detailed message from Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president and top lawyer. In a matter of hours, the trillion-dollar corporation had turned on a dime, establishing a new subsidiary from scratch — legal work done, papers ready to file as soon as the Washington Secretary of State opened Monday morning.

They called it Microsoft RAI Inc., using the acronym for Responsible Artificial Intelligence.

“We can then capitalize the subsidiary and take all the other steps needed to operationalize this and support Sam in whatever way is needed,” Smith wrote. Microsoft was “ready to go if that’s the direction we need to head.”

Altman’s reply: “kk.”

The company calculated the cost of absorbing the OpenAI team at roughly $25 billion, Nadella later confirmed in a deposition — enough to match the compensation and unvested equity of employees who had been promised stakes in a company that now seemed on the verge of collapse.

By Sunday, Emmett Shear, the Twitch co-founder, had replaced Murati as interim CEO. That night, when the board still hadn’t reinstated Altman, Nadella announced publicly that Microsoft was prepared to hire the OpenAI CEO and key members of his team.

“In a world of bad choices,” Nadella said in his deposition, the move “was definitely not my preferred thing.” But it was preferable to the alternative, he added. “The worst outcome would have been all these people leave and they go to our competition.”

‘Strong strong no’

On Tuesday, Nov. 21, the outcome was still uncertain. Altman messaged Nadella and Scott that morning, “can we talk soon? have a positive update, ish.” Later, he said the situation looked “reasonably positive” for a five-member board. Shear was talking to the remaining directors.

Nadella asked about the composition, according to the newly public transcript of the message thread, which redacts the names of people who ultimately weren’t chosen.

“Is this Larry Summers and [redacted] and you three? Is that still the plan?”

Summers was confirmed, Altman replied. The other slots were “still up in air.”

Altman asked, “would [redacted] be ok with you?”

“No,” Nadella wrote.

Scott was more emphatic, giving one unnamed person a “strong no,” and following up for emphasis: “Strong strong no.”

The vetting continued, as Nadella and Scott offered suggestions, all of them redacted in the public version of the thread.

Nadella added Smith to the thread. One candidate, the Microsoft president wrote, was “Solid, thoughtful, calm.” Another was “Incredibly smart, firm, practical, while also a good listener.”

At one point, Scott floated a joke: “I can quit for six months and do it.” He added a grinning emoji and commented, “Ready to be downvoted by Satya on this one, and not really serious.”

Nadella gave that a thumbs down.

The back-and-forth reflected a delicate position. Microsoft had no board seat at OpenAI. Nadella had said publicly that the company didn’t want one. But the texts showed something closer to a shadow veto — a real-time screening of the people who would oversee the nonprofit’s mission.

By evening, a framework emerged. Altman proposed Bret Taylor, Larry Summers, and Adam D’Angelo as the board, with himself restored as CEO. Taylor would handle the investigation into his firing.

Smith raised a concern. “Your future would be decided by Larry [Summers],” he wrote. “He’s smart but so mercurial.” He called it “too risky.” (Summers resigned from the OpenAI board in November 2025, following revelations about his correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein.)

Altman wrote, “id accept it given my conversations with him and where we are right now.” He added, “it’s bullshit but i want to save this … can you guys live with it?”

Nadella asked for Summers’ cell number.

At 2:38 p.m., Altman texted the group: “thank you guys for the partnership and trust. excited to get this all sorted to a long-term configuration you can really depend on.”

Nadella loved the message.

Two minutes later, Smith replied: “Thank you! A tough several days. Let’s build on this and regain momentum.”

Altman loved that one.

Nadella had the last word: “Really looking forward to getting back to building….”

Later that night, OpenAI announced Altman’s return with the newly constituted board.

“We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Nadella posted on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.”

The crisis was resolved, but the underlying tensions remained.

‘Project Watershed’

On December 27, 2024, OpenAI announced it would unwind its capped-profit structure. Internally, this initiative was called “Project Watershed,” the documents reveal.

The mechanics played out through 2025. On September 11, Microsoft and OpenAI executed a memorandum of understanding with a 45-day timeline to finalize terms.

Microsoft’s role was straightforward but powerful. Its approval rights over “Major Decisions” including changes to OpenAI’s structure. Asked in a deposition whether those rights covered a recapitalization of OpenAI’s for‑profit entity into a public benefit corporation, Microsoft corporate development executive Michael Wetter testified that they did.

The company had no board seat. “Zero voting rights,” Wetter testified. “We have no role, to be super clear.” But under the 2019 agreement, the conversion couldn’t happen without them.

The timing mattered. A SoftBank-led financing — internally called Project Sakura — was contingent on the recapitalization closing by year-end. Without the conversion, the funding could not proceed. Without Microsoft’s approval, the conversion could not proceed.

Valuation became a key focus of negotiations. Morgan Stanley, working for Microsoft, estimated OpenAI’s value at $122 billion to $177 billion, according to court filings. Goldman Sachs, advising OpenAI, put it at $353 billion. The MOU set Microsoft’s stake at 32.5 percent. By the time the deal closed after the SoftBank round, dilution brought it to 27 percent.

OpenAI’s implied valuation was $500 billion — a record at the time (until it was surpassed in December by Musk’s SpaceX). As Altman put it in his deposition, “That was the willing buyer-willing seller market price, so I won’t argue with it.”

For Microsoft, it was a give-and-take deal: the tech giant lost its right of first refusal on new cloud workloads, even as OpenAI committed to the $250 billion in future Azure purchases.

At the same time, the agreement defused the clause that had loomed over the partnership: under prior terms, a declaration of artificial general intelligence by OpenAI’s board would have cut Microsoft off from future models. Now any such declaration needs to be made by an independent panel, and Microsoft’s IP rights run through 2032 regardless.

The transaction closed on Oct. 28, 2025. The nonprofit remained (renamed the OpenAI Foundation) but as a minority shareholder in the company it had once controlled.

Six days later, OpenAI signed a seven-year, $38 billion infrastructure deal with Amazon Web Services. The company that had “sneaked in there” at the founding, as Nadella put it in 2015, was back — this time as a major cloud provider for Microsoft’s flagship AI partner.

In a post this weekend, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar made the shift explicit: “Three years ago, we relied on a single compute provider,” she wrote. “Today, we are working with providers across a diversified ecosystem. That shift gives us resilience and, critically, compute certainty.”

Revenue had grown from $2 billion in 2023 to more than $20 billion in 2025. OpenAI was no longer a research lab dependent on Microsoft’s cloud. It was a platform company with leverage.

In December 2015, Nadella had to ask whether Microsoft had been called to participate in the OpenAI launch. A decade later, nothing could happen without the Redmond tech giant.

But OpenAI would no longer be theirs alone.",https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Altman-Satya-3.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 14:02:12.932093

The race is scheduled for 20 to 22 March and will replace the Argentina Grand Prix as the second round of the season.

The circuit has been fully repaved, and many safety and building upgrades have been made, including new kerbs, larger run-off areas and improvements to the pit lane, paddock, medical centre and race control. Local reports say the work is about 84% complete after some delays caused by extra requests from the FIM and Dorna.

An FIM inspection last week gave positive feedback, and officials said there was no serious reason to doubt the race will go ahead as planned. Another test event will take place from 29 February to 1 March, featuring 300cc, 600cc and 1000cc races behind closed doors to help the circuit receive full approval.

The event will be run by many of the same officials and marshals who will work at the MotoGP race, including some from the Formula 1 Sao Paulo Grand Prix. If the race happens, Brazilian fans will be able to support Diogo Moreira, who will make his MotoGP debut with LCR Honda after becoming the first Brazilian world champion in Moto2.

Adobe empowers everyone everywhere to imagine, create, and bring any digital experience to life. With over 29 billion assets generated using Adobe Firefly and a vast Adobe Stock ecosystem, the ability to search and discover relevant images or videos at scale is critical.

Achieving this at Adobe’s scale comes with complex technical requirements: running AI models that process hundreds of millions of assets, managing thousands of parallel inference jobs, and ensuring GPUs are fully utilized without breaking cost efficiency. Meeting these challenges requires an infrastructure that can handle massive data throughput, scale elastically, and minimize operational overhead.

In this post, we will share how the Adobe SDC team tackled these challenges and why AWS Batch—combined with GPU accelerated Amazon EC2 Instances—became a strong fit for our large-scale distributed inference workloads. More importantly, we’ll highlight the lessons we learned and the practices that helped us make inference very efficient.

The opportunity

Image assets from multiple sources power content retrieval, discovery and recommendations across various Adobe products—such as Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Express, Adobe Firefly and more—and are surfaced through semantic search. Embedding models are constantly evolving, which makes periodic re-computation of the embeddings for such huge data set(s) with hundreds of millions of assets increasingly critical for state-of-the-art search ranking and relevancy. As search features and experiences continue to evolve, with several experiments and evaluations across the development cycle, recomputing and updating embeddings becomes repetitive.

Computing image embeddings is similar to workflows for text, video, and audio and involves loading images into memory, running inference with Adobe’s proprietary machine learning models, and storing the results in internal systems that power semantic search, RAG, and other capabilities. Given the volume of the data, this process can only be implemented as a massively parallel process rather than sequential processing. AWS Batch, a fully managed service that simplifies running batch computing workloads, helped to achieve our goals.

Some of the key challenges included:

Model and data diversity: Different models and dataset sizes require different GPU architectures to maximize performance and speed. So, our pipelines need to be flexible to use different types of EC2 instances

High operational overhead: Building and maintaining our own container orchestration system (such as EKS) to execute these ad hoc inference jobs would involve significant engineering effort, including managing servers, auto-scaling groups, and load balancers. Instead, a simple ephemeral solution is more appropriate.

Failure detection and recovery: Even with complete automation of cluster setup, failure detection and retry mechanisms require additional business logic.

Data sharding complexity: Efficiently partitioning data and assigning work to each node in the data lake becomes increasingly challenging at scale.

Long processing times: Sequential processing can take weeks to complete for large workloads, severely limiting iteration speed.

The solution

When designing solutions, we aimed to achieve:

Immediate access to resources: Provide seamless access to GPUs across multiple instance types (e.g., g6e, g5), selected based on model requirements.

Efficient resource utilization: Ensure resources allocated are efficiently and effectively used.

Consistent job submission: Offer a standardized interface for job execution, regardless of parallelization level or EC2 instance type.

Cost optimization: Leverage a “pay-as-you-go” model and dynamically scale resources up or down based on demand. Minimize per-job costs to deliver the best possible value.

User experience: Democratize massive batch processing through a fully self-serve experience, empowering users to run jobs without deep infrastructure knowledge.

Data Preparation and Distributed Inferencing

Efficient data loading is critical to maximize GPU utilization during large-scale inference. A common bottleneck is that data is either not loaded quickly enough into GPUs, or the pipeline becomes unbalanced, leading to underutilized hardware.

For a different use case, Adobe Research customized the PyTorch Dataloader to stream samples directly from Amazon S3 into AWS Batch containers at a node level. Within each container, CPUs handle preprocessing—such as decoding and converting samples into tensors—before delivering well-formed batches to GPUs for inference. If a node has 8 GPUs, 8 dataloaders are created, each paired with its own model engine. While they all point to the same dataset, each data loader uses its assigned rank and the number of dataloaders the host is spinning up, also known as world rank, to know exactly which shard of the dataset to process, avoiding overlap and ensuring balanced throughput.

When extending the process to multiple distributed nodes, it is important for each node to be given a distinct dataset partition to process. One approach is to download the entire dataset per node and rely on dataloader rank/world size to handle partitioning. However, given the scale of the data, this would require significant extra disk usage. This is where we leveraged AWS Batch: We separated the dataset preparation and converted it into its own AWS Batch job. This preprocessing job runs multiple workers to shard the S3 bucket and compress object addresses into compact binary files.

During inference, each node only needs to download its assigned binary shard—based on its AWS_BATCH_JOB_NODE_INDEX—and to feed that to its data loaders. This reduces disk overhead, eliminates redundant data transfers, and ensures that every node processes a unique subset of the dataset. Together, these techniques keep GPUs well-fed with batches and maintain high efficiency across thousands of concurrent jobs. This stage was also achieved by AWS Batch service, and we leveraged Batch’s EC2 GPU instance type support capability.

How AWS Batch Supports our Solution Goals and Solved Scaling Challenges

AWS Batch provides a managed architecture that removes much of the operational burden of scaling large-scale inference workloads. It enables us to run tens of thousands of concurrent jobs without maintaining complex infrastructure, while benefiting from consistent logging, monitoring, access controls, and file system integration.

The following are some of the elements of the AWS Batch parallel processing.

Compute environment: This is where we define the EC2 instance type, launch template, and the minimum/maximum number of nodes. AWS Batch provisions an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for GPU nodes and deploys containers to these EC2 nodes based on their availability and health. This abstraction means we rarely touch low-level infrastructure. Scaling is automatic—if job volume increases or decreases, the ASG adjusts node count within the defined limits, ensuring we never pay for idle capacity.

Job queue: This determines the order in which jobs are executed against the associated Compute Environment. For example, if queue A is mapped to compute environment (CE) A, jobs in that queue will be dispatched based on available GPU capacity and queue priority. The job queue also enforces high-level execution rules, such as terminating jobs that exceed timeouts, fail due to insufficient GPU availability, or encounter other resource constraints.

Job definition: The job’s execution blueprint, like a docker run command. This specifies the Docker image, required GPU/CPU resources, disk mounts, and any environment variables or runtime configurations needed for the container to run on the EC2 host. It also defines the number of job attempts, or how many times to try to restart the container in case of failure.

Job: The process of submitting a job definition into a job queue. This triggers the provisioning of the required infrastructure. Each node in a multi-node job is automatically assigned two key environment variables—AWS_BATCH_JOB_NODE_INDEX and AWS_BATCH_JOB_NUM_NODES—used to shard data so that each node processes its specific portion of the workload.

When a job is submitted to AWS Batch, every job node receives the same environment variables, including an S3 URI where all data is stored. The EC2 instance from the ASG pulls the Docker image containing our inference model and logic. Once the container is up and healthy, it uses the node’s AWS_BATCH_JOB_NODE_INDEX and AWS_BATCH_JOB_NUM_NODES values to determine exactly which shard of data it should download and process. After the inference step completes, results are immediately stored in the search index. The container then exits with a success code and terminates, freeing the EC2 host. If additional jobs are waiting in the queue, the host picks up the next job; otherwise, the ASG scales down to release unused resources. By default, each job index also creates an AWS CloudWatch log stream, allowing us to observe container activity in real time and debug issues when needed.

Results

By redesigning a sequential workflow into a multi-step sharding and distributed parallel compute pipeline, and by implementing an efficient onload/offload mechanism for data to GPUs, we achieved 10x faster execution. From our monitoring dashboards, we often see our GPUs now consistently run at 100% utilization, delivering extremely high throughput and maximizing hardware efficiency.

AWS Batch allowed us to support this at scale by provisioning ephemeral compute with no fixed infrastructure or standing costs. AWS Batch handles the operational heavy lifting, and its flexibility to support both CPU and GPU workloads has saved us substantial engineering effort while reducing cloud spend.

In one of our largest runs—computing image embeddings for Adobe Stock—we reduced compute time from 30 days to under 20 hours, while realizing a 95%+ reduction in cost, covering not only compute but also engineering investment. This capability empowers our engineering team to accelerate production workloads and run large-scale experiments quickly and cost-effectively.

Lessons Learned

Data Organization

Efficient Data Sharding:

To process a large number of assets efficiently, pre-organizing data into smaller, manageable shards is critical. Without this, even simple operations like listing assets in S3 can take hours or may hang entirely. By organizing the data into smaller shards, we enabled parallel nodes to consume the data more effectively.

Handling S3 Rate Limits:

After organizing the data, parallel downloading by multiple nodes initially resulted in rate limit errors (HTTP 429). To address this:

We collaborated with the AWS S3 team to increase the throughput of the S3 bucket, which significantly reduced the rate limit errors.

Despite these measures, occasional 429 errors persisted. To mitigate this:

We implemented immediate retries within the same processing loop.

We added a final retry mechanism at the end of the processing. By this stage, each node was making fewer calls to S3, reducing the likelihood of 429 errors.

Batch Processing on GPUs:

When working with GPUs, processing data in optimal batches is mandatory. This applies to preprocessing, processing, and post-processing. This optimal batch size varies across applications. We experimented with various batch sizes before the big run and found an optimal size. Batch processing saved significant GPU time and reduced the overall processing time.

Data Localization:

We ensured that the data resided in the same AWS region as the batch computing clusters. This approach:

Avoided cross-region data transfer charges, which can be substantial.

Reduced latency and improved the overall operation time.

Compute

GPU Availability Challenges:

Due to the rising demand for ML computing, obtaining a high number of GPUs on demand is challenging. To address this:

We created compute definitions for various GPU instance families such as G5s, G6es, and G6s.

We leveraged hybrid compute definitions in AWS Batch to maximize flexibility.

Throughput Optimization:

Understanding the throughput of a single pod was essential. Based on this:

We defined the minimum and maximum number of vCPUs/GPUs required.

This ensured that even if the full compute capacity was unavailable, AWS Batch could start processing with the available resources and scale up as more compute became available.

Key Takeaways:

Data Organization: Proper sharding and localization of data are critical for efficient processing and cost optimization.

Error Handling: Implementing robust retry mechanisms helps mitigate rate limit errors.

Batch Processing: Processing data in batches is essential for GPU efficiency.

Compute Flexibility: Adapting to available compute resources ensures uninterrupted processing and scalability.

For established, profitable consumer brands, the P/S ratio is a useful cross check because it relates the share price to the revenue base that supports long term cash generation. Investors usually pay higher or lower P/S multiples depending on what they expect for future growth and how risky they think those cash flows are, so there is no single “right” level for all companies.

Kraft Heinz currently trades on a P/S of 1.11x. That sits above the Food industry average of 0.76x, but below the peer group average of 1.95x. To refine this further, Simply Wall St uses a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 1.33x for Kraft Heinz. This is the P/S level it estimates based on factors such as the company’s earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics.

This Fair Ratio is often more informative than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry because it adjusts for company specific traits rather than assuming all food stocks deserve the same multiple. Comparing the Fair Ratio of 1.33x with the current P/S of 1.11x suggests the shares may be trading at a discount on this metric.

Boston Scientific’s planned $14.5 billion acquisition of Penumbra started off the year with a bang. The two fast-growing, cardiovascular companies complement each other, with Boston Scientific seeing an opportunity to enter new markets, and Penumbra expecting its devices to gain a wider global reach.

Boston Scientific CEO Mike Mahoney explained how they reached a deal, saying there are few companies that can accelerate Boston Scientific’s growth, earnings per share and operating income margins.

“You have basically two companies that are strong independently, and in the combination have the potential to even become much stronger,” Mahoney said on a Thursday investor call.

The acquisition is expected to close in 2026, more likely in the second half of the year, Mahoney said. Boston Scientific will pay $374 per share, funding the acquisition with about $11 billion in cash and the remainder in stock.

Here are three takeaways from the deal:

1. Penumbra is expected to expand Boston Scientific’s presence in a fast-growing market

Penumbra makes thrombectomy devices to remove clots from blood vessels. It also makes embolization devices to stop blood flow and control bleeding. Mahoney said the acquisition could help Boston Scientific enter new, high-growth segments such as neurovascular and mechanical thrombectomy.

Boston Scientific previously had a neurovascular business, but the company sold it to Stryker in 2011.

“We’ve really been looking for a long time on how to become a scaled, market-leading neurovascular company, not one that’s coming from a distance behind the pack and trying to roll up a bunch of companies,” Mahoney said.

Last year, Boston Scientific also acquired Silk Road Medical, which makes minimally invasive products to prevent stroke in patients with carotid artery disease.

Mahoney added that while Boston Scientific sells some products to vascular surgeons, such as Silk Road’s systems, Penumbra works more closely with those physicians, and an acquisition could help with those relationships.

J.P. Morgan analyst Robbie Marcus wrote in a research note that Boston Scientific’s drug eluting stents, drug coated balloons and transcarotid artery revascularization systems could benefit from working more closely with vascular surgeons. At the same time, the analyst thinks Penumbra can benefit from Boston Scientific accelerating its access to international markets.

2. Little product overlap

Boston Scientific is “the most logical acquirer” for Penumbra, Needham analyst Mike Matson wrote in a research note. Penumbra’s products are complementary to Boston Scientific’s cardiology and peripheral intervention businesses, Matson added, with only modest overlap between the companies’ devices.

Because of this, Matson does not expect the deal to run into antitrust issues. He also does not expect Penumbra to receive higher bids from other firms that might face more regulatory hurdles to a deal. Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic and Terumo, for example, all have existing neurovascular businesses.

If the deal falls through, Penumbra would be responsible for paying a break-up fee of $525 million if it enters an agreement for a better proposal or the board changes its recommendation for shareholders to adopt the merger agreement, according to a securities filing.

Boston Scientific would be responsible for a $900 million termination fee if the companies are unable to get the needed regulatory approvals or clearances, but have met the other needed conditions, including shareholder approval.

3. Boston Scientific plans to keep Penumbra as a standalone company and maintain its culture

Mahoney said his number one goal for the acquisition is to keep employees engaged. He said both companies’ cultures are aligned with a focus on innovation and clinical evidence.

“I think you see with Boston Scientific, we have a very highly engaged global workforce,” Mahoney said. “We develop our employees. We have a culture that lets them speak their mind. We care about employees, and that very much matches with Penumbra.”

Two years after the acquisition closes, he expects to retain and grow the commercial workforce and provide additional resources to support Penumbra as needed.

To allow Penumbra the flexibility and speed it needs, Boston Scientific also plans to keep the company as a standalone entity within its cardiovascular group.

Stifel analyst Rick Wise said in a research note that Penumbra works in markets that are “high-growth but also highly competitive,” and that Boston Scientific emphasized protecting Penumbra’s “rapid innovation culture and top-class commercial team.”

As a further show of support for the deal, Penumbra CEO Adam Elsesser said he would take Boston Scientific stock for all of his Penumbra shares, and would be on the combined company’s board of directors.

Il ceo e primo azionista John Bossi ha depositato la lista per il nuovo consiglio di amministrazione, che sarà eletto nell’assemblea dei soci convocata per il 3 febbraio. La novità più rilevante è la candidatura di Marina Natale, ex manager di Unicredit e già amministratore delegato di Amco, come futura presidente della banca.

La lista presentata da Bossi è destinata a ottenere la majority of seats: secondo le previsioni, potrebbe assicurarsi almeno otto posti su nove, rafforzando così la continuità del progetto strategico avviato negli ultimi anni. L’ingresso di Natale al vertice del cda rappresenta un cambio di passo, soprattutto in vista della definizione del nuovo three-year industrial plan che la banca dovrà varare nei prossimi mesi.

Il nuovo piano industriale: wealth management e CIB

Il piano industriale, atteso nei prossimi mesi, sarà incentrato su wealth management e corporate e investment banking. L’obiettivo dichiarato dalla banca è stimolare la crescita organica, puntando su servizi finanziari alle imprese e sulla consulenza patrimoniale per imprenditori e famiglie. In particolare, la divisione wealth management mira a incrementare le masse gestite fino a 4,5 miliardi entro fine 2027, un traguardo ambizioso che richiede una forte integrazione con l’attività corporate. Secondo Bossi, la banca vuole diventare un punto di riferimento per le aziende nel loro percorso di sviluppo, offrendo supporto sia nelle fasi di espansione sia in quelle più delicate, come il passaggio generazionale.

Solidità patrimoniale e ricapitalizzazione

La financial solidity resta un punto di forza per Cherry Bank: a giugno l’istituto ha superato i 4 miliardi di attivo e i 220 milioni di patrimonio, con un CET1 al 17,89%. Questo risultato è stato sostenuto anche dall’aumento di capitale da 15 milioni versato da Bossi, parte di un accordo siglato nel 2021 durante la fusione con il Banco delle Tre Venezie. In vista della ricapitalizzazione, il ceo ha riconosciuto ad alcuni soci il diritto di non diluirsi, una scelta che sarà esercitata entro marzo e porterà la quota di Bossi al 55%, rispetto a oltre il 70% attuale. Una mossa che conferma la volontà di mantenere un controllo stabile, pur favorendo la partecipazione di investitori di rilievo.

Shares of personal computing and printing company HP (NYSE:HPQ) fell 1.7% in the morning session after Morgan Stanley turned more cautious on the U.S. IT hardware sector and lowered its price target on the company's stock.

The investment bank cut its view on the North American IT Hardware industry to “cautious” from “in-line,” warning of a potential 'perfect storm.' The analysts pointed to slowing demand from businesses, rising costs for components, and high stock valuations as reasons for the more defensive stance.

Specifically for HP, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring kept an ""Underweight"" rating on the stock but cut the price target by 10% from $20.00 to $18.00. The negative sentiment impacted the broader sector, with shares of Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise also falling.

What Is The Market Telling Us

HP’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 11 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 8 months ago when the stock dropped 8.2% on the news that the company reported weak first-quarter 2025 results: its EPS and EBITDA missed, and it lowered its full-year EPS guidance, pointing to an uncertain macro backdrop and uneven recovery in printing and consumer tech spending. On the other hand, HP narrowly topped analysts' revenue expectations. Still, this was a softer quarter.

HP is down 10% since the beginning of the year, and at $19.91 per share, it is trading 42.7% below its 52-week high of $34.72 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of HP’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $789.88.",https://news-assets.stockstory.org/cover-images/hp-cover-image-220e9e9be02c_2025-03-04-164456_dhwo.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 12:04:56.443113

10 stocks we like better than IonQ ›

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has seen success that few companies could dream of. It's at the center of one of the most important technological revolutions humankind has ever experienced, and it holds an impressive market share in its sector. Furthermore, Nvidia is producing margins that are unheard of for hardware companies, and any company that can replicate Nvidia's business model will likely be a successful investment.

One area where investors are looking for the next Nvidia is in quantum computing. It's a natural progression from the accelerated computing Nvidia excels at, and Nvidia isn't pursuing a quantum processing unit. So, there could be a new winner on the block for this innovative and exciting technology.

One stock investors point toward that could achieve Nvidia-like status is IonQ (NYSE: IONQ). IonQ is a pure-play quantum computing investment that is solely focused on bringing its quantum computing solution to the market. But can it replicate Nvidia's dominance?

Nvidia is a high standard to live up to

Nvidia's competition in the accelerated computing market is fairly slim. Advanced Micro Devices is an obvious competitor, but so are companies like Broadcom that partner directly with AI hyperscalers to make custom AI chips. Still, Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are at the top of the option list when outfitting a data center with computing hardware. However, that's pretty much it for competition.

Quantum computing is vastly different. Because we're in the early stages of quantum computing development, there are countless companies competing for market share. There are other pure plays, like Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum, as well as some legacy players like Alphabet and Microsoft. All of these companies are striving to reach viable quantum computing status as fast as they can, and whoever gets there first will carve out a first-mover advantage, similar to what OpenAI has done with ChatGPT in generative AI.

The beginnings of IonQ and Nvidia offer a stark contrast, as Nvidia created its GPU to process gaming graphics -- a fairly uncontested field. This allowed Nvidia's first product to flop, then it iterated to make a better solution. Eventually, Nvidia's GPUs became good enough to be used for other computing tasks, like engineering simulations and cryptocurrency mining. IonQ doesn't have that luxury. Its first products need to be its best, as there is no room for error in this fierce competitive landscape.

Another facet of Nvidia's business is its dominance. One estimate points to Nvidia's share of data center GPUs hovering around 90%. That dominance level, especially when you consider that Nvidia's products have a premium over their rivals, is absolutely incredible. It will be very hard for IonQ to achieve that level of dominance, especially with the fierce competition it's facing between scrappy start-ups and legacy tech companies with nearly unlimited resources.

The reality is, IonQ will have a very difficult time duplicating Nvidia's business model. However, there is one path that could make it possible.

IonQ is pursuing a unique quantum computing technology

There isn't just one way to perform a quantum calculation. There are multiple avenues that companies can pursue in quantum technology, but not all of them will work out in the end. The most popular strategy, by far, is superconducting. This technique is used by a few pure plays and by many of the legacy tech companies. There are benefits and drawbacks of this technique, but one of the biggest hurdles superconducting is tackling is accuracy. Right now, quantum computers aren't that accurate, and superconducting methods haven't proven to be largely successful by this measure.

IonQ uses a trapped-ion technique, which yields far superior accuracy. IonQ holds the world record for the most accurate quantum computer, and it's over 10 times as accurate as the best superconducting quantum computer. That may be an impossible challenge for its competition to overcome, which could allow it to match Nvidia's business model.

IonQ becoming the next Nvidia is far from a surefire bet. However, if IonQ can produce a superior computing system and reach an acceptable accuracy threshold, it's possible that IonQ could become the Nvidia of quantum computing. If it does, then the stock could skyrocket higher over the next decade.

Shares of computer hardware and IT solutions company Dell (NYSE:DELL) fell 5.3% in the morning session after Morgan Stanley downgraded its view on the IT hardware industry to 'cautious' and an analyst from the firm lowered the price target on Dell's stock.

The investment bank warned of a 'perfect storm' for the sector, citing slowing enterprise demand, rising component costs, and rich valuations. According to a Morgan Stanley survey, corporate hardware spending budgets were expected to see minimal growth. Specifically for Dell, an analyst at the firm maintained an 'Underweight' rating but cut the price target to $111 from $113. The negative sentiment was widespread, with other hardware stocks like HP Inc and Hewlett Packard Enterprise also falling. Broader market weakness also added to the pressure, as investors reacted to new tariff threats.

The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Dell? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.

What Is The Market Telling Us

Dell’s shares are very volatile and have had 21 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago when the stock gained 2.9% on the news that analyst firm Barclays upgraded its rating on the stock to Overweight from Equal Weight, pointing to strong orders for the company's Artificial Intelligence (AI) servers.

The bank expressed growing confidence in Dell's position in the AI server space and noted improving opportunities in enterprise server and storage markets. The upgrade was driven primarily by stronger-than-expected demand for its AI-focused hardware. Barclays kept its price target on the shares at $148.

Dell is down 10.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $114.12 per share, it is trading 30.8% below its 52-week high of $164.88 from October 2025.

IBM’s The Enterprise in 2030 study finds quantum computing is expected to reshape industry by the end of the decade, but most enterprises are not preparing for its adoption, creating a strategic gap that could leave even AI-advanced organizations exposed.

While 59% of surveyed executives believe quantum-enabled AI will transform their industry by 2030, only 27% expect their organizations to be using quantum computing, a disconnect IBM describes as a strategic miscalculation rather than a timing issue.

The report positions quantum as a complementary technology that will integrate gradually into hybrid classical-AI workflows, with early enterprise use cases already emerging in areas such as drug discovery and financial optimization.

IBM expects quantum computing to reshape industry by 2030, yet most enterprises are not preparing to use it — a gap that the company’s experts warn could leave even AI-advanced organizations exposed to the next major computing shift.

That warning sits at the center of The Enterprise in 2030, a study from the IBM Institute for Business Value, which surveyed more than 2,000 senior executives across 33 geographies and 23 industries in late 2025. The report’s central finding is not that quantum computing is imminent, but that it is inevitable — and that corporate strategy is lagging that reality.

According to the study, 59% of executives believe quantum-enabled artificial intelligence (AI) will transform their industry by the end of the decade. Yet only 27% expect their organizations to be using quantum computing in any capacity by that time. IBM characterizes the gap as a strategic miscalculation rather than a technology timing issue, arguing that companies focused narrowly on AI risk missing a deeper shift in how computation itself evolves.

“Quantum will never stand alone,” said Dr. Thomas Eckl, chief expert at Bosch, in the report. Classical computing, AI and quantum must work together in connected workflows.”

The study positions quantum computing not as a replacement for today’s systems, but as a complementary tool designed to handle classes of problems that strain even the most advanced classical computers — particularly optimization, simulation and probabilistic analysis. Those capabilities, IBM argues, will increasingly matter as AI systems grow more complex and data-hungry.

Readiness Gap — Strategic Consequences

IBM’s researchers frame quantum computing as the fifth and most underappreciated of five forces shaping the enterprise by 2030, following competitive pressure, productivity reinvestment, tailored AI models and the limits of automation. Unlike earlier waves of enterprise technology, the report suggests quantum’s impact will be indirect at first, most likely appearing inside hybrid workflows rather than as standalone systems.

However, the survey data show a disconnect with many executives treating quantum as a distant research topic rather than a planning priority. While nearly six in 10 respondents expect quantum-enabled AI to reshape their industry, fewer than three in 10 expect to deploy quantum tools themselves.

IBM describes that mismatch as unusual compared with prior technology transitions. In areas such as cloud computing and cybersecurity, adoption expectations and readiness tended to move together. With quantum, belief has outpaced preparation, according to the report.

The risk is not that companies will miss an early advantage, but that they will fail to adapt when quantum capabilities begin affecting markets indirectly — through supply chains, financial systems, drug discovery pipelines and national infrastructure.

“Quantum has the potential to accelerate computing — and to unlock use cases beyond the abilities of even today’s most powerful high-performance computers,” the study states.

IBM does not predict a single moment when quantum computing “arrives.” Instead, it describes a gradual integration process similar to how GPUs and specialized AI chips entered enterprise systems. IBM sees quantum arriving first as accelerators for narrow tasks, then as core components of broader platforms.

From Lab to Enterprise

To counter skepticism that quantum computing remains purely theoretical, the report covers several real-world deployments already underway inside large organizations.

One of the most detailed examples comes from Moderna, which has been applying quantum algorithms to problems in mRNA design. The challenge, according to the study, lies in predicting how strands of messenger RNA fold, a problem with an astronomically large number of possible configurations.

“Our goal is to improve human health,” said Alexey Galda, associate scientific director of quantum algorithms and applications at Moderna. “We believe it’s critical to explore every available tool — including quantum computing — to scale our progress today, rather than wait for the technology to fully mature.”

IBM reports that Moderna has used quantum systems involving up to 80 qubits to model mRNA secondary structures, surpassing prior limits in the field. The company also applied its approach to larger optimization problems using as many as 156 qubits and 950 non-local gates, with results matching those of commercial classical solvers.

The IBM team reports that the significance is not that quantum outperformed classical methods, but that it performed comparably on problems previously considered impractical for quantum systems. That parity suggests quantum computing is beginning to move from academic experimentation toward targeted enterprise workloads.

The report also cites early quantum experimentation in financial services, including a quantum-enabled algorithmic trading demonstration conducted by HSBC. In finance, where optimization and risk assessment are central, IBM suggests quantum tools may be adopted earlier than in sectors focused primarily on transactional processing.

To be clear, these examples are presented as signals rather than proof. IBM repeats throughout the report that quantum computing will not replace classical systems, nor will it deliver broad productivity gains on its own. Its value lies in addressing narrow bottlenecks that compound across complex systems.

AI Strategy not Enough

IBM calls particular attention in the report to organizations that view AI investment as sufficient preparation for the next decade. While AI dominates executive agendas — with 79% of respondents saying it will significantly contribute to revenue by 2030 — IBM argues that AI’s growth will increase demand for new forms of computation rather than reduce it.

As AI models become larger and more specialized, they generate optimization problems that classical systems struggle to solve efficiently. Quantum computing, IBM suggests, offers a way to handle those challenges without relying solely on brute-force scaling.

“By 2030, insight will be everywhere,” said Chad Gates, managing director at Pronto Software, in the report. “Interfaces will be radically different and AI will act as the business intelligence system, decision engine and a participant in operations.”

IBM’s analysis suggests that quantum computing’s most immediate role will be as an accelerator for AI-driven workflows. In other words, quantum will improve training, optimization and simulation rather than replacing existing infrastructure. That framing positions quantum readiness as part of AI governance and architecture decisions being made today.

The report also links quantum preparedness to cybersecurity, particularly as post-quantum cryptography standards move closer to adoption. While cybersecurity does not rank as a top executive priority for 2030 in the survey, IBM describes it as a “table stakes” capability that must evolve alongside emerging technologies.

In that context, quantum computing becomes less about competitive advantage and more about systemic resilience.

Plan for Inevitability, not Immediacy

IBM stops short of urging companies to deploy quantum hardware immediately. Instead, it argues that enterprises should treat quantum the way they once treated cloud computing before mass adoption. It should begin building skills, partnerships and governance frameworks sooner, rather than later.

The study calls for organizations to experiment with hybrid workflows that combine classical computing, AI and quantum tools, even if those quantum components remain small. It also urges leaders to monitor quantum developments as part of strategic risk management rather than innovation scouting.

This framing reflects the report’s broader thesis: that the enterprise of 2030 will be defined less by any single technology than by how organizations integrate multiple systems into adaptable architectures.

Competitive advantage in 2030 will come from innovation rather than resource optimization, a statement in the report that most — 64% — of the experts who were polled .

IBM’s researchers conclude that quantum computing fits that pattern. According to IBM, its impact will likely emerge unevenly, first benefiting organizations that have already mapped where advanced computation could unlock value.

According to the report, those that wait for clarity may find that the shift arrives embedded in markets and supply chains rather than announced in product launches.",https://thequantuminsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-9.59.57-AM-1.png,N,,2026-01-20 12:05:07.697488

Cyber risks vary and can be discussed in several sections within 10-K filings, including risk factors and management’s discussion and analysis.
Companies should also steer away from “AI washing,” a concern that businesses’ disclosures don’t actually match their use or risks, he added.","Companies are gearing up to disclose emerging cyber risks in upcoming financial reports to the Trump administration’s SEC as rapidly evolving artificial intelligence spawns new threats.

While Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins has shifted the agency away from Biden-era climate and environmental, social, and governance initiatives, lawyers still are bracing for the Wall Street regulator’s continued scrutiny of corporate cybersecurity as it stresses disclosure of material information that could affect investors’ decision-making.

Publicly-traded companies crafting their approach for SEC filings—from Form 10-K annual reports to breach disclosures—face a new challenge: providing specific details about cyber threats tied to AI in real time as they work to understand emerging tools’ risks. They’re also on high alert for how the SEC will tackle cyber enforcement after the agency in November dropped a case against business software firm SolarWinds Corp. that cyber executives and attorneys broadly criticized as an overreach by the Biden administration.

“It wasn’t a complete retreat, but through that action and some of the other actions that the SEC has taken, it seems like they’re taking a step back from being ‘cyber auditor,’ but not taking a step back from being the enforcer of accurate disclosures around cybersecurity,” said Ilona Cohen, chief legal and policy officer at HackerOne, a security solutions provider.

Ahead of March deadlines for many companies to file their 10-Ks, businesses will juggle spelling out new AI risks with the SEC’s emphasis on materiality. The agency on Jan. 13 called for recommendations on how corporate disclosures could be curtailed to focus on details reasonable investors deem important.

The SEC signals that “you have to get your house in order and understand these risks so that you can articulate them and talk about them if they are material to you,” said Frank Esposito, partner at Squire Patton Boggs who advises boards of directors and in-house legal teams on governance and securities issues.

The SEC declined to comment on what the agency is looking for from companies when reviewing disclosures related to AI and cybersecurity in 10-Ks covering 2025.

10-K Strategy

The use of AI is growing so ubiquitous that, for many companies, it’s worth considering SEC disclosure, said Michelle Reed, co-chair of Paul Hastings LLP’s data privacy and cybersecurity group. How they’re using it internally or leveraging it as part of their cyber defense shapes those details.

“There’s no question that that is a huge discussion point on every 10-K that we’ve done so far this year,” Reed said.

Cyber risks vary and can be discussed in several sections within 10-K filings, including risk factors and management’s discussion and analysis. In its 10-K, information technology company HP Inc. said it was bracing for an increase in sophisticated cyber attacks because of AI. Broadcom Inc., which supplies infrastructure software solutions, in December flagged AI-powered cyber attacks relying on deep fakes as an area of risk for the company.

The companies didn’t respond to requests to comment on their SEC filings.

Tailoring the disclosure to the specific company and the systems it uses will provide useful information for investors and mitigate the risk of comment letters from SEC staff seeking further information, according to Debevoise & Plimpton LLP corporate partner Eric Juergens.

“You could easily draft a risk factor or some disclosure that would apply to 95% of the companies out there—but that doesn’t really tell an investor all that much,” Juergens said.

Companies should also steer away from “AI washing,” a concern that businesses’ disclosures don’t actually match their use or risks, he added.

As companies enter the final stretch of 10-K preparation, Anthony Bonaguro, partner in Grant Thornton Advisors LLC’s CFO advisory services, said he expects to see some “waiting a bit” to file their reports closer to deadline to see how others are approaching disclosures.

Talking Cyber

While cybersecurity lawyers say they expect less aggressive enforcement from Atkins’ SEC, they still advise companies to be on watch for enforcement of accurate and timely disclosures of material cyber incidents, which companies are supposed to report in 8-K filings for material events. The SEC hasn’t rolled back Biden-era 2023 cyber incident disclosure rules, which aim to give investors timely disclosure of hacks.

Determining the materiality of cyber incidents as they unfold will be a core focus for companies this year.

A ransomware attack, for example, may not always be material depending on a company’s size, balance sheet, and ability to withstand it, Paul Hastings’ Reed said. This means businesses should be documenting how they assessed an incident’s materiality ahead of regulatory probes.

“The SEC will be focused on what I call and what many commentators call ‘bread-and-butter’ securities enforcement issues and a failure to disclose a material cyber incident entirely is always going to be seen as ‘bread-and-butter,’” said Haimavathi Marlier, co-chair of Morrison & Foerster LLP’s fintech and securities enforcement practices and former SEC senior trial counsel.

The agency formed the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit in February 2025 to ferret out cyber-related misconduct and monitor companies’ compliance with cyber regulations, among other priorities.

It’s unclear where the 2023 disclosure rules rank in the unit’s priorities. The group is leveraging its staff’s “substantial fintech and cyber-related experience” to combat fraud and protect investors, the SEC said when it formed the unit.

“Again another signal that they’re primarily focused on accurate disclosures,” HackerOne’s Cohen said of the new unit. “And I will be paying attention to what they’re up to and what their plans are.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/85fa8d6/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4c%2F14%2Fe84c8bf04bc7a2328c2829ce89ba%2Fbli-hp-and-broadcom-tear-away-cover.png,N,,2026-01-20 12:05:03.698659

Under the definitive agreement, Adobe will pay $12 per share, representing a premium of roughly 77.5 percent over Semrush’s last closing price before the announcement.

Adobe plans to fold Semrush into its Digital Experience business, alongside Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Analytics, and to connect it to the recently introduced Adobe Brand Concierge. The company says this combination will help marketers understand how their brands appear across owned channels, large language models, traditional search and the wider web.

As generative AI becomes a new interface between customers and brands, marketers are beginning to treat generative engine optimisation (GEO) as a complement to search engine optimisation (SEO).

“Brand visibility is being reshaped by gen AI, and brands that do not embrace this new opportunity risk losing relevance and revenue,” said Anil Chakravarthy, president of Adobe’s Digital Experience Business. “With Semrush, we are unlocking GEO for marketers as a new growth channel alongside their SEO, driving more visibility, customer engagement and conversions across the ecosystem.”

The two boards have approved the transaction. Adobe has also secured voting commitments from Semrush’s founders and other shareholders representing more than 75 percent of Semrush’s voting power to support the deal.

A Semrush shareholder meeting to vote on the merger has been scheduled for 3 February 2026. If approved and regulatory clearances are obtained, closing is expected in the first half of 2026.

Semrush’s platform is widely used for SEO, competitive research and online visibility tracking. In its most recent quarter, the company reported enterprise annual recurring revenue growth of 33 percent year on year, and it counts Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and TikTok among its customers.

“Adobe is an industry leader in helping marketers create personalised customer experiences at scale,” said Bill Wagner, chief executive of Semrush. “With the advent of LLMs and AI-driven search, brands need to understand where and how their customers are engaging in these new channels.”

Adobe says most Fortune 100 companies rely on its software to apply AI within their workflows, naming The Coca-Cola Company, General Motors and IBM among customers. It argues that integrating Semrush’s GEO and SEO capabilities will provide marketers with a single view of brand visibility across search, LLMs and owned channels.

Regulatory assessment will include review under the US Hart-Scott-Rodino process and scrutiny in other jurisdictions, including the UK and EU, given Adobe’s scale in digital experience software. Both parties said the merger remains subject to customary conditions. Adobe abandoned a proposed Figma acquisition in 2023 following regulatory opposition, which makes the timetable for this transaction a focus for investors.

Adobe has positioned Brand Concierge at the centre of its agentic AI strategy, describing it as an application that turns brand content into conversational experiences across digital touchpoints. The company has pointed to Adobe Analytics data showing a sharp rise in traffic to US retail sites from generative AI sources, underscoring why discoverability beyond traditional search is now a priority.

Cash consideration will be funded from Adobe’s balance sheet and operating cash flow.

Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is acting as legal adviser to Adobe. Centerview Partners LLC is serving as exclusive financial adviser to Semrush, and Davis Polk & Wardwell is its legal adviser.

Mr Wagner concluded: “The combination of Adobe and Semrush provides marketers more insights and capabilities to increase their discoverability across today’s evolving digital landscape.”

In addition, higher R&D and restructuring spend may constrain earnings leverage, raising the risk that dividend growth slows if operational momentum does not improve.","Medtech is in an exciting place right now.

Artificial intelligence (AI), predictive monitoring, digital twin simulations and robotics are all driving rapid innovation across the sector.

R&D activity is set to expand, both at established firms and startups with potentially disruptive technologies, particularly those leveraging complex data, real-time analytics, edge computing and edge AI.

Regulatory frameworks are also evolving. In February 2026, the FDA will replace its decades-old Quality System Regulation with a modernized Quality Management System Regulation.

In Europe, meanwhile, the EU’s AI Act and European Health Data Space Regulation will push the sector toward greater transparency.

Medtronic [MDT] is at the forefront of many of these developments.

Founded in 1949 as a medical electronics repair shop in Minnesota, it pioneered cardiac pacemakers, insulin pumps and advanced surgical systems, expanding through innovation and acquisitions. Over decades, Medtronic has grown into a diversified healthcare giant, spanning cardiovascular, diabetes, neurological and surgical technologies worldwide.

The firm’s Q2 results, released in November 2025, beat expectations.

Revenue rose 6.6% to $9bn, led by a 10.8%% surge in cardiovascular sales — the firm’s best outside the Covid-19 pandemic in over a decade. Cardiac ablation grew 71% year-over-year, with the Affera pulsed field ablation system doubling its install base.

The company raised full-year guidance, lifting revenue growth to 5.5% and EPS to $5.62–5.66.

MDT stock climbed steeply following the results, although it has dipped since then. It is up 16.02% over the past 12 months as of the January 16 close.

Going into 2026, commentators and investors alike are buoyant about Medtronic’s prospects.

Medium-term Tailwinds for MDT Stock

In May 2025, Medtronic said it would spin off its diabetes unit into a standalone, publicly listed company, with the deal expected to close by year-end 2026 based on management’s guidance.

The rationale for this move is compelling, and a number of commentators have expressed approval.

Principally, Medtronic has struggled to keep up with rivals in key areas of diabetes care, notably continuous glucose monitoring, while facing intensifying competition in insulin pumps. In addition, diabetes is also the group’s only direct-to-consumer business and delivers materially lower operating margins than its other divisions.

Exiting the unit will sharpen Medtronic’s focus on higher-margin B2B segments and could help unlock more profitable, sustainable growth.

Elsewhere, in December 2025, Medtronic secured US regulatory clearance for Hugo, its robotic-assisted surgery system, initially for urologic procedures. While the approval is unlikely to drive near-term revenue growth, it opens a significant long-term opportunity. Robotic surgery remains underpenetrated despite clear advantages in minimally invasive care. Although competition is intense, growing shipments and expanded indications should allow Hugo to become a meaningful contributor over time.

The company has also announced it will be making acquisitions as it looks to expand and diversify its portfolio.

At the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco earlier in January, executives said the firm has “significant firepower” to pursue acquisitions.

The company is focused on tuck-in deals, particularly in cardiology and neuroscience, with a preference for assets that are early stage or close to commercialization, according to CEO Geoff Martha.

CFO Thierry Piéton said Medtronic’s balance sheet provides ample flexibility to complete a “meaningful number” of transactions without putting pressure on its finances. He added that the company is re-accelerating its M&A activity after a quieter period, while stressing that Medtronic’s dividend policy remains unchanged.

Management is targeting acquisitions in the low- to mid-single-digit billions of dollars, Reuters reported, aiming to complement internal R&D rather than replace it. To speed execution, Medtronic has also established a new board-level committee focused on dealmaking.

In parallel to this, the company has pursued various collaborations, including a recently announced partnership with Precision Neuroscience to integrate its StealthStation surgical platform with Precision’s Layer 7 brain-computer interface.

Medtech Leaders: MDT vs BSX vs SYK

Let’s see how Medtronic measures up against two leading peers in the space.

Boston Scientific [BSX] specializes in minimally invasive interventional devices across cardiovascular, neurovascular, urology and endoscopy segments. The company has delivered double-digit organic revenue growth and expanded margins through innovation and strategic acquisitions, including a recent $14.5bn deal for Penumbra [PEN] to bolster its cardiovascular portfolio. Boston Scientific focuses on high-growth procedural markets rather than broad device categories and, with a $130.61bn market cap, slightly outstrips Medtronic in terms of size.

Stryker Corporation [SYK], meanwhile, leads in orthopedics and surgical systems, including robotic-assisted surgery with its Mako platform, as well as neurotechnology and emergency care equipment. Its revenue growth and profitability are underpinned by strong product demand, recurring implant volumes and innovation in surgical tools. Stryker also offers a dividend, appealing to income-oriented investors. At $139.12bn, its market cap is the largest of the three.

Here go the three firms’ current fundamentals.

Source: Yahoo Finance

Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Stryker represent a scale spectrum within medtech.

Medtronic stands at the broadest end, with diversified revenue streams across chronic care, surgical and device segments, generating scale, steady cash flows and resilience to cyclicality. Its extensive portfolio and global reach position it as a core medtech holding with moderate growth and strong fundamentals.

Boston Scientific sits in the mid-growth tier, with a sharper focus on procedural and interventional devices. It has delivered robust organic growth and margin expansion through innovation and bolt-on acquisitions, though its earnings are somewhat more sensitive to procedure volumes and integration risk from recent deals.

Stryker excels in orthopedics and surgical robotics, combining above-average growth with attractive margins and shareholder returns including dividends. Its fundamentals reflect strong product demand and pricing power in elective and trauma procedures.

Collectively, the three offer diversified exposure across medtech’s core growth drivers with varying risk-return profiles.

Conclusion: The Investment Case for MDT Stock

The Bull Case for Medtronic

Medtronic stands out as a compelling option for income-focused investors. The healthcare group has raised its dividend for 48 consecutive years and currently offers a forward yield of around 3%. It is on course to achieve Dividend King status — defined as 50 straight years of dividend growth — within the next few years, with a strong likelihood of sustaining dividend increases well beyond that milestone. This income appeal is reinforced by Medtronic’s resilient free cash flow generation, investment-grade balance sheet and diversified end markets, which collectively underpin dividend durability across economic cycles.

The Bear Case for Medtronic

Despite its defensive appeal, Medtronic faces several headwinds. Organic growth has lagged faster-growing medtech peers, while execution challenges in diabetes and cardiac devices have weighed on margins. Ongoing pricing pressure, rising input costs and regulatory scrutiny could limit near-term profitability. In addition, higher R&D and restructuring spend may constrain earnings leverage, raising the risk that dividend growth slows if operational momentum does not improve.",https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/med_2225143489_1200px.jpg_medium.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 11:11:56.303388

Company Overview

With roots dating back to 1863 and a presence across 26 states primarily in the Midwest and West, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) is one of America's largest banks providing lending, deposit services, wealth management, payment processing, and merchant services to individuals and businesses.

Sales Growth

From lending activities to service fees, most banks build their revenue model around two income sources. Interest rate spreads between loans and deposits create the first stream, with the second coming from charges on everything from basic bank accounts to complex investment banking transactions. Regrettably, U.S. Bancorp’s revenue grew at a sluggish 4.4% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This fell short of our benchmark for the banking sector and is a rough starting point for our analysis.

We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within financials, a half-decade historical view may miss recent interest rate changes, market returns, and industry trends. U.S. Bancorp’s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its revenue was flat over the last two years. Note: Quarters not shown were determined to be outliers, impacted by outsized investment gains/losses that are not indicative of the recurring fundamentals of the business.

This quarter, U.S. Bancorp reported year-on-year revenue growth of 5.1%, and its $7.37 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 0.6%.

Net interest income made up 58.6% of the company’s total revenue during the last five years, meaning U.S. Bancorp’s growth drivers strike a balance between lending and non-lending activities.

Our experience and research show the market cares primarily about a bank’s net interest income growth as non-interest income is considered a lower-quality and non-recurring revenue source.

Tangible Book Value Per Share (TBVPS)

Banks are balance sheet-driven businesses because they generate earnings primarily through borrowing and lending. They’re also valued based on their balance sheet strength and ability to compound book value (another name for shareholders’ equity) over time.

When analyzing banks, tangible book value per share (TBVPS) takes precedence over many other metrics. This measure isolates genuine per-share value by removing intangible assets of debatable liquidation worth. Traditional metrics like EPS are helpful but face distortion from M&A activity and loan loss accounting rules.

U.S. Bancorp’s TBVPS grew at a tepid 3.7% annual clip over the last five years. However, TBVPS growth has accelerated recently, growing by 16.7% annually over the last two years from $21.37 to $29.12 per share.

Over the next 12 months, Consensus estimates call for U.S. Bancorp’s TBVPS to grow by 8.7% to $31.67, paltry growth rate.

Key Takeaways from U.S. Bancorp’s Q4 Results

It was encouraging to see U.S. Bancorp beat analysts’ tangible book value per share expectations this quarter. We were also happy its net interest income narrowly outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this print had some key positives.

PE Deals data is for announced or completed deals where a Canadian company is the target, as of December 31, 2025.","The private equity industry went in a number of different directions in 2025. Global dealmaking value picked up in the second half of the year but the number of deals decreased. PE exits declined year-over-year, boosting growth in alternative strategies to generate liquidity. Investors remain committed to PE according to Preqin's latest investor survey, despite exercising greater caution in short-term commitments. Macroeconomic conditions improved markedly as the year went on, after a turbulent and unexpected start.

In this edition of the Bennett Jones PE Briefing, we look at the full-year data on private equity activity in Canada in 2025 as well as:

how 2025 unfolded and what to look for in the coming year

PE exit activity and what to expect in 2026

trends in GP-stakes investing

The PE Market in 2025 and Looking Ahead

Private equity dealmakers are looking ahead to renewed growth in activity following an upswing in global transaction values during H2 2025. The third quarter was particularly buoyant with US$376.3 billion in aggregate deal value, according to Preqin. This was the best three-month tally since Q1 2022. In November, the CVCA reported the Canadian private equity market had a record-setting third quarter in 2025.

Several segments of private equity stood out with highly active years in 2025, including secondaries. The global secondary market volume now exceeds US$160 billion and fundraising is headed for another banner year. This is driven in large part by a soft PE exit environment. The flow of capital into secondaries stands in contrast to a weak fundraising environment overall in the PE industry.

The private credit market in Canada has grown to become a core allocation for institutional investors and has been a sharp area of focus in 2025. Private credit strategies have delivered outsized returns and the asset class is expected to continue growing—as deals become structurally more complex.

Leveraged buyouts were on the rise in 2025, spurred by private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds, and this is expected to continue into the new year. S&P Global data shows that PE's share of leveraged buyouts has been increasing since 2023.

The pace of exits continues to be one of the biggest challenges for PE firms. As the Wall Street Journal describes it, ""Private equity has more housecleaning to do in 2026. Recent deals boosted optimism for the new year, but firms are still sitting on a glut of portfolio companies.""

What to Expect in Exit Activity

Globally, private equity exit volume remains subdued, but average exit size increased in 2025, according to Preqin data. In Canada, PE exits continued to decline in 2025 by deal count. The aggregate value of announced or completed deals decreased in 2025, after rising from 2022-2024.

The outlook for PE exits in 2026 remains cautiously balanced between optimism and restraint. Reasons for optimism in 2026 include lower interest rates, continued pressure for exits from LPs and a reopening of the IPO window (as well as a renewed bullish sentiment in the capital markets generally), in the United States. Globally, the IPO market had its best year since 2022, according to Dealogic. The IPO market in Canada remains in a drought, however, with de-listings and companies taken private continuing to outpace IPOs on the TSX and TSXV.

Although high-quality assets are in demand for exits, valuation gaps continue to persist for many companies. PE assets nearing maturity are expected to exit at a slower pace. While the global economic picture has improved, uneven growth and ""K-shaped"" recoveries for certain sectors compared to others may continue. All of this could lead to a patchy recovery across the PE landscape. Preqin says that for now, it sees only tentative signs of a recovery in exit volumes.

GP-Stakes Investing

GP-stakes investing involves the sale of a minority, generally non-voting ownership interest in a GP entity by an asset manager to another investor. Historically, such transactions were undertaken almost exclusively by existing LPs seeking deeper alignment with the asset manager. A notable early example is the CalPERS 2001 acquisition of a minority interest in The Carlyle Group for approximately US$175 million.

Over the past decade, the buyer landscape has shifted. Specialized investment vehicles, commonly known as GP‑stakes funds, have emerged as the dominant acquirers of these interests. While a GP‑stakes investor may, in certain cases, be required to fund its pro rata share of the GP’s capital commitment and receive a corresponding limited partnership interest, the primary objective of GP-stakes funds is to capture returns linked to their share of GP economics, principally management fees and, when realized, carried interest. An early illustration of this evolution occurred when Affiliated Managers Group, a publicly traded asset manager known for acquiring GP-stakes, purchased a minority equity position from Goldman Sachs’ Petershill Fund I for approximately US$800 million. Since then, the strategy has continued to accelerate. There were US$3.4 billion of GP-stakes deals globally in 2024, the highest level since the record year of 2021, according to PitchBook data.

Although Canada has yet to see the emergence of funds dedicated exclusively to GP stakes investing, the model offers compelling opportunities for both GPs and LPs. For GPs, selling a minority, non voting stake can provide long awaited liquidity for employees, and some GPs also use the sale proceeds to strengthen their management team or facilitate succession planning. GP-stakes opportunities may also serve as incentives used to attract lead LPs. For LPs, acquiring a stake in the GP enhances alignment with the manager, and any carried interest realized can meaningfully offset overall fee expenses associated with investing in the fund. In this sense, GP stakes continues to evolve from a niche structuring solution into a recognized asset class, joining the ranks of private equity, real estate, secondaries, infrastructure, and other established alternatives.

Canadian PE Activity

Total Canadian private equity deal value was up and deal count was down in the final quarter of 2025. Fewer deals were done last year than in 2024 and the total value for announced or completed transactions declined from US$59.8 billion to US$48.3 billion in 2025.

Add-ons were the most common type of transactions—156 Canadian PE deals used this strategy in 2025. Buyouts (27), growth (26) and LP direct (21) rounded out the top five. LP direct deals and corporate carve-outs saw more deals in 2025 than the previous year.

Looking Ahead

The mood of the Canadian and global private equity markets improved as we moved through 2025. Growing sectors such as technology (including the burgeoning AI and AI-adjacent sectors) and defense will continue to create dealmaking opportunities. The AI boom has been one of the biggest stories in years, with tens of billions of dollars being invested in data centres, large-scale energy and industrial infrastructure, and the sector’s picks-and-shovels suppliers.

Challenges remain for private equity in 2026. Delayed exits, aging assets and slower fundraising may hold the industry back from a full recovery. On the buy-side specifically, add-ons and roll-ups into existing portfolios should continue to improve as sponsors look for EBITDA expansion. Conversely, GPs will likely want to remain patient and disciplined before executing on new platform investments.

Instead, he tells me about the company’s plans to repurpose its spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) drug taldefgrobep alfa, which flunked a Phase III trial in late 2024, as a muscle-sparing drug for use alongside GLP-1s like Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy or Eli Lilly’s Zepbound. He specifically points to bimagrumab, for which Lilly paused a clinical trial last September.

“A lot of folks who don’t want to take GLP-1s are concerned about the muscle loss and the bone density effects,” Coric told BioSpace on the sidelines of the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. “The only thing that I think limited Lilly’s bimagrumab was the side effects. They had very high rates of side effects. We’re not seeing the side effects that Lilly ran into.” Notably, Lilly did not report a reason for pausing the bimagrumab trial in September.

Biohaven made a serendipitous discovery following the trial of taldefgrobep alfa for SMA—a neuromuscular disease that causes destruction of motor neurons; participants saw reduced weight and preservation of lean muscle and bone density while on the drug. Biohaven Is recruiting patients living with obesity or who are overweight for a Phase II study, which is set to complete in September 2026.

While the pivot is significant and the competition fierce, Coric appears undaunted. In fact, he seems only to see an opportunity.

Bimagrumab is an inhibitor that blocks activin type II receptors, preventing its inhibitory action on muscle growth while potentially causing side effects, Coric said, while taldefgrobep alfa uses a different mechanism of action to inhibit a different protein, myostatin, which itself regulates muscle size. “So we think we could deliver bimagrumab-like efficacy without the side effects. That’s a winning profile for a monotherapy.”

The Biohaven brand has had its successes. In 2022 Pfizer bought Biohaven Pharmaceutical for $11.6 billion, largely to acquire its successful migraine treatment program. Coric took a pipeline of experimental products from what remained and spun out a second company, Biohaven Ltd., trading under Biohaven Pharma’s original stock ticker.

The new company hasn’t yet been able to reproduce the original’s commercial achievements. When Biohaven’s spinocerebellar ataxia treatment troriluzole was rejected by the FDA in November 2025, the company also missed out on a $150 million payment from investment firm Oberland Capital. But Biohaven is resilient. The company went to Wall Street to raise more funds, seeking a $150 million public offering but ending up with $200 million.

Then, on January 7 just ahead of JPM, the investment firm Janus Henderson bought $125 million in shares of Biohaven. “That’s 10% of the company” Coric said. “We’re well capitalized.”

Coric’s confidence appears to stem from Biohaven’s diverse pipeline. He pointed repeatedly to BHV-1300, a protein degrader therapy for autoimmune conditions. That drug scored in March 2025 when it showed a deep reduction in IgG proteins after a four-week Phase I trial.

For all of this swagger, however, it seems Coric and Biohaven came to the conference with something to prove to the rest of the biopharma world. “I think coming into [JPM26], we wanted to make sure we were well-funded, we could show people our exciting data and focus on the degrader platform as the future.”

Despite the rollercoaster trajectory of the second iteration of Biohaven, Coric seems intent to keep the company running as its own entity—for the time being—although he is open to a potential buyout.

“I’m a firm believer you should run your company like you’re going to own it forever,” he said, “but if somebody comes in and gives you a good offer, you’ll always consider that, as we did for [Pfizer].”",https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/bb92b8c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4011x2256+201+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F9d%2F0c656e304f4ca2b8e793e50768ad%2Fistock-648692064.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:11:31.384536

The fourth quarter provision was $6 million (1.1%) higher than the third quarter of 2025 and $17 million (3%) higher than the fourth quarter of 2024.

USB Price Action: U.S. Bancorp shares were down 3.25% at $52.63 during premarket trading on Tuesday.","U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) stock fell on Tuesday after the lender reported fourth-quarter 2025 results.

The company reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, beating the analyst consensus estimate of $1.19. Quarterly sales of $7.337 billion outpaced the Street view of $7.308 billion.

The company’s provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter was $577 million, compared with $571 million in the third quarter of 2025 and $560 million in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The fourth quarter provision was $6 million (1.1%) higher than the third quarter of 2025 and $17 million (3%) higher than the fourth quarter of 2024.

The increase in provision expense year over year was primarily driven by loan portfolio growth, partially offset by lower net charge-offs.

Other Metrics

Net income rose 23.0% year over year to $2.045 billion.

Return on tangible common equity rose to 18.4%, while return on average assets increased to 1.19%. The efficiency ratio improved to 57.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2024.

The company delivered 440 basis points of positive operating leverage, adjusted for prior notable items. Net interest margin rose to 2.77%, up 6 basis points year over year and 2 basis points sequentially.

Noninterest expense remained relatively stable compared to the prior-year period. The CET1 capital ratio stood at 10.8% as of Dec. 31, 2025.

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis rose to $4.31 billion, up from $4.25 billion in the prior quarter and $4.18 billion a year earlier.

Average deposits rose to $515.1 billion from $511.8 billion in the third quarter, while average total loans increased to $384.3 billion from $379.2 billion in the prior quarter.

“Record consumer deposits this quarter and effective balance sheet remixing contributed to net interest income growth and margin expansion. Fee income exceeded our mid-single-digit growth target and was supported by broad strength across our diversified fee businesses,” said CEO Gunjan Kedia.

Important Highlights

U.S. Bancorp signed a definitive deal to buy BTIG, LLC, expanding its investment banking and trading platform. BTIG’s roughly 700 employees across 20 locations will join U.S. Bancorp, and current leadership will stay.

The company expects the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approvals.

U.S. Bank also completed a cross-border stablecoin pilot, signaling readiness for future compliant commercial offerings.

Outlook

U.S. Bancorp forecast fiscal 2026 revenue of $29.85 billion to $30.42 billion, compared with Wall Street expectations of $30.04 billion.

“Looking ahead to 2026, we remain committed to our strategic priorities and medium-term targets as these measures will continue to drive sustainable EPS growth and industry-leading returns,” Kedia added.

USB Price Action: U.S. Bancorp shares were down 3.25% at $52.63 during premarket trading on Tuesday. The stock is approaching its 52-week high of $56.19, according to Benzinga Pro data.

Quick Insights

Underperformance was mainly due to the fund's higher exposure to growth stocks and lower exposure to value, as value outperformed growth significantly during the quarter.

I maintain a constructive outlook but anticipate investors will favor cash-generative companies with sustainable earnings and durable competitive advantages after a year of strong returns.

Absence from the aerospace & defense industry and lagging healthcare holdings were key detractors, while technology and AI-related names contributed positively.

The marriage between Wingify and AB Tasty represents something of a Silicon Valley paradox.
The new company will operate under both the Wingify VWO and AB Tasty brands initially, maintaining separate product lines before gradually consolidating the platform over time.
Everstone will retain majority control and hold majority board rights, with a board structure of five to six seats including representation from Everstone, Gupta, and three to four independent directors.
Everstone's merger of Wingify and AB Tasty signals a clear bet that the future of digital optimization belongs to consolidated, AI-ready platforms rather than point solutions.","Private equity firm Everstone Capital just closed a major consolidation play in the digital optimization space, merging India's Wingify and France's AB Tasty into a single $100 million-plus revenue company. The move comes just one year after Everstone acquired a controlling stake in Wingify for $200 million, signaling an aggressive platform-building strategy aimed at competing head-to-head with players like Optimizely and Adobe.

The marriage between Wingify and AB Tasty represents something of a Silicon Valley paradox. Two rivals that have long operated in the same space - helping enterprises improve digital experiences through testing and personalization - are now joining forces under Everstone Capital's umbrella. It's a move that tells you a lot about where the market's heading and why pure-play startups are increasingly finding it hard to go alone.

Sparsh Gupta, Wingify's co-founder, will lead the combined entity as CEO. The new company will operate under both the Wingify VWO and AB Tasty brands initially, maintaining separate product lines before gradually consolidating the platform over time. Both businesses are profitable, a detail Gupta emphasized to underscore that this isn't a desperate fire sale but rather a calculated play to build something bigger.

""Both the businesses have been operating as friendly competition,"" Gupta told TechCrunch. The framing matters here - this is positioned as natural alignment rather than acquisition by necessity. The merger reflects what enterprises actually want: integrated, holistic platforms that don't require stitching together multiple vendors to cover testing, personalization, and feature delivery all in one place.

The numbers underscore the scale Everstone is assembling. The combined business will serve more than 4,000 customers globally, with roughly 90 percent of revenue coming from the US and Europe. We're talking about brands like Forbes, Walt Disney, Amway, L'Oréal, and Samsonite - enterprises across e-commerce, SaaS, travel, and media. Close to 800 employees will operate across 11 offices globally, with roughly 350 staff based outside India. The merged company will be headquartered in New Delhi.

Everstone is injecting ""significant additional capital"" into the deal beyond what was already committed when it acquired a majority stake in Wingify for $200 million in January 2025. Gupta described the fresh capital as primarily aimed at ""cleaning up"" AB Tasty's cap table - translation: paying off existing investors - and enabling the two businesses to operate as one. Financial terms weren't disclosed, though the structure includes cash and some equity rollover for existing leadership.

The executive team reflects the merging of two orgs. Alongside Gupta as CEO, Wingify co-founder Ankit Jain takes on Chief Product and Technology Officer duties. AB Tasty's co-founders - Rémi Aubert and Alix de Sagazan - become Chief Customer and Strategy Officer and Chief Revenue Officer respectively. Everstone will retain majority control and hold majority board rights, with a board structure of five to six seats including representation from Everstone, Gupta, and three to four independent directors.

Here's what's particularly noteworthy: there are no layoffs planned. Gupta framed this as ""value creation"" rather than cost-cutting, which is unusual for private equity deals but increasingly common in high-growth tech consolidations where scaling product matters more than cutting overhead.

The timing reflects a larger market shift. Enterprise SaaS M&A is on a tear. According to PitchBook data, the sector saw 270 deals worth $65 billion in Q3 alone, with deal volumes up 26.2 percent quarter-over-quarter and private equity accounting for 66.7 percent of those deals. Private equity firms have identified consolidation as a key value-creation strategy, and enterprise customers are increasingly demanding AI-ready, integrated platforms that can handle everything from A/B testing to personalization to feature flagging without vendor fragmentation.

This deal also positions Everstone to compete more directly against Optimizely, Adobe's experience cloud offerings, and other established players dominating the digital optimization category. By combining Wingify's 3,000-plus customer base with AB Tasty's 1,000-plus, Everstone gets instant scale and a deeper product suite. The focus now shifts to investing in AI capabilities - both companies have flagged this as a priority going forward - while maintaining the customer experience in the near term.

The deal is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, but expect this to close relatively quickly. Everstone's backing suggests it has a clear roadmap for the combined company, likely involving further bolt-on acquisitions, deeper AI integration, and aggressive expansion in specific verticals where the merged platform can offer unique value.

Everstone's merger of Wingify and AB Tasty signals a clear bet that the future of digital optimization belongs to consolidated, AI-ready platforms rather than point solutions. For enterprise customers tired of integrating multiple vendors, this deal means fewer technical headaches and more comprehensive capabilities. For the broader SaaS market, it's another data point confirming that private equity sees consolidation as the path to building defensible, scaled businesses that can compete against entrenched players like Adobe. Watch for Everstone to announce additional acquisitions or partnerships as it works to cement this new platform's position at the center of enterprise digital transformation.",https://charming-card-d91ad3487b.media.strapiapp.com/file_c47186ef9a.png,N,,2026-01-20 11:11:47.803926

If the case reaches trial, it would become the first non-settlement lawsuit targeting pharma with the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) pathway, normally reserved for mobsters.
Takeda previously agreed to a roughly $2.4 billion settlement with patients allegedly harmed by the drug.
Takeda declined to comment on the active litigation, and Lilly did not respond to an inquiry by the time of publication.
“I feel like it will induce a more open honest conversation with FDA [so drug companies can’t] be accused of any sort of deception,” James said.","A potentially paradigm-changing lawsuit targeting Eli Lilly and Takeda Pharmaceuticals has cleared a major hurdle and could wind up being decided in a courtroom. If the case reaches trial, it would become the first non-settlement lawsuit targeting pharma with the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) pathway, normally reserved for mobsters.

Wisner Baum, which filed the case, is chasing damages as high as $7 billion, alleging that the companies conspired to hide evidence their diabetes drug Actos was linked to a higher risk of bladder cancer to maintain blockbuster profits.

Takeda previously agreed to a roughly $2.4 billion settlement with patients allegedly harmed by the drug. But the law firm is leveraging a financial angle to seek more.

The key allegation being levied by a Minnesota-based union health fund, along with consumers in four states, is that the companies concealed evidence of adverse health risks from the public and the FDA. After the cancer link came to light and the FDA slapped a warning label on Actos in 2011, sales dropped by as much as 80%. Thus, prescriptions received — and paid for — before the warning label was attached led the plaintiffs to pay for more doses than they would have otherwise, said Harrison James, a senior associate attorney at Wisner Baum.

Takeda declined to comment on the active litigation, and Lilly did not respond to an inquiry by the time of publication.

The lawsuit, originally filed in 2014, cleared a major hurdle in November when a federal appeals court allowed the nationwide class action against Takeda and Lilly to move forward. But there are other barriers to clear before it makes it to trial.

The companies recently asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case, which could halt the litigation. An answer is expected this spring, James said. If the Supreme Court declines to hear it, the companies could still attempt to convince a lower court to decertify the case by presenting additional evidence, he said. The case could get a trial date as early as next year. The companies could also decide to settle, but James thinks it’s unlikely.

A broader impact?

If this case goes to trial, the legal fallout could have industrywide implications.

Some experts believe that using the RICO statute substantially increases the risks to drugmakers. In this case, attorneys are seeking what are known as treble damages, allowed under RICO, which triple the amount of compensatory damages.

But while some predicted the case would fling open the floodgates to similar lawsuits against pharma, that hasn’t happened yet, and probably won’t, James said.

“It’s not easy to win under this statute,” he explained.

Part of what could help the plaintiffs succeed in the case is that the alleged fraud was well documented, James added. Among the evidence presented so far were internal company documents and testimony from a safety consultant who said the companies were aware of cancer-related safety signals but didn’t disclose the information publicly.

“It’s a pretty high burden to succeed here. The facts were very, very strong to meet all the elements that we needed,” James said. “It’s not every day that a case like that falls into your lap.”

Even though the outcome may not expose pharma to a high risk of similar lawsuits, James hopes the case will encourage drug companies to be more transparent about risks.

“I feel like it will induce a more open honest conversation with FDA [so drug companies can’t] be accused of any sort of deception,” James said.

In this case, the companies allegedly participated in systemic concealment of risk.

“In my opinion, using the RICO tool is another avenue for redress when you do have really severe fraud like this to deter this sort of conduct from continuing to take place,” James said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/RVZV-bxihYYaJYdavQ1cZOPu9uFOMRDqsfoGt0pGNBE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS90YWtlZGFfRmoxZjg5by5qcGc=.webp,N,,2026-01-20 10:03:14.415816

""Folate receptor alpha in ovarian cancer tissue and patient serum is associated with disease burden and treatment outcomes.""","INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 20, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to sofetabart mipitecan (LY4170156) for the treatment of adult patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have received prior bevacizumab and mirvetuximab soravtansine, if eligible. Sofetabart mipitecan is a novel folate receptor alpha (FRα) antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that uses proprietary linker technology and an exatecan payload.

Breakthrough Therapy designation aims to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s).

""Platinum-resistant ovarian cancer remains one of the most challenging settings in gynecologic oncology, with limited treatment options and poor outcomes for patients,"" said Bhavana Pothuri, M.D., professor of Obstetrics/Gynecology and Medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health and director of Clinical Trials Office at the Perlmutter Cancer Center. ""The Breakthrough Therapy designation and preliminary clinical data for sofetabart mipitecan across all levels of FRα expression are encouraging and point to its potential as a meaningful treatment option for patients.""

""We are pleased the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for sofetabart mipitecan, reflecting the significant unmet need in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and the promising initial results shown in our Phase 1 study,"" said Jacob Van Naarden, executive vice president, and president of Lilly Oncology and head of corporate business development. ""Building on compelling results generated to date, we've initiated our Phase 3 FRAmework-01 trial with the goal of bringing a potential therapeutic option to patients with advanced ovarian cancer, across all levels of folate receptor expression.""

The FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation is based on encouraging preliminary results from the Phase 1a/b study. Lilly presented initial Phase 1 results at the 2025 ASCO Annual Meeting in June and updated data at the 2025 ESMO Congress in October, showing responses at all dose levels and across all FRα expression levels, including in patients who progressed on prior mirvetuximab soravtansine. These initial data also indicate a promising tolerability profile with low rates of interstitial lung disease, peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia, and no significant ocular toxicity.

Sofetabart mipitecan recently advanced into the Phase 3 FRAmework-01 study (NCT07213804), a global trial investigating the treatment as a monotherapy in patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer (PROC), and in combination with bevacizumab in patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (PSOC). Lilly is conducting the FRAmework-01 study in partnership with the European Network for Gynaecological Oncological Trial groups (ENGOT - lead groups GINECO/NOGGO e.V.), the GOG Foundation (GOG), and the Asia-Pacific Gynecologic Oncology Trials Group (APGOT)

About Ovarian Cancer

Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. While most patients initially respond to platinum-based chemotherapy, approximately 70% will experience recurrence, leading to progressively shorter remission periods with each subsequent treatment. When cancer recurs during or within six months of platinum therapy, known as platinum-resistant disease, patients face limited treatment options.

About Sofetabart Mipitecan

Sofetabart mipitecan (LY4170156) is composed of an Fc-silent, folate receptor alpha (FRα) specific humanized monoclonal antibody linked to exatecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, via a proprietary cleavable polysarcosine linker (PSARlink™). Sofetabart mipitecan was designed to target FRα across all expression levels with improved therapeutic index. FRα is a cell-surface glycoprotein encoded by the gene FOLR1 that binds to the essential nutrients folic acid and reduced folates, bringing them into cells to facilitate cell division and growth.1,2 FRα is overexpressed in many solid tumors such as ovarian, non-small cell lung, and colorectal cancers.1,3,4 Sofetabart mipitecan is currently being studied in patients with ovarian cancer as well as other FRα-expressing solid tumors, NCT06400472 and NCT07213804.

Wilson, who still owns about 4.3% of the company's shares, began a proxy campaign in December to nominate three independent directors. Though he isn't seeking a seat himself, he's made it clear that any compromise would require the departure of two long-serving directors including chair David Mussafer, who represents Advent.

For Wilson, the push appears personal as well as strategic. Advent has been tied to Lululemon since its early days, but Wilson has reportedly grown frustrated with the firm's influence and what he views as an uneven record in consumer-focused investments.

A sensitive time for corporate conflicts. Elliott Management, which bought a $1 billion stake in Lululemon, is also courting former Ralph Lauren CEO Jane Nielsen for a leadership post. This has sparked expectations of top-level company changes.

Caution for CIOs The flexibility offered by Enterprise Advantage could have its own set of tradeoffs for CIOs.
“If clients simply deploy Enterprise Advantage without building internal muscle, they’ll end up reliant on IBM’s platform for updates, extensions, and compliance maintenance.","IBM has launched a new consulting service named Enterprise Advantage, designed to help CIOs take their agentic and other AI applications from experimentation to large-scale production.

Enterprise Advantage is based on Consulting Advantage, IBM’s internal AI-powered delivery platform, which in turn combines the company’s consulting expertise and workflows used to transform its internal operations.

Consulting Advantage also includes a marketplace that houses industry‑specific AI agents and applications, which has been rolled into Enterprise Advantage.

Analysts say Enterprise Advantage could help enterprises more effectively build and scale agentic and other AI applications across complex, multi-cloud environments because the service is designed to operate independently of specific cloud providers, AI models, or underlying infrastructure.

This approach aligns with the fragmented and heterogeneous IT landscapes most large enterprises already run, as they need to be able to scale AI applications within the constraints of their current IT estates without having to rip and replace any layer or infrastructure, Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst at Greyhound Research.

Echoing Gogia’s views, Pareekh Jain, principal analyst at Pareekh Consulting, pointed out that large enterprises already have sunk costs in multiple clouds and multiple model choices.

In fact, Jain sees the new service helping enterprises reduce hyperscaler lock-in and offering more flexibility of choice when it comes to choosing a specific cloud vendor or their AI stack for building an agentic or AI application.

Caution for CIOs

The flexibility offered by Enterprise Advantage could have its own set of tradeoffs for CIOs.

While Enterprise Advantage’s cloud‑agnostic pitch does help enterprises avoid getting locked into hyperscaler‑specific agent platforms like AWS Bedrock Agents or Microsoft Copilot Studio, the dependency might shift to the orchestration layer, Jain pointed out.

“If companies build their agent workflows, governance rules, and orchestration logic entirely on IBM’s Enterprise Advantage framework, migrating to another provider later could become just as difficult,” Jain added.

Rather, CIOs should internally evaluate whether their enterprise has the talent and expertise to operate the frameworks and workflows that Enterprise Advantage provides because that’s the only way that they can avoid lock-in at the orchestration and service level, Gogia said.

“If clients simply deploy Enterprise Advantage without building internal muscle, they’ll end up reliant on IBM’s platform for updates, extensions, and compliance maintenance. This could replicate the same old outsourcing trap we’ve seen before,” Gogia added.

In fact, Jain pointed out that enterprises with at least some level of AI maturity should look at adopting the new service.

While firms with very limited AI talent may find a framework-led approach too complex and instead prefer fully managed SaaS solutions, highly tech-native companies tend to build their own orchestration layers to avoid service dependency and retain control, the analyst said.

“The real sweet spot is the enterprise middle, large organizations with capable IT teams but heavy backlogs, where developers can build agents but are slowed by security, governance, and infrastructure hurdles that IBM’s service can help remove,” Jain added. The service has been made generally available.",https://www.cio.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4119056-0-71746000-1768910633-IBM-building.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2026-01-20 11:11:42.680841

By utilizing this index, organizations can gain insights into operational efficiencies and undertake informed measures to improve their environmental impact.

Ecolab Inc. is a global leader in the production and marketing of cleaning and sanitation products for various sectors, including industrial manufacturing, hospitality, healthcare, and life sciences. The company offers a comprehensive range of products and services, such as dish and laundry washing systems, pest control, and infection control products. Ecolab also provides customized water management solutions, reinforcing its stronghold in the U.S. market while expanding internationally.

With a market capitalization of $78.48 billion, Ecolab operates within the Basic Materials sector, specifically in the Chemicals industry. The company's strategic initiatives and robust product offerings position it as a dominant player in its field.

Financial Health Analysis

Ecolab's financial performance reflects its strong market position and operational efficiency. The company reported a revenue of $15.89 billion, with a 3-year revenue growth rate of 7.6%. This growth is supported by a 17.57% operating margin and a 12.49% net margin, indicating effective cost management and profitability.

On the balance sheet front, Ecolab maintains a current ratio of 1.7 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.91, reflecting a stable financial structure. The company's return on equity stands at 21.94%, showcasing its ability to generate returns on shareholder investments.

However, there are warning signs to consider. The Altman Z-Score of 5.25 indicates strong financial health, but insider activity shows mixed signals with recent insider selling.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

Ecolab's valuation metrics suggest a premium market position. The company's P/E ratio is 39.81, while the P/S ratio is 4.98, both near historical highs. The P/B ratio of 8.07 also reflects a valuation close to its 3-year high.

Analyst sentiment remains positive, with a target price of $295.13 and a recommendation score of 2.2, indicating a ""Buy"" consensus. Technical indicators such as the RSI of 66.04 suggest the stock is approaching overbought territory.

Institutional ownership is robust at 80.66%, indicating strong confidence from large investors, while insider ownership is relatively low at 1.18%.

Risk Assessment

Ecolab's financial health is supported by a high Piotroski F-Score of 7, indicating a very healthy situation. The Beneish M-Score of -2.51 suggests the company is unlikely to be a manipulator.

Sector-specific risks include potential volatility in raw material prices and regulatory changes impacting the chemicals industry. The company's beta of 1.02 indicates moderate market volatility.

While Ecolab's strategic initiatives and financial metrics are strong, investors should remain vigilant of market conditions and sector-specific risks that could impact future performance.

why don’t i just take a day off?

it’s probably the mix between the love of tapping keys & hijacking minds...

and potential of helping young guys find value they need.

it’s a mix of both.

...which brings me to this...

obsession...

what is obsession...?

sure. everything could go right for you.

why wouldn’t it?

all you do is work/train/study

so, why do you still break promises to yourself?

because you don’t entirely believe it will work out.

you want to be rich, but you don’t believe you can.

honestly, you really don’t.

if you did, nothing could stop you from becoming that.

the mirror only smiles, when you do.

i smile. because i want to.

i really do.

that’s why i wake up with a grin on my face.

because i know it means i get to work on things i take deep interest in.

another day of being the best at everything i do.

& i love it.

thoroughly enjoying every second of the delusional belief that I’m better than my competition.

that’s what i wake up for.

never taking a day off...

there is still so much to get done.

the thought of not having a fully specced out mercedes, a plethora of divine females & a body of a greek god...

brings a spike of anxiety and stress...

yet... most guys won’t achieve it... until 65.

that is... if there are not dead yet.

hellish.

so, what am I so anxious about?

it doesn’t mean i won’t fail.

if i put brakes on. take a slow & steady approach.

they’ll be plenty of mfers who would love to take my spot.

business is a never ending game.

and the number of guys who want to compete with me... only grows.

but, i don’t understand it anymore...

who can compete with someone who treats life as art. obsessed with how every brush stroke brings something new to life...

i simply don’t think you can.

& this is still the reality...

you plant a seed...

the fruit doesn’t flourish overnight.

it only happens after you water it enough, consistently, for a long enough time.

for me, I have to be wired deeply every waking hour.

because I know there is a bunch of hungry pussyboys ready to rise above me...

success might float into the wrong hands. enough said.

listen to this...

if you are anything like me... hellbent to making this work, otherwise what’s the point?

then realistically... what could go wrong?

let me rephrase that...

what could go right?

everything you put in enough effort & time starts working out.

what can you gain?

financial & time freedom, peace beyond understanding, power.

why not you?

you’re a compulsively obsessed artist wired to make it work...

i mean, i don’t see why it can’t be you.

what is the best possible outcome?

i’ll leave this one to you.

but delusion & obsession in itself ain’t enough.

you have to back it up with hard work and consistency.

that’s all it takes...

if you do, your life with chance in the best possible way.

you can have everything you want, and more.

by being obsessed with what you love doing...

you’re totally in. or not.

if you don’t find your fun in being the best at everything possible.

After a long weekend for US investors, attention is back on tariffs, with US President Donald Trump threatening European allies with 10% levies over their refusal to support his desire to take over Greenland.

Trump’s threats, and the possibility of European nations having to retaliate, rattled markets on the other side of the Atlantic Monday. “Higher tariffs from the US and Europe are a destructive way forward,” says Robert Bergqvist, Senior Economist at SEB.

The Greenland dispute adds to the geopolitical noise investors are having to navigate at the start of 2026. At the same time, investors are still waiting for the Supreme Court to weigh in on whether Trump’s use of tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act is legal.

“The new tariffs presumably would rely on IEEPA authority, which is what the Supreme Court is reviewing,” says Preston Caldwell, Morningstar’s senior US economist. “If the Supreme Court strikes down IEEPA tariffs, the Trump administration will have to rely on statutory authority, which historically has entailed lengthy process and paperwork. Hence, it would become likely much harder to slap countrywide tariffs on and off for arbitrary reasons.”

Speaking of the Supreme Court, Wednesday will bring oral arguments over whether Trump can remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from the central bank. This at a time when investors have grown increasingly wary about Trump’s efforts to influence monetary policy and erode the Fed’s independence.

Big Bank Bumps

Fourth-quarter earnings season is now in full swing, and as investors await earnings from Big Tech in coming weeks, big banks have been in the spotlight. It was a bumpy start, as JPMorgan JPM and BankAmerica BAC stocks took a hit, while Citigroup C shares seesawed.

But it wasn’t necessarily earnings news that was driving the market. Again, it was news out of the White House as Trump proposed a 10% cap on credit card interest rates. As we wrote last week, bank executives and analysts panned the idea, saying it would limit credit availability to lower quality borrowers and hurt profits. As for the key takeaways from the actual earnings reports, the outlook looks pretty decent according to Sean Dunlop, a director at Morningstar who follows the big banks.

Here’s what Dunlop has to say:

2026 is setting up to be another solid year for banks if the current backdrop holds. Asset prices remain high. Interest rates are set to decline modestly, with Morningstar senior US economist Preston Caldwell forecasting two rate cuts in his December outlook, in line with CME estimates. And we expect still-solid 4.4% nominal gross domestic product growth … which in conjunction with a labor market that is weaker (but not dramatically so) looks like a decent setup for banks.

Consumer health looks solid. Credit and debit card spending was up 6%-7% in nominal terms basically across the board for the banks, and consumer health, proxied by charge-offs, was very strong. Barring significant deterioration in the labor market, we’re looking at an environment where sentiment and spending continue to diverge sharply.

Things might really be better at Citi. The bank reported sharply stronger results across segments, with particular improvement in wealth management and the retail bank, but every segment saw returns improve by more than 2.5 percentage points.

Key Earnings This Week

For many investors, the big earnings news is still a week off, when the likes of Microsoft MSFT, Tesla TSLA, and Apple AAPL report. In the meantime, the focus will be on regional banks and other key names.

Regional Banks: Throughout the week, regional banks will report. That includes Zions ZION and US Bancorp USB reporting Tuesday, and Truist TFC on Wednesday. Morningstar equity analyst Maoyuan Chen has this to say about what she will be watching:

Consumer health looks solid. The money center banks that have already reported have shown credit and debit card spending up 6%-7% in nominal terms across the board. Credit costs were mostly stable.

Regional banks’ net interest income will face some headwinds in 2026 from two or three rate cuts from the Fed. How much growth the regional banks can achieve will depend on balance sheet growth. We currently forecast around 3%-4% growth, but we could see bank lending growing faster from more commercial real estate loan growth (a headwind in the past three years) or higher commercial lending growth from a pickup in middle-market M&A deal activity.

2025 was a busy year for bank acquisitions, including deal announcements from PNC-FirstBank, Fifth Third-Comerica, Huntington-Cadence, and Huntington-Veritex. We will be watching out for execution updates on these deals and other regional banks’ appetite for inorganic opportunities.

Airlines: United Airlines UAL reports Wednesday. “With Delta having already reported and showing some softness among the leisure market in the fourth quarter, I’ll be watching how that played out for the other airlines and certainly listening for how their bookings are stacking up so far this year,” says Nicolas Owens, equity analyst at Morningstar. “The industry has returned to a low single-digit growth mode after several big rebound years postpandemic.”

GE Aerospace: Thursday will bring fourth-quarter earnings from GE Aerospace GE, which is up some 77% over the past year, thanks to a rally that began in the spring of 2025. For Owens, “the biggest question is just how their supply chain is holding up, as they have so much demand to meet from Airbus for new engines and from existing engine operators for parts.”

Stock Market Rotation or Another Head Fake?

As we alluded to earlier this month, stock market strategists have predicted 10 of the last two rotations out of tech stocks. Will those forecasts be wrong yet again? So far, 2026 has started off in rotation mode for stocks. It’s visible at the sector level, with tech stocks performing the worst while basic materials are out in front. The rotation can also be seen on a market capitalization basis, as small caps have jumped ahead of large caps.

The firm expressed confidence in Eli Lilly’s growing leadership in the obesity treatment market, projecting strength into 2026 and beyond.
These developments indicate Eli Lilly’s active engagement in strategic growth and competitive positioning within the pharmaceutical sector.","Investing.com - Morgan Stanley has reiterated an Overweight rating and $1,290.00 price target on ahead of upcoming REDEFINE-4 Phase 3 obesity trial data. The pharmaceutical giant, currently trading at $1,038.40 with a market cap of nearly $930 billion, has delivered impressive 44% returns over the past year and maintains a PEG ratio of just 0.42, indicating attractive valuation relative to growth.

The REDEFINE-4 trial is a head-to-head comparison of ’s CagriSema versus Eli Lilly’s Zepbound in obese patients without diabetes. The 84-week trial features a flexible dosing design allowing physicians to adjust dosage based on tolerability and weight loss outcomes.

Morgan Stanley outlines three potential scenarios from the trial results. In their base case, CagriSema shows similar efficacy and tolerability to Zepbound, which would likely have limited impact on Eli Lilly shares. According to InvestingPro data, analysts maintain a bullish consensus on LLY with a rating of 1.7 (where 1 is Strong Buy), with targets ranging from $770 to $1,500.

A bull case for Novo Nordisk would involve CagriSema demonstrating statistical superiority with similar tolerability, potentially causing a low-to-mid single-digit percentage decline in Eli Lilly shares. However, Morgan Stanley notes mitigating factors including Eli Lilly’s broad diabesity portfolio with next-generation options Eloralintide and Retatrutide, and potential supply chain limitations for CagriSema.

A bull case for Eli Lilly would emerge if CagriSema shows inferior efficacy or worse tolerability compared to Zepbound, which could drive Eli Lilly shares up by a low single-digit percentage.

In other recent news, Eli Lilly’s earnings and revenue results have not been highlighted, but the company is making significant moves in the industry. Eli Lilly is reportedly preparing a €15 billion offer to acquire French biotech company , although a formal offer has yet to be submitted to Abivax’s board. This potential acquisition could bolster Eli Lilly’s portfolio. Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has delayed its decision on Eli Lilly’s weight-loss pill until April 10, pushing back from the expected late-March timeline. This drug was part of the FDA’s fast-track review program, intended for drugs critical to public health or national security.

In terms of analyst activity, BMO Capital has reiterated its Outperform rating on Eli Lilly, maintaining a price target of $1,200. The firm expressed confidence in Eli Lilly’s growing leadership in the obesity treatment market, projecting strength into 2026 and beyond. Additionally, ’s CEO has commented on the competitive landscape, suggesting that Biogen’s new at-home Alzheimer’s drug could provide an edge over Eli Lilly’s Kisunla. Despite Kisunla’s significant market share, Biogen is positioning its at-home injection as a key differentiator. These developments indicate Eli Lilly’s active engagement in strategic growth and competitive positioning within the pharmaceutical sector.

10 stocks we like better than Walmart ›

Economists aren't sure what will happen with the U.S. and global economies. Certain prognosticators see a weakening domestic labor market as an indicator that economic growth will slow, and forecast a recession will soon be upon us.

However, even if it doesn't occur in 2026, at some point, the U.S. will enter a recession. That will undoubtedly hurt stock prices.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

But not all companies, and hence stock prices, will be affected the same way during a slowdown. While many retailers' sales have already been hurt by consumers stressed by higher prices and an uncertain job market, how will venerable retailer Walmart (NASDAQ: WMT) fare?

Understanding the business

Walmart consists of its namesake stores around the world and a membership warehouse club, Sam's Club. The U.S. Walmart business makes up most of the company's revenue.

Opening its first retail store in the early 1960s, Walmart has mastered the art of charging low prices to customers. In fact, shoppers would be hard-pressed to find lower prices. Walmart does this by keeping an extremely tight rein on costs.

It also makes technology investments to keep up with competitors, including behemoth online retailer Amazon. These tend to focus on making shopping at Walmart more convenient, such as same-day pickup and delivery. Most of this year's capital expenditures went toward supply chain, customer-facing initiatives, and other technology.

Management's focus on low prices and convenience continues to resonate with customers. The Walmart U.S. division's fiscal third-quarter same-store sales (comps) increased 4.5%. Higher traffic contributed 1.8 percentage points, and increased spending accounted for the balance. The period ended on Oct. 31, 2025.

Management stated that it drew higher-income consumers during the quarter. This also happened during the Great Recession as the wealthier demographic sought bargains. I believe Walmart's low prices will continue to drive shoppers during the next economic downturn.

Rich valuation

Shareholders have done well by investing in Walmart's stock. The shares gained 31.2% over the past year through Jan. 14, outpacing the S&P 500 index's 19%.

The company's past success has created high expectations for future growth. Walmart's stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 42, compared to 37 a year ago. It also sells at a richer valuation than the overall market, with the S&P 500 trading at a P/E multiple of 31.

However, given the company's success, ability to succeed in all kinds of economic environments, including recessions, and its investment to keep it ahead of the competition, I believe a higher multiple is warranted.

That's why I'd be willing to pay up for Walmart's shares.

Its requirements are forcing a reckoning with enterprise architecture that supply chain leaders can no longer ignore.

Moving past the hype cycle, agentic AI is entering widespread adoption. According to the 2025 Gartner “Market Guide for PLM Software in Discrete Manufacturing Industries,” this year, more than 80% of PLM vendors will incorporate AI capabilities into their platforms, compared with less than 40% in 2025. Here’s what that stat doesn’t capture: agentic AI doesn’t just add features to existing systems. It fundamentally changes what software delivers.

Why standalone systems can't compete

Consider a typical scenario facing supply chain executives today. A critical component supplier announces a 30% tariff-driven price increase. Someone manually pulls procurement data, cross-references engineering specs in PLM, checks ERP inventory, reviews CRM customer commitments, and attempts to reconcile everything in spreadsheets. Days turn to weeks. Margins erode while leadership has to wait to see the complete picture.

No amount of better workflows or skilled analysts solves this. It's an architecture problem. Standalone systems rarely communicate in real time. They create data islands requiring human intermediaries to bridge gaps. Implementing Agentic AI exposes this limitation with brutal clarity.

Unlike generative AI that responds to prompts, agentic AI can take autonomous action within defined parameters. An agent optimizing supply chain decisions needs simultaneous access to engineering data, quality records, supplier performance, customer commitments, and financial constraints. If that data lives in five disconnected systems, the agent’s ability to function is compromised. It's like hiring an expert operations manager but only allowing them to look at one system per day.

The connected intelligence requirement

This coming generation of AI agents won't live inside individual applications. They'll coordinate across entire ecosystems, turning fragmented processes into intelligent networks. Software platforms extending data across enterprises will dominate while isolated tools fade.

Consider predictive inventory management. An effective agent, or group of agents across apps analyze demand patterns, component availability, supplier lead times, quality results, and customer forecasts. When shortages appear, it triggers procurement workflows, alerts production planning, notifies affected customers, and recommends alternative sourcing.

This orchestration requires connected data and integrated workflows across the supply chain and tech stack which standalone software can’t deliver. Manufacturers with integrated data significantly reduce development cycles because agents access comprehensive, connected data rather than siloed information. When systems no longer operate in isolation, time-to-market improvements scale with agents automatically cross-referencing engineering changes with supplier capacity, regulatory requirements, production schedules, and customer delivery commitments.

The infrastructure mistake executives make

However, this connected intelligence creates a dangerous misconception. Some executives see AI agents performing sophisticated analysis and assume the agents themselves are the solution, that powerful AI can simply work around fragmented systems. If the agent is smart enough, why invest in expensive platform integration?

Here's why that thinking fails.

Having implemented legacy systems for manufacturers during my Accenture years, I've seen what happens when companies chase technology without infrastructure foundations. Agents without structured systems are like a Formula 1 car with no track to race on. The car is impressive, but without guardrails, you're headed for disaster.

The platform provides those guardrails, enforcing the business rules, compliance requirements, and process controls that agents need to operate safely. This is especially critical in supply chain operations where regulatory compliance and audit trails aren't optional. Consider a manufacturer with a decade of supplier quality inspection records. An agent analyzing historical data might notice a compliance field completed less than 50% of the time without business impact. Based on this pattern, the agent determines the field is unimportant and stops prompting for completion.

But what if that field is an FDA reporting requirement that hasn't been audited yet? The moment inspection occurs, missing data becomes a compliance violation shutting down your entire supply chain. A proper platform enforces which fields are mandatory for agents, regardless of historical patterns. The agent becomes incredibly effective once it understands which processes are non-negotiable.

The governance reality

Can your current systems automatically control which AI agents access proprietary supplier agreements or customer pricing? If not, you're not ready for agentic AI at scale. Just as companies have focused on user access, least privilege and protecting confidential and PII data for their employees, the same regimen needs to be applied for agents.

Enterprise platforms provide the governance structure agents desperately need. Without it, you face two bad options: you can't enforce permissions at all, or you spend enormous effort manually recreating permissions in AI models. When permissions inevitably change, agents access data they shouldn't, or make decisions based on outdated rules.

When an auditor asks for the decision trail on a supplier change that impacted customer deliveries, you need more than ""the AI agent handled it."" You need documented processes, approval workflows, and clear accountability. This is what robust platforms deliver, and it's non-negotiable in supply chain operations.

Real business value emerges when supply chain data flows seamlessly across PLM, ERP, procurement, and logistics through a unified backbone. Agents can then conduct the predictive analysis and autonomous coordination that supply chain executives expect, identifying which products tariffs affect before margins erode, determining which parts need alternate sourcing before shortages hit, and adjusting production schedules when supplier capacity shifts.

The partnership imperative

Successful agentic AI demands a partnership between intelligence and infrastructure. Agents, guided by humans, provide the decision-making layer; enterprise platforms provide the operational foundation. Neither works effectively without the other in supply chain environments where speed, accuracy, and compliance determine success.

The manufacturers and supply chain organizations that recognize this interdependence now will build sustainable competitive advantages. Those that chase AI without addressing their fragmented system architecture will watch competitors pull ahead while they manage unreliable automation built on unstable foundations.

Longevity is no longer just a buzzword in 2025: it’s the beauty industry’s most radical shift in branding. The era of conventional anti-ageing fixes has given way to a new generation of consumers seeking precision skincare powered by biotechnology and wellness science. From AI-driven personalisation to next-generation delivery systems, these are the breakthroughs shaping a new wave of skin-longevity products.

When Estée Lauder shared its latest skin-longevity science at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) last year, the focus wasn’t only on showcasing a single product launch, amazing as the Platinum 6D Black Diamond Eye Cream was. The company was signalling a new era in science-backed rejuvenation – and in this case, the science was in sirtuin age-reversal technology.

The company spent more than 15 years researching sirtuin proteins, the skin’s essential longevity regulators that activate key restorative pathways to delay and even reverse visible signs of ageing in as little as 14 days. Since 2023, the brand has supported a multi-year programme with the Stanford Center on Longevity, using cross-disciplinary research on aesthetics, vitality and ageing to inform its broader skin-longevity platform. In Asia, it’s also rolled out education initiatives to familiarise consumers with the science of skin longevity.

This age-reversal technology now anchors Estée Lauder’s prestigious Re-Nutriv collection, infused with the brand’s patented SIRTIVITY-LP complex. Featured in hero products such as the Ultimate Diamond Transformative Brilliance Soft Crème and the Ultimate Diamond Age Reversal Eye Crème, SIRTIVITY-LP targets a novel longevity pathway through NF-κB inhibition, curbing the cellular cascade of oxidative stress, protein degradation and damage that leads to loss of elasticity and firmness. The result: skin that not only appears revitalised but operates with the resilience of youth.

L’Oréal, too, is staking a bold claim on the skin-longevity frontier. At last year’s Viva Technology conference in Paris, the group presented its latest breakthroughs as part of a new Longevity Integrative Science blueprint, positioning itself less as a cosmetics house and more as a beauty-tech powerhouse that’s now strongly invested in how skin behaves over time.

Moving away from corrective anti-ageing care to proactive longevity care is part of L’Oréal’s master framework. At Viva Technology, L’Oréal debuted its Wheel of Longevity, which decodes skin biological ageing, identifies nine interconnected hallmarks of ageing and, using its proprietary Longevity AI Cloud, translates the data into actionable care.

L’Oréal’s biggest breakthrough is probably in the Cell BioPrint, a “lab-on-a-chip” device that was created with NanoEntek, using microfluidics and proteomics to read skin biomarkers from a simple tape strip to calculate biological skin age, inflammation, skin moisture levels and sensitivity to actives such as retinol in five minutes. Marketed under its luxury brand Lancôme, the device can effectively bring longevity analytics to the beauty counter and offer consumers essential information about their own skin needs.

Beyond the store, Lancôme’s Rénergie Nano-ResurfacER 400 Booster is billed as the next generation tech-powered device developed for at-home use. The device, which is powered by patented nanochip technology, is designed to boost topical penetration into the stratum corneum, the skin’s outermost layer, amplifying the Rénergie H.C.F. Triple Serum’s performance to its fullest. It’s a tool inspired by micro- needling, but designed to be perfectly safe Shiseido’s Future Solution FX line for at-home use with no pain and no down-time at all.

Shiseido’s use of its LonGenevity Complex and the Enmei Herb in its Future Solution LX line is irrefutable proof that the group also belongs in the skin-longevity conversation. LonGenevity Complex is Shiseido’s core technology, and is an exclusive blend of four key elements including the Enmei Herb, vitamin C, green tea and Skingenecell 1P, a proprietary amino- acid derivative. Shiseido had spent decades studying the Enmei Herb, found only on sacred mountains, such as Japan’s mounts Ibuki and Koya, and has historically been linked with longevity and healing. The resulting complex enables skin to be optimised at any age by reinforcing its barrier function, improving brightness, plumpness and smoothness so that skin behaves more like younger skin over time.

Moreover, Shiseido’s broader research and development emphasises health-span science, resulting in the Beauty Alive Circulation Check to uncover our true skin health. Without contacting the skin, the device uses dual cameras to analyse both its surface and the micro-circulation underneath, capturing RGB images and thermal data to evaluate the overall balance of radiance, resilience and smoothness. For its innovation and inclusivity, the device won Shiseido the CES Innovation Award last year.

Taking inspiration from fitness trackers, AmorePacific is claiming its place in the realm of skin longevity with Skinsight, which tracks the micro-shifts in the skin’s health, anticipating problems before they even surface. Co-developed with researchers at MIT, the sensor patch can detect micrometre-level changes in skin tightness, while also measuring UV and blue-light exposure, temperature and moisture, turning skin science into a live data field instead of a static snapshot. The data is then fed and analysed by an AI engine, with the results readily accessible through an AI-powered mobile app. In an era when skincare routines are increasingly becoming personalised, this innovation is truly game-changing – which is why it’s winning an Innovation Award at the forthcoming CES 2026. And while the technology hasn’t yet arrived on the market, it’s being utilised internally, with the research already being used to substantiate the efficacy of Amorepacific’s luxury-brand products, including Sulwhasoo’s signature First Care Activating Serum.

La Prairie has talked about cellular rejuvenation long before skin longevity was a thing. The Swiss brand isn’t just into longevity, but haute longevity science. In recent years, La Prairie and Clinique La Prairie have effectively built a closed ecosystem in which the clinic develops medical-rate lifespan science, while the skincare house translates its research into products such as the new Life Matrix collection, tying daily skincare back to the brand’s original cellular-therapy heritage on Lake Geneva.

Powered by the Exclusive Matrix Complex, the Life Matrix Haute Rejuvenation Cream nurtures skin longevity from the core, working on four levels of the Skin Longevity Matrix to amplify youth, balance optimisation, make the skin resilient and improve the skin’s appearance. La Prairie’s scientists were able to identify more than 18,000 biomolecules in young and aged epidermal cells and successfully reset 394 of them with its Exclusive Matrix Complex, restoring them to a younger state and proving the cream’s potency. Science has never been more fascinating – and in the hands of the world’s leading beauty titans, it’s rapidly rewriting what skin longevity looks like, one breakthrough bottle and biometric at a time.",https://images.prestigeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2026/01/08155652/forever-young.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:11:51.836627

Similarly, strong reported results paired with cautious 2026 guidance would likely produce a negative reaction despite a fourth-quarter beat.","U.S. Bancorp reports fourth-quarter 2025 results on Tuesday, January 20 before market open. Markets are now looking for clues as to whether the ~50% rally in the USB stock price off April’s low will be supported by operational performance, rather than multiple expansion.

Trading at $54.50 leading in to the print, USB is positioned at a pivotal level, with a potential breakout above resistance, or a breakdown to support on the cards.

Wall Street consensus for the print sits at $1.12 EPS and $7.18B revenue, representing 8.7% and 5.1% year-over-year growth respectively. The setup creates asymmetric risk: the stock now trades at 12.5x earnings, a full valuation that leaves little room for disappointment on either reported results or forward guidance.

The quarter also marks the first reporting period following USB’s completion of the BTIG acquisition, adding capital markets capabilities but introducing integration risk that the market has viewed skeptically. With estimates revised upward by $0.01 over the past 30 days and four analysts raising projections in the past week, the Street is incrementally believing the improved run-rate signaled by third-quarter results. The question is whether management can articulate a path to sustaining earnings growth in 2026 that supports current valuation levels.

What the result will determine is whether USB’s transition from defensive cost-cutting to growth-oriented strategy can deliver on elevated expectations. The bank’s third-quarter beat, driven by record net revenue of $7.33B and EPS of $1.22, established a higher baseline. Fourth-quarter execution at or slightly above consensus may not be sufficient if guidance or commentary suggests the third-quarter strength represented peak performance rather than a sustainable trajectory.

Consensus Estimates

Consensus EPS of $1.12 sits at the midpoint of the $1.09 to $1.16 range, with estimate momentum turning positive over the past 30 days. Eight analysts raised projections in the past month, contributing to a $0.01 upward revision. Revenue expectations of $7.18B imply sequential deceleration from third-quarter’s $7.33B record, though year-over-year growth of 5.1% would still exceed the company’s full-year guidance midpoint of 4%. The estimate distribution suggests the Street is modeling modest sequential pullback from third-quarter strength rather than sustained acceleration.

The gap between consensus and management’s full-year revenue growth target of 3–5% is narrowing. Fourth-quarter revenue at $7.18B would imply full-year growth near the upper end of guidance, assuming prior quarters’ results hold. The key risk is whether management reaffirms or tightens this range for 2026, as any signal of deceleration below 4% growth could pressure the stock despite a fourth-quarter beat.

Management Guidance and Commentary

“We are focused on delivering sustainable revenue growth of 3 to 5 percent annually while maintaining our commitment to operating leverage and efficiency improvements.”

Management’s full-year revenue growth target of 3–5%, reiterated through the first three quarters of 2025, established a framework that consensus has consistently tested. The midpoint of 4% annual growth implies quarterly revenue in the $7.0B to $7.3B range, depending on seasonality. Fourth-quarter consensus of $7.18B sits comfortably within this band, but the market is now looking for confirmation that 2026 can sustain similar growth without relying on one-time tailwinds.

The third-quarter commentary highlighted fee revenue growth and positive operating leverage as core drivers, with management emphasizing the durability of the payments, wealth, and capital markets businesses. The BTIG acquisition, completed in late 2025, was framed as a strategic addition to fee-generating capabilities rather than a transformative deal. Investor skepticism around the acquisition centers on whether integration costs will offset near-term earnings accretion and whether the capital deployed could have generated higher returns through buybacks.

The gap between guidance and consensus is minimal on revenue but undefined on EPS, as management has not provided quarterly EPS targets. The Street’s $1.12 EPS estimate implies margin expansion and operating leverage, which aligns with management’s stated priorities. The risk is that deposit pricing pressures or BTIG integration costs compress margins, causing EPS to undershoot even if revenue meets expectations. Management’s tone on net interest margin trajectory and expense run-rate will be as important as the reported numbers.

Analyst Price Targets & Ratings

Wall Street maintains a constructive view with 82% of analysts rating shares a Buy or Strong Buy. The consensus target of $60.80 implies 11.6% upside from current levels, though this reflects the stock’s recent rally compressing the upside potential. The absence of any Sell ratings suggests analysts view the current valuation as supportable, though the concentration in Hold ratings indicates some caution about near-term momentum.

Sector & Peer Comparison

U.S. Bancorp trades at 12.5x trailing earnings and 11.1x forward earnings, positioning it near the middle of its regional bank peer group. The forward multiple sits between PNC Financial’s 11.8x and Truist’s 10.7x, suggesting the market is pricing USB at a modest premium to lower-quality peers but below PNC’s valuation. The 27.6% profit margin leads most regional peers and trails only Fifth Third’s 28.4%, reflecting USB’s historical focus on operational efficiency.

Earnings Track Record

U.S. Bancorp has beaten EPS estimates in 14 of the past 15 quarters, establishing a 93.3% beat rate with an average surprise of 3.4%. The third-quarter 2025 result represented the strongest upside in the period, with a 9.9% beat driven by record revenue and margin expansion. The pattern shows consistent execution on profitability even when top-line results have occasionally disappointed the Street, as in second-quarter 2025 when revenue came in below expectations despite an EPS beat.

Post-Earnings Price Movement History

Historical post-earnings price movement shows an average next-day decline of 0.6%, with the same negative average on beats. The pattern reveals that EPS beats alone have not been sufficient to drive positive reactions, particularly when revenue or guidance disappoints. Third-quarter 2025’s 9.9% EPS beat was followed by a 2.3% stock decline, likely due to concerns about sustainability of the record revenue print or lack of explicit upward guidance revision.

Expected Move & Implied Volatility

The options market is pricing an expected move of approximately 3.2%, or a range of $52.76 to $56.24, based on at-the-money straddle pricing. Implied volatility of roughly 22% sits modestly above 30-day historical volatility of 19%, suggesting the market sees slightly elevated uncertainty around the event but not extreme risk. The implied move aligns with USB’s historical average absolute post-earnings move, indicating options traders are not pricing for a major surprise in either direction.

Expert Predictions & What to Watch

Key Outlook: Guidance Will Drive the Trade

The fourth-quarter setup presents balanced risk. On one hand, USB’s consistent beat record and positive estimate revisions suggest the company is likely to exceed $1.12 EPS. On the other, the stock’s valuation expansion means the bar for a positive reaction is higher than the bar for simply beating estimates. The market is no longer rewarding small beats without forward confirmation of earnings power, as evidenced by the third-quarter result where a 9.9% EPS beat still produced a 2.3% stock decline.

Key Metrics to Watch

The five metrics above represent the critical data points that will determine whether USB can sustain its valuation premium. Net interest margin and fee income are the primary drivers of top-line performance, while credit provisions signal asset quality trends. BTIG integration progress addresses the market’s skepticism around capital allocation, and 2026 guidance provides the forward visibility necessary to support a 12.5x earnings multiple.

Investors should focus on the interplay between these metrics rather than any single number. A scenario where NIM expands but fee income disappoints would raise questions about business mix quality. Similarly, strong reported results paired with cautious 2026 guidance would likely produce a negative reaction despite a fourth-quarter beat. The market is demanding both execution and confidence in forward trajectory.",https://www.asktraders.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Depositphotos_69820815_s-2019.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 08:59:56.335458

Recent data highlights the urgency of this shift. According to research from the Interactive Advertising Bureau, attribution accuracy has plummeted by approximately 40% since the introduction of Apple’s iOS 14.5 update, with roughly 75% of users opting out of tracking.

This ‘measurement gap’ is not merely a technical glitch; it represents a fundamental breakdown in the performance-heavy media models that have dominated corporate strategy. As Google prepares for the eventual deprecation of third-party cookies, the mechanisms that once powered digital advertising are vanishing.

Building sustainable brand equity

For many years, brand building was dismissed on quarterly earnings calls as ‘unmeasurable’ or ‘old-fashioned,’ in favour of the immediate gratification of cost-per-acquisition (CPA) metrics. Yet, evidence is mounting that branding is the only sustainable path forward in a privacy-first world.

A longitudinal study of e-commerce brands found that companies that maintained a balanced approach, investing in both brand and performance, achieved a 23% higher customer lifetime value (CLV) than those focused solely on short-term activation.

While performance marketing is effective at harvesting existing demand, brand marketing creates the demand in the first place. Without the latter, the addressable market shrinks, and the cost of ""harvesting"" through performance channels becomes unsustainably expensive.

The 60:40 rule

The question for the modern executive is no longer if they should invest in brand, but how much. Influential analysis of the IPA Databank suggests a ‘60:40’ rule: 60% of the budget should be allocated to long-term brand building, and 40% to short-term performance activation.

However, global research from firms like Kantar suggests that this ratio must be nuanced by industry:

FMCG and high frequency: Brands with short purchase cycles often skew toward performance (roughly 55:45) to capture immediate intent.

Considered purchases: In sectors such as financial services and automotive, the ratio often swings toward 70:30 in favour of the brand. In these categories, a brand must remain in the ""consideration set"" for months or years before a purchase intent ever emerges.

Mass media returns

As digital attribution becomes less reliable, traditional mass media, television, radio, and out-of-home (OOH), are seeing a strategic resurgence. Research from Yellowwood across dozens of brands indicates that these channels consistently deliver more substantial long-term ROI than previously credited through digital-only measurement. While digital channels remain excellent for short-term activation, their impact on long-term brand equity is often negligible.

This shift requires a change in executive mindset. Strategic judgement must once again take precedence over ""precision"" data that is increasingly flawed. Marketing departments built entirely around last-click attribution and immediate conversion metrics must now restructure to value metrics that unfold over quarters and years, rather than weeks.

The ‘pendulum’ is not swinging back to brand because performance marketing has failed, but because the ecosystem that allowed performance-only strategies to thrive is collapsing.

Get C-Suite buy-in

For CMOs to drive genuine business revenue and contribute to broader economic growth, they must secure board-level buy-in for three critical shifts:

Accepting imperfection: Recognise that 100% measurement precision is a myth in the current privacy landscape.

Lengthening horizons: Secure permission to measure success over years, ensuring the brand is ""planted"" well before it is ""harvested.""

Future-proofing infrastructure: Invest in first-party data and measurement tools that will survive the death of the cookie and the rise of privacy-first operating systems.

The fashion industry has reacted with a mix of alarm and strategic exhaustion. While some executives are simply waiting for another TACO moment (Trump Always Chickens Out) and a subsequent U-turn, others are hoping for a favourable ruling from the US Supreme Court on the tariff’s legality. Retailers have warned of an immediate 10 to 15 percent price hike on European imports like French leather, Italian silk or British wool.

Industry voices between ‘wait and watch’ and worry

“While luxury giants may be able to overcome another seismic shift, there is a fear that smaller independent designers will not survive... Aspirational shoppers are expected to be priced out,” commented Helen Brocklebank, CEO of the UK’s official body for luxury goods, Walpole, according to The Guardian.

“These tariffs will be yet another burden for businesses across our country... The use of tariffs against allies is completely wrong,” stated UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer when asked about the sentiment of British heritage brands and the UK’s luxury sector according to Yahoo News.

“European designers could end up selling mostly in Europe; American designers could sell mostly in America. This could set the industry back 50 years,” said industry analyst and CEO of Tomorrow London Limited Stefano Martinetto when commenting on the potential for a complete breakdown of transatlantic fashion trade according to The Guardian.

How are luxury groups adjusting?

Luxury giant LVMH is taking a cautious, multi-tiered approach due to its 23 percent revenue exposure to the US market. According to analysts from Morgan Stanley, while LVMH usually has high pricing power, the luxury conglomerate that is home to brands such as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Bulgari and others can only partially offset these tariffs. In line with the fear voiced by Brocklebank, there is a risk of squeezing middle-income (aspirational) consumers who have already been hit by the inflation.

Throughout January, LVMH has been rushing shipments of leather goods and perfumes to US warehouses to beat the deadline of 1st February. Experts suggest there could be selective price hikes of 8 to 12 percent on core items like the Louis Vuitton Speedy or Dior Lady Bag toward the end of the first quarter.

French luxury group Kering, owner of brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta and others, is in a more vulnerable position as it works to turnaround the Gucci brand. Unlike LVMH, Kering is more likely to absorb a portion of the tariff cost rather than passing 100 percent of it to the consumer, fearing that a price spike could stall Gucci's recovery.

The luxury giant is reportedly looking at harmonising global prices — raising prices in Europe and Asia slightly while keeping US increases moderate — to discourage US tourists from doing all their shopping in European metropolises to avoid tariff-inflated domestic prices.

French luxury brand Hermès has signalled that it would likely pass the full cost of the tariffs directly to its US clientele, thus banking on ultra-high-net-worth individuals who are on waitlists for Kelly and Birkin bags to accept a 10 to 25 percent “Greenland Surcharge.”

Many CEOs of luxury brands are currently at the World Economic Forum in Davos, attempting to lobby for a “Luxury Exemption” similar to those granted in previous trade disputes. However, if no deal is reached by 1st February, the first wave of price increases would likely appear on US e-commerce sites by mid-month.

What does this mean for US brands?

In view of the European Union currently favouring a “tit-for-tat” escalation and moving away from its usual diplomatic restraint, a subsequent “Trade Bazooka” could mean the EU retaliating with a package of measures targeting US-made clothing and denim and thus iconic American brands such as Nike, Ralph Lauren, Levi Strauss and others.

If implemented, US brands could see their European retail prices rise by 15 to 20 percent almost overnight. This would likely lead to a re-routing strategy, where they attempt to ship goods through non-targeted EU countries like Spain or Italy.",https://r.fashionunited.com/w-nu7ix2QLPDBb4SAcpCLJPAJ7MGCUClsEmLJuDyXsU/resize:fit:1200:630:0/gravity:ce/quality:70/aHR0cHM6Ly9mYXNoaW9udW5pdGVkLmNvbS9pbWcvdXBsb2FkLzIwMjYvMDEvMjAvZWFnbGUtdnMtYnVsbC1haS02YjVqeW9jbi0yMDI2LTAxLTIwLnBuZw.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 05:01:36.463598

The ads will only appear in ChatGPT’s free and Go tiers (the latter being its lowest-cost subscription option, introduced as an option for US customers the same day).

Fidji Simo, CEO of Applications at OpenAI, is adamant that paid ads won’t affect product recommendations that ChatGPT deems “objectively useful,” nor will users’ data and conversations be sold to advertisers, per the announcement.

Simply put, OpenAI wants to assure users that “ads do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives [them].”

There’s a lot of certainty about what the ad business won’t look like.

But what, exactly, it will look like isn’t set in stone. (And we all know Sam Altman’s take on ads is famously inconsistent.)

For now, ads will exist at the bottom of ChatGPT feed and be clearly identified and separate from the organic recommendation. And the first ads will be part of a test, not a national rollout.

Still, whether you frame it as OpenAI stepping aboard its rocket ship or beginning a descent down the world’s slipperiest slope, it’s the beginning of something important.

Riding The Tube

OpenAI isn’t the only company with earth-moving advertising news from late last week.

Soon, the BBC will announce a content deal with YouTube to produce bespoke programs for the Google platform, the Financial Times reports. According to the FT, the content BBC will be producing for YouTube will counter misinformation and disinformation on the platform.

But the announcement (when it comes) is a major departure for the BBC, which in the UK does not collect ad revenue, even from content it distributes on third-party platforms.

The broadcaster also has a reputation for prioritizing its first-party assets, the iPlayer streaming platform and two traditional TV channels.

Some older BBC series may be available now on YouTube, too, though that wasn’t central to the deal, one source tells the FT.

On Principal

The times, they are a-changing.

Because ways of doing business that once would have crossed a line in the sand for marketers are now standard, accepted ways of working together.

For one, there’s the old marketing mantra that an agency or media company shouldn’t “grade its own homework.”

Some marketers still repeat the line. But when they speak with their budgets, which accrue to walled gardens, it’s clearly an antiquated notion.

Last week, the CPG data seller SPINS, which has in-store sales and share-of-shelf info, acquired the commerce-focused ad tech company MikMak. Not so long ago, these marketing functions were supposed to be separate. Now, marketers want those functions under one roof.

Another example is principal-based buying, which involves agencies buying and repackaging inventory to clients at undisclosed margins. Principal-based buying has in a few short years gone from an illicit practice discussed in hushed, abashed whispers to a de facto part of how big agencies operate.

“Marketers are looking for cost relief, agencies are looking for margin, and publishers are looking for sales and revenue,” Forrester’s VP and senior agency analyst Jay Pattisall tells Digiday. “The mechanism of arbitrage and principal media enables you to meet all of those considerations.”

It’s within this context that the 8th Annual Shopper, Retailer & Category Insights Conference returns to London on 12th February, offering a focused look at the trends, technologies and behaviours shaping the year ahead.

This year’s event gathers senior voices from Diageo, Deliveroo, The Coca-Cola Company, Sainsbury’s, Holland & Barrett, Kraft Heinz, AO, Barilla Group, Church & Dwight, Medik8, and others, offering a clear, practical lens on how brands can preserve value, build relevance and deliver growth in a price sensitive market.

Inflation, loyalty pressure and the value equation

The morning opens with sessions addressing the economic pressures driving 2026 strategy. With shoppers increasingly switching to private labels, cutting basket sizes and prioritising value over loyalty, Diageo’s Diego Infante will outline how brands can balance affordability with margin protection while sustaining trust.

His emphasis on “smart promotions, not more promotions” is likely to resonate. As promotional fatigue grows and activation budgets tighten, precision and timing are emerging as critical capability gaps.

Central Co-op’s Charlotte Castille builds on this by examining how brands can set price points that protect equity while limiting down-trading. The discussion includes which segments are most vulnerable and how pack formats, innovation and sustainability now influence retention.

Influence, hybrid journeys and non-linear behaviour

The Consumer Behaviours panel - featuring Deliveroo, Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz and AO - explores how shoppers now navigate fragmented, non-linear journeys. Influence -led discovery continues to shape purchase decisions, creating a new competitive environment where credibility must be established instantly.

RTIH readers will recognise the relevance of this shift. With journeys spanning social platforms, marketplaces, brand sites and physical stores, the panel looks at how brands can maintain consistent value messaging and ensure personalisation stays helpful rather than intrusive.

AI moves from theory to operational reality

AI underpins much of this year’s programme. Holland & Barrett CFO Vineta Bajaj will highlight how AI can decode behaviour, forecast category shifts and unify data previously siloed across CRM, e-commerce, loyalty and in-store systems.

The focus is firmly on practical application — how to shift AI from insight generation to activation. With just under half of purchases expected to be influenced by AI agents by 2030*, organisational capability, governance and privacy safeguards are becoming increasingly central.

Retailer collaboration: from legacy KPIs to performance led ecosystems

Diageo’s Efrain Rosario leads the discussion on modern retailer-supplier partnerships, exploring how physical experiences, real-time orchestration and shared data are reshaping value creation. As the sector moves beyond impressions and traditional volume KPIs, outcome-led collaboration is becoming the new standard.

Private label dynamics and brand defence strategies

Private label penetration continues to accelerate. The conference offers two perspectives - from Church & Dwight and AO - on how national brands can defend their position through innovation, trust-building and clear communication.

Rather than treating private label purely as a threat, the discussion examines how national brands can complement retailer value strategies while maintaining distinctive equity.

Retail media, omnichannel performance and measurable ROI

The Retail Media panel - featuring TRIP and Barilla Group - tackles fragmentation across RMNs, TikTok Shop, YouTube and emerging formats. Measurement, duplication and incrementality remain friction points, and the session promises grounded guidance on what effective investment looks like in 2026.

Later sessions delve into omnichannel performance, sustainability and scalable personalisation, with contributions from Sainsbury’s, Medik8, Currys, Objkts Jewelry, The INKEY List and flaconi. Together, they highlight the operational realities of delivering consistency across channels, managing regulatory shifts and applying AI to unify shopper views.

A strategic snapshot of retail’s next chapter

Across inflation, consumer behaviour, AI, retail media, category innovation, convenience and sustainability, the conference provides a concise yet comprehensive view of how brands can build resilience in a fast-changing landscape. For senior commercial, digital and retail leaders, it serves as a timely checkpoint on where the sector is heading - and where competitive advantage will be won in 2026.

It was also the first time the value of a simple coffee run stood out.
She previously told Fortune that both Gen Z new hires and millennial middle managers need to be more “patient” in their quest for success.
He says he got promotion after promotion by doing his very best in the role he was in — even those junior ones.","Gen Z might groan at the idea of fetching their boss’s flat white. And who can blame them? They’ve entered the workforce in an era where optics matter, and they know that being the person who always grabs the coffee, takes notes, or organizes the lunch (also known as “office housework”) can make you look more junior and hurt progression over time.

But Stephanie Kramer, the CHRO of L’Oréal U.S., says those small tasks are often where opportunity begins — and they played a surprisingly big role in her own career to the corner office at the world’s largest beauty company.

Quest fragrances, where she worked closely with perfumers early in her career

Before joining the Fortune 500 firm, L’Oreal, Kramer’s first job out of university was at Quest fragrances. It was also the first time the value of a simple coffee run stood out.

“I really wanted to have time to get to meet this incredibly cool perfumer,” she recalls to Fortune, adding that she went early to the meeting with the mindset that she simply wanted to support her team. But she soon discovered that “something positive comes out of those little things too.”

Instead of being wrapped up in being seen as the most junior person in the room, she quickly noted it gets you access.

“If you’re the one that is going to capture the actions from the meeting and the next steps, and you’re listening and you’re observing that isn’t that isn’t necessarily a negative,” Kramer explains. “You are in the room and you are absorbing how those points are coming to be. You’re developing the skills of inference.”

“So just make sure, when you’re discrediting some of those more small tasks, that you’re not discrediting their value they bring to you and your learning. I think about that all the time.”

Take whatever you can now, be strategic later

Kramer’s résumé spans Chanel, Kiehl’s, and L’Oréal’s corner offices — but it’s the middle-school roles and the odd, early-career errands she remembers most clearly.

“Those ones stick with you,” she says. That first job probably won’t be your dream role, it certainly wasn’t hers. But over time, it will have a snowball effect on your career.

“I don’t know if those are the ones where I ever wanted to be, you know, in my whole life.” Yet, she insists, every experience adds up. “It does. It makes a big difference.”

Her message to young workers facing a freezing job market: take the role, take the task, take the coffee run — because the value will only compound over time.

“You just have to start,” Kramer insists. “I guarantee that someday, that’s what you’re going to talk about in your interview.”

“It might not be the job that you have, or that you’re not necessarily sure that you should take. Right now, maybe it’s a paycheck, or maybe it’s a platform for you to connect with other people so that you can discover what you want to do.”

“When people ask me how I ended up in HR, I tell them it’s from middle school, because in middle school I was a lifeguard, I was a Girl Scout, I was a cross country runner, which means that you have to run through the woods alone, but you’re still making points as a team….Those jobs are part of what my job is today.”

The promotions will come later — but first, focus on

As the adage goes: If you look after the pennies, the pounds will look after themselves. The same goes for your career. Kramer is far from the first exec to tell young workers that if they excel in the small tasks today, the promotions will follow.

Cisco’s U.K. chief spent 25 years climbing the ranks at the Fortune 500 Europe telecommunications giant BT, before joining Cisco in 2022 as managing director and being promoted lead its U.K. and Ireland arm just two years later.

She previously told Fortune that both Gen Z new hires and millennial middle managers need to be more “patient” in their quest for success. The promotions will come, but young aspirational workers should focus on building their skills over rushing to nab any new snazzy title to update their LinkedIn.

Pret A Manger’s CEO Pano Christou, went from working at McDonald’s for $3 an hour to earning millions as the boss of the British sandwich chain. He says he got promotion after promotion by doing his very best in the role he was in — even those junior ones.

“I’ve watched people that have been so fixated on the next role that they really take their eye off the current job they’re doing,” Christou told Fortune. “My philosophy has always been if you do a great job, people will notice you.”

Likewise, Shaid Shah, one of the most senior execs at Mars — the powerhouse behind household brands like Dolmio — said the best career hack is to stop obsessing over getting that promotion or dream job title, and embrace the many steps in between that get you there.

“It’s about acquiring the experiences that you need to realize your ambition, to realize what makes you happy, what makes you tick, what inspires you to get out of bed every day,” Shah explained. “Because career success is more than just hierarchy.”",https://allwork.space/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gen-Z-Career-Advice-From-A-CHRO-Getting-The-Coffee-Is-Strategic-Not-Pathetic.png,N,,2026-01-20 02:58:55.150290

On the distribution side, BoomRx ensures healthcare providers nationwide can quickly and easily fulfill prescriptions for these therapies through one streamlined portal.""
What’s new with oral semaglutide approval and market availability?
Oral semaglutide was approved by the FDA in December 2025 as a once-daily pill (25 mg), intended to limit excess body weight and help with weight maintenance.
BoomRx Introduces Oral Semaglutide and Tirzepatide for Healthcare Providers Nationwide.","BoomRx, a pharmaceutical technology platform that simplifies prescription sourcing and fulfillment by providing healthcare professionals (HCPs) with access to weight management therapies, has now made both oral semaglutide and tirzepatide options available via its platform.1 The options will be using advanced nanoemulsion delivery, for use by medical clinics, telemedicine providers, wellness facilities, and med spas.

What is nanoemulsion technology and how does it improve drug absorption?

According to a report published in Scientifica,2 “Nanoemulsions, also known as nanometric-sized emulsions, are fine water-in-oil (w/o) and oil-in-water (o/w) dispersions of two immiscible fluids, as opposed to the milky-white hue concomitant with coarse dispersion. These 20–200 nm droplets are stabilized by adding the appropriate amphiphilic emulsifiers or emulsifiers.”

Why does delivery format matter for semaglutide and tirzepatide?

By utilizing nanoemulsion technology, the formulations convert each dose into ultra-small particles that promote uniform distribution and enhanced bioavailability. The needle-free delivery format supports greater treatment flexibility and reliability as weight-management care expands into sustained, scalable models.

""Semaglutide and tirzepatide have become foundational therapies in weight management, and how they're delivered matters,"" noted Kurt Lunkwitz, BoomRx’s founder and president in a company news release.1 ""On the clinical side, nanoemulsion delivery provides an injection-free option designed for consistency and predictability—eliminating the performance peaks and troughs that come with using these products. On the distribution side, BoomRx ensures healthcare providers nationwide can quickly and easily fulfill prescriptions for these therapies through one streamlined portal.""

As the industry knows, demand for medical weight loss therapies is on the rise. Keeping that in mind, HCPs are prioritizing delivery formats that help address patient adherence and dosing challenges. By condensing particle sizes at the molecular level, the active ingredients are not only more evenly distributed, but more readily absorbed.

What’s new with oral semaglutide approval and market availability?

Oral semaglutide was approved by the FDA in December 2025 as a once-daily pill (25 mg), intended to limit excess body weight and help with weight maintenance. It officially hit the market earlier this month, and has since been added to both the Amazon Pharmacy and GoodRx networks.

This new version of Wegovy in pill form represents the first ever oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist therapy that’s been approved for weight management. It also now marks the third formulation of Wegovy, expanding its available options.

The GLP-1 agonist was initially approved in June 2021 for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or overweight who have at least one related condition, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol, alongside diet and exercise. In 2024, its label was further expanded to include adults with cardiovascular disease.

Tirzepatide—often known under the brand names Mounjaro and Zepbound—is yet to be approved orally, but is available as an injection.

How does BoomRx’s platform simplify prescribing and fulfillment for providers?

As for BoomRx's platform, HCPs are reportedly1 able to:

Compare formulations using one centralized dashboard

Simplify ordering and fulfillment via one secure login

Scale weight-management programs across both in-office and virtual care environments

""Our role is to remove friction from how healthcare providers source and manage therapies,"" Lunkwitz added. ""As delivery options evolve, BoomRx ensures access stays simple, efficient, and built for growth.""

Weekend AI News Briefs

Guest Post: Three GTM Challenges Killing Vertical AI Startups in 2026—And Why Market Shaping GTM Solves All of Them

As AI startup funding surges while enterprise IT budgets grow only marginally, most vertical AI startups face extinction not because of weak technology but because outdated SaaS go-to-market strategies no longer align with how enterprise buyers choose vendors. The guest post argues that in 2026, only startups that abandon volume-driven SaaS tactics and adopt “market shaping” approaches — focused on narrative control, third-party validation, and early proof — will survive enterprise budget consolidation. (AI Insider)

OpenAI Addresses ‘Capactity Overhang’ — What AI Can Do and How It’s Being Used

OpenAI argues that as AI capabilities advance faster than their real-world adoption, the central challenge for the Intelligence Age will be managing the growing “capability overhang” between what AI can do and the value society captures at scale. The company outlines principles focused on transparency, broad access to compute and tools, and user self-empowerment, contending that widespread, practical use of frontier AI is key to unlocking productivity gains, economic growth, and shared opportunity. (OpenAI)

Power, Connectivity and the Next Phase of the AI Supercycle

Today’s AI agents mark an early phase of a much longer AI supercycle that will ultimately push intelligence out of screens and into the physical world, requiring fundamentally new infrastructure, according to the World Economic Forum. As AI workloads strain power grids and outgrow internet-era architectures, the Forum argues that distributed compute and AI-native networks — capable of moving intelligence securely and reliably across data centres, metro regions, and the edge — will become the foundation for the next wave of real-world, physical AI. (World Economic Forum)

The Next AI Revolution Could Start with World Models

As AI systems increasingly falter by predicting what looks plausible rather than understanding how the world actually works, researchers are turning to “world models” that maintain a continuous, internal representation of space and time, Scientific American reports. Advances in 4D modeling — combining three-dimensional structure with temporal change — could stabilize AI-generated video, improve augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous systems, and may be a necessary building block toward more humanlike intelligence and eventual artificial general intelligence. (Scientific American)

Moxie Marlinspike Has a Privacy-Conscious Alternative to ChatGPT

As concerns grow that AI assistants will mirror the data-harvesting models of ad-driven platforms, Signal co-founder Moxie Marlinspike has launched Confer, a privacy-first chatbot designed so user conversations cannot be accessed, stored, or monetized, TechCrunch reports. The service uses end-to-end encryption, trusted execution environments, and open-weight models to block data collection by design, offering a higher-priced alternative for users willing to pay a premium to keep sensitive AI interactions private.

AI’s Future: Plotting a Path to Competitiveness and Digital Sovereignty

Europe’s push for digital sovereignty is colliding with a rapidly concentrating cloud and AI market dominated by a handful of U.S. hyperscalers, but the two goals need not be at odds, according to the World Economic Forum. The organization argues that a shift toward distributed, hybrid AI architectures — combining centralized model training with regional infrastructure and edge deployment — can allow countries and companies to capture economic value while preserving control over data, security, and strategic dependencies.

The agentic AI capability has been integrated with IBM OpenPages and the broader watsonx portfolio. e& said the deployment is intended to streamline compliance-related tasks, reduce response times and provide 24/7 self-service access across the organization, while maintaining explainability and auditability suitable for governance, risk and compliance environments.

The companies said a joint proof of concept was delivered within eight weeks by IBM, GBM (Gulf Business Machines) and e&. IBM’s Client Engineering team led the design and integration work, while GBM supported delivery through project coordination and its familiarity with e&’s existing OpenPages and watsonx Assistant environment. The proof of concept was positioned as a demonstration of agentic AI operating at enterprise scale under real-world conditions and within an established governance framework.

IBM noted that the initiative aligns with watsonx.governance, which is already in use at e&, and highlighted a hybrid deployment approach that allows large language models to run across hybrid environments, including customer-managed infrastructure, while remaining governed under enterprise controls. e& described the collaboration as a milestone in its enterprise AI journey and a foundation for broader agentic AI adoption across the organization.

KEY QUOTES:

“Our ambition is to move beyond isolated AI use cases toward enterprise-scale agentic AI that is trusted, governed, and deeply integrated into how the organization operates. By collaborating with IBM, we are embedding intelligence directly into our risk and compliance processes, enabling faster decisions, consistent policy interpretation, and a foundation for broader agentic AI adoption across the enterprise.”

Hatem Dowidar, Group CEO, e&

“As organizations move from experimenting with AI to embedding it into the fabric of how they operate, governance and accountability become just as important as intelligence. Through our collaboration with e&, this proof of concept intends to demonstrate how agentic AI can be designed and validated for enterprise-scale use, deeply integrated into core systems, governed by design, and trusted to support human-led decisions and outcomes.”",https://cdn.pulse2.com/cdn/2026/01/e-Logo.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 01:01:01.795001

Last year, we built off of our efforts to continue energizing and giving back to the city we call home — mobilizing employees, investing in public art and partnering with local nonprofits that meet pressing community needs across the city.

Read on to revisit highlights from 2025.

Rallying Companies to Volunteer Together

When we helped launch the Downtown Volunteer Coalition (DVC) with four other companies in 2024, the goal was simple: bring people back to our sidewalks through regular, hands‑on service. In 2025, that coalition more than doubled in size as six additional employers joined — Citizens, Crusoe Energy, FleishmanHillard, Google, the Golden State Warriors and the San Francisco Giants. All participating companies contributed to four cross‑company service days, 30 projects and more than 700 volunteers in the downtown area.

Painting the City With ‘These City Walls’

To mark the 25th anniversary of Community Day — and to add beauty, culture and color across our neighborhoods — we collaborated with 1AM Projects and local partners to commission 25 new murals citywide, including “Beneath the Bay,” completed down the street from our San Francisco headquarters in November. From Potrero Hill to Union Square, these murals are showing up across the city to bring energy to the neighborhoods that make our city thrive.

25 Years of Community Day

We marked LS&Co.’s 25th Community Day with nearly 600 San Francisco-based employees volunteering with 20 nonprofits in one day, alongside more than $150,000 in local grants. This annual day of service was a powerful snapshot of our commitment to our values, with employees working with long-time nonprofit partners across the city like AIDS Memorial Grove and the Homeless Prenatal Program, as well as new nonprofits like Booker T. Washington and San Francisco’s Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Showing Up for Pride in Our Hometown

Our employees showed up in a big way for San Francisco Pride, supporting programming and volunteer activations that celebrate the LGBTQ+ community and the culture that makes the city thrive. We were proud to once again sponsor the San Francisco Pride parade and show up for the community through city-wide pop-ups and events.

St. Anthony’s Partnership

To meet immediate clothing needs in the Tenderloin neighborhood and beyond, we formalized an ongoing donation cadence with St. Anthony’s Free Clothing Program to match supply with demand. St. Anthony’s Foundation provides essential services like meals, medical care, free clothing and pathways to stability for individuals and families in need. Programs such as the Free Clothing Program support thousands of people each year, helping to meet immediate needs and foster long-term well-being.

The donations have been warmly received, and we’ve continued to collaborate on volunteer opportunities for our employees.

Deepening Ties With Longstanding Partners

Throughout the year, we continued to support cultural institutions like the SF MOMA, Academy of Sciences, Fine Arts Museums and the Exploratorium, as well as became a proud sponsor of the annual Stern Grove festival. After the successful inaugural year of Downtown First Thursdays (DFT) in 2024 — of which LS&Co. was a key funder — we continued our support of DFT’s expansion to Front Street as well as the Downtown Development Corporation’s launch. We also kept up our engagement with organizations that are vital to San Francisco families and youth, including Larkin Street Youth Services and the Homeless Prenatal Program, helping their missions through grants and employee volunteering on Community Day and throughout the year.

Just the Beginning

As we look ahead, our commitment to San Francisco remains unwavering. Every mural, every volunteer hour, every partnership reflects our belief that thriving communities start with showing up — again and again. We’ve believed in this city for more than 170 years, and we look forward to continuing to show up.",https://www.levistrauss.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260120_LevisSanFranciscoHometown-700x424.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 02:59:01.121018

The acquisition follows an initial investment made 15 months ago and is part of Gushcloud’s broader strategy to scale its global creator management and monetisation platform, particularly in high-growth markets.

As part of the deal, TalentPlus will rebrand as Gushcloud TalentPlus, focusing on managing MENA creators for global representation while also representing and monetising international creators and intellectual property in the region.

Don't miss: Is the influencer agency space ripe for acquisitions?

Michel Chahda will continue as CEO of Gushcloud TalentPlus and will be appointed partner at Gushcloud International. In a statement, the company said the move strengthens its capabilities across reserved media, creator IP development and cross-border monetisation, supporting creators and brands looking to scale across Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, Europe and the United States.

Gay Carr, chief of staff at Gushcloud International, has also relocated to the UAE to co-lead the unit. She will continue overseeing Gushcloud’s multi-year partnership with the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO), which supports the establishment of Gushcloud’s regional headquarters for EMEA and India in Abu Dhabi.

The company said the partnership aligns with ADIO’s economic diversification goals, including building Abu Dhabi into a regional media and entertainment hub while supporting job creation and the growth of the digital creator ecosystem.

Gushcloud’s expansion comes amid strong growth in digital consumption across the region. According to Strategy&, digital content is projected to account for 46% of the region’s estimated US$22 billion media spend, while data from GlobalWebIndex shows MENA users maintain an average of 8.4 social media accounts and spend more than three hours daily on social platforms.

The acquisition strengthens Gushcloud’s footprint in MENA as competition intensifies among global creator management firms seeking scale, monetisation depth and cross-market reach.

“The UAE has done a great job in recent years marketing itself to creators and is becoming one of the most strategic markets globally for creators to live, work, play and build their businesses and family offices out of. Hence, this majority acquisition is a strategic step forward for us at Gushcloud to have more control in this large growing market that great adds value to the creator ecosystem that Gushcloud is building,” said Althea Lim, co-founder and group CEO of Gushcloud International.

She noted that Gushcloud’s earlier investment in TalentPlus laid the groundwork for a close working relationship with Chahda and his team, citing their deep regional experience, strong local relationships and creator-first approach. Lim added that bringing TalentPlus under majority ownership and appointing Chahda as a partner supports Gushcloud’s long-term ambition to scale its operations and deliver value for creators, brand partners and stakeholders across markets.

In tandem, Michael Chahda, CEO of Gushcloud TalentPlus said, ""Combining our local insights with Gushcloud’s global network, Gushcloud TalentPlus will enable us to create a global path and more monetisable opportunities for the creators we manage and represent exclusively.""

""With Gushcloud’s growing online media inventory , extensive marketing services, and proprietary AI and data tools and platforms, we can now provide accuracy for brands to connect more effectively to their audiences via the creators, allowing more ROI for the brands,"" he added.

The acquisition builds on Gushcloud’s earlier push into the region. In August last year, the company unveiled plans to expand into MENA with the launch of its regional headquarters in Abu Dhabi, backed by a multi-year partnership with the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO).

At the time, Gushcloud said the move would strengthen its presence in one of the world’s fastest-growing creator economies while supporting Abu Dhabi’s ambition to become a global media and entertainment hub. The partnership is aimed at scaling operations across the region, fostering innovation and supporting talent development, as the global creator economy continues its rapid growth.",https://marketing-interactive-assets.b-cdn.net/article_images/gushcloud-acquires-dubai-based-talent-and-influencer-firm-talentplus/1768868860_gushcloud.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 22:59:19.618790

A few months ago, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the company's backlog was in the range of $500 billion.
Taking this one step further, many of the hyperscalers are entering into multiyear agreements for their data center projects.
How much will Nvidia be worth by year-end?
By the end of 2026, I'm predicting that Nvidia could be worth anywhere between $7 trillion and $9 trillion.","When OpenAI commercially launched ChatGPT in November 2022, Nvidia (NVDA 0.29%) was worth about $345 billion. A little more than three years later, the semiconductor powerhouse is now worth $4.5 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world.

While Nvidia has emerged as the king of the generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom thus far, what if I told you the company's epic run was just getting started?

Below, I'll explore a number of catalysts it has for 2026 and break down how the company could notch its next trillion-dollar milestone by year-end.

Why 2026 could be another huge year for Nvidia

According to reporting from FactSet Research and Goldman Sachs, AI hyperscalers, including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and OpenAI could have up to $527 billion in capital expenditures (capex) this year.

A few months ago, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the company's backlog was in the range of $500 billion. However, management was quick to clarify his statement by saying that a portion of this backlog had already been recognized.

Nevertheless, the company's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, recently told investors that the order backlog is growing exponentially. This sounds reasonable considering that Nvidia recently signed a major deal with Anthropic, which will be using the company's new Vera Rubin chip architecture.

Also, Amazon Web Services (AWS) signed a $38 billion deal with OpenAI, which will be renting clusters of Nvidia's GPUs from the cloud provider. And the chipmaker just inked a $20 billion licensing deal with start-up Groq to bolster its inference offerings.

Precise figures are not known, but Wall Street's optimistic view suggests that Nvidia could generate between $320 billion and $330 billion in data center revenue in 2026.

Using that data center business as a proxy for broader AI capex budgets, it's not unreasonable to forecast the company capturing upward of 60% of big tech's infrastructure spending this year.

Taking this one step further, many of the hyperscalers are entering into multiyear agreements for their data center projects. Against this backdrop, Nvidia is positioned for long-term growth in the AI infrastructure era, gaining further revenue and profit visibility with each new deal signed.

Nvidia's valuation profile looks interesting

The chart below illustrates trends across Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) and forward P/S ratios throughout the AI revolution. As it indicates, both multiples have compressed over the last year and are hovering well below prior peaks seen over the last three years.

To me, this could suggest the market is beginning to value Nvidia like a maturing business as opposed to a hypergrowth stock. Below, I'll explain how the company can attain further valuation expansion even as its multiples continue to tighten.

How much will Nvidia be worth by year-end?

Although Nvidia is a diversified business, Wall Street analysts tend to dial in on just one segment: data centers. Over the last 12 months, it has generated $167 billion in data center revenue.

At its current market value, the company is valued at roughly 27 times its trailing-12-month data center sales. Should it execute on its growth plan this year and essentially double those sales, it would be worth almost $9 trillion, assuming its valuation profile stays the same.

Just for argument's sake, let's say the company's ratio between market cap and data center sales compresses closer to its overall forward P/S of 21. At this multiple, the business would be worth about $7 trillion.

The exercise above is simply a fun math exercise, but the key takeaway is that Nvidia is in position to generate further gains this year and beyond, even with its valuation multiples normalizing.

When you measure its growth and influence relative to other contributors to the AI boom in areas such as enterprise software or cloud computing, the company begins to look absurdly cheap.

By the end of 2026, I'm predicting that Nvidia could be worth anywhere between $7 trillion and $9 trillion. At the midpoint of this range, it could be trading for roughly $330 per share, implying more than 70% upside from current levels.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F851501%2Fnvidia-headquarters-with-nvidia-sign-in-front-11.png&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-19 21:00:30.244096

China Market Hurdle: H200 Production Paused A primary driver of the current weakness is the halted production of the H200 chip for the Chinese market.
In total, insiders have sold around 1.66 million shares over the past 90 days.
The suspension of H200 deliveries to China and heated trade rhetoric are applying short-term pressure on revenue prospects and market sentiment.","While U.S. markets were closed for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Nvidia's stock faced notable selling pressure in European trading. The shares declined by approximately 2.9% to €155.88 in Frankfurt. The downturn reflects a dual burden: fresh complications in the critical Chinese market and a broader deterioration in trade policy sentiment affecting the technology sector. This raises questions about the impact of these short-term headwinds on the company's powerful long-term growth narrative.

The negative sentiment in Europe was compounded by a rougher geopolitical climate. Reports of renewed U.S. tariff threats against European nations this morning triggered declines across the technology sector in Frankfurt and London. Nvidia's move was in sync with other major tech equities, with stocks like Microsoft and Alphabet also retreating by more than 2% during European sessions.

Analyst Confidence Contrasts with Near-Term Pressure

Despite the immediate negative price reaction, major financial institutions have recently reaffirmed or raised their longer-term assessments.

Jefferies: On January 16, analyst Blayne Curtis increased his price target from $250 to $275, maintaining a ""Buy"" rating. He cited an exceptionally strong product roadmap through 2028, featuring the Blackwell and Rubin platforms, which he believes will overshadow near-term disruptions.

Goldman Sachs: The firm maintains a $250 price target. It reiterated its positive view in November, underpinned by Nvidia's leading position in data centers and the persistently high demand for AI infrastructure.

Based on a recent U.S. closing price near $186, the Jefferies target of $275 implies an upside potential of roughly 47%. This suggests that a segment of institutional investors may view the current pullback as a temporary obstacle rather than a fundamental break in the company's trajectory.

Key Business Metrics and Market Context

Trading Environment: U.S. exchanges closed for holiday; European trading active.

Share Price: Approximately €155.88 in Frankfurt, down ~2.9%.

Financial Performance: Q3 revenue reached $57 billion, a 62% year-over-year increase, with a gross margin of 73.4%.

Valuation: The company commands a market capitalization exceeding $4.5 trillion and trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 46.

China Market Hurdle: H200 Production Paused

A primary driver of the current weakness is the halted production of the H200 chip for the Chinese market. Reports late last week indicated that suppliers suspended manufacturing after Chinese customs blocked deliveries of these high-performance semiconductors.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Nvidia?

Significant revenue is at stake. Current data suggests over 1 million orders from Chinese clients are now in limbo. While the U.S. government had previously approved exports subject to a 25% tariff, the new blockade from Beijing creates an additional hurdle and disrupts short-term delivery plans in a crucial growth region.

Insider and Institutional Activity Shows Mixed Signals

Recent filings reveal varied signals from corporate insiders and major investors. The last quarter saw notable insider selling: CEO Jensen Huang disposed of 75,000 shares worth approximately $13.9 million, while Executive Vice President Ajay Puri sold 200,000 shares valued at about $37.6 million. In total, insiders have sold around 1.66 million shares over the past 90 days.

Concurrently, institutional investors are adjusting their stakes. OLD Second National Bank of Aurora reduced its holding by 3.0%, and WESPAC Advisors SoCal LLC cut its position by 9.4%. These moves occur against the backdrop of Nvidia's massive valuation and high earnings multiple, which appear to be prompting selective profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing.

Outlook: Volatility Amid Structural Strength

Nvidia is navigating a period of elevated volatility heavily influenced by political factors. The suspension of H200 deliveries to China and heated trade rhetoric are applying short-term pressure on revenue prospects and market sentiment. However, these developments do not fundamentally challenge the company's structural positioning within the AI sector.

The combination of a premium valuation, robust growth (62% revenue increase last quarter), and geopolitical risks is likely to keep the share price susceptible to swings in the coming weeks. A key focus will be whether and how quickly a resolution emerges regarding exports to China, and if the analysts' raised medium-term price targets can hold firm given the evolving political landscape.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2436611_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 07:00:22.135016

That said, investors should still tread carefully. When a stock gets caught in a sustained downtrend or “freefall,” even solid fundamentals don’t always provide immediate support, and volatility can stay elevated longer than expected.

Because of that, this may be a smart time to start with a small position and scale in gradually as momentum improves and the price action begins to stabilize and recover. Overall, I’m moderately bullish on ADBE, but I think disciplined position sizing and patience are key here.

ADBE Offers Rare Value Against the Crowded AI Trade

It’s definitely tempting to try a short-term trade in Adobe right now—especially with the 14-day RSI sitting at an extremely oversold 23. A sharp rebound could easily deliver something like a 20% move within a month. But I’m not a technical trader, and I’d rather frame this opportunity through a medium-term, fundamentals-driven lens.

From a valuation standpoint, Adobe is starting to look unusually cheap. Its forward PEG ratio is roughly 40% below the sector median, which suggests the market may be pricing in a lot of pessimism. At the 2021 peak, using the all-time high close of $688.37 and FY2021 diluted EPS of $10.02, Adobe was trading around ~69x GAAP earnings.

Today, the setup looks very different. Based on management’s FY2026 midpoint guidance, EPS is implied to be roughly $18.00 GAAP and $23.40 non-GAAP, which puts Adobe at approximately ~17x forward GAAP earnings or ~13x forward non-GAAP earnings at the current price.

With consensus forecasts still calling for roughly 10% normalized EPS growth per year over the next several years, it’s hard to argue this kind of valuation discount will persist indefinitely. Yes, the software landscape is evolving quickly—AI is reshaping competition, raising new threats, and pressuring market share expectations. But that’s also exactly the kind of environment where value investors tend to step in, when sentiment gets too negative, and the downside risks look increasingly priced in.

Value Investors Pounce When Market Share Is at Risk

AI is rapidly changing the creative software landscape. Adobe has historically relied on a subscription model anchored to professional, repeatable workflows—but AI is now pushing the industry toward more usage-based economics, where value is increasingly tied to consumption rather than seats. Over time, that shift can put pressure on Adobe’s average revenue per user (ARPU), even as overall content creation volume continues to expand.

In Fiscal 2025, subscriptions accounted for roughly $22.9B of $23.8B in total revenue—about 96%—highlighting Adobe’s continued reliance on recurring revenue. Management has also pointed to the growing role of generative credits, including pay-per-use layers on top of subscriptions, which is an important evolution in the monetization model.

Meanwhile, Adobe’s annualized revenue run rate ended at $25.2B, up 11.5% year-over-year, suggesting the business remains fundamentally stable rather than weakening. The market, however, appears to be discounting a much more pessimistic long-term outcome well in advance.

At today’s valuation—under 13x free cash flow, based on FY2025 operating cash flow of roughly $10B minus capex of about $180 million—the downside case really hinges on clear, sustained evidence of ARPU deterioration. On the other hand, the upside doesn’t require a dramatic reacceleration—simple stability could be enough to rerate the stock. That’s why I increasingly see Adobe as an asymmetric setup, and it’s also why I remain moderately bullish on ADBE.

Why the Expensive Macroeconomy Is Punishing Adobe

Adobe is a classic long-term compounder with durable cash flows, which means the market tends to value it on earnings expected far into the future. In a pricey macro backdrop like today’s AI-driven boom, investors can often find acceptable returns in much safer assets.

As a result, predictable “steady growers” like ADBE frequently take the biggest hit because they were previously priced for “bond-like” growth. In other words, investors either rotate into genuinely low-risk bonds, or they move further out on the risk curve as valuations stretch—until the market ultimately forces a macro valuation reset.

Is ADBE a Good Buy Right Now?

On Wall Street, Adobe has a consensus Moderate Buy rating based on 16 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell. The average ADBE price target of $450.17 indicates a 52% upside potential over the next 12 months.

This is an extremely bullish outlook, but it’s important to note that consensus price targets have been revised downward as the stock has been declining over the past two years. Calling a bottom on this stock is tough, but it’s fair to say the value is great if investors are willing to tolerate some more downside before the tide shifts in the bulls’ favor.

ADBE is a Value Investment for the Brave

Adobe’s selloff is really a valuation reset without a fundamental breakdown, and that always spells opportunity. It’s a highly-profitable business that’s cash-generative and deeply embedded in professional creative workflows. Even as AI introduces real competitive pressure at the margin, Adobe is adapting to usage-based pricing dynamics and is likely to stay dominant.

At about 13x forward non-GAAP earnings and under 13x free cash flow, the market is already discounting a prolonged period of pressure on average revenue per user from strategic disruption. Thankfully, for value investors, that means the bar is low for upside. We only need to see durable evidence that revenue stability and margins are holding.

Fair enough, an expensive macro environment can punish boring, durable compounders like Adobe, but the stock is now priced for skepticism, and there’s clearly a large margin of safety in the valuation. Disciplined value investors can make money here, but staging a position rather than timing the precise bottom is wise, because it won’t be a straight line to the upside.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2543899675-750x406.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 20:59:42.579245

With no single headline event driving attention, U.S. Bancorp (USB) is drawing investor interest based on its recent performance, its value score of 4, and its core banking operations focused on U.S. consumers and institutions.

See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp.

The share price at $54.40 has largely treaded water in the very short term, while a 14.26% 90 day share price return and 17.45% 1 year total shareholder return indicate gradually improving momentum for U.S. Bancorp.

If this kind of steady banking performance interests you, it can be worth widening your research to other healthcare stocks that may respond differently to economic and interest rate trends.

With U.S. Bancorp trading at $54.40, a value score of 4 and an estimated intrinsic discount of 40.25% raise a clear question for investors: is this an undervalued bank stock, or is the market already pricing in future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 10.6% Undervalued

The widely followed narrative places U.S. Bancorp’s fair value at about US$60.84, above the last close of US$54.40, framing the current set up as moderately discounted.

The analysts have a consensus price target of $53.604 for U.S. Bancorp based on their expectations of its future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors. However, there is a degree of disagreement amongst analysts, with the most bullish reporting a price target of $67.0, and the most bearish reporting a price target of just $47.0.

Read the complete narrative.

Curious what sits behind that fair value gap? Revenue growth assumptions, margin shifts and a higher future P/E all play a part, but the exact mix might surprise you.

Result: Fair Value of $60.84 (UNDERVALUED)

Walmart is No. 2 in the Top 2000. The database is Digital Commerce 360’s ranking of North America’s online retailers by their annual ecommerce sales.

In addition, Walmart is No. 8 in the Global Online Marketplaces. That database ranks the top such marketplaces by third-party gross merchandise value (GMV).

Who are the new Walmart U.S. CEO and other executives?

Walmart credited Guggina with leading efforts to improve its delivery capabilities that expand serving to “95% of U.S. households in under three hours,” the retailer announced in a Jan. 16 press release. The company noted that his experience with ecommerce, as well as supply chain operations, were among his qualifications to take on the chief executive position for Walmart U.S.

“Over my 32 years with Walmart, I’ve seen that our people are our greatest competitive advantage,” Furner said in a released statement. “These internal promotions reflect our culture of opportunity and the depth of our leadership bench.”

Among those promotions, Seth Dallaire, the executive vice president and chief growth officer for Walmart U.S., was named as the new executive vice president and chief growth officer at Walmart Inc.

Walmart detailed his new responsibilities as including global enterprise platforms, which encompass Walmart Connect and digital advertising, Walmart+, Walmart Data Ventures, Vizio, Sam’s Club MAP and the Walmart Marketplace platform.

At Sam’s Club U.S., Chris Nicholas will leave his role as president and CEO to take over as president and CEO of Walmart International. In doing so, Nicholas will replace Kath McLay, who is leaving the company.

Meanwhile, Latriece Watkins will take on Nicholas’s previous duties as president and CEO of Sam’s Club U.S. Most recently, she has been executive vice president and chief merchandising officer at Walmart U.S.

Why is Walmart making changes to its executive team?

“These leadership changes also mark a key step in how we organize for the future,” Furner said.

Furner, who is scheduled to become president and CEO of Walmart on Feb. 1, described the changes as necessary for Walmart to be competitive. Moreover, he tied them to how Walmart is using artificial intelligence (AI) to update its operations and workforce. The new titles and responsibilities will be effective on the same day he takes over.

“Even the best teams need the right structure to win,” he stated. “As AI rapidly reshapes retail, we are centralizing our platforms to accelerate shared capabilities, freeing up our operating segments to be more focused on and closer to our customers and members.”

Dario Arfelli leads global marketing for Imaging Informatics at Philips, where cloud imaging is being framed less as an infrastructure shift and more as an operational correction. In conversations with clients and prospects, the discussion is more about time saved and access gained rather than the IT benefits of moving to the cloud.

Cloud Imaging, Workforce Pressure, and Time Back for Care

Radiology is becoming untethered…in a good way. More radiologists are reading remotely, freeing up valuable space in healthcare facilities.

As Arfelli puts it, “Before, radiologists were locked to the physical radiology department,” but now they have the freedom to operate from anywhere – a remote office, from home or in a different state. This is only possible with...

Rainer M. Blair, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""We are encouraged by our third quarter results.
It was a softer quarter as it posted a slight miss of analysts’ revenue estimates and a miss of analysts’ organic revenue estimates.

It was a strong quarter as it also produced an impressive beat of analysts’ organic revenue estimates and a narrow beat of analysts’ revenue estimates.","The end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Let’s take a look at how research tools & consumables stocks fared in Q3, starting with Danaher (NYSE:DHR).

The life sciences subsector specializing in research tools and consumables enables scientific discoveries across academia, biotechnology, and pharmaceuticals. These firms supply a wide range of essential laboratory products, ensuring a recurring revenue stream through repeat purchases and replenishment. Their business models benefit from strong customer loyalty, a diversified product portfolio, and exposure to both the research and clinical markets. However, challenges include high R&D investment to maintain technological leadership, pricing pressures from budget-conscious institutions, and vulnerability to fluctuations in research funding cycles. Looking ahead, this subsector stands to benefit from tailwinds such as growing demand for tools supporting emerging fields like synthetic biology and personalized medicine. There is also a rise in automation and AI-driven solutions in laboratories that could create new opportunities to sell tools and consumables. Nevertheless, headwinds exist. These companies tend to be at the mercy of supply chain disruptions and sensitivity to macroeconomic conditions that impact funding for research initiatives.

The 10 research tools & consumables stocks we track reported a mixed Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 1.1% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 1.3% below.

Thankfully, share prices of the companies have been resilient as they are up 7.3% on average since the latest earnings results.

Danaher (NYSE:DHR)

Born from a real estate investment trust that transformed into a manufacturing powerhouse, Danaher (NYSE:DHR) is a global science and technology company that provides specialized equipment, software, and services for biotechnology, life sciences, and diagnostics.

Despite the top-line beat, it was still a mixed quarter for the company with a beat of analysts’ EPS estimates but revenue guidance for next quarter missing analysts’ expectations significantly.

Rainer M. Blair, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""We are encouraged by our third quarter results. DBS-driven execution paired with continued momentum in our bioprocessing business and better-than-anticipated respiratory revenue at Cepheid enabled us to exceed our revenue, earnings and cash flow expectations.""

Key Takeaways

The Swedish krona gained 20.2% against the U.S. dollar in 2025, marking its biggest year of appreciation in decades.

Many major currencies appreciated against the dollar last year given steep policy uncertainty and increasing central bank reserve diversification.

Donald Trump’s trade war was a major driver of U.S. dollar weakness in 2025, pushing trade policy uncertainty to historic levels.

At the same time, U.S. dollars held in foreign central bank reserves fell to 20-year lows. Given these dynamics, several major currencies, from the Swedish krona to the Brazilian real saw double-digit gains against the U.S. dollar amid lower global demand.

This graphic shows the appreciation of major currencies against the greenback in 2025, based on data from Bloomberg via The Bulwark.

The Performance of Major Currencies Against the U.S. Dollar

Below, we show how numerous currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar in 2025:

CurrencyAppreciation in 2025 🇸🇪 Swedish Krona20.2% 🇲🇽 Mexican Peso15.6% 🇨🇭 Swiss Franc14.5% 🇿🇦 South African Rand13.8% 🇪🇺 Euro13.5% 🇩🇰 Danish Krone13.3% 🇳🇴 Norwegian Krone12.9% 🇧🇷 Brazilian Real12.8% 🇦🇺 Australian Dollar7.8% 🇬🇧 British Pound7.7% 🇸🇬 Singapore Dollar6.2% 🇨🇦 Canadian Dollar4.8% 🇹🇼 Taiwanese Dollar4.4% 🇳🇿 New Zealand Dollar2.8% 🇰🇷 South Korean Won2.2% 🇯🇵 Japanese Yen0.3%

With 20.2% gains, the Swedish krona saw its strongest performance against the dollar in decades.

The U.S. dollar weakened on softer economic data and policy expectations, and investors rebalanced into currencies like the krona amid relatively stronger Swedish growth prospects and economic fundamentals.

The Mexican peso had the second highest gains, strengthening 15.6% in 2025. This marked the best year since 1994, defying expectations given U.S. trade tensions. Among the factors underpinning the peso’s rise are resilient growth and macroeconomic stability.

Meanwhile, the South African rand rose 13.8% and the Brazilian real appreciated 12.8%.

Across Asian countries, the Singapore dollar increased 6.1%, serving as a “quasi safe haven” across the region. The global financial hub is known for its institutional strength and significant current account surplus, further supporting demand.

Charted: Asset Class Returns Across Eras (1990–2025)

See visuals like this from many other data creators on our Voronoi app. Download it for free on iOS or Android and discover incredible data-driven charts from a variety of trusted sources.

Key Takeaways

Private markets delivered the strongest long-term returns since 1990, but with the highest volatility.

Since 2020, gold has been the best-performing asset with an 18.4% annualized return.

Bonds have struggled in recent years as higher interest rates and inflation weigh on fixed-income returns.

Investment performance can vary widely depending on the time period analyzed. While equities and gold have delivered strong returns in recent years, bonds and some alternative assets have lagged, especially in the post-pandemic era of rising interest rates.

This graphic breaks down annualized returns and volatility across major asset classes over three distinct periods: long-term (1990–2025), mid-term (2010–2025), and the most recent cycle (2020–2025), using data from Goldman Sachs. Global equities and private markets exclude real estate, and data is as of September 2025.

ℹ️ Understanding volatility: Volatility measures how much an investment’s returns fluctuate year to year. For example, a volatility of 10% implies that returns typically move about 10 percentage points above or below the average in a given year. While higher volatility often accompanies higher returns, it also increases the risk of short-term losses.

Long-Term Returns by Asset Class: 1990–2025

Over the past 35 years, risk assets have significantly outperformed safer alternatives.

Private markets delivered the strongest annualized returns at 10.5%, although this came with substantial volatility of over 21%. Global equities also performed well, averaging just over 8% annually.

Bonds offered more modest but stable returns, while gold provided diversification benefits with mid-range returns and high volatility.

Post-Global Financial Crisis Asset Performance: 2010–2025

The period following the Global Financial Crisis was marked by low interest rates and strong equity performance.

Global equities saw annualized returns rise to 10.5%, while private markets continued to outperform public assets.

In contrast, sovereign bonds struggled as yields compressed, delivering less than 1% annual returns. Gold remained resilient during this era, with prices rising sharply from 2009 to 2012, before falling and stabilizing.

Post-Pandemic Asset Class Returns: 2020–2025

The most recent five-year period highlights a sharp divergence across asset classes.

Global equities delivered strong returns following the 2020 crash, despite market volatility.

Meanwhile, gold has been the best-performing asset amid rising inflation, geopolitical risks, and elevated interest rates, with prices hitting all-time highs twice since 2020.

Bonds experienced negative real and nominal performance as rapid interest rate hikes eroded prices. Rising inflation and high sovereign debt levels have put downward pressure on sovereign bond prices.

Furthermore, real estate has seen relatively low returns relative to medium- and long-term periods, with high mortgage rates dampening the demand for housing in many major markets.

Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?","Target Corporation TGT is treating fiscal 2026 as an inflection year, accelerating investment behind its store fleet, digital capabilities and operating model after several years of volatile discretionary demand. Management acknowledged that the company is not yet where it wants to be, but is reorganizing around a more modern retail architecture designed to restore relevance and growth.

Capital spending will rise to roughly $5 billion in fiscal 2026, up from $4 billion this year, with dollars directed toward technology upgrades, category resets, new larger-format stores and an expanded remodel program. Management noted that remodels continue to drive reliable sales lifts, while new stores are outperforming internal expectations.

Technology modernization is central to the turnaround. Target is deploying machine learning and AI-enabled tools to improve forecasting, in-stocks and personalization, as well as to compress time from trend identification to shelf. Early progress was visible in the fiscal third quarter, as the availability of the company’s top-selling SKUs improved by more than 150 basis points year over year.

Store presentation will follow suit. Target plans its most significant floor pad transformation in 10 years, with resets in Home, Baby, Beauty and Fun 101. These changes are intended to elevate discretionary storytelling and reassert design-led merchandising, areas that have historically distinguished the brand.

To support the new model, headquarters staffing has been reduced by roughly 1,800 roles, streamlining decision-making and accelerating the merchant workflow. If executed effectively, TGT’s 2026 investments could restore discretionary momentum and position the company for a more competitive cycle, defined by improved availability, stronger store experience and tighter merchandising discipline.

WMT & BBY Boost Digital Initiatives as TGT Builds Tech Infrastructure

Walmart Inc. WMT advanced its Digital initiatives to deliver more personalized, multi-modal and contextual app experiences in the third quarter of fiscal 2026. Walmart is also using AI to improve software development, where more than 40% of new code is now AI-generated or AI-assisted, and to help associates build skills through OpenAI certifications and ChatGPT Enterprise access. Moreover, Walmart is leveraging a partnership with OpenAI so customers can purchase items directly through ChatGPT, making shopping more seamless and connected across channels.

Best Buy Co., Inc. BBY advanced its digital initiatives in the third quarter of fiscal 2026 by driving app use, expanding personalization and improving online experiences, including enhanced TV shopping and faster delivery options. The company also strengthened its new online marketplace with above 1,000 sellers and 11X more SKUs, while Best Buy continued boosting fulfillment efficiency and return convenience to elevate the omnichannel journey.

Andy Beshear and a delegation from Team Kentucky will travel to Europe this week to Finland and Sweden and to attend the World Economic Forum in Switzerland to support future investment, job-creation and economic development opportunities in the commonwealth.

The trip comes just after the announcement that Kentucky scored its second-best year on record for new private sector investments in 2025 — $10.5 billion in projects from 185 new-location and expansion announcements projected to create nearly 9,600 full-time jobs. Last year also saw rising wages across the state, as the average incentivized hourly wage was $29.58 in 2025, the highest on record, and topped $26 in four consecutive years for the first time.

“The commonwealth’s economy is as strong as it has ever been, and that momentum is carrying over into 2026 as we continue to work toward our goal of building a brighter future for all Kentuckians,” said Gov. Andy Beshear. “The World Economic Forum presents a unique opportunity to meet with business leaders from around the world at one location – an opportunity that otherwise would not be possible. I am excited to show the world that our New Kentucky Home is the best place to invest, do business, live and work as we build on our record-breaking success.”

The World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2026 will center on the theme “A Spirit of Dialogue,” with primary topics focusing on collaboration, economic resilience and competitiveness, ethics and workforce disruption, sustainability, and deployment of transformative technologies. The annual invitation-only event, established in 1973, has grown to become a major international networking opportunity and one of the world’s largest assemblies of global decision-makers, with thousands of government, business and civic leaders representing over 125 countries participating.

Team Kentucky’s participation provides an opportunity to build on Kentucky’s extensive international presence, which currently includes 524 foreign-owned facilities that employ over 110,000 Kentuckians. The commonwealth ranks third nationally for Foreign Direct Investment employment as a percentage of total employment.

The Governor and his team are currently scheduled to meet with about 260 business leaders, as well as 16 companies with existing Kentucky facilities that employ over 13,600 workers as well as eight prospective companies with projects that include nearly 650 proposed jobs.

Gov. Beshear will also visit with leadership from various overseas companies during the trip, including DHL Group, a global leader in mail, delivery and logistics. In 2024, its company DHL Express announced the groundbreaking of a new state-of-the-art aviation maintenance facility at CVG Airport in Northern Kentucky, a $292 million investment creating 300 new, full-time jobs.

The governor’s visit to Europe will build on the best six-year period for economic growth in state history.

Since the beginning of his administration, Gov. Beshear has announced more than 1,300 private-sector new-location and expansion projects totaling over $45 billion in announced investments, creating more than 68,000 jobs. This is the highest investment figure secured during the tenure of any governor in the commonwealth’s history and $24 billion more than the next highest total.

Gov. Beshear has announced some of the largest economic development projects in state history, which have solidified Kentucky as the battery capital of the United States: AESC’s $2 billion, 2,000-job gigafactory project in Warren County; Ford Motor Co.’s $2 billion, 2,200-job commitment in Louisville, as well as its $2 billion, 2,100-job project at the Kentucky 1 plant in Hardin County; Shelbyville Battery Manufacturing’s $712 million investment, creating 1,572 jobs in Shelby County; and Toyota’s $1.3 billion investment in Scott County, among others.

The Governor’s administration also secured the largest General Fund budget surplus and Rainy Day Fund. In 2023, Kentucky recorded over 2 million jobs filled for the first time ever and has stayed above that number ever since.

Kentucky also secured rating increases from major credit rating agencies Fitch Ratings, S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service.

Last year, Site Selection magazine ranked Kentucky in the top five nationally and second in the South Central region for economic development projects per capita in its 2024 Governor’s Cup rankings.

Bentonville-based retail giant Walmart announced on Jan. 16 that Latriece Watkins, EVP and chief merchandising officer for Walmart U.S., was named president and CEO of Sam’s Club U.S.

A native of McGehee, Watkins started her career with Walmart as an intern in 1997. Among her many successes, she reshaped the Walmart U.S. assortment strategy, drove operational excellence and ensured a consistent, trusted shopping experience. Watkins has held a wide range of leadership roles across Sam’s Club, Walmart U.S. merchandising, people and U.S. store operations.

Watkins has been widely recognized for her leadership and influence in the retail industry. She has been featured in Essence Magazine, named to FORTUNE Magazine’s “Ones to Watch” list and Mass Market Retailer’s Most Influential Women in Retail, and received the inaugural Madam C.J. Walker Award for Excellence in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. She was also inducted into the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame in 2025.

The change is part of a leadership shuffle in the wake of last year’s announcement that John Furner would take over as president and chief executive officer of Walmart Inc. Via a release, Furner said the new executive leaders would help fuel innovation and drive a new era of retail.

“Over my 32 years with Walmart, I’ve seen that our people are our greatest competitive advantage. These internal promotions reflect our culture of opportunity and the depth of our leadership bench,” he said.

“These leadership changes also mark a key step in how we organize for the future. Even the best teams need the right structure to win. As AI rapidly reshapes retail, we are centralizing our platforms to accelerate shared capabilities, freeing up our operating segments to be more focused on and closer to our customers and members.”

Watkins will take over in her new role Feb. 1. Other executive changes announced Jan. 16 include:

Seth Dallaire, EVP and chief growth officer for Walmart U.S., is being named EVP and chief growth officer for Walmart Inc.

David Guggina, EVP and chief ecommerce officer for Walmart U.S., will become president and CEO of Walmart U.S.

A US district judge ruled in 2024 that the technology company had monopolised online search and text advertising through exclusive distribution agreements that made Google the default option for users.

Responding to the ruling on Friday, Google said it “ignored the reality that people use Google because they want to, not because they’re forced to.” The company also argued that the judgment failed to reflect the competitive nature of the market.

“The decision failed to account for the rapid pace of innovation and intense competition we face from established players and well-funded start-ups,” Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs, wrote in a blog post.

As part of the appeal process, Google has asked District Court Judge Amit Mehta to pause an order requiring the company to share certain data with competitors, a measure intended to create more balance in the online search market. In a court filing, Google said complying with the data-sharing requirement before the appeal is resolved could result in the loss of trade secrets.

The data-sharing order was issued alongside the judge’s rejection of a request from the US government that Google be required to sell its Chrome web browser. At the time, the judge said Google must make available to “qualified competitors” search index data and user interaction information that rivals could use to improve their services.

Google said it is not seeking to delay other elements of the court’s earlier orders, including those related to privacy and security safeguards for user data. “Although Google believes that these remedies are unwarranted and should never have been imposed, it is prepared to do everything short of turning over its data or providing syndicated results and ads while its appeal is pending,” the company said.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/bmi/media/media_files/GxJKjHWNl8xtNTuEkqd2.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 00:00:33.010437

According to the exec's statements, ""most"" customers are already running operations based on current-gen ""Grace Blackwell"" GB200 and GB300, but Yang believes that common architectural traits will make transitions—onto the next-gen platform—much easier than before.

Industry observers have highlighted possible issues of moving from the ""Grace Blackwell"" chiplet-based design to the advanced packaging of ""Vera Rubin."" During CES, NVIDIA announced that full production of server-grade ""Vera"" CPUs and ""Rubin"" GPUs had kicked off. This Q1 2026 initiation has happened well ahead of a previous ""by H2 2026"" mass manufacturing goal. Team Green's forthcoming ""Vera Rubin"" NVL72 SuperCluster is classed as a premier rack-scale system. A larger ""NVL144"" variant was previewed last year, but this CPX platform seems to be further out from release. According to a mid-October report, an involved manufacturing partner was weighing up a loose ""2026 volume production"" window.

Once a steady, century-old stalwart known for its dominance in the insulin market, Lilly has undergone a metamorphosis, evolving into a $1 trillion cardiometabolic powerhouse. The company’s trajectory has been propelled by a class of drugs known as GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists, specifically tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for obesity.

Today, Lilly sits at the center of a global health revolution. With obesity now recognized as a chronic, treatable disease rather than a lifestyle choice, the demand for its medications has outstripped even the most optimistic projections. This deep dive explores how Lilly is not just riding a wave of demand but is fundamentally rebuilding its supply chain and R&D engine to maintain its lead in what analysts expect to be a $150 billion obesity market by 2030.

Historical Background

Founded in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical chemist and American Civil War veteran, the company was built on a foundation of quality and innovation. Based in Indianapolis, Indiana, Lilly’s early years were marked by being the first company to mass-produce the polio vaccine and, more pivotally, the first to commercialize insulin in the 1920s.

Throughout the 20th century, Lilly solidified its ""Big Pharma"" status with blockbuster psychiatric medications like Prozac (fluoxetine), which transformed the treatment of depression in the 1980s. However, the 2010s were a period of ""patent cliff"" anxiety, as the company faced the loss of exclusivity for major earners like Cymbalta and Zyprexa. Under the leadership of David Ricks, who became CEO in 2017, the company pivoted sharply back toward high-science, high-risk R&D in oncology, immunology, and metabolic health, setting the stage for its current dominance.

Business Model

Eli Lilly operates as a pure-play, innovation-driven pharmaceutical company. Unlike some peers that have diversified into consumer health (like Johnson & Johnson) or animal health, Lilly is focused entirely on human medicine across four core pillars:

Metabolic Health: The largest segment, encompassing the incretin franchise (Mounjaro/Zepbound) and its legacy insulin business (Humalog/Jardiance).

Oncology: Driven by Verzenio, a breast cancer drug, and a growing pipeline of targeted therapies.

Immunology: Centered around Taltz and Olumiant for autoimmune conditions.

Neuroscience: A resurgent sector following the approval of Kisunla (donanemab) for Alzheimer’s disease.

The company’s model is predicated on high R&D reinvestment (typically over 25% of revenue) to create proprietary, high-margin biologics that provide significant clinical benefits over existing standards of care.

Stock Performance Overview

Lilly’s stock performance over the last five years has been nothing short of historic. As of early 2026, the stock trades in the $1,030 – $1,080 range, reflecting a staggering transformation in valuation.

1-Year Performance: LLY is up approximately 38%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. This growth was driven by the resolution of supply chain bottlenecks and clinical trial successes for its next-generation obesity drugs.

5-Year Performance: Investors have seen returns exceeding 500%. In 2021, LLY was trading around $160; by late 2025, it became the first pharmaceutical company to cross the $1 trillion market cap threshold.

10-Year Performance: Long-term shareholders have enjoyed a ""ten-bagger"" return, as the stock grew from roughly $80 in 2016 to over $1,000 today, fueled by the strategic shift initiated by CEO David Ricks.

Financial Performance

In the preliminary data for FY 2025, Eli Lilly has demonstrated the financial profile of a high-growth tech stock rather than a traditional drugmaker.

Revenue: Projected at $63.0 – $63.5 billion for 2025, a massive increase from the $34 billion reported in 2023.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): Estimated at $23.00 – $23.70 (non-GAAP) for the full year 2025.

Margins: Operating margins have expanded significantly as manufacturing scale-up began to drive down per-unit costs for tirzepatide.

Valuation: With a trailing P/E ratio hovering near 50x, the market is pricing in sustained 20%+ annual growth, a rarity for a company of its size.

Cash Flow: Operating cash flow has been redirected into a $55 billion multi-year capital expenditure program to build ""the most advanced bio-manufacturing network in the world.""

Leadership and Management

David A. Ricks, Chairman and CEO, is widely credited with Lilly’s current success. His strategy has been twofold: ruthlessly prioritizing the pipeline and aggressively investing in manufacturing. Ricks is supported by a seasoned executive team, including CFO Anat Ashkenazi, who has managed the company’s massive capital deployments with surgical precision.

The board of directors and management team have earned a reputation for being ""long-term greedy""—willing to sacrifice short-term earnings to build the capacity needed to serve hundreds of millions of patients. This is evidenced by their decision to continue investing in Alzheimer's research for three decades despite multiple failures, eventually resulting in the approval of Kisunla.

Products, Services, and Innovations

Lilly’s innovation engine is currently the envy of the industry.

The Incretin Franchise

Mounjaro/Zepbound (Tirzepatide): A dual GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonist. As of early 2026, this franchise is on track for a $40 billion annual run rate.

Retatrutide (""Triple G""): A triple agonist (GLP-1, GIP, and Glucagon) currently in Phase 3. Data from late 2025 showed weight loss approaching 29%—a figure previously only achievable through bariatric surgery.

Orforglipron: A non-peptide, oral GLP-1. This ""obesity pill"" is expected to receive FDA approval by April 2026. Because it is a small molecule, it can be manufactured more cheaply and at higher volumes than injectable biologics.

Beyond Obesity

Kisunla (Donanemab): A cornerstone of Lilly’s neuroscience portfolio, targeting amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s.

LillyDirect: A first-of-its-kind direct-to-consumer digital health platform that allows patients to obtain prescriptions and medications directly from the manufacturer, bypassing traditional pharmacy middle-men.

Competitive Landscape

Lilly’s primary rival is the Danish firm Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO), the maker of Wegovy and Ozempic. The two companies currently operate as a duopoly in the GLP-1 space. However, the landscape is shifting in 2026:

The Challenger Group: Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) and Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) are advancing ""me-too"" or ""next-gen"" injectables.

The Oral Entrants: Roche (OTC: RHHBY) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) are racing to bring oral obesity pills to market, though Lilly’s Orforglipron is currently the frontrunner in the oral small-molecule race.

Lilly's Edge: Lilly’s dual and triple agonist approach (Tirzepatide/Retatrutide) has consistently shown superior weight loss efficacy compared to Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide.

Industry and Market Trends

The ""Metabolic Supercycle"" is the defining trend of 2026. Obesity is now being treated as the ""gateway condition"" for dozens of other diseases, including sleep apnea, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis).

Supply chain resilience has also become a major competitive moat. After two years of shortages, Lilly’s decision to build its own API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) plants in Indiana and Ireland has given it a ""volume advantage"" over competitors who rely more heavily on contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) like Catalent.

Risks and Challenges

Despite the euphoria, Lilly faces several headwinds:

Pricing Legislation: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the U.S. remains a threat, with Medicare price negotiations for top-selling drugs potentially impacting Mounjaro by late 2027.

Manufacturing Complexity: Building $50 billion worth of factories is prone to delays and cost overruns. Any contamination or regulatory citation (Form 483) at a major site could stall growth.

Long-term Safety: While GLP-1s are generally safe, the ""mass-exposure"" of hundreds of millions of people to these drugs means that even a rare side effect could become a major liability.

Competition and Commoditization: As more oral pills enter the market, pricing for the obesity category may experience a ""race to the bottom"" in the late 2020s.

Opportunities and Catalysts

Orforglipron Approval (April 2026): This is the most significant near-term catalyst. If approved, it opens the door to the primary care market and emerging economies where cold-chain injection infrastructure is lacking.

New Indications: Expect 2026 to bring Phase 3 data for tirzepatide in treating obstructive sleep apnea and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

M&A Potential: With a massive cash pile, Lilly is expected to acquire small-cap biotech firms specializing in ""next-next-gen"" therapies, such as muscle-sparing obesity drugs.

Investor Sentiment and Analyst Coverage

Wall Street remains overwhelmingly bullish. Institutional ownership is high, with major firms like BlackRock and Vanguard treating LLY as a ""must-own"" growth-at-any-price asset. Retail sentiment is equally strong, fueled by the ""LillyDirect"" consumer-facing brand and the undeniable physical results seen by millions of patients.

Recent analyst notes from firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have raised price targets to the $1,300 range, citing the ""unlimited"" TAM (Total Addressable Market) for metabolic health.

Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

Regulatory focus in 2026 is centered on the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act (TROA), which aims to expand Medicare coverage for obesity medications. If fully passed, it would unlock a massive demographic of patients currently paying out-of-pocket.

Geopolitically, Lilly is diversifying away from Chinese manufacturing. Its massive investments in Germany and the U.S. (""Lilly in America"") are designed to insulate the company from potential trade conflicts or supply chain disruptions in Asia.

Conclusion

Eli Lilly has transitioned from a traditional pharmaceutical company into a generational growth story. By the start of 2026, it has successfully addressed the supply shortages that plagued its 2024 launch and is now pivoting toward a high-volume, multi-platform strategy involving both injectables and oral pills.

While the $1 trillion valuation brings increased scrutiny and higher stakes, Lilly’s aggressive capital expenditure and ""best-in-class"" pipeline data suggest it is well-positioned to remain the dominant force in healthcare. Investors should closely watch the April 2026 FDA decision on Orforglipron and the speed at which the Indiana manufacturing complex comes online. In the long run, Lilly is not just selling a drug; it is selling a solution to one of the most pressing health crises of the 21st century.

Otros simplemente es pura curiosidad. Y algunos, los más interesantes, van de confiar. De esto último iba precisamente el que le propusieron a la periodista y presentadora María Casado desde L’Oréal Paris. El punto de partida: probar durante dos meses la crema de día Revitalift Laser y comprobar, desde la transparencia y el rigor científico, hasta dónde puede llegar una fórmula antiedad bien diseñada. Y sí: también de confiar en la ciencia.

Casado no solo aceptó el desafío, sino que lo hizo desde el corazón de la investigación científica: los propios laboratorios de L’Oréal Paris en París. Y lo hizo para poder entender y después, vivir en su propia piel, todo lo que hay detrás de uno de los tratamientos antiedad más icónicos de la marca.

De la mano de Elisabeth Bouhadana, directora científica global de L’Oréal Paris, María Casado pasó primero por un diagnóstico avanzado del estado de su piel antes de empezar el tratamiento. El objetivo era documentar de forma objetiva el antes y el después.

Durante las ocho semanas posteriores, su rutina fue constante: la crema de día Revitalift Laser. Le acompañó durante la experiencia la tecnología de análisis dérmico Visia, un sistema de alta precisión capaz de evaluar arrugas, textura, firmeza y luminosidad. El reto no iba de documentar opiniones o percepciones subjetivas, sino de documentarlo a través de imágenes, datos y mucha ciencia.

Revitalift Laser

Además de María Casado, el otro protagonista de esta historia es un producto que lleva años reinventando el cuidado antiedad. La icónica crema de día Revitalift Laser es el corazón de la gama de L’Oréal que está inspirada en los procedimientos de medicina estética y pensada para actuar de forma intensiva pero accesible sobre los signos visibles del envejecimiento.

Su fórmula combina Pro-Retinol, Ácido Hialurónico, Vitamina Cg y Pro-Xylane, que son activos de referencia en dermatología cosmética y que trabajan juntos para ofrecer una triple acción antiedad. Por un lado, corrige arrugas gracias a la adenosina y al ácido hialurónico fragmentado; retexturiza y redensifica la piel, mejorando visiblemente su calidad tras su uso y además, remodela el rostro, ya que redefine el contorno facial y devuelve la firmeza en las zonas donde más se necesita.

Los resultados

Según los estudios clínicos de la marca* (y la experiencia de María Casado) los efectos son progresivos pero claros desde el primer uso. Se nota la piel más hidratada al momento y la textura, mejorada. Arrugas y líneas de expresión comienzan a reducirse en una semana y tras cuatro semanas de uso, la piel se ve más luminosa y firme. A las 8 semanas, los resultados que ya se ven en el espejo, son confirmados también por la tecnología.

Y es que cuando la innovación se une a una rutina diaria y constante que además está bien formulada, hay traducción directa en la piel.

As a result, the actual first-week sales performance could be meaningfully higher, underscoring the potential strength of the oral Wegovy launch trajectory.
It has priced oral Wegovy at $149 per month (without insurance).
Against this backdrop, Novo Nordisk’s launch of oral Wegovy gives it a first-mover advantage in the oral GLP-1 segment, positioning the company to regain market share from Lilly and drive incremental revenues.
During the same time frame, Novo Nordisk’s 2026 earnings estimates have declined from $3.65 to $3.52.","Shares of Novo Nordisk NVO rose 9.1% on Friday after the company reportedly recorded strong early prescription trends just one week following the early-January U.S. launch of the oral version of its blockbuster GLP-1 therapy, Wegovy (semaglutide). The pill, approved in late December for obesity and cardiovascular risk reduction, is reportedly seeing robust initial demand, signaling an encouraging early uptake in the U.S. market.

The available prescription data reportedly reflects only retail channel activity and excludes volumes from Novo Nordisk’s direct-to-consumer online pharmacy, NovoCare. As a result, the actual first-week sales performance could be meaningfully higher, underscoring the potential strength of the oral Wegovy launch trajectory.

Please note that the Wegovy pill is the first oral GLP-1 drug to be approved in the United States, ushering in a new era of obesity treatment. The pill includes the same active ingredient — semaglutide — contained in NVO’s Wegovy and Ozempic injections (for type II diabetes). It has priced oral Wegovy at $149 per month (without insurance).

Eli Lilly LLY is Novo Nordisk’s arch-rival in the obesity space, which markets its tirzepatide (GLP-1) injections as Mounjaro (for type II diabetes) and Zepbound (for obesity). LLY has also filed a regulatory application seeking FDA approval for its oral GLP-1 drug, called orforglipron, for obesity. However, last week, the FDA reportedly delayed its decision on orforglipron to April 10 from the prior expectation of late March.

Daily oral obesity pills are expected to emerge as a more convenient and potentially lower-cost alternative to once-weekly injectables, such as Lilly’s Zepbound and Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy, lowering treatment burden and expanding patient adoption. With scalable manufacturing and broader appeal, Goldman Sachs estimates oral GLP-1 pills could generate about $22 billion in sales by 2030, or roughly 25% of a projected $95 billion global obesity drug market. Against this backdrop, Novo Nordisk’s launch of oral Wegovy gives it a first-mover advantage in the oral GLP-1 segment, positioning the company to regain market share from Lilly and drive incremental revenues. While analysts had expected Eli Lilly to close the gap quickly following a potential FDA approval of orforglipron in 2026, the latest delay puts LLY a step behind in the obesity pill race and gives Novo Nordisk additional time to strengthen its foothold in the oral obesity market.

Additionally, the regulatory body in the United Kingdom announced on Friday the approval of a 7.2 mg dose of Wegovy injection, which Novo Nordisk claims provides an option for “greater weight loss potential” than what is being offered by the available doses. This also likely contributed to the stock price gain as the improved efficacy profile could prompt physicians and patients to reconsider treatment choices, potentially shifting demand away from Lilly’s Zepbound toward the higher-dose Wegovy. Similar filings are also currently being reviewed in the United States and the EU. Favorable outcomes could improve NVO’s growth trajectory in the injectable treatment franchise.

Competition Heating Up in the Obesity Space

Eli Lilly is Novo Nordisk’s fierce competitor in the obesity space. Like NVO, Lilly is investing broadly in obesity and has several new molecules currently in clinical development with a range of oral and injectable medications with different mechanisms of action. Apart from orforglipron, LLY’s late-stage pipeline includes retatrutide, a GGG triagonist, as well as mid-stage candidates, including bimagrumab, eloralintide and mazdutide.

The obesity space has garnered much of the spotlight over the past year due to the sizeable and still underpenetrated market opportunity. Smaller biotech firms, like Viking Therapeutics VKTX, are also advancing GLP-1–based therapies to challenge the incumbents. Viking Therapeutics is developing its dual GIP/GLP-1 RA, VK2735, both as oral and subcutaneous formulations for the treatment of obesity. Last year, VKTX started two late-stage studies evaluating the subcutaneous formulation of VK2735. While one of these studies completed enrolment in November 2025 at a rapid pace, Viking Therapeutics expects to complete enrolment in the other study by the end of this quarter.

NVO Stock’s Price, Valuation & Estimates

In the past six months, Novo Nordisk shares have lost 4% against the industry’s 23.6% growth. The company has also underperformed the sector and the S&P 500 during the same time frame, as seen in the chart below.

The company unveiled the strategy at the CES trade show in Las Vegas, alongside a slate of new products that lean heavily on artificial intelligence, faster displays and custom hardware.

HyperX will now serve as HP’s end-to-end gaming brand, spanning laptops, monitors, controllers and software, the company said.

The move brings together two names HP has spent years building — OMEN for gaming PCs and displays, and HyperX for accessories — under one banner as rivals such as Lenovo Group Ltd.’s Legion and Dell Technologies Inc.’s Alienware expand tightly integrated ecosystems.

“Gamers deserve a seamless experience that matches their passion, from the systems that power their worlds to the gear that connects them,” Josephine Tan, senior vice president and division president of personal systems gaming solutions at HP, said in a statement.

At the center of HP’s CES lineup is the HyperX OMEN MAX 16, a new flagship gaming laptop that the company says is its most powerful to date. The machine is designed to deliver up to 300 watts of total platform power, a jump from the previous generation, using Intel’s Core Ultra 200HX processors or next-generation AMD Ryzen AI chips paired with Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 5090 laptop GPU.

HP said the device relies on a fully internal cooling system, including a redesigned OMEN Tempest Cooling Pro architecture with a third fan, to sustain performance during extended gaming sessions.

The laptop also features a high-polling-rate keyboard aimed at reducing input lag and an OLED display option with a 240-hertz refresh rate.

Artificial intelligence plays a bigger role this generation. HP is positioning its OMEN AI software as a one-click optimisation tool that automatically tunes operating system, hardware and in-game settings to boost frame rates, removing the need for manual configuration.

The company also expanded its display portfolio with the HyperX OMEN OLED 34, a 34-inch ultrawide monitor built on next-generation V-stripe QD-OLED panel technology.

The monitor offers a 360-hertz refresh rate and near-instant response times, targeting competitive players as well as creators who need accurate color reproduction. Features such as USB-C power delivery and a built-in KVM switch are aimed at users juggling multiple devices.

On the peripherals side, HP introduced the HyperX Clutch Tachi, its first Xbox-licensed arcade-style controller. The leverless controller uses magnetic switches and supports extensive customization through HP’s NGENUITY software, including user-designed modifications produced via 3D printing.

HP also previewed a more experimental product: an in-development HyperX gaming headset created with neurotechnology startup Neurable.

The headset uses electroencephalography sensors and AI to interpret brain activity in real time, with the goal of helping players improve focus and accuracy — an early signal of how HP sees neuroscience intersecting with gaming.

The new products are expected to be available in the spring through HP’s website, with pricing to be announced closer to launch.

For HP, which has been working to revive demand in a sluggish PC market, gaming remains one of the more resilient segments.",https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Untitled-design-2025-10-22T132600.062-1.png,N,,2026-01-19 11:08:40.729385

Following the successful spin-off of its consumer health division, Kenvue, JNJ has fully transitioned into a high-growth, pure-play healthcare powerhouse focused exclusively on Innovative Medicine and Medical Technology (MedTech).

Today, the company is in the spotlight not for Band-Aids or Tylenol, but for its aggressive pivot into high-complexity surgical robotics, life-saving cardiovascular devices, and a pharmaceutical pipeline that is successfully navigating a historic ""patent cliff."" With its recent acquisitions of Abiomed and Shockwave Medical now fully integrated, and the highly anticipated Ottava robotic system nearing the final stages of regulatory approval, JNJ is positioned to define the next decade of healthcare delivery. This article explores how JNJ is balancing legacy litigation risks with a bold 2026 growth strategy.

Historical Background

Founded in 1886 by three brothers in New Brunswick, New Jersey, Johnson & Johnson’s early identity was forged in the development of sterile surgical dressings and the first commercial first-aid kits. For over a century, the company functioned as a decentralized conglomerate, often referred to as a ""broad-based"" healthcare giant.

The 20th century saw JNJ expand into pharmaceuticals (founding Janssen Pharmaceutica) and medical devices (acquiring DePuy and Ethicon). However, the most significant transformation in the company’s history occurred in August 2023, when JNJ finalized the separation of its Consumer Health business. This maneuver allowed the ""New J&J"" to shed its slower-growing retail segments to focus capital and R&D on the high-margin, high-innovation sectors of biologics and specialized medical hardware. This evolution marks a return to the company’s high-science roots while maintaining the operational discipline that has made it one of the few AAA-rated corporations in the world.

Business Model

Johnson & Johnson operates through two primary segments, having streamlined its operations to maximize agility and returns:

Innovative Medicine (formerly Pharmaceuticals): This segment generates approximately 65% of total revenue. It focuses on six core therapeutic areas: Oncology, Immunology, Neuroscience, Cardiovascular/Metabolism, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Infectious Diseases. The model relies on ""blockbuster"" biologics and a robust R&D engine to replace revenues lost to patent expirations.

Medical Technology (MedTech): Accounting for the remaining 35% of revenue, this segment is a global leader in Surgery, Orthopaedics, Vision, and Interventional Solutions. Following a string of multi-billion dollar acquisitions, MedTech is now heavily weighted toward cardiovascular care and digital/robotic surgery, which offer higher growth rates and stickier hospital relationships than traditional mechanical instruments.

The company's customer base is global, selling primarily to hospitals, healthcare providers, and wholesalers, with a growing emphasis on value-based care partnerships where JNJ products are integrated into hospital workflows to improve patient outcomes.

Stock Performance Overview

Over the past decade, JNJ has traditionally been viewed as a ""defensive"" stock—a core holding for income-seeking investors due to its status as a Dividend King. However, its price action has been a tale of two eras:

10-Year Horizon: JNJ has delivered steady, albeit market-trailing, returns as it navigated the litigation-heavy 2010s. The stock has been a reliable source of capital preservation, with dividends reinvested significantly boosting total returns.

5-Year Horizon: Performance was marked by the volatility of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent restructuring. The 2023 Kenvue split provided a ""special dividend"" in the form of shares, but the core JNJ ticker saw sideways movement as the market weighed the talc litigation against the new growth profile.

1-Year Horizon (2025–2026): Over the last twelve months, JNJ has begun to outperform the broader healthcare sector (XLV). As of January 2026, the market has started to reward the company for its double-digit growth in oncology and the successful integration of Shockwave Medical.

Financial Performance

Johnson & Johnson enters 2026 with a formidable balance sheet. Preliminary 2025 results indicate a resilient fiscal year:

Revenue: 2025 revenue is projected at approximately $93.2 billion, a 5.5% increase year-over-year.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): Adjusted operational EPS for 2025 is estimated at $10.85, reflecting the company’s ability to manage costs despite the biosimilar competition for its top-selling drug, Stelara.

Margins and Cash Flow: Operating margins remain healthy at nearly 30%, supported by the higher-margin pharmaceutical mix. The company generates roughly $20 billion in annual free cash flow, which powers its aggressive M&A strategy and dividend increases.

Valuation: Trading at approximately 15.5x forward earnings, JNJ continues to trade at a discount compared to peers like Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) or Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO), largely due to the ""litigation discount"" applied by institutional investors regarding talc liabilities.

Leadership and Management

CEO Joaquin Duato, who took the helm in early 2022, has been the primary architect of the ""New J&J."" His leadership is characterized by a ""MedTech-First"" investment philosophy and a decisive move to modernize the company's pharmaceutical portfolio.

Under Duato, the management team has become more aggressive in capital allocation. The board of directors, known for its conservative governance, has supported Duato’s shift toward high-risk, high-reward acquisitions like Abiomed ($16.6B) and Shockwave Medical ($13.1B). This leadership team is currently focused on two critical execution targets for 2026: the successful FDA submission of the Ottava robotic system and the ongoing spinoff of the slower-growing DePuy Synthes orthopaedics business.

Products, Services, and Innovations

Innovation is the lifeblood of the 2026 JNJ investment thesis. The company currently boasts 11 ""priority platforms"" that each generate over $1 billion in annual sales.

Oncology Dominance: Darzalex (for multiple myeloma) has become the crown jewel of the portfolio, surpassing $3 billion in quarterly sales in 2025. Meanwhile, Carvykti, a CAR-T cell therapy, is seeing nearly 90% growth as manufacturing scales and it moves into earlier-line treatments.

Cardiovascular MedTech: The acquisition of Shockwave Medical has introduced Intravascular Lithotripsy (IVL) to the JNJ portfolio—a game-changing technology that uses sonic pressure waves to crack calcified plaque in heart arteries. This, alongside Abiomed’s Impella heart pumps, makes JNJ a leader in interventional cardiology.

Robotics (Ottava): In January 2026, JNJ submitted its Ottava robotic surgery system for FDA De Novo classification. Unlike existing systems, Ottava features six arms integrated into a standard operating table, promising to save space and increase surgical flexibility.

Competitive Landscape

JNJ competes in a bifurcated landscape:

In Pharma: It faces intense competition from Merck (NYSE: MRK) in oncology and AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) in immunology. While JNJ lost exclusivity for Stelara in late 2024, its newer oral IL-23 peptide, Icotrokinra, is positioned to recapture market share in 2026.

In MedTech: Its primary rival in the robotic space is Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG). While Intuitive’s Da Vinci 5 remains the market leader, JNJ’s strategy is to leverage its deep relationships with hospitals (via its Ethicon surgical tools) to bundle the Ottava system, potentially disrupting Intuitive's dominance.

Industry and Market Trends

The healthcare sector in 2026 is being shaped by three macro drivers:

AI and Digital Surgery: JNJ is integrating AI into its Polyphonic digital ecosystem, which provides surgeons with real-time data and video analytics during procedures.

Consolidation of Care: Hospitals are increasingly looking for ""single-source"" partners. JNJ’s broad MedTech portfolio allows it to offer comprehensive solutions that smaller niche players cannot match.

The ""Patent Cliff"" Cycle: As large-cap pharma companies face losses of exclusivity, there is a sector-wide rush toward M&A. JNJ is a leader in this trend, having spent over $30 billion on acquisitions in the last three years.

Risks and Challenges

Despite its strengths, JNJ faces significant headwinds:

Talc Litigation: This remains the ""elephant in the room."" As of January 2026, over 67,000 cases remain in the federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL). Despite attempts to use the ""Texas Two-Step"" bankruptcy strategy, the courts have forced JNJ back into mediation. Recent multi-billion dollar verdicts in California and Maryland continue to worry shareholders.

Inflation Reduction Act (IRA): In 2026, the first wave of Medicare price negotiations takes effect. JNJ’s Stelara is among the impacted drugs, which may pressure margins even as biosimilar competition intensifies.

Execution Risk: The integration of Shockwave and the launch of Ottava are high-stakes maneuvers. Any regulatory delay in the Ottava approval could allow competitors to further entrench their market share.

Opportunities and Catalysts

Looking ahead at 2026, several catalysts could re-rate the stock:

2026 Earnings Guidance: During the January 2026 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, management targeted a 5% to 7% operational sales CAGR through 2030. If the company hits the high end of this range in its Q1 and Q2 reports, it could trigger a significant valuation multiple expansion.

DePuy Synthes Spinoff: The plan to spin off the orthopaedics business by late 2026 will further refine JNJ into a high-growth entity, potentially attracting a new class of ""growth"" investors.

Icotrokinra Launch: The expected 2026 launch of the first oral biologic-like treatment for psoriasis could be a multi-billion dollar catalyst for the Innovative Medicine segment.

Investor Sentiment and Analyst Coverage

Wall Street sentiment toward JNJ is currently ""Cautiously Bullish.""

Institutional Support: Large asset managers like Vanguard and BlackRock remain the largest holders, attracted by the 3% dividend yield and the AAA credit rating.

Analyst Views: Many analysts have moved JNJ to a ""Buy"" rating in late 2025, citing that the Stelara patent cliff is now ""baked in"" and that the MedTech growth is being undervalued.

Hedge Fund Interest: There has been a notable uptick in ""event-driven"" hedge fund interest, with some betting on a final global settlement of the talc litigation in 2026, which would remove the primary obstacle to the stock's appreciation.

Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

JNJ’s global footprint makes it sensitive to geopolitical shifts.

U.S. Policy: The 2026 implementation of the IRA is the most significant domestic policy shift. JNJ is actively lobbying for reforms while simultaneously pivoting its pipeline toward ""small molecule"" drugs that may be less impacted by certain IRA provisions.

China Market: JNJ continues to see China as a critical growth market for MedTech, though trade tensions and localized ""buy Chinese"" policies for medical devices present ongoing challenges for the Ethicon and DePuy units.

Conclusion

As we move through 2026, Johnson & Johnson is a company in the final stages of a profound metamorphosis. By divesting its consumer roots and doubling down on high-science pharma and interventional MedTech, it has positioned itself for a new era of growth.

Investors should watch two things closely in 2026: the regulatory progress of the Ottava robotic system and any definitive legal resolution to the talc litigation. If JNJ can clear its legal hurdles while executing its ambitious MedTech integration, it may finally break out of its defensive shell and reclaim its status as a premier growth-and-income engine in the healthcare sector. For the Finterra investor, JNJ represents a calculated bet on the future of medical innovation, underpinned by one of the strongest balance sheets in corporate history.

Lilly sells tirzepatide, sold under the name Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss.
In fact, my prediction is that 2026 will be the year of Eli Lilly.
Because the company may soon launch a key product: a weight loss pill.
Rival Novo recently won approval for its weight loss pill, but I'm confident Lilly's potential pill would win market share.","Eli Lilly (LLY +0.52%) has behaved more like a tech stock in recent years than like a pharma stock. Tech players are known to soar in the double and triple digits when the environment and corporate news are supportive. Pharmaceutical companies generally take a slower but steady path, and this is due to the fact that patients always need their medicines -- this supports revenue stability over time.

So, why has Lilly become a growth stock? The company has established leadership in an area of high demand: the weight loss drug market. Lilly sells tirzepatide, sold under the name Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss. Together, these drugs delivered more than $10 billion in revenue in the latest quarter and helped the company's overall revenue soar in the double digits.

I think this momentum is far from over. In fact, my prediction is that 2026 will be the year of Eli Lilly. And this is for one specific reason...

Lilly's blockbuster revenue

As mentioned, Lilly has generated blockbuster revenue thanks to its weight loss portfolio. Doctors have prescribed either of the injectable drugs for weight control, and demand has been high. It even resulted in drug shortages a couple of years ago until Lilly expanded its manufacturing capacity.

Demand continues to march on, and analysts predict that the obesity drug market will approach $100 billion by the end of this decade.

Right now, Lilly shares the market with Novo Nordisk, maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, but Lilly has advanced due to the efficacy of its drugs and its aggressive buildout of manufacturing infrastructure to meet demand.

A potential new launch

Why do I expect this year to be a big one for Lilly? Because the company may soon launch a key product: a weight loss pill. Lilly applied for the regulatory review of orforglipron late last year, and trial results have been solid. A pill could be a significant product for two reasons: It's more convenient for patients to take on the go and avoids a needle stick -- something many aren't too fond of. And for Lilly, a pill is cheaper and easier to manufacture than an injectable in pen format.

Rival Novo recently won approval for its weight loss pill, but I'm confident Lilly's potential pill would win market share. After taking Novo's Wegovy pill, patients must avoid food and drink for half an hour; Lilly's doesn't involve any dietary restrictions, making it extremely easy to fit into a daily routine.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F851055%2Fgettyimages-1320686310.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-19 11:08:36.783515

Chicago, IL – January 19, 2026 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses C.H. Robinson Worldwide CHRW, J.B. Hunt Transport Services JBHT, Saia SAIA and ArcBest Corp. ARCB.

Industry: Transportation - Trucking

Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2818625/3-truck-stocks-positioned-to-navigate-industry-challenges

The Zacks Transportation-Truck industry continues to face supply-chain disruptions, a weak freight scenario and a difficult macroeconomic backdrop marked by geopolitical tensions, still-high inflation levels and a shortage of truck drivers. The freight downturn is hurting players in other corners of the broader Zacks Transportation sector as well. For example, C.H. Robinson Worldwide is also hurt by this prolonged freight recession.

Despite these headwinds and the resulting demand uncertainty, the truck industry has demonstrated resilience, particularly among companies that focus on growth strategies and operational efficiency. Notable players expected to withstand these challenges include J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Saia and ArcBest Corp.

Industry Description

The Zacks Transportation - Truck industry houses truck operators transporting freight to diverse customers, mainly across North America. These companies provide full-truckload or less-than-truckload (“LTL”) services over the short, medium or long haul. The range of trucking services these companies provide includes dry-van, dedicated, refrigerated, flatbed and expedited. Some companies have an extensive fleet of company-owned tractors and trucks, and independent contractor trucks.

Besides trucking, most entities offer logistics and intermodal services as well as value-added services like container drayage, truckload brokerage, supply-chain consulting and warehousing. A few also offer asset-light services to other third-party logistics companies in the transportation sector.

3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Trucking Industry

Prolonged Freight Downturn Remains Worrisome: Although economic activities picked up from the pandemic gloom, lingering supply-chain disruptions continue to dent stocks in the industry. Below-par freight rates are also hurting the industry’s prospects. Highlighting weak freight demand, the Cass Freight Shipments Index declined 7.6% year over year in November 2025. This measure has deteriorated year over year each of the past nine months, which confirms the overall declining trend.

Cost Cuts to Boost Margins: The industry is facing input cost inflation, transport and logistics costs, and the impact of tariffs. Industry players are constantly implementing cost-reduction actions, which are likely to help sustain margins in this scenario. The companies are focused on streamlining their operations and realigning around high-growth key markets or customer segments to enhance performance.

Prolonged Truck-Driver Shortage: The persistent driver crisis in the trucking industry is worsening supply-chain challenges across the United States. Driver scarcity issues limit trucking capacity, making it difficult for trucking companies to meet increased freight demand. American Trucking Associations’ chief economist, Bob Costello, expects the trucking industry to be short of more than 160,000 drivers by 2030.

Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospects

The Zacks Transportation - Truck industry is a 12-stock group. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #234, which places it in the bottom 2% of 243 Zacks industries.

The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates murky near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimate for 2026 has decreased 30.9% on a year-over-year basis.

Before we present a few stocks from the industry that you may want to hold on to, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and the valuation picture.

Truck Industry Underperforms the SP 500 and the Sector

The Zacks Transportation-Truck industry has lagged the Zacks S&P 500 composite as well as the Transportation sector over the past year.

The industry has declined 3.7% over this period compared with the S&P 500's appreciation of 18.1% and the broader sector’s uptick of 1.4%.

Truck Industry's Current Valuation

Based on the trailing 12-month EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), a commonly used multiple for valuing trucking stocks, the industry is currently trading at 14.37X compared with the S&P 500’s 18.99X. The figure is above the sector’s EV/EBITDA of 10.83X.

Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 16.3X and as low as 7.83X, with the median being 12.31X.

Davos, Switzerland — Water.org, Gap Inc., Amazon, Starbucks, and Ecolab today announced the launch of Get Blue™. The global initiative is designed to accelerate access to safe water and sanitation by aligning business leadership, consumer engagement, and capital behind Water.org’s proven, market-driven solutions, reaching families and communities in need around the world.

Today, 2.1 billion people—nearly one in four worldwide—still lack access to safe water, while 3.4 billion people lack access to safe sanitation. When families have access to safe water and sanitation at home, the benefits are immediate and lasting–supporting improved health, time gained for education and income, and opportunity.

Get Blue is designed to be a long-term platform that enables companies across consumer and business- to-business sectors to treat water as a core operating and market issue. By recognizing water as a growing business imperative, the campaign gives enterprises a way to turn leadership, collaboration, and customer participation into sustained investment in solutions that Bring Water Home™.

“At Gap Inc., we bridge gaps to create a better world — and the gap between people who lack access to water, let alone clean water, is far too big. We believe everyone should have access to clean water,” said Richard Dickson, president and CEO of Gap Inc. “Through the launch of Get Blue, we’re uniting some of the world’s most influential brands behind a shared mission. As an industry, we have both an opportunity and a responsibility to lead—using our scale, creativity, and influence to turn awareness into action. By coming together, we can help make safe water accessible to every person on the planet and demonstrate what’s possible when our industry steps up as a force for good.”

Water is foundational to business performance, underpinning the systems and supply chains companies rely on and the communities they serve. As the water crisis intensifies, more companies are advancing water stewardship, reducing operational water use, managing supply-chain risk, investing in access and conservation projects, and supporting community education.

“Solving the global water crisis is possible if the business community comes together and focuses on measurable change. Water sits at the center of opportunity in the global economy. Get Blue gives companies a way to lead on an issue their industries depend on, and to help scale solutions that are already reaching millions of people who need them. This is the kind of leadership required to end the water crisis within our lifetimes,” said Gary White, CEO and co-founder of Water.org.

Water.org was founded by Gary White and Matt Damon with a shared belief that access to safe water and sanitation is foundational to health and opportunity. Through the organization’s WaterCredit solution, families use small, affordable loans to access safe water and sanitation at home. To date, Water.org has reached 85 million people with lasting access to safe water or sanitation, working toward an ambitious goal of reaching 200 million people by 2030. The Get Blue campaign will help Water.org extend its reach as part of a broader portfolio of strategies.

Get Blue will mobilize scalable, partner-enabled capital through corporate brands, enterprise partnerships, and integrated business and consumer activations. A portion of proceeds will drive funding support to Water.org’s market-driven solutions, helping families finance, maintain, and sustain their own long-term water and sanitation solutions.

The launch to consumers and commercial customers is planned for later in 2026, with Gap Inc., Amazon, Starbucks, and Ecolab already developing activations across fashion, food and beverage, and technology—demonstrating the initiative’s scale, cross-sector collaboration and cultural reach.

""I've been fortunate to work with Gary and Matt for years and have seen firsthand the transformative impact of their work,"" said Kara Hurst, chief sustainability officer at Amazon. ""Access to safe water is foundational to healthy communities and building a more sustainable business. Through Get Blue, we're using Amazon's scale and innovation to show what's possible when companies work together toward a common good.""

“The water crisis requires sustained, meaningful action, and Get Blue is an example of what the private sector can do to help raise awareness and work together to drive solutions and impact. This approach builds on Amazon's aim to be a responsible water steward in communities—and water stressed regions— where it operates, as it works to reduce water use across its operations through investment, innovation and implementation. Globally, Amazon has announced more than 40 water replenishment projects that are expected to return upwards of 18 billion liters of water annually, once complete. As part of that work, Amazon set a goal to return more water to communities than it uses across its data centers by 2030, and is already more than halfway to meeting that goal—and the company set a goal to return more water than it uses across its entire operations in India by 2027,” Hurst added.

Each of the founding partner companies has prioritized water as an issue that is important to their business, their stakeholders, and their communities. Each also brings a distinct value proposition and perspective to helping everyone, everywhere gain access to safe water.

“Clean water is essential to healthy families and communities,” said Marika McCauley Sine, chief sustainability officer, The Starbucks Coffee Company. “In some coffee, tea, and cocoa farming regions, people lack access to clean water and sanitation. For Starbucks, helping these communities thrive is both the right thing to do and strengthens our business and supply chain. By partnering with Water.org and investing $50 million in WaterEquity, we’re helping bring clean water and sanitation to those who need it most. So far, we’ve proudly helped more than 700,000 people. And by teaming up with Get Blue, with other companies we can make a meaningful difference for more people and the planet, together.”

“Ecolab is built on the belief that when we help our customers use water smarter, we unlock both business growth, value and social impact,” said Christophe Beck, chairman and CEO, Ecolab. “Through Get Blue, we’re joining forces with global leaders to expand access to safe water and strengthen the communities where we all operate.”

“Get Blue is already starting to bring together a community that recognizes everyone’s individual roles in helping end the global water crisis. When brands especially use their influence this way, progress proliferates — and that’s exactly what this movement is designed to do,” said Matt Damon, co-founder of Water.org.

Water.org is inviting companies across industries to join Get Blue and help tackle the water crisis. To learn more about partnership opportunities, contact Ben Albert at balbert@water.org.

“The future is on the cloud,” Arfelli concluded.","Dario Arfelli leads global marketing for Imaging Informatics at Philips, where cloud imaging is being framed less as an infrastructure shift and more as an operational correction. In conversations with clients and prospects, the discussion is more about time saved and access gained rather than the IT benefits of moving to the cloud.

Cloud Imaging, Workforce Pressure, and Time Back for Care

Radiology is becoming untethered…in a good way. More radiologists are reading remotely, freeing up valuable space in healthcare facilities.

As Arfelli puts it, “Before, radiologists were locked to the physical radiology department,” but now they have the freedom to operate from anywhere – a remote office, from home or in a different state. This is only possible with secure, reliable, cloud enterprise imaging.

The reliability of cloud infrastructure is one of the reasons Arfelli says the theme of conversations with prospects and clients has changed. “It’s all about time,” Arfelli said. “Radiologists don’t have time. IT departments don’t have time. Philips cloud imaging is giving back time to both.” It is also giving provider organizations the freedom to operate in a manner that optimizes access for patients without burning out radiologists.

“We need a revolution,” claims Arfelli. “We need to change the way we are working in cardiology, radiology…any ‘ology’. So we need to give the tools to our clients to get to the next level. We listen to all our customers and they told us that what they need most is flexibility. They need to work from home, they need to have all the tools available that they would have in the office.”

Philips is continuing to add to its cloud capabilities to ensure radiologists can operate as efficiently as possible. “The future is on the cloud,” Arfelli concluded.

By selecting SabreMosaic Travel Marketplace, these companies are responding to the growing demand for unified access to modern airline content, including NDC. Sabre now offers the industry's broadest NDC airline coverage, with recent global launches including British Airways, Iberia, Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, Emirates, and a pipeline of more than 60 additional carriers coming online. This breadth allows agencies and corporates using these five leading travel technology providers to access NDC offers, continuous pricing, bundled fares, and new ancillaries in the same environment as traditional and low-cost carrier content, without the need for separate direct connections or custom integrations for each airline. Each of the five providers will enable SabreMosaic Travel Marketplace content progressively, following their own roadmaps, creating flexibility while opening the pathway for future activations.

The technical foundation for this expansion is Sabre's structured approach to NDC integrations, which standardizes airline-specific nuances. Rather than building and maintaining one-off connections to individual airlines, these providers use Sabre's harmonized APIs to present multi-source content, including NDC, consistently. The capabilities span end-to-end workflows, and enable execution of all post-booking actions, cancellation, void, refund, exchange, seat selection, and ancillary management, regardless of the airline.

For agencies and buyers, the result is a significant reduction in manual workarounds, fewer errors, and faster onboarding of new airline content. NDC content sits alongside traditional and low-cost carrier options in unified displays, allowing agents to compare options like-for-like and select the offer that best fits traveler needs and program rules. Corporate buyers retain their policy controls and duty-of-care visibility when their online booking tools are powered through Sabre. They also gain access to airline features such as continuous pricing and exclusive promotions without introducing parallel systems or retraining teams.

""Lleego, Vibe, TPConnects, Ypsilon.net, and Mesh have gone beyond connectivity to deliver the book-and-service depth agencies expect,"" said Miguel Gonzalez, Senior Director Global Commercial Planning, Management Consulting and Partner Solutions at Sabre. ""Their customers can use NDC from carriers we've launched across the marketplace, and they can do it inside the same agent and corporate tools they trust today. That is how you scale NDC, pairing coverage leadership with workflows that protect efficiency.""

By expanding their NDC connection through Sabre, these partners help agencies and corporates to adopt modern airline content without adding systems. The technical lift shifts from bespoke, airline-by-airline builds to a unified implementation that preserves servicing parity, compliance, and reporting. The result is faster activation, fewer workarounds, and better traveler outcomes.

Global technology group e& and IBM announced a strategic collaboration to advance towards an enterprise-grade agentic AI foundation at e&, starting with policy, risk, and compliance. Unveiled at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, the initiative reflects e&’s move beyond traditional natural language processing (NLP)-based chatbots toward governed, action-oriented AI embedded in core enterprise systems.

e& and IBM have introduced an agentic AI solution built on IBM watsonx Orchestrate – a product offering more than 500 tools and customizable, domain-specific agents from IBM and its partners – to help employees and auditors quickly access and interpret legal, regulatory, and compliance information. Integrated with IBM OpenPages and the broader watsonx portfolio, the solution delivers clear, traceable responses aligned with enterprise governance requirements.

A joint proof of concept delivered by IBM, GBM (Gulf Business Machines) and e& within eight weeks demonstrated how agentic AI can operate at enterprise scale under real-world conditions.

Marketing Technology News: MarTech Interview with Miguel Lopes, CPO @ TrafficGuard

IBM’s Client Engineering team led the design and integration of the agentic AI solution, with GBM supporting delivery through project coordination and deep familiarity with e&’s OpenPages and watsonx Assistant environment. The work showcased AI capabilities that move beyond traditional question-and-answer tools, enabling reasoning and action while remaining aligned with e&’s governance, risk, and compliance framework.

“Our ambition is to move beyond isolated AI use cases toward enterprise-scale agentic AI that is trusted, governed, and deeply integrated into how the organization operates,” said Hatem Dowidar, Group CEO, e&. “By collaborating with IBM, we are embedding intelligence directly into our risk and compliance processes, enabling faster decisions, consistent policy interpretation, and a foundation for broader agentic AI adoption across the enterprise.”

IBM watsonx Orchestrate enables agentic AI that goes beyond chat-based interactions, allowing AI agents to reason, orchestrate tasks, and integrate with enterprise systems under governance controls. For e&, it provides a foundation for trusted, explainable AI that can scale across compliance and other enterprise domains. It helps to streamline compliance tasks, reduce response times, and enable 24/7 self-service access across the organization.

The initiative also aligns natively with watsonx.governance, already in use at e&, providing a strong foundation for AI governance, explainability, and compliance by design. By embedding agentic AI directly into the OpenPages governance, risk, and compliance platform, this represents one of the early enterprise-grade agentic AI implementations in the region, demonstrating how AI can support trusted, human-led decision-making under regulatory and operational requirements.

The deployment also demonstrates the flexibility of IBM’s AI and model gateway approach, enabling large language models to run across hybrid environments, including customer-managed infrastructure, while remaining governed under enterprise controls.

“As organizations move from experimenting with AI to embedding it into the fabric of how they operate, governance and accountability become just as important as intelligence,” said Ana Paula Assis, SVP and Chair for Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific, IBM. “Through our collaboration with e&, this proof of concept intends to demonstrate how agentic AI can be designed and validated for enterprise-scale use, deeply integrated into core systems, governed by design, and trusted to support human-led decisions and outcomes.”

During that time, your company agrees to pay you three-fourths of your salary, every single year, until you retire.
He went to court because he hadn't received a pay raise during those 15 years away.
Ian Clifford, a software employee in the UK, went on sick leave from IBM in September 2008 due to mental health reasons.
The judge stated that the lifelong payment plan itself was a ""very substantial benefit""—a form of ""favourable treatment"" that only a disabled employee in his situation could get.","Imagine being on sick leave from your job. Now, imagine that leave lasts for 15 years. During that time, your company agrees to pay you three-fourths of your salary, every single year, until you retire. For most, this would be an unexpected safety net.

But for one IT employee, it wasn't enough. He went to court because he hadn't received a pay raise during those 15 years away.

This is the unusual true story of Ian Clifford and the tech giant IBM.

Ian Clifford, a software employee in the UK, went on sick leave from IBM in September 2008 due to mental health reasons. His absence continued, and he was later diagnosed with a serious illness.

By 2013, after being off work for five full years, Clifford did something surprising. He filed a formal complaint against IBM. His main issue? In all those years of not working, his salary had remained frozen. He had not been given a single increment or pay rise.

Later in 2013, IBM and Clifford reached a settlement. He was placed on the company's Sickness and Accident Plan. This was a major deal. The plan guaranteed he would receive 75% of his last drawn salary every year until he turned 65.

Based on his salary then, this meant a steady yearly payment of over £54,000 (roughly Rs 54 lakh at the time). Newspapers calculated that from 2008 until his retirement, he could receive over £1.5 million (multiple crores of rupees) without working another day. He was even paid extra to settle holiday pay claims. In return, he agreed to close the matter.

Most would see this as a secure, lifelong arrangement. But nearly ten years later, in 2022, Clifford sued IBM again. He took them to an employment tribunal, this time claiming disability discrimination.

His argument? By not increasing his fixed yearly payments for inflation since 2013, IBM was treating him unfairly because of his disability. He said his income's value was shrinking as prices rose.

In 2023, the tribunal judge dismissed his case. The court's reasoning was straightforward.

The judge stated that the lifelong payment plan itself was a ""very substantial benefit""—a form of ""favourable treatment"" that only a disabled employee in his situation could get. Other, non-disabled employees did not have access to such a plan.

A key line from the ruling explains it simply: You cannot claim discrimination for not getting extra benefits on top of a special benefit created just for you.

The court saw the guaranteed annual payment not as a frozen salary, but as a protected financial support system, which was in itself a privilege.

For any working professional, especially in India's competitive IT sector where appraisals are keenly awaited, this story seems almost unbelievable. It shows how the lines between a company's support, an employee's rights, and a sense of fairness can sometimes lead to the most unexpected courtroom battles.",https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2026/01/20260119071614_Man-on-Sick-Leave-for-15-Years.png,N,,2026-01-19 11:09:03.920638

Media reports have recently speculated about interactions between Delfin and UniCredit concerning Delfin’s stake in Monte Paschi, following the latter’s acquisition of Mediobanca.

This follows UniCredit’s withdrawal from its plan to purchase Banco BPM over unmet conditions related to the golden power authorisation.

In a statement to Bloomberg, a spokesperson from Delfin said: “Delfin’s board of directors announces that it has never discussed the possibility of divesting its financial stake” in Monte de Paschi.

“Delfin denies that negotiations are underway with UniCredit or other operators aimed at the total or partial sale of its stake” in the Italian bank.

In a statement, Delfin reiterated its “full support” for Monte Paschi’s current leadership.

Monte de Paschi completed its acquisition of Mediobanca in September, with Delfin’s holdings in Mediobanca exchanged for shares in Monte Paschi.

However, Italian prosecutors are probing Monte de Paschi CEO Luigi Lovaglio and major shareholders Delfin & Caltagirone for alleged market manipulation and regulatory obstruction in the Mediobanca takeover.

The actions of Lovaglio and Delfin chairman Francesco Milleri are under review by authorities in Milan amid allegations that they masked coordinated efforts to secure control over Mediobanca.

Monte Paschi said it “is confident it can provide all the necessary information to clarify the correctness of its actions”, added Bloomberg.

Meanwhile, Delfin maintained its board “always acted in full compliance with market rules and laws.”

OTR appoints Oscar Torres as Chief Executive Officer

OTR has appointed Oscar Torres as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective 5 January 2026, marking a key leadership transition as the company positions itself for its next phase of development. The appointment brings to OTR a senior executive with more than 25 years of leadership experience in private equity–backed businesses and a strong track record in the global aerospace aftermarket.

Torres has spent the majority of his career at Kellstrom Aerospace, a major distributor and technical services provider to the aviation industry. During his time at the company, he progressed through a series of senior leadership roles, including Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and ultimately Chief Executive Officer. This breadth of experience across finance, operations and executive management has given him a comprehensive understanding of the commercial and operational drivers of the aerospace aftermarket.

While at Kellstrom Aerospace, Torres led a range of initiatives aimed at improving operational performance and delivering sustainable, long-term growth. He was closely involved in shaping the company’s strategic direction and played a central role in multiple acquisitions and divestitures, helping to strengthen Kellstrom’s market position and expand its global footprint. Under his leadership, the business further established itself as a key supply-chain solutions provider to airlines, original equipment manufacturers, maintenance, repair and overhaul organisations, and aircraft lessors around the world.

Torres’ appointment is seen as a strategic move that aligns with OTR’s ambitions within the aerospace aftermarket, particularly as the sector continues to adapt to changing customer demands and supply-chain dynamics. His experience working in private equity–backed environments is expected to be especially relevant as OTR pursues growth opportunities while maintaining operational discipline.

Challenges in Scaling AI Despite the optimism for pragmatic AI, scaling remains a formidable hurdle.
Balancing innovation with pragmatism will determine whether AI fulfills its promise or joins the ranks of overhyped trends.","Beyond the Buzz: AI’s Shift from Hype to Hard Returns in 2026

In the fast-paced world of technology, artificial intelligence has long been the darling of investors and executives, promising to revolutionize everything from daily operations to global economies. But as we enter 2026, a palpable shift is underway. Companies are moving beyond the initial excitement, demanding tangible results from their AI investments rather than riding on promises alone. This transition marks a critical juncture where hype gives way to scrutiny, with businesses prioritizing measurable outcomes over speculative potential.

Recent reports highlight this evolution. According to a study by the Capgemini Research Institute, featured in TechRadar, AI adoption has matured from broad experimentation to targeted implementation. The research, based on surveys of over 1,000 executives, reveals that while 80% of organizations have deployed AI in at least one function, the focus now is on scaling these initiatives to deliver real value. Gone are the days of pouring billions into unproven pilots; instead, firms are honing in on applications that boost efficiency, cut costs, and drive revenue.

This pivot isn’t isolated. Industry observers note that the initial wave of AI enthusiasm, sparked by breakthroughs like ChatGPT in 2022, led to inflated expectations. Millions flocked to interactive tools, enchanting users and sparking economic ripples. Yet, as MIT Technology Review detailed in its analysis of 2025’s reckoning, disillusionment was inevitable. The publication outlined four key ways to frame this correction, emphasizing that while AI’s capabilities are real, the overhyping created a bubble ripe for bursting.

The Investment Reckoning

Investors, once eager to fund any AI-related venture, are now exercising caution. Posts on X from financial analysts, such as those warning of a potential bubble pop, underscore a growing sentiment that the sector’s spending—estimated at $400 billion annually—far outpaces its $60 billion in returns. One prominent thread highlighted Forrester’s prediction of a 2026 market correction, with companies delaying 25% of planned AI expenditures by a year due to underwhelming profit margins.

This caution is echoed in broader market trends. TechCrunch forecasts that 2026 will see AI transition to pragmatism, with advancements in smaller models, reliable agents, and physical AI designed for practical use. The article points to new architectures and world models as harbingers of more grounded progress, moving away from the grandiose visions that dominated headlines.

Moreover, big investors are redirecting focus toward infrastructure rather than flashy applications. A Forbes survey revealed that institutional players see opportunities in robotics and supporting tech, even amid bubbles, signaling a preference for stable, long-term bets over volatile hype cycles.

Challenges in Scaling AI

Despite the optimism for pragmatic AI, scaling remains a formidable hurdle. Many enterprises report that only a fraction of their AI projects yield widespread value. BCG’s findings, referenced in various X discussions, indicate just 5% of executives have seen significant returns, prompting a reevaluation of strategies. This mirrors the experiences during past tech frenzies, like the blockchain boom, where initial fervor gave way to plateauing interest.

The Conversation draws parallels, noting that AI, much like blockchain, will likely stabilize rather than fizzle out entirely. The piece argues that while hype dies, underlying utility persists, provided companies adapt to realistic timelines and applications.

On the ground, firms are grappling with integration issues. Executives fear committing to the “wrong model,” leading to hesitation in deployments. X posts from industry insiders describe a “stall mode” in enterprise AI, with budget scrutiny and risk aversion reminiscent of post-2008 caution in digital advertising. This environment demands not just technological prowess but also robust governance to ensure trust and accountability.

Governance and Global Pressures

As AI moves into widespread use, governance emerges as a linchpin for success. Council on Foreign Relations warns that 2026 could be decisive, with policymakers under pressure to address adoption, strategic competition, and ethical concerns. The analysis stresses that AI’s future hinges on balancing innovation with regulation, especially in critical sectors.

Internationally, paradoxes abound. The World Economic Forum explores how human factors—idiosyncrasies in expectations and economics—will shape AI’s trajectory. As expectations outpace reality, the forum suggests that technical capability alone won’t suffice; societal and economic viability must align.

Investment hype often lags behind research by three to five years, according to experts cited in WebProNews. This disconnect leads to overvaluation of outdated technologies like large language models, while emerging areas like agentic AI are overlooked, potentially missing key opportunities.

Market Signals and Stock Movements

Stock performances are telling indicators of this shift. Microsoft’s shares dipped 10% recently, attributed to ballooning infrastructure costs and shrinking AI enthusiasm, as reported by Windows Central. Executives offloading stock underscores a murky outlook, with competition from players like Google adding pressure.

Conversely, some voices on X remain bullish. Influential figures predict massive valuations and daily investments reaching $3 billion, painting a picture of AI as an unstoppable force despite current headwinds. Yet, these optimistic takes contrast with warnings of mass layoffs and chatbot fatigue, as detailed in satirical yet pointed X threads envisioning a 2026 fraught with frustration.

Predictions from academic sources, such as Johns Hopkins, outline what policymakers should anticipate, emphasizing scalable production over pilots. The university’s experts stress industry-specific implementations to bridge the gap between hype and value.

Pathways to Pragmatic Progress

To navigate this new phase, companies are advised to reset expectations. MIT Technology Review, in a follow-up piece, calls for an “antidote” to overwhelming hype, advocating for measured approaches that prioritize real-world impact over spectacle.

Trends for 2026, as per iTnews, include a focus on cost-effective, trustworthy agents and tailored solutions. This shift promises to move AI from a buzzword to a business essential, provided organizations invest in the right areas.

X sentiment reflects a mixed bag: while some decry an impending bubble burst with creditors demanding returns on trillions invested, others highlight AI’s infancy and potential for “AI or die” scenarios where adaptation is key to survival. One thread notes that 95% of generative AI projects fail to scale, backing the “AI or die” reality for S&P 500 companies facing shortened lifespans.

Emerging Opportunities Amid Caution

Amid the caution, opportunities emerge in niche areas. Infrastructure investments, as Forbes previously noted, attract institutional money betting on long-term stability. Robotics and physical AI, highlighted in TechCrunch’s outlook, could redefine manufacturing and services, offering concrete returns.

Podcasts and discussions, like those from Marathon Asset Management shared on X, emphasize the unprecedented scale of AI investments but question uncertain returns. Key points include the need for clear monetization paths and the risks of over-reliance on energy-intensive data centers.

Experts warn that without proving ROI, many initiatives will falter. Capgemini Research Institute’s findings in TechRadar reinforce that maturity in AI means prioritizing strategic realism over unchecked enthusiasm, a lesson drawn from years of trial and error.

Human Elements in AI’s Evolution

Ultimately, AI’s path forward depends on human ingenuity as much as algorithms. The World Economic Forum’s paradoxes remind us that economic viability and technical prowess must converge with societal needs.

In educational circles, Johns Hopkins’ predictions urge a focus on policy automation and business processes, where AI’s strengths shine. X users debating AI’s power in enterprise settings argue that beyond consumer interfaces, its impact on systems and efficiency is profound.

As 2026 unfolds, the technology sector stands at a crossroads. Balancing innovation with pragmatism will determine whether AI fulfills its promise or joins the ranks of overhyped trends. Industry insiders must heed these signals, investing wisely to harness AI’s true potential while sidestepping the pitfalls of past bubbles. With governance strengthening and markets demanding proof, the era of blind faith in AI is closing, ushering in one defined by results.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/article-6708-1768800264.jpeg,N,,2026-01-19 09:01:32.150991

Confluent Acquisition Advances Past Key Hurdle A significant milestone has been reached in IBM's planned $11 billion all-cash acquisition of Confluent.
It is also forecast to contribute approximately 2% in inorganic revenue growth to IBM's software segment.
For context, IBM's third-quarter 2025 results surpassed expectations, with earnings per share of $2.65 beating the consensus estimate of $2.45.
Launch of ""IBM Sovereign Core"" Platform On January 15, IBM introduced ""IBM Sovereign Core,"" described by the company as its first ""AI-ready"" software platform focused on digital sovereignty.","IBM shares are entering a decisive period marked by regulatory progress on a major acquisition, a series of analyst upgrades, and the imminent release of its fourth-quarter 2025 financial results. Despite a recent consolidation phase since the start of the year, the stock remains up approximately 2.35%, building on a substantial gain of around 39% throughout 2025.

Market experts have shown increased confidence in IBM's trajectory at the start of the year, with several prominent institutions raising their price targets.

Jefferies upgraded its rating on IBM from ""Hold"" to ""Buy"" on January 5, lifting its price objective from $300 to $360. The firm cited improved visibility for software growth and sustained momentum in the Red Hat business.

RBC Capital Markets reaffirmed its ""Outperform"" rating on the same day, increasing its target from $300 to $350.

Bank of America maintained its ""Buy"" recommendation on January 13, raising its target price from $315 to $335, driven primarily by an enhanced free cash flow outlook.

According to consensus data from MarketBeat, the average analyst rating currently stands at ""Moderate Buy,"" with a mean price target of $301.85. IBM shares are trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of roughly 36.4, with a market capitalization of approximately $284.5 billion.

Confluent Acquisition Advances Past Key Hurdle

A significant milestone has been reached in IBM's planned $11 billion all-cash acquisition of Confluent. The mandatory waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act expired on January 12, clearing a major U.S. regulatory hurdle for the deal, which offers $31 per share for the data-streaming specialist.

The next critical step is Confluent's special shareholder meeting scheduled for February 12, where investors will vote on the transaction. Final proxy materials were distributed to Confluent stockholders on January 9. IBM anticipates closing the acquisition around mid-2026.

Strategically, the purchase is designed to bolster IBM's data-streaming capabilities and complement its existing software portfolio, including Red Hat, watsonx, and HashiCorp. Analysts project the deal will positively impact EBITDA and free cash flow through scale benefits and higher margins. It is also forecast to contribute approximately 2% in inorganic revenue growth to IBM's software segment.

Quarterly Earnings and 2026 Guidance in Focus

All eyes are on IBM's upcoming fourth-quarter 2025 report, scheduled for release on January 28 at 5:00 PM Eastern Time. The presentation is expected to provide formal guidance for the full year 2026, details on the Confluent integration timeline, and updates on software segment performance.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying IBM?

Bank of America anticipates slightly weaker pre-tax margins for Q4, as IBM is likely to book a charge of around $400 million related to a ""workforce rebalancing"" initiative. Nevertheless, the bank forecasts a full-year 2025 margin improvement of 70 basis points compared to the prior year, though this would be below the company's own guidance of more than 100 basis points.

For context, IBM's third-quarter 2025 results surpassed expectations, with earnings per share of $2.65 beating the consensus estimate of $2.45. Revenue reached $16.33 billion, a 9.1% year-over-year increase.

Bank of America's 2026 Projections

Analyst Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America expects IBM to project roughly 10% constant-currency growth in software for fiscal 2026, low single-digit percentage growth in consulting, and largely stable infrastructure segment performance. This translates to an estimated total revenue growth of 5%, with 4% being organic.

For the current 2025 fiscal year, Bank of America models a free cash flow of $14.0 billion, targeting approximately $15 billion for 2026.

Launch of ""IBM Sovereign Core"" Platform

On January 15, IBM introduced ""IBM Sovereign Core,"" described by the company as its first ""AI-ready"" software platform focused on digital sovereignty. The offering targets organizations that need to run AI workloads under their own control and within specific legal jurisdictions.

Built on a Red Hat open-source foundation, a tech preview of the platform is slated for February 2026, with general availability planned for mid-year. For the launch, IBM is partnering with European IT service providers Cegeka (Belgium, Netherlands) and Computacenter (Germany).

Davos, Switzerland — Water.org, Gap Inc., Amazon, Starbucks, and Ecolab today announced the launch of Get Blue™. The global initiative is designed to accelerate access to safe water and sanitation by aligning business leadership, consumer engagement, and capital behind Water.org’s proven, market-driven solutions, reaching families and communities in need around the world.

Today, 2.1 billion people—nearly one in four worldwide—still lack access to safe water, while 3.4 billion people lack access to safe sanitation. When families have access to safe water and sanitation at home, the benefits are immediate and lasting–supporting improved health, time gained for education and income, and opportunity.

Get Blue is designed to be a long-term platform that enables companies across consumer and business- to-business sectors to treat water as a core operating and market issue. By recognizing water as a growing business imperative, the campaign gives enterprises a way to turn leadership, collaboration, and customer participation into sustained investment in solutions that Bring Water Home™.

“At Gap Inc., we bridge gaps to create a better world — and the gap between people who lack access to water, let alone clean water, is far too big. We believe everyone should have access to clean water,” said Richard Dickson, president and CEO of Gap Inc. “Through the launch of Get Blue, we’re uniting some of the world’s most influential brands behind a shared mission. As an industry, we have both an opportunity and a responsibility to lead—using our scale, creativity, and influence to turn awareness into action. By coming together, we can help make safe water accessible to every person on the planet and demonstrate what’s possible when our industry steps up as a force for good.”

Water is foundational to business performance, underpinning the systems and supply chains companies rely on and the communities they serve. As the water crisis intensifies, more companies are advancing water stewardship, reducing operational water use, managing supply-chain risk, investing in access and conservation projects, and supporting community education.

“Solving the global water crisis is possible if the business community comes together and focuses on measurable change. Water sits at the center of opportunity in the global economy. Get Blue gives companies a way to lead on an issue their industries depend on, and to help scale solutions that are already reaching millions of people who need them. This is the kind of leadership required to end the water crisis within our lifetimes,” said Gary White, CEO and co-founder of Water.org.

Water.org was founded by Gary White and Matt Damon with a shared belief that access to safe water and sanitation is foundational to health and opportunity. Through the organization’s WaterCredit solution, families use small, affordable loans to access safe water and sanitation at home. To date, Water.org has reached 85 million people with lasting access to safe water or sanitation, working toward an ambitious goal of reaching 200 million people by 2030. The Get Blue campaign will help Water.org extend its reach as part of a broader portfolio of strategies.

Get Blue will mobilize scalable, partner-enabled capital through corporate brands, enterprise partnerships, and integrated business and consumer activations. A portion of proceeds will drive funding support to Water.org’s market-driven solutions, helping families finance, maintain, and sustain their own long-term water and sanitation solutions.

The launch to consumers and commercial customers is planned for later in 2026, with Gap Inc., Amazon, Starbucks, and Ecolab already developing activations across fashion, food and beverage, and technology—demonstrating the initiative’s scale, cross-sector collaboration and cultural reach.

""I've been fortunate to work with Gary and Matt for years and have seen firsthand the transformative impact of their work,"" said Kara Hurst, chief sustainability officer at Amazon. ""Access to safe water is foundational to healthy communities and building a more sustainable business. Through Get Blue, we're using Amazon's scale and innovation to show what's possible when companies work together toward a common good.""

“The water crisis requires sustained, meaningful action, and Get Blue is an example of what the private sector can do to help raise awareness and work together to drive solutions and impact. This approach builds on Amazon's aim to be a responsible water steward in communities—and water stressed regions— where it operates, as it works to reduce water use across its operations through investment, innovation and implementation. Globally, Amazon has announced more than 40 water replenishment projects that are expected to return upwards of 18 billion liters of water annually, once complete. As part of that work, Amazon set a goal to return more water to communities than it uses across its data centers by 2030, and is already more than halfway to meeting that goal—and the company set a goal to return more water than it uses across its entire operations in India by 2027,” Hurst added.

Each of the founding partner companies has prioritized water as an issue that is important to their business, their stakeholders, and their communities. Each also brings a distinct value proposition and perspective to helping everyone, everywhere gain access to safe water.

“Clean water is essential to healthy families and communities,” said Marika McCauley Sine, chief sustainability officer, The Starbucks Coffee Company. “In some coffee, tea, and cocoa farming regions, people lack access to clean water and sanitation. For Starbucks, helping these communities thrive is both the right thing to do and strengthens our business and supply chain. By partnering with Water.org and investing $50 million in WaterEquity, we’re helping bring clean water and sanitation to those who need it most. So far, we’ve proudly helped more than 700,000 people. And by teaming up with Get Blue, with other companies we can make a meaningful difference for more people and the planet, together.”

“Ecolab is built on the belief that when we help our customers use water smarter, we unlock both business growth, value and social impact,” said Christophe Beck, chairman and CEO, Ecolab. “Through Get Blue, we’re joining forces with global leaders to expand access to safe water and strengthen the communities where we all operate.”

“Get Blue is already starting to bring together a community that recognizes everyone’s individual roles in helping end the global water crisis. When brands especially use their influence this way, progress proliferates — and that’s exactly what this movement is designed to do,” said Matt Damon, co-founder of Water.org.

Water.org is inviting companies across industries to join Get Blue and help tackle the water crisis. To learn more about partnership opportunities, contact Ben Albert at balbert@water.org.

Ecolab’s market cap is around $78.6 billion, reflecting its position as a large-cap specialty chemicals and services firm with extensive international reach.

The company is slated to announce its fiscal Q4 2025 earnings results before market open on Feb. 10.

Myntra and Raymond Lifestyle are experiencing senior leadership changes, with Ritesh Mishra joining Myntra from Lifestyle India and Satyaki Ghosh appointed CEO of Raymond Lifestyle from Grasim Industries. These appointments signal a focus on growth and transformation within the fashion retail sector, following a broader trend of CEO churn in the Indian fashion industry this fiscal year.

Ritesh Mishra has joined Myntra as senior vice president, heading category and revenue. He joins from departmental store chain Lifestyle India where he was the deputy chief executive officer.

On the other hand, Raymond Lifestyle Ltd has appointed Satyaki Ghosh as chief executive officer as part of its ongoing transformation effort to strengthen the company for next phase of growth.

The measures aim to encourage greater use of public transport, shared mobility, and electric vehicles, reducing reliance on private cars as pollution mitigation remains a key priority for the city.

To support increased adoption of the Delhi Metro, Uber is offering a first free Metro ride worth up to ₹25 for users booking Metro tickets through the Uber app for the first time. This offer will be available until January 21. By integrating Metro ticketing into its app, Uber aims to simplify access to public transport, reduce queues at stations, and make daily commuting more seamless.

In addition, Uber is strengthening first- and last-mile connectivity to Metro stations by offering discounts of up to 30% on bike trips, capped at ₹20, until February 11. These discounts apply to rides taken to and from Metro stations, helping commuters complete their journeys without depending on personal vehicles.

For longer trips, Uber is promoting cleaner and shared mobility alternatives. With nearly 1,000 electric vehicles operating in Delhi, Uber Electric is offering a 10% discount, up to ₹50, until February 11, providing a lower-emission travel option. The company is also highlighting Uber Shuttle, a high-capacity shared transport service designed to reduce the number of individual vehicles on the road and support more efficient commuting.

Together, these offerings are intended to complement Delhi’s public transport network and make sustainable travel choices more practical for everyday use.

Manjinder Singh Sirsa, Hon’ble Minister for Environment, Forest & Wildlife, Government of NCT of Delhi, said, “Under the leadership of Hon’ble Chief Minister Smt. Rekha Gupta, the Delhi Government has announced a series of initiatives to curb air pollution. However, Delhi’s air quality challenge cannot be addressed without reducing the number of private vehicles on our roads. We appreciate efforts by shared mobility platforms such as Uber that encourage greater use of public transport, shared travel, and cleaner mobility options. Initiatives that provide viable alternatives to private cars support the Delhi Government’s broader strategy to improve air quality and ease congestion.”

Amit Deshpande, Head – City Operations, Uber India, said, “Tackling air quality challenges requires collective action and coordinated solutions. We’re proud to support the Delhi Government’s efforts by making it easier for people to choose public transit and sustainable mobility options. Whether it’s discounted Metro tickets, reliable first- and last-mile rides, electric vehicles or shared high capacity vehicles - our focus is on enabling smarter and sustainable choices for daily travel.”

Uber said it will continue working with transport authorities and city stakeholders to scale solutions that support cleaner air and more efficient urban mobility across Delhi.",https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/Uber.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 11:09:23.446506

A year later, the government has published its Roadmap for a modern digital government.","In an attempt to address the complexity people often experience in dealing with government services, the UK government has unveiled CustomerFirst.

This is a new unit within the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT), led by Tristan Thomas, formerly of Monzo, and Greg Jackson, CEO of Octopus Energy. It aims to bring together the best civil service operators alongside leading private sector disruptors and transformation specialists. The plan is to use CustomerFirst expertise to rewire government services, making use of AI and best practices from the private sector.

The Blueprint for modern digital government report, published last year, set out six steps to achieve a digital state. At the time, the government also recognised major challenges that were preventing digital government from progressing.

Although the government spends over £26bn annually on digital technology and employs a workforce of nearly 100,000 digital and data professionals, institutionalised fragmentation is holding back digital government services. Problem areas include persistent legacy, cyber and resilience risk; siloed data; under-digitisation; inconsistent leadership; a skills shortfall; diffused buying power; and outdated funding models.

A year later, the government has published its Roadmap for a modern digital government. The roadmap states that public services are being redesigned to be quicker, more accessible and easier to use, while also being cheaper to run and costing less to the taxpayer. The roadmap includes digitisation of the planning system to accelerate house building and a goal to simplify how people manage their benefits and taxes online.

CustomerFirst is being positioned as one of the initiatives the government will use to deliver savings for taxpayers through end‑to‑end reform and smarter use of technology by departments. There is a potential £4bn saving from moving service processing online, rather than by phone, post or in-person.

Discussing the need to streamline how people interact with government departments, the minister for digital government, Ian Murray, said: “Too often, people are put off from interacting with the services they need by the frustration that comes with waiting on hold, filling in endless forms, and jumping through hoop after hoop.”

He said the government would redesign services so they meet the demands of modern life.

Technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) will be deployed to achieve this objective. Greg Jackson, founder and CEO of Octopus Energy, said: “With modern technology, including AI, and even more importantly empowered teams whose job it is to help citizens, we can improve service without increasing costs.”

The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is the first government department to work with CustomerFirst. It aims to improve how the DVLA handles millions of customer interactions each year related to driving licences, vehicle registration and other motoring services.

DSIT said the DVLA will become a blueprint for improving services across government departments. DVLA CEO Tim Moss said: “DVLA has a track record of delivering great digital services, and we are keen to build on this and further develop the next generation of high-quality services that citizens should expect.”

As part of its roadmap for modern digital government, DSIT said it was looking for senior and experienced talent with expertise in service design, solutions architecture and product management.",https://www.computerweekly.com/visuals/German/article/human-groups-data-analysis-adobe.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 11:08:20.399917

On Sunday, several users said they received a text message from Uber stating that their subscriptions had been impacted due to a “route change.” The message read:

“Uber Shuttle Subscription Update: Your subscription has been impacted due to a route change. A refund for remaining trips has been processed, and 2 free trips have been added to your account. We apologize for the inconvenience caused.”

However, many commuters claim that refunds have either not been received yet or are stuck in processing, with some alleging their money is blocked in the Uber cash despite the company indicating the refund has been initiated.

The sudden disruption has sparked speculation online about whether Uber is quietly scaling down or even shutting down its Shuttle service in certain markets, especially as affected users claim they were given little to no prior heads-up. As of Monday, Uber India has not issued a detailed public statement explaining the extent of the route changes, the reason behind the sudden service disruption, or a clear timeline for refunds.

Over the past 24–48 hours, frustrated commuters have flooded social media with complaints, sharing screenshots of the message, route unavailability, and refund-related issues. Several users also questioned how subscription-based mobility services can be altered overnight without advance notice to paying customers.

For daily office commuters, the impact has been immediate. Many users said Uber Shuttle had become their preferred option for predictable pricing and fixed routes, and the sudden disruption has forced them to scramble for alternatives at short notice, often at higher costs.

The controversy has also revived uncomfortable memories of BluSmart’s sudden operational collapse earlier this year. BluSmart ceased operations in April 2025 amid founder fraud allegations and SEBI investigations, leaving many users with stuck wallet balances and limited clarity on refunds.

Delta’s purchase of 30 787-10 jets – with opportunity for up to 30 more of the largest 787 variant – will enable the airline’s expansion and modernization plans on high-demand transatlantic and South American routes.

“Delta is building the fleet for the future, enhancing the customer experience, driving operational improvements and providing steady replacements for less efficient, older aircraft in the decade to come,” said Ed Bastian, Delta’s chief executive officer. “Most importantly, these aircraft will be operated by the best aviation professionals in the industry, providing Delta’s welcoming, elevated and caring service to travelers worldwide.”

With capacity for up to 336 passengers and 25% lower fuel use than the airplanes it replaces, the 787-10 offers the lowest operating cost per seat of any widebody airplane. Delivering superior comfort for passengers, the 787 Dreamliner features the largest windows of any widebody airplane flying today and air that is pressurized at a lower cabin altitude, which will help Delta’s customers arrive at their destinations feeling more refreshed.

“We are excited that Delta Air Lines has selected the 787-10 to join its fleet of the future. The 787 Dreamliner’s unmatched efficiency, range, and passenger comfort make it a perfect fit for Delta’s international expansion and fleet modernization,” said Stephanie Pope, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “Our team looks forward to delivering new Dreamliners to Delta and supporting their commitments to provide an exceptional passenger experience and advance sustainability in aviation.”

With more than 460 Boeing airplanes currently in service, Delta has flown most Boeing single-aisle and widebody models across its domestic and international networks over the decades. This new widebody order further strengthens that partnership and supports U.S. aerospace manufacturing jobs across Boeing’s production system and supply chain.

With draws beginning to shape the narrative around our season, Virgil van Dijk is expected to hold a players’ meeting at the AXA Training Centre following the 1–1 with Burnley.

The report, via Sky Sports, points to leadership rather than panic, with the Netherlands international determined to confront standards internally rather than allow frustration to linger.

This is not about one result, but about how we respond collectively.

Van Dijk leadership comes to the fore at Liverpool again

According to Sky Sports, the centre-back was unhappy with the sloppiness that crept in after the hour mark against Burnley, particularly given how dominant we were for long spells.

“I’m frustrated that after 60 minutes we started to become sloppy and it’s not the first time,” the 34-year-old said.

That frustration carried weight because it followed a performance where we generated chances at volume but failed to turn control into victory.

Liverpool registered 15 shots in the first half alone, with Florian Wirtz continuing his fine run after being teed up by Curtis Jones, yet one lapse proved costly.

This is not the first time the captain has intervened this season either.

After defeat to Manchester United in October, Van Dijk called a similar meeting during a difficult run, underlining how seriously he takes responsibility for direction within the group.

That sense of accountability has been reflected in his public words too, where he admitted there was “something lacking” while also stressing the need for unity during a demanding spell – after the draw with Burnley.

Why Van Dijk meeting matters before Marseille test

Timing matters.

We now head to Marseille in the Champions League knowing that small margins can quickly become defining ones, particularly away from home against a Roberto De Zerbi side.

Van Dijk referenced that challenge directly, saying: “Monday will be a big one for it because Wednesday will be a very difficult game over there.”

The Dutch defender was also clear that solutions must be collective.

“It’s not about me addressing it, it is about how can we solve it because we all want to win games,” he added.

That mindset aligns with what Jeremie Frimpong has already said about Van Dijk’s influence, describing him as both a leader and a presence players naturally respond to.

It also reinforces why he remains the right man to wear the armband during a period of transition under our head coach in his second season.

With the squad given Sunday off, highlighted by Van Dijk attending the NBA in London, the reset begins now.

Jan 19, 2026 Share

Phoenix Specialty, a construction-focused managing general agent (MGA), has announced it has secured additional A+ (S&P) rated capacity to complement its existing AA- (S&P) rated backing from AXA Insurance UK.

The London-based MGA said the move strengthens its ability to support brokers across its UK contractors' all risks (CAR) and contractors' plant & equipment (CPE) propositions. The expanded capacity increases Phoenix Specialty's underwriting appetite and flexibility, with probable maximum losses of up to £50 million now available on a case-by-case basis for both annual and single project risks.

The capacity expansion comes amid shifting dynamics in the UK construction insurance market. Standard four-walls CAR premiums declined by around 20% in mid-2025, according to Aon's UK Insurance Market Outlook, a trend attributed to growing underwriting capacity entering the market.

Complex engineering risks, however, have been priced flat, with underwriters exercising greater caution. The increased competition has encouraged product innovation and customisation, particularly in segments such as SME construction.

In addition to the UK capacity expansion, Phoenix Specialty has secured Lloyd's capacity support on a prior submit basis. This enables the MGA to consider Erection All Risks (EAR) business globally within Lloyd's of London-approved territories.

The EAR proposition will offer capacity of up to US$27 million in total insurable value. Appetite spans multiple sectors, including steel, cement, mineral processing, breweries, bottling plants, dairies, semiconductor and pharmaceutical facilities, and data centres.

These developments follow the launch of Phoenix Specialty's Global CPE proposition in mid-2025. That offering focuses on annual renewable business and is available on both a direct insurance and facultative reinsurance basis.

Tim James (pictured above), CEO of Phoenix Specialty, said the additional capacity represents a milestone for the company.

""This is a significant milestone for Phoenix and gives us further opportunity to expand our offering and better support our broker partners,"" James said.

James added that the company has had a strong start to 2026, with several projects in development. He noted that the team remains focused on working closely with broker partners to grow mutual accounts.

Around 150 million cubic feet of gas is reportedly lost from the grid every day due to leaks, technical losses, and mismanagement.
Two floating LNG terminals currently supply the grid, together capable of handling about one billion cubic feet per day.
Without that, the country risks running its economy on empty, sustained by imports, vulnerable to shocks, and perpetually one crisis away from paralysis.","Bangladesh’s gas crisis did not arrive as a sudden shock; it crept in quietly, disguised as policy pragmatism and short-term fixes, until it became a structural threat to the economy.

What is unfolding now is not merely a seasonal shortage or a logistical hiccup, but the cumulative consequence of years of strategic neglect, compounded by global volatility and domestic inertia.

The numbers alone tell a story of exhaustion. The country currently demands around 3.8 billion cubic feet of gas per day, while supply lingers at roughly 2.58 billion cubic feet, leaving a daily deficit of 1.22 billion cubic feet. Even compared to the same period last year, supply has fallen by 176 million cubic feet per day.

For an economy whose industrial backbone, power generation, and fertilizer production depend overwhelmingly on gas, this gap is not technical; it is existential.

The roots of this imbalance lie in a policy choice made years ago: To manage scarcity through imports rather than confront it through exploration.

During the previous government’s tenure, liquefied natural gas was elevated from a stopgap solution to a structural pillar of energy policy. Instead of aggressively investing in onshore and offshore exploration, Bangladesh chose the predictability of foreign cargoes, even as global energy markets grew more volatile and geopolitics more intrusive.

The financial cost of this choice is staggering. Since the 2018–19 fiscal year, the country has spent or committed to spend more than Tk 2.56 trillion on LNG imports.

In the current fiscal year alone, plans are in place to import 115 cargoes at an estimated cost of Tk 51,540 crore, significantly higher than the previous year.

These figures reflect not only rising volumes, but also the growing price of dependency.

Meanwhile, domestic production has been quietly eroding. Four of the five companies extracting gas in Bangladesh have recorded declines over the past year.

Bangladesh Gas Fields Company Limited saw production fall by more than 500 million cubic metres year-on-year. Bapex’s output dropped by around 14%. Even Chevron, which supplies nearly half of the country’s gas through its three onshore fields, experienced a decline of over one billion cubic metres in a single year.

Only one operator showed a marginal increase, insufficient to offset the broader trend. This is not a coincidence; it is what depletion looks like when exploration stagnates and development lags behind demand growth.

Adding to this fragility is inefficiency within the system itself. Around 150 million cubic feet of gas is reportedly lost from the grid every day due to leaks, technical losses, and mismanagement.

In such a scenario, drilling new wells without fixing transmission and distribution inefficiencies is akin to pouring water into a cracked vessel. The result is predictable: New supply fails to translate into meaningful relief, while costs continue to rise.

The interim government inherited this crisis with high public expectations. As a caretaker authority overseeing a critical political transition, it was seen as uniquely positioned to take difficult, long-term decisions insulated from electoral pressures.

Energy, the lifeblood of the economy, was expected to be an early priority. Yet more than a year into its tenure, the crisis appears deeper, not eased.

Import dependence remains entrenched, local production continues to decline, and infrastructure expansion has barely moved beyond announcements.

Two floating LNG terminals currently supply the grid, together capable of handling about one billion cubic feet per day. This capacity is already insufficient, yet tangible progress on new terminals remains elusive.

Building another floating terminal, even if approved today, would take at least three years to become operational. By then, the interim government will be long gone, and the political cost deferred to an elected successor.

This pattern of postponement, where today’s inaction becomes tomorrow’s inherited problem, has become a recurring feature of Bangladesh’s energy governance.

The risks of this approach extend beyond balance sheets. Global energy markets are increasingly shaped by sanctions, conflicts, and strategic rivalries. Recent disruptions in LPG supply, triggered by sanctions affecting shipping and trading routes, offer a glimpse of how external events can suddenly constrict access to fuel.

For a country that imports a growing share of its primary energy, such shocks can quickly cascade through the economy, shutting down factories, reducing export capacity, and straining foreign exchange reserves.

Bangladesh is discovering, belatedly, that energy security is inseparable from national security.

The industrial impact is already visible. Many factories operate for months without adequate gas pressure; others have shut down entirely.

Power plants built at great cost sit underutilized for lack of fuel. Export-oriented industries, particularly those competing on thin margins, face rising production costs and declining reliability.

At a time when Bangladesh seeks to attract foreign investment and diversify its economy, persistent energy shortages send a deeply discouraging signal. Investors may tolerate policy uncertainty; they rarely tolerate unreliable energy.

To be fair, plans do exist. An integrated energy roadmap stretching from 2026 to 2050 envisions phased reforms and investments worth an estimated $70-80 billion. There are promises of drilling 100 wells by 2028, purchasing new rigs, updating production-sharing contracts, and reducing reliance on spot LNG through short-term agreements.

These are not trivial measures. Yet plans, in the absence of urgency and coordination, risk becoming another layer of deferred responsibility. Energy systems do not respond to intent; they respond to execution.

What is most troubling is the continued absence of a clear exit strategy from LNG dependency. Importing LNG can stabilize supply in the short run, but it cannot anchor an economy indefinitely, especially one vulnerable to currency pressure and external shocks.

Without a defined timeline to reduce imports and replace them with domestic production, LNG risks becoming a permanent crutch, draining public finances while crowding out investment in exploration.

The opportunity cost is immense. Every taka spent on expensive spot cargoes is a taka not invested in seismic surveys, offshore drilling, or modern grid management.

Bangladesh’s gas story is ultimately a lesson in policy time horizons. Exploration does not yield immediate political dividends; imports do.

Infrastructure takes years; cargoes arrive in weeks. But nations that prioritize convenience over capacity eventually pay a higher price. The current crisis is not merely about gas shortages; it is about the erosion of strategic autonomy.

An economy that cannot fuel its factories without navigating sanctions regimes and shipping constraints is an economy exposed to forces beyond its control.

The interim government still has limited time to shape the contours of what comes next. Even if it cannot deliver immediate relief, it can establish credibility by locking in irreversible steps toward exploration, efficiency, and diversification.

Failing that, the burden will fall on the next elected government, which will inherit not only depleted fields and expensive contracts, but also public frustration and industrial fatigue.

Bangladesh once built its growth narrative on affordable energy. That advantage is slipping away. Reclaiming it will require more than cargoes and committees; it will require a decisive break from the politics of postponement.

Without that, the country risks running its economy on empty, sustained by imports, vulnerable to shocks, and perpetually one crisis away from paralysis.",https://ecdn.dhakatribune.net/contents/cache/images/600x315x1/uploads/media/2026/01/19/9020c84e6d1e2f39edbc929110979331-696dc091da111.jpg?jadewits_media_id=58381,N,,2026-01-19 04:59:21.072811

U.S. Bancorp Total Revenue

Over the past month, analysts have largely maintained their forecasts for the company, indicating confidence in U.S. Bancorp’s performance as earnings approach. However, it’s worth noting that the company has fallen short of revenue expectations twice in the last two years.

Profound Logic is rolling out a new AI-powered development tool that it says will increase the productivity of individual developers by five to 10 times. Dubbed CoderFlow, the software coordinates the work of multiple AI agents to assist with the development new IBM i applications or the maintenance and modernization of existing ones.

Existing AI copilots provide some productivity gains for developers working in an IDE, somewhere around 20 percent, according to Profound Logic chief executive officer Alex Roytman. But CoderFlow is a different type of product. It is not a coding co-pilot, he said. Instead it is a framework for spinning up autonomous agents that can accomplish a range of tasks, from converting code to new languages and compiling the code to testing code in a 5250 or Web environment and even resolving errors.

“What we’re seeing with this new approach is it’s truly agentic and it’s like five to ten times the productivity,” Roytman told IT Jungle. “I always feel like if I say something like this, the person on the other side is like, that sounds like BS.”

But CoderFlow is the real deal, Roytman insists.

One of the product’s advantages over traditional GenAI copilots is its multi-agent framework. Once the customer submits a given task to CoderFlow, such as converting an RPG subprocedure from RPG III to free-form RPG IV, the software will spin up multiple agents automatically to tackle the task. The software will run a competition among the agents – each of which may be using a different language model, such as Anthropic’s Claude or OpenAI’s GPT 5 – to see which one will produce the best results.

“There’s another agent that will look at all of those and say, out of all of these, here’s how I rate them,” Roytman said. “It’ll produce a little rubric and say: ‘This one got the functionality right, but the code is not as well organized as it could be, whereas this one’s got the code well organized.’ Because they’re competing, the winning solution will come to the front.”

The agents have their own containerized environments to work in, which gives them autonomy and also limits the damage they can do if they do something wrong, Roytman said. If an agent brings up a 5250 session to test a change, it’s a virtual emulator, not a real one.

CoderFlow understands and can generate a variety of languages common the IBM i platform, including various flavors of RPG, COBOL, CL, DDS, SQL, Java, and Node.JS; it hasn’t been tested in C on IBM i. Whereas the mainstream LLMs like Claude and GPT struggled with RPG just a year ago, they have made rapid improvements and now display a solid of RPG, Roytman said.

Those improvements mean that any IBM i shop can go out and use Claude or GPT 5.0 to understand and generate RPG on their own. What CoderFlow brings to the table is something different, Roytman said.

“These models do understand the RPG fairly well,” he said. “We provide the scaffolding, the parts that will say, well, in order for me to understand more about this RPG program, in addition to just reading the code, I have to be able to understand the context. It’s going to go out and understand the data, the database tables that I’m working with, what the layout is. The agent can’t really make decisions on how to edit the RPG without knowing the right context.”

Like many GenAI sessions, a CoderFlow session starts with a prompt. A human developer may tell the software to build something, such as an order processing module, along with validation, error handling and API support. CoderFlow will then analyze the command, break it down into individual tasks, and then spin up AI agents to execute those tasks.

Interaction between the human developer and the software is critical for getting it right. The first set of results may be throw-away work and in need of improvement, Roytman said. The software allows customers to deliver feedback in a couple of different ways, including by circling elements on the screen or by explaining the errors in typed input, he said.

“It is kind of like a chat, where you say ‘You got this almost right, but can you adjust this part or can you adjust this piece,’ and it will make the adjustments for you,” Roytman said. “Once it’s edited the code, it then moves on to saying, well, let’s see if it compiles. It resolves all the compilation issues; let’s see if it runs. If it’s a 5250 application, it spins up a 5250 session on its on its own, runs through the application, test everything that it’s built. If there are runtime errors, it resolves them. If something doesn’t appear right on the screen, it resolves them. And it can do that with both browsers and 5250 screens.”

Instead of staring at an IDE all day, the developer is now coordinating the work of multiple agents. Having multiple agents compete to create the best solution bumps up the success rate, Roytman said. All told, CoderFlow can significantly improve the amount of work, whether its new development, maintenance of existing code, or modernizing older software.

You don’t have to be a coding genius to use CoderFlow, but it does require someone with moderate RPG skills, as well as an understanding of the database layout. There is a bit of setup required to use CoderFlow, with the biggest requirement being that a customer must be storing their source code in Git, and managing changes in Git as well, Roytman said. Setup and implementation will typically take a couple of weeks, potentially longer if the customer is not yet using Git.

CoderFlow is a component in Profound App Dev, the company’s flagship application development suite, which encompasses a variety of other products, including Profound UI, Profound.js, Genie, and Atrium. In addition to the Web interface, Profound is offering command line and VS Code extensions.

Roytman is confident that progress in agentic AI is going to provide big productivity gains for IBM i shops in 2026.

“That doesn’t mean, oh, let’s just start getting rid of people. I think companies are going to become more ambitious and start doing projects that they thought were out of reach,” he said. “You can do it much faster than you did before. You’re going to be taking on more work.”

ID46,Walmart,2026-01-19 05:04:25+00:00,Modern Retail,Walmart's fashion push is resonating with more six-figure households - Modern Retail,Julia Waldow,,,,,https://www.modernretail.co/operations/walmarts-fashion-push-is-resonating-with-more-six-figure-households/,"Over half (60%) of Walmart Fashion customers are women, and 40% belong to a $100K-plus household, per data shared at NRF.
Today, Walmart Fashion is home to “six brands that are a billion dollars or bigger,” Incandela said.
It was important, she said, “to change perception of Walmart fashion” — beginning with a fresher assortment.
Elevating Walmart’s fashion offerings “started with the customer,” Incandela said.
“We were covering the bottom of their closet.” This was particularly true when it came to Walmart’s “growth” customer, Incandela said.","Walmart, whose tagline is “Save money, live better,” is typically known for groceries, gadgets and household essentials. But the company is trying to be a more trend-focused fashion player as it looks to compete with national brands, Amazon and department stores. In addition to hiring Incandela — who once launched Saks Fifth Avenue’s website and assumed her current role in 2021 — Walmart brought on celebrity fashion designer Brandon Maxwell as the creative director of Scoop and Free Assembly in 2021. All the while, Walmart has built brands with higher prices, partnered with influencers like Athena Roberts and Lori & Leslie on Instagram videos, and set up shop at New York Fashion Week. It has also overhauled its store displays to group items like handbags and installed QR codes that link to additional colors and sizes on its website.

The strategy appears to be working, especially with higher-income households, executives shared. In November, Walmart revealed that its apparel business grew “over 5%” every month of its third quarter. “We see more and more customers choosing Walmart for their source of fashion,” incoming CEO John Furner said on a Nov. 20 earnings call. Over half (60%) of Walmart Fashion customers are women, and 40% belong to a $100K-plus household, per data shared at NRF. About a third (35%) are ages 25-44.

Today, Walmart Fashion is home to “six brands that are a billion dollars or bigger,” Incandela said. “We’re assertively taking market share, our total performance scores are improving dramatically, [and] we’re capturing new customers,” she added. “Our $100K-plus household income customers are increasing dramatically, because they’re looking at Walmart for the first time for fashion.”

Refining and revamping Walmart’s closet

About half of the U.S., or 145 million people, visit Walmart’s website and stores every week, Incandela said. When Incandela joined Walmart in 2017, the company was doing well with boosting traffic. But, she said, it wasn’t known for playing a credible role in fashion. It was important, she said, “to change perception of Walmart fashion” — beginning with a fresher assortment.

Elevating Walmart’s fashion offerings “started with the customer,” Incandela said. The company found that when a typical Walmart customer shopped in Walmart, 60% of her spending was at an opening price point of $15 average unit retail, or less. However, when that customer left Walmart and shopped elsewhere, 80% of her spending was on higher AUR items. “It show[ed] that we were not supporting our customers’ closet,” Incandela said. “We were covering the bottom of their closet.”

This was particularly true when it came to Walmart’s “growth” customer, Incandela said. That’s a shopper who is Gen Z or a millennial, lives in an urban area, and has more discretionary income. “While we were winning on price, price alone does not make value,” Incandela said. “We were not winning on quality, aesthetic and style, so that’s where we’ve been pursuing this opportunity.”

The store experience has also been important to refine, Incandela said. Today, Walmart has remodeled about 1,000 of its 4,000 stores to help fashion offerings “stand tall,” she shared. As part of this, Walmart created distinct areas for denim and handbags. It also eliminated some 10% of its racks to open up the space. “We wanted the product to be the hero,” Incandela said.

The brand equation

Walmart’s fashion expansion covers three avenues: national brands, opening-price-point brands and what it calls “elevated brands.” Its national brands include names like Reebok, Wrangler and Michael Kors. Its OPP brands include Terra Sky, No Boundaries and Weekend Academy. Its “elevated brands” — or ones with AURs from $15-$40 — are Scoop, Free Assembly and Avia.

Initially, Walmart received pushback for wanting to sell brands at higher prices, Incandela recalled. When Walmart first developed Scoop and Free Assembly, Incandela said, “Our store operators said, ‘No way. We will never be able to sell this.'” Now, she said, Free Assembly is in all Walmart stores. Scoop — a once-shuttered boutique brand that Walmart brought back in 2019 — is in half of Walmart stores. It’s all proof that consumers are willing to opt into higher-priced, trendy styles, Incandela said.

Incandela also described how Walmart changed the look of two brands — No Boundaries and Joyspun — to better service today’s shoppers. No Boundaries is a young-adult brand, but a few years ago, it was “packaging to a customer who was 55-plus,” Incandela said. “That was a $2 billion brand, but … we were missing the mark,” she said. In 2024, Walmart completely overhauled the brand, from its logo to its assortment, to resonate with Gen Z. Its most popular products include joggers, sweatshirts and wide-leg pants.

Meanwhile, Joyspun used to be called Secret Treasures, but as an intimates brand, it did not connect with the modern consumer. “We said, ‘It’s time to retire this. There’s no saving this name,'” Incandela said. Joyspun, the new iteration, replaced Secret Treasures in 2022. “This is one of those things where you have to have a lot of courage, right?” Incandela said. “Because you know it’s not right, it’s not modern, [and] it’s not going to enable you to win.”

Neil Saunders, managing director for GlobalData Retail, has been monitoring Walmart’s progression in apparel, footwear and luxury closely. The company wants to be a “destination for fashion, especially among younger consumers,” he told Modern Retail. But, Saunders said, “This has been quite a tall order as, traditionally, Walmart has been seen as rather frumpy and basic in apparel.”

However, Saunders said, Walmart has “moved the dial” in the last few years by launching new brands, improving product design and making store environments “more attractive through better merchandising.” “I’d say that Walmart is early on in this process, but it has a lot more confidence in fashion now than it has [had] in the past,” he added.

Walmart, too, knows it will take time to accomplish all of its fashion goals — but it’s also eager to keep going. “Frankly, we are just scratching the surface,” Incandela said. “There’s a lot more to come. But I feel like we have momentum, and I’m excited about it.”",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/01/Free-assembly-Walmart.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 02:59:37.823270

Over the past few years, the CCPA has consistently flagged misleading claims across coaching and edtech players.
In 2024, the CCPA issued comprehensive guidelines to curb misleading coaching advertisements.
Why misleading ads persist According to Prof. Keyoor Purani, Vice Chancellor, Prestige University Indore, misleading advertising survives because economics continues to reward exaggeration more than honesty.
Kapoor warns that persistent misleading advertising erodes trust in legitimate offerings.","India’s coaching and edtech sector has repeatedly landed in regulatory crosshairs over misleading advertisements, with 2023 marking a turning point.

In 2023, edtech major Byju’s was penalised by the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) for allegedly publishing misleading advertisements related to its online IAS coaching programme. The regulator imposed a fine of Rs 10 lakh, ordered the company to discontinue the advertisements, and directed it to submit a compliance report within 15 days.

According to the CCPA’s order, Byju’s failed to substantiate its claims regarding the number of successful UPSC candidates trained through its programmes. The authority noted that Think & Learn, Byju’s parent company, did not provide evidence to support its assertion that 62 out of 1,228 candidates who appeared for the civil services examination in 2013 were trained by the platform. Consent forms and fee receipts of the selected candidates were also missing. Byju’s had contested the order and said it would appeal.

This episode was not an outlier.

Over the past few years, the CCPA has consistently flagged misleading claims across coaching and edtech players. In 2023 alone, notices were sent to 20 IAS coaching institutes for deceptive advertising. That same year, successful civil services candidates were barred from endorsing coaching institutes after selection, with regulators classifying such promotions as misleading and unfair trade practices.

A pattern, not an exception

The numbers underline the scale of the issue. According to an Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) report, education has consistently been the most violative advertising sector. In 2022, 27 percent of all advertising complaints received by ASCI were related to education, with 22 percent coming from classical education and five percent from edtech.

The trend persisted in 2025, when education once again topped the violation charts. Significantly, 45 percent of violative advertisements were withdrawn voluntarily after ASCI intervention, highlighting both the prevalence of exaggerated claims and the growing scrutiny they now face.

Regulatory action has intensified. In 2024, the CCPA issued comprehensive guidelines to curb misleading coaching advertisements. That year, it issued 45 notices to coaching centres and fined 19 institutes a cumulative Rs 61.6 lakh. Penalties were also imposed on Vajirao & Reddy Institute, StudyIQ IAS and Edge IAS for misrepresenting success rates by highlighting toppers without disclosing that most had only enrolled in interview guidance or short-term programmes.

In December 2025, Vision IAS became the first institute to face a higher penalty—Rs 11 lakh—for a repeat offence. The CCPA found that while Vision IAS’s advertisements claimed dozens of top-ranking UPSC candidates, only three of the 119 showcased had actually enrolled in its foundation courses; the rest had availed limited services such as test series or mock interviews.

Recently, Manisha Kapoor, CEO and Secretary General, ASCI highlighted a case involving an edtech advertisement that promised a “minimum 3x salary hike” after course completion, supported by a handful of success stories. While individual outcomes were genuine, ASCI found no evidence to prove that such results were typical, directly attributable to the course, or achievable for most learners. The claim was upheld as misleading for creating an impression of certainty, despite outcomes being influenced by multiple variables such as prior experience, skills and market conditions.

Why misleading ads persist

According to Prof. Keyoor Purani, Vice Chancellor, Prestige University Indore, misleading advertising survives because economics continues to reward exaggeration more than honesty. “Education suffers from information asymmetry. Parents and students cannot easily verify claims, and grey areas with fine-print disclaimers make it easy to mislead while remaining technically compliant,” he says.

KV Sridhar, Global Chief Creative Officer at Nihilent Limited and Hypercollective, notes that education is among the top three categories for misleading advertising complaints in India. “The core problem is that education advertisers sell results, not learning. No one can guarantee marks, ranks, placements or success, yet these claims function as emotional guarantees for a child’s future,” he explains.

Sridhar argues that this amounts to emotional manipulation. “Parents are locked into years of coaching, driven by fear rather than aptitude or interest. Even universities advertise ‘90 percent placements’ or headline salaries without disclosing medians or full context,” he says.

A systemic distortion

Purani believes recent regulatory action should be seen as a symptom of a deeper distortion. “Education is a purpose-first sector, but its advertising is beginning to resemble hard-sell consumer categories. When rankings and placements become marketing targets, institutions start optimising for numbers rather than learning,” he says, citing Goodhart’s Law.

This distortion has intensified as coaching, edtech and test-prep businesses—operating with low entry barriers and high margins—apply performance-marketing logic to education. “When outcomes are probabilistic but marketing promises certainty, ethical lines blur,” Purani adds.

Investor pressure and credibility loss

ASCI's Kapoor says COVID-19 accelerated the edtech boom and, with it, violations. “Digital platforms and influencer-led campaigns amplified both reach and risk. Many edtech companies are VC-funded, and the pressure to show growth often leads to aggressive, non-compliant marketing,” she says.

Kapoor warns that persistent misleading advertising erodes trust in legitimate offerings. “Education touches every household. When exaggeration becomes the norm, skepticism grows—and that damages the sector’s long-term credibility.”

Vibhor Yadav, Regional Creative Officer and Founding Partner at TGTHR, is blunt: “This isn’t accidental—it’s strategic. When a Rs 4–5 lakh penalty delivers enrolments worth crores, institutions factor penalties into their cost of acquisition.”

According to Yadav, enforcement is reactive, not preventive. “By the time action is taken, the business objective is already achieved. But what’s changing now is scrutiny—ads don’t disappear anymore. They’re archived, shared and challenged in real time.”

The cost of broken trust

The cumulative effect is a credibility deficit across the category. “Parents today aren’t asking which institute is best, but which claim is least exaggerated,” Yadav says. This has driven some students toward self-study and alternative learning models.

Sridhar believes the issue goes beyond advertising. “Education has become over-commercialised. Many institutions are now run like real estate ventures. Making money isn’t wrong—but exploiting fear is,” he says, warning that the sector is increasingly fuelled by “bad money” rather than long-term value creation.

The way forward

Experts agree that reform cannot rely on regulation alone. Ethical advertising must focus on inputs, not guaranteed outcomes—faculty quality, curriculum design, mentoring and learning processes. “If a claim needs a disclaimer to undo its implication, the claim itself needs rethinking,” Purani argues.

As ASCI’s Kapoor notes, advertising can amplify credibility but cannot replace it. “Education marketing must build trust, not trade on vulnerability.”",https://images.storyboard18.com/storyboard18/2026/01/Copy-of-CXO-5-2026-01-dce531d629cd875cc065b8377f114bbb-1019x573.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 00:00:02.979852

FIVE THINGS I LEARNED FROM BREAKINGVIEWS THIS WEEK

RISK AND RESOLVE

One of this newsletter’s recurring themes is the extraordinary resilience of economies and financial markets in the face of geopolitical turmoil. Imagine if, at the beginning of 2025, investors had perfect foresight about everything happening in the next twelve months. They would have braced for a tariff-induced recession and sustained selloff - neither of which materialised. The U.S. economy probably expanded by around 2% last year, and the S&P 500 Index ended 2025 up 16%.

The disconnect has become even starker in the past two weeks. Donald Trump has arrested the president of Venezuela and started selling the country’s oil, undermined the transatlantic alliance by reviving his interest in Greenland, and advocated for a change of government in Iran. His administration then threatened Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell with a criminal indictment. The president has expressed his desire to cap credit card interest rates, impose a 25% tariff on countries that do business with Iran, and restrict defence contractors from returning cash to shareholders. Oh, and he threatened to send troops into U.S. cities.

Despite all this, investors have barely blinked. The S&P 500 Index (.SPX), opens new tab is up just over 1% this year, yields on 10-year U.S. government bonds are pretty much unchanged, and the VIX index (.VIX), opens new tab of stock market volatility remains low. Meanwhile speculators are piling into silver (up 24% this year) and bitcoin (up 9%).

There are three broad explanations. The first is that money managers think none of the things Trump is threatening will actually happen. Congress and the Supreme Court will restrain him, or he will back down when reality proves more complicated. Yet this theory doesn’t really hold up. For example, U.S. bank stocks sold off following Trump’s credit card comments, even though a cap would be hard to implement.

The second explanation is that none of this will meaningfully change the direction of inflation, interest rates, or corporate earnings. Venezuela produces less than a million barrels of oil a day, a rounding error in the global market. The stock market’s dependence on a small number of giant tech companies means its future is more tightly tied to the fate of artificial intelligence than to broader economic shifts. But this theory, too, has holes. It’s hard to conceive of a more consequential action for markets than the U.S. president bullying the central bank into lowering interest rates. Yet investors have shrugged off Trump’s assault on the Fed.

The third explanation is that big shifts take time. They require investors to fundamentally rethink how and where to allocate assets. And few will talk about it publicly. It was therefore striking that Dan Ivascyn, the chief investment officer of Pimco, this week told the Financial Times that the giant bond fund manager is diversifying away, opens new tab from the United States. Sometimes the connection between different events is not as strong as we thought. Or it may just take time for the link to reveal itself.

CHART OF THE WEEK

Wall Street banks often complain that they’re held back by excessive regulation, allowing less restrained rivals to push into trading or private credit. So it’s striking that both Morgan Stanley (MS.N), opens new tab and Goldman Sachs (GS.N), opens new tab now trade at a higher multiple of book value than in 2007, when the Global Financial Crisis kicked off. Yet as Stephen Gandel observes, their reported return on equity is still much lower than in those heady days.

THE WEEK IN PODCASTS

PARTING SHOT

I was sad to hear that David Webb had died at the age of 60. Hong Kong’s most prominent corporate gadfly spent decades pursuing a lonely but important campaign for better transparency and against poor corporate governance in the Asian financial hub. His encyclopedic memory, clarity of thought, and strongly held views made him a valuable resource for other investors - and for financial journalists. Hudson Lockett’s obituary is a fitting tribute to the man, who would doubtless have appreciated its sharp conclusion.

GDOS demonstrates that these values are not merely slogans, but a platform where employees can personally practice them within the community and reaffirm the company's reason for existence.""

On September 25 last year, Eli Lilly Korea held a volunteer activity attended by all employees to celebrate the 'Global Day of Service (GDOS).' GDOS is a global volunteer program launched by Lilly in 2008, which has accumulated over 1.2 million volunteer hours across 65 countries to date. Eli Lilly Korea has participated since 2010, contributing more than 20,000 hours of service.

The Global Day of Service is a day when organizations and individuals worldwide volunteer for local communities and global issues. Lilly operates this day annually as its own GDOS, effectively establishing it as ""the volunteering day for Lilly employees worldwide.""

The theme for the 2025 Eli Lilly Korea GDOS was ""A Better World Made Together,"" centered on two pillars: environmental improvement and support for underprivileged children. Approximately 250 employees were divided into groups to conduct plogging in Jung-gu and Seodaemun, and to create donation kits for child support. The donations were delivered through Save the Children, in cooperation with the Community Chest of Korea. They provided necessary items to children at the Manan District Social Welfare Center in Anyang.

Notably, they introduced 'GDOS Night; for the first time last year, featuring a charity performance by the in-house band and a donation program. A new attempt was made to expand the post-volunteer interaction into another act of sharing by accumulating the entire proceeds from food and beverages purchased by employees as donation funds.

GDOS aligns with Lilly's global sustainability strategy, which includes: ▲ expanding access to medicines ▲ improving environments with limited medical infrastructure ▲ strengthening community resilience ▲ minimizing environmental footprints ▲ fostering innovation grounded in inclusion and diversity.

We met with Minju Kang, Medical Director of Eli Lilly Korea, who managed last year's GDOS, and the TF team (Joohee Lee, Yu Seok Kang , and Hyung-min Kim) to discuss preparations, operations, achievements, and future directions.

Q. Please describe your roles in last year's GDOS.

Minju Kang (Medical): I am Minju Kang, head of the Medical Department and the sponsor for GDOS. Each year, a different department takes turns sponsoring GDOS, and since the Medical Department was in charge last year, I took on the role of sponsor.

Hyung-min Kim (Regulatory Affairs): I am Hyung-min Kim from the Regulatory Affairs team. For this GDOS, I established the overall program plan, selected volunteer activities, and managed group assignments.

Joohee Lee (Medical): I am Joohee Lee from the Medical Department. This program was led by three 'Champion Leaders' centered around Vice President Minju Kang. My role involved planning the program, encouraging employee participation, and setting the direction for which values we should focus on.

Yu Seok Kang (ENC): I am Yu Seok Kang from the ENC team. Since GDOS is a long-standing event, my primary role was to ensure that the company's regulations and procedures were strictly followed throughout the support process.

Q. What kind of event is GDOS?

Minju Kang: GDOS is a global corporate social responsibility program in which all Lilly branches worldwide, including the U.S. headquarters and Korea, participate. It has continued for nearly 20 years since its 2008 launch, and Eli Lilly Korea has participated consistently since 2010.

It is highly significant because it goes beyond a simple annual event; it is a time for us, as members of a pharmaceutical company, to reconnect with our fundamental purpose asking 'Why do we do this work?'

GDOS is operated as a volunteer-based activity involving all employees, and each year the TF Champions plan the program. The format changes annually. In some years, we conduct plogging to improve community environmental health, and other years we assemble donation kits for the underprivileged.

Last year, we conducted plogging and kit production simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduced GDOS Night, aiming to extend the lasting impact of volunteer work into a time for sharing and interaction.

Q. Compared to other CSR activities, what makes Lilly's program special?

Hyung-min Kim (Regulatory Affairs): Generally, many volunteer programs rely on external vendors to handle the event's composition and operation. However, at Lilly, employees form their own TF to take the lead in the entire process—from planning and execution to reporting results.

Members experience creating the program as protagonists rather than mere participants, gaining a sense of belonging and achievement. I believe this is the fundamental differentiator of Lilly's CSR activities.

Joohee Lee: Having worked at other pharmaceutical companies, I found it particularly impressive that Lilly employees worldwide participate in volunteer work on the same day.

It is rare to find CSR activities in which employees from every country, including the U.S. headquarters, work toward a common goal with a consistent identity as 'Team Lilly.'

Additionally, not only the domestic TF but also TF Champions from each country meet in advance to discuss the planning direction and implementation methods for the GDOS program, and share the results after the event. This systematic approach, in which we learn from and spread the activities of different countries, sets GDOS apart as a sophisticated global volunteer program rather than a simple local activity.

Q. We heard the 2025 theme was 'A Better World Made Together.' What were the central messages you focused on?

Yu Seok Kang : The first pillar was 'Environmental Improvement.' To this end, we collaborated with the 1365 Volunteer Center to conduct plogging activities that could directly improve the local community's environment. The second pillar was 'Child Support.' In the past, we focused on visiting orphanages to improve their facilities. Last year, during discussions with the Community Chest of Korea, we explored ways to provide more practical help to children.

As a result, we agreed that an approach of personally creating and delivering items that children need and would enjoy was more meaningful. By structuring the program around these two core pillars (environment and children), we prepared for the theme of ""A Better World Made Together"" to be portrayed through the activities.

Q. Could you explain what ""GDOS Night"" was?

Joohee Lee: In the past, after the volunteer work was completed, employees typically went their separate ways.Last year, we introduced GDOS Night to strengthen GDOS's communal values further.

Many employees voluntarily attended the event even after the official activities ended, continuing the interaction and sharing. I believe this experience catalyzed GDOS to naturally expand its purpose.

Minju Kang: GDOS Night was an event planned around the 'Lilly Band,' an in-house club.

Employees who participate in the band as a hobby held a charity concert. We expanded the traditional 'one-day cafe' format by renting an external club space, selling food and drinks, and raising funds.

It was meaningful because it provided a direct platform for employees to participate and spread a culture of donation beyond just a concert.

Q. What is the meaning behind Lilly's core value, 'To unite caring with discovery to make life better for people'?

Yu Seok Kang : We thought deeply about how to integrate caring and discovery into our activities harmoniously. In particular, introducing the unprecedented GDOS Night was meaningful because it expanded the event from a mere gathering of Lilly members into a festival where we could share and personally experience the values the company pursues.

Furthermore, we interpreted the purpose of GDOS differently by introducing a structure that converted the program's proceeds into donations. I believe this series of processes was an attempt to meld the corporate purpose of caring and innovation into overall activities, and a case of seeking new ways through new methods.

Minju Kang: Lilly holds 'Respect for People' as one of its core values, which is based on fundamental respect for human dignity and life. Caring, stemming from this value, has a practical meaning for a pharmaceutical company: providing patients with treatment opportunities and improving their quality of life. At the same time, for such caring to be realized in reality, innovative discovery and continuous R&D investment are essential.

Therefore, Lilly simultaneously pursues a people-centered perspective and the discovery that realizes it. The discovery mentioned here refers to the development of new medicines, which directly links to our corporate purpose, as only innovative treatments can provide substantial benefits to patients. From this perspective, GDOS is not an event separate from the company's daily operations, but an extension of the process where caring and discovery for a better life are connected through activities.

Q. Is there a message you would like to send to the TF preparing for this year's GDOS?

Yu Seok Kang: Last year, we made various attempts based on collaborations with several volunteer organizations. However, since most volunteer groups operate with small numbers, there were constraints on schedules and operational methods during the coordination process for GDOS, which requires large-scale participation.

In the future, we can enhance efficiency and meaning further if collaboration schedules are coordinated and prepared at an even earlier stage. Although there was some trial and error, the process itself, including discussing with TF members and brainstorming ways to maximize employee participation, was very valuable, and I am satisfied with the overall results.

Joohee Lee: The feedback left by CEO after last year's GDOS was also memorable. The suggestion was to consider activities that can deliver hope to patients, caregivers, and the community, aligned with a pharmaceutical company's identity and role. From this perspective, I believe programs that create direct touchpoints with patients, such as the Lilly Band holding a concert for patients, are directions worth considering for the future.

Kim Hyung-min: GDOS is not an activity directly linked to performance metrics, but it is an event we must participate in with a sense of mission, personally practicing the company's values as Lilly employees. Since it required preparation outside of working hours, personal motivation was necessary, and being able to provide momentum to each other while working as a team was a great help. I believe a TF involving members who can voluntarily offer opinions is a crucial element for the future success of GDOS.",https://www.dailypharm.com/image/en_og.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 21:00:12.245127

Those were among the findings of a Royal College of Occupational Therapists (RCOT) survey of the workforce, which was conducted from November 2024 to January 2025 but whose findings were released this week.

The research received responses from 321 local authority OTs, a large majority of whom (80%) reported working in social care.

Most OTs face increasing demand

Over four in five respondents (83%) said there had been an increase in demand for their services over the previous 12 months, above the rate for all OTs who answered the survey (67%).

Also, just over half of councils OTs (52%) reported being ""unable to provide equipment or adaptions when needed"", which was also higher than the average for the whole sample (33%).

They also highlighted relatively high waiting times for their services, with 15% saying these were 12 months or more and the most common response being 3-6 months, compared to less than 12 weeks for the full cohort of survey respondents.

£50m boost to disabled facilities grant funding

The news followed the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) announcing a £50m boost to disabled facilities grant (DFG) funding, taking the total for 2025-26 to £761m.

DFGs fund home adaptations for disabled people, such as widening doors, installing ramps or putting in stairlifts, up to a maximum cost of £30,000, on a means-tested basis. OTs generally assess people for DFGs and determine eligibility.

Care minister Stephen Kinnock said the funding boost ""could support around 5,000 more people to make these vital changes to their homes so they can remain independent and comfortable rather than face a hospital stay or a move into residential care"".

Investment in OTs urged

However, while welcoming the increase, both the RCOT and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) warned that its impact would be limited without additional investment in OTs.

For the college, director of practice and innovation Karin Orman said: ""Without urgent investment in occupational therapists too, people risk waiting longer for expert assessments, which means people can get the changes they need to make their homes safe and accessible. Without occupational therapists, the right support can’t reach the people who need it most, when they need it.""

ADASS chief executive Sally Burlington said: ""Our members tell us that occupational therapy services who are administering the grant still face multiple challenges such as increasing demand, lengthy administration processes including unnecessarily lengthy paperwork, restrictions on what the money can be spent on, and limits to how much can be spent per person meaning local authorities can’t support people quickly enough with this grant.""

As well as boosting investment in OTs, Burlington called on the government to urgently complete and publish a review of the £30,000 funding limit, which has been in place since 2008. She said this would ""ensure the grant can go further to improve people’s health and wellbeing"".",https://www.communitycare.co.uk/media/1nvluyp2/an-occupational-therapist-talking-to-a-man-in-a-wheelchair-adobestock_151210246-1.jpg?width=1002&height=564&v=1dc871142f52c70,N,,2026-01-18 18:59:45.604347

After completing the takeover, Coris launched a mandatory public offer to acquire remaining shares from minority investors, in line with Cape Verde’s capital market rules. BCA is listed on the Cape Verde Stock Exchange. Market participants said the move could streamline ownership and give the new owner more room to move on operational changes and expansion plans.

From local lender to regional group

Founded in 2008, Coris Bank International has expanded steadily across West and Central Africa. The group operates in Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal, Togo, Benin, Mali, Guinea and Chad, with branches in Niger and Guinea-Bissau.

Under Nassa, Coris has used acquisitions to broaden its footprint. It opened Coris Bank Guinea in 2021, bought Standard Chartered’s retail operations in Côte d’Ivoire in 2023, and acquired Société Générale’s units in Chad and Mauritania in 2024. Company figures show the group’s assets now exceed $9 billion, up from initial capital of about $3 million at launch.

Fresh capital backs expansion

Coris recently secured a €10 million ($11.6 million) investment from Dutch development finance institution FMO. The funding forms part of a €102 million ($118.43 million) round led by Mediterrania Capital Partners and backed by development lenders including BII, BIO and IFU.

The Burkina Faso-based banking group initially declared its intention to acquire BCA in March 2024, following its designation as the preferred bidder for the Portuguese state's stake. Now that the deal has closed, Cape Verde joins the group as its 11th African market, bolstering its presence in Portuguese-speaking countries.",https://www.billionaires.africa/content/images/2026/01/Idrissa-Nassa-1--1--1.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 16:00:13.009870

AI data centers have been growing rapidly and are undoubtedly reshaping the global data center demand.
Whereas a normal data center uses around 5,000 to 15,000 tons of copper, an AI data center uses around 50,000 tons of copper per facility, more than 3 times the amount of a normal center.
Copper is clearly a metal that is desired in all major growth changes around the world, from sustainable energy production to AI centers and more.
America may already be improving copper rush production, as should the other major nations across the globe.","This digital age of technology and electrification has its perks. It has truly changed how the world lives, works, and connects, offering easy access to anything imaginable. However, this age of technology has also brought with it some heightened demand for certain resources like copper, which might soon reach a pace that production is not able to keep up with.

The dark side of the rise in our digital age

Digitisation and technological advancement certainly have their perks, with improved communication, easy access to information, advancements in healthcare, productivity, efficiency, and economic growth, and job creation, amongst numerous other benefits. While all of these are greatly helpful to the world, they have an unfortunate downside that can go unnoticed.

Increased reliance on digitization and technology means an increase in the need for electricity. This heightened power demand relies heavily on copper, as it is one of the best conductors and essential for wiring. This element is a pretty crucial infrastructure element used in power grids and data centers, as well as for electronic devices, and even renewable energy technology like solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles.

Carlos Pascual, Senior Vice President, Geopolitics and International Affairs, S&P Global Energy, explains the importance of copper:

“Several countries have deemed copper a ‘critical metal’ over the past half decade, including, in 2025, the United States. And with good reason. Copper is the connective artery linking physical machinery, digital intelligence, mobility, infrastructure, communication and security systems; the future availability of copper has become a matter of strategic importance.”

While the demand for copper isn’t an issue right now, it is the predicted increase in demand over the next few years that the world won’t be able to keep up with. One key technological development is going to cause a drastic increase, and it might surprise you.

AI data centers may be to blame for the projected increase in copper demand

It can’t have gone unnoticed by anyone that the AI industry has skyrocketed. AI data centers have been growing rapidly and are undoubtedly reshaping the global data center demand. The market is expanding hugely, and along with it is the use of electricity and its associated copper.

Whereas a normal data center uses around 5,000 to 15,000 tons of copper, an AI data center uses around 50,000 tons of copper per facility, more than 3 times the amount of a normal center.

Daniel Yergin, Vice Chairman, S&P Global, talks about the projected demand:

“Here, in short, is the quandary: copper is the great enabler of electrification, but the accelerating pace of electrification is an increasing challenge for copper. Economic demand, grid expansion, renewable generation, AI computation, digital industries, electric vehicles and defense are scaling all at once—and supply is not on track to keep pace. At stake is whether copper remains an enabler of progress or becomes a bottleneck to growth and innovation.”

This copper demand could lead to a great deficit by 2030

It’s all good and well for the demand of copper to increase, but if the supply cannot keep up, that’s when trouble hits. The IEA has predicted that copper could be in a 30% deficit by 2035, less than a decade away. This would make the metal extremely vulnerable. Copper mining in areas like the Morenci copper mine, as well as brand new locations, will need to increase drastically to avoid such a deficit and turn the supply trajectory around.

Copper is clearly a metal that is desired in all major growth changes around the world, from sustainable energy production to AI centers and more. Primary production of copper is the very foundation of the supply that needs to be reconsidered in light of the future trajectory. America may already be improving copper rush production, as should the other major nations across the globe.

The results that should make investors in airline stocks think again

Delta (NYSE:DAL), one of America’s Big 3 airlines and headquartered in Atlanta, released its Q4 and annual results last week. The other 2 of the ‘Big 3’ are American Airlines and United, although increasingly it is the case that American is trailing Delta and United because while it has an enormous domestic network, it lacks the penetration in the premium travellers market. Sorry for the spoiler alert for what we will soon reveal.

Let’s look at Delta’s Q4 revenue from ‘main cabins’ (i.e. economy) and ‘premium cabins’ (i.e. first class, business class and premium economy). It is common knowledge that airlines make higher margins from premium cabins, although it has still been the case that more revenue overall has been made from economy (even if there are lower margins on each passenger). This is no longer the case. Delta’s main cabin revenue was US$5.62bn and its premium cabin revenue was $5.7bn – these were down 7% and up 9% respectively.

Turning to the full year results and main cabin revenue does exceed premium cabin revenue – $23.39bn to $22.1bn. But again, the former was in decline (by 5%) and the former is in the other direction (up 7%). Overall, passenger revenues were $12.9bn for Q4 (up 1%) and annual revenues were $51.8bn (up 2%). The balance of revenue is made up from loyalty travel awards and travel-related services, $1.6bn in Q4 and $6.3bn for the full year.

The two speed economy

It is common knowledge in any business that it is better to make more money from less people than less money from more people and that is true in the airline business with such high capex and low margins. That is why we are seeing airlines invest so much in premium travel (i.e. cabins and reward programs) rather than economy travel. Look at how ‘premium-heavy’ Qantas’ current 787s are (i.e. the proportion of premium class seats and how much space they take up) and also how the future A350s will be.

But also that while premium travel demand keeps going up and up with no end in sight whilst economy travel demand keeps decreasing due to the two-speed economy that has existed since early 2022. Now, you could say Delta is just one airline…but look at the entire industry and you’ll see the same thing. Spirit Airlines has been in administration for over a year now, JetBlue has not turned a profit since the pandemic, Allegient just snapped up boutique airline Sun Country, and Frontier is struggling too (looking at a merger with Spirit).

What does it mean?

Arguably the key consideration for investors in any airline stock is to what extent it goes after premium travellers, or everyone else. Because if all else goes well (i.e. there are no fleet issues, market disruptions like pandemics and oil prices are reasonable and stable), then that will be the key factor in determining whether or not the airline goes well.",https://stocksdownunder.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/passenger-airplane-flying-in-blue-sky-travel-and-2026-01-11-08-46-35-utc-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 14:59:53.824590

Earnings season intensifies with a diverse lineup spanning financials, industrials, technology, and consumer staples, highlighted by Netflix (NFLX) Tuesday testing streaming economics, Intel (INTC) Thursday providing crucial semiconductor perspectives, and blue-chip stalwarts Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Wednesday and Procter & Gamble (PG) Friday offering consumer health insights.

Wednesday's presidential address takes on heightened market significance as investors seek clarity on economic policy priorities, trade agenda, regulatory approaches, and fiscal plans that will shape the business environment throughout Trump's term. The compressed four-day trading week packs an extraordinary amount of market-moving information into a condensed period, creating potential for significant volatility as participants digest political developments, economic data, and corporate fundamentals simultaneously.

Here are 5 things to watch this week in the Market.

Trump's Economic Policy Address

Wednesday's speech by President Trump at 8:30am represents a critical market catalyst as he outlines economic priorities and policy initiatives for the year ahead. Investors will scrutinize the address for insights into potential tax policy changes, infrastructure spending proposals, regulatory approaches, and crucially, any evolution in trade policy that could impact multinational corporations and global supply chains. Trump's commentary on China relations will be particularly important given ongoing tensions over rare-earth exports, technology restrictions, and trade imbalances that have created market volatility. Any discussion about tariff adjustments, trade agreement modifications, or protectionist measures could trigger immediate sector-specific reactions, particularly in technology, manufacturing, and industrial stocks with significant international exposure. The speech may also address energy policy, healthcare initiatives, and government spending priorities that influence different market sectors. Trump's tone regarding Federal Reserve policy and his relationship with Chair Powell could impact rate-sensitive assets and the dollar. The timing amid earnings season and ahead of Thursday's critical economic data creates a complex backdrop where political rhetoric, corporate results, and economic fundamentals will compete for investor attention and potentially amplify market reactions.

Thursday's Economic Data Convergence

Thursday delivers an unprecedented convergence with both the Q3 GDP revision and November Core PCE Price Index releasing simultaneously at 8:30am, creating potential for significant market volatility as participants digest growth and inflation data together. The GDP revision will provide final perspectives on third-quarter economic expansion, with particular focus on consumer spending contributions, business investment patterns, and net export dynamics. Any material revisions to previous estimates could influence perceptions about economic momentum entering 2026. The Core PCE Price Index represents the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure and will be crucial for assessing whether price pressures moderated through year-end or remained stubbornly elevated. The dual release creates complex interpretation challenges as markets must simultaneously weigh growth strength against inflation concerns to determine appropriate Fed policy expectations. Strong GDP combined with elevated inflation could pressure rate-sensitive sectors by reducing accommodation expectations, while weak growth with moderating inflation could support dovish positioning. Friday's Manufacturing and Services PMI data will provide forward-looking perspectives on business conditions entering 2026.

Netflix and Streaming Economics Reality Check

Tuesday's Netflix (NFLX) earnings will provide critical insights into streaming industry economics, subscriber growth sustainability, and content investment return on investment as competition intensifies from Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and other platforms. The results will be scrutinized for subscriber additions across different regions, average revenue per user trends, and crucially, the success of password-sharing crackdowns and advertising tier adoption. Netflix's commentary about content spending levels, churn rates, and pricing power will help determine whether the streaming model can deliver consistent profitability or faces structural challenges from content cost inflation and subscriber saturation. The company's guidance about 2026 subscriber growth and margin expansion will be particularly important given recent stock strength. Netflix represents a bellwether for digital media transformation and consumer discretionary spending on entertainment, making its results relevant beyond just streaming stocks. Strong results could validate premium valuations for technology platform businesses, while disappointments could raise questions about growth sustainability in maturing digital markets.

Industrial and Technology Crossroads

Thursday's earnings convergence from Intel (INTC), GE Aerospace (GE), and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) will provide diverse perspectives on semiconductor turnaround efforts, aerospace demand, and commodity market dynamics. Intel's results represent a critical test of the company's manufacturing transformation and competitive positioning against Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung in advanced chipmaking. Intel's foundry business progress, government subsidy utilization, and data center chip competitiveness will be closely watched following years of market share losses to AMD and Arm-based alternatives. GE Aerospace will offer insights into commercial aviation demand, defense spending trends, and jet engine maintenance cycles that serve as leading indicators for industrial activity. Freeport's results will provide copper market perspectives relevant for infrastructure investment and clean energy transition themes. Tuesday's 3M (MMM) and Fastenal (FAST) earnings will add industrial distribution and manufacturing supply perspectives.

Consumer Staples and Financial Services Health

The week features several blue-chip consumer and financial companies providing foundational economic insights. Wednesday's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) earnings will offer perspectives on pharmaceutical demand, medical device markets, and healthcare spending trends, while Friday's Procter & Gamble (PG) results will provide comprehensive consumer staples insights across personal care, household products, and beauty categories. P&G's pricing power, volume trends, and emerging market performance will help assess consumer resilience amid economic uncertainties. Wednesday's Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Truist Financial (TFC) earnings will complement last week's major bank results with perspectives on wealth management, retail banking, and regional financial institution health. Tuesday's U.S. Bancorp (USB) will add Midwestern banking perspectives. Friday's Schlumberger (SLB) results will provide energy services insights about oil and gas exploration activity and international drilling demand. The diversity of sectors reporting creates opportunities to assess which areas of the economy are showing strength versus weakness as 2026 begins.

In December 2024, I predicted that Nvidia would be a better Dow stock to buy than Amazon because of its reasonable valuation and superior business model. The recommendation was intended for long-term investors, not those seeking to make a quick profit on a one-year time horizon.

Still, the call has been right so far, with Nvidia gaining 38.9% in 2025 compared to just 5.2% for Amazon. In fact, Amazon was the worst ""Magnificent Seven"" stock in 2025 -- underperforming Nvidia, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Tesla.

Even after Nvidia's big 2025 gain, it remains a better buy than Amazon. Here's why.

Amazon's success is largely tied to AWS

In its most recent quarter, Amazon achieved an operating margin of just 4.1% on its non-Amazon Web Services (AWS) business, which encompasses its online and physical stores, advertising, subscription services, third-party commissions, fulfillment, and shipping fees, and its miscellaneous ""other"" category. AWS is so profitable that it made up 60% of Amazon's operating income for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2025, even though it's less than a fifth of total Amazon sales.

With 35.6% operating margins for the nine months ended Sept. 30, AWS is a high-powered cash cow and the crown jewel in Amazon's crown. But AWS growth has slowed in recent years as it faces mounting competition from Microsoft, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and Oracle.

Rubin could open the door to new revenue streams for Nvidia

While AWS helps fuel Amazon's broader business, Nvidia is more of a pure-play artificial intelligence (AI) company. Its data center sales now make up around 90% of total revenue. And the other 10% of the business is also high margin, with end markets like gaming, professional visualization, automation, and robotics.

Nvidia's presentation at CES earlier this month showcased its new Rubin architecture, which consists of six different chips designed for the next stage of AI advancement -- agentic AI, robotics, and autonomous driving. Nvidia is releasing Rubin ahead of schedule, with deployments to hyperscalers -- including AWS -- on track for the second half of 2026.

Despite its size, the law of large numbers hasn't caught up to Nvidia. It continues to grow earnings at a breakneck pace and defends its high margins thanks to its innovation. Rubin goes beyond the graphics processing unit (GPU) with networking, interconnections, and central processing units (CPUs) for rack-scale readiness. With Nvidia playing a bigger role in AI data centers, there's every reason to believe the stock can keep roaring higher.

Nvidia is a better value for long-term investors

Nvidia's high margins and break-even growth rate justify a higher valuation than Amazon. Amazon has become more affordable because its earnings grew faster than its stock price last year. Amazon is cheaper than Nvidia, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 30.1 compared to 39 for Nvidia.

However, I'd still take Nvidia over Amazon because of its growth potential. If Nvidia's data center business does eventually cool off, it could easily more than offset a potential slowdown with new opportunities in other facets of its business. At the same time, Amazon depends heavily on AWS, and there's only so much room for margin expansion in its e-commerce business.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F851458%2Fabstract-rendering-of-light-emerging-from-computer-components-illustrating-the-growing-importance-of-artificial-intelligence-ai.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-18 15:00:02.744295

ID33,OpenAI,2026-01-18 17:08:37+00:00,RAPPLER,[Tech Thoughts] OpenAI's ChatGPT will test out ads. Here's what to expect. - Rappler,Victor Barreiro Jr,,,,,https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/openai-chatgpt-testing-ads-what-to-know/,"On Friday, January 16, OpenAI announced a number of updates that would be coming to its ChatGPT chatbot.
What ChatGPT with ads is promising OpenAI’s announcement for the eventual introduction of ads to ChatGPT comes with its own mission statement, which feels admirable, if a little off-putting.
According to their announcement, advertising on ChatGPT will also be separated from the actual answers it gives users, and will thus not influence ChatGPT’s responses.
The introduction of ads is a potential starting point of this second stage of enshittification.
It stands to reason that the advertising gambit is the start of OpenAI’s attempts to earn itself more money for sustenance.","On Friday, January 16, OpenAI announced a number of updates that would be coming to its ChatGPT chatbot. In addition to launching ChatGPT Go, its $8-priced subscription tier, worldwide, ChatGPT will also eventually be testing out advertising for its free and Go tiers in the United States in the coming weeks.

According to OpenAI, the move to add advertising to ChatGPT is “so more people can benefit from our tools with fewer usage limits or without having to pay.”

What might users expect from a ChatGPT with advertisements? We can examine the fine print by reading the company’s announcement, but we can also discuss how it might play out in the long run.

What ChatGPT with ads is promising

OpenAI’s announcement for the eventual introduction of ads to ChatGPT comes with its own mission statement, which feels admirable, if a little off-putting.

Said OpenAI, “Our mission is to ensure AGI (artificial general intelligence) benefits all of humanity; our pursuit of advertising is always in support of that mission and making AI more accessible.”

It added that it’s aiming for the long-term value of ChatGPT, with the priority being “user trust and user experience over revenue.” This, despite seeking to put ads into its free and low-cost subscription tiers.

According to their announcement, advertising on ChatGPT will also be separated from the actual answers it gives users, and will thus not influence ChatGPT’s responses. Said OpenAI, “Answers are optimized based on what’s most helpful to you.”

The idea is to show ads after your answers, and, if you’re curious enough, you can ask the ChatGPT interface to tell you more about the advertisement presented.

That said, ChatGPT conversations are also said to be “private from advertisers.” Further, OpenAI promises to “never sell your data to advertisers.”

Users will also have control over their data and the ability to turn off personalization and clear the data users from ads when they want to. OpenAI went on to say the quiet part out loud: “We’ll always offer a way to not see ads in ChatGPT, including a paid tier that’s ad-free,” which can ostensibly be read as, “Subscribe to our higher-tiered service so you can use it without dealing with everything we’ve just written down in this announcement post!”

Enshittification, stage two?

As OpenAI seeks to make money from its artificial intelligence venture, users may have to reckon with actions similar to this moving forward. This is enshittification — the process by which a service or online platform degrades in quality — as it happens.

As Cory Doctorow’s process of enshittification might indicate, we are presumably hovering between its first and second phases, where, after attracting a user base, a given platform will start degrading the user experience to favor business customers.

The introduction of ads is a potential starting point of this second stage of enshittification. Reducing the feature set of a product for users who were previously used to getting everything for free is another indicator of this second stage.

One example of such enshittification that might be relevant to this case would be how Google’s search engine degraded over time. After garnering a large user base (Stage 1) by offering relevant search results and very limited advertising, the site degraded after increasing advertising, enabling search engine optimization and, in some cases, fraud to the advantage of advertising customers (Stage 2).

Stage 3 is when when a company abuses its business customers as it seeks value for shareholders of that company. In Google’s case, it might be argued that its work on inserting AI itself into search is its third stage.

The inevitable?

We must remember that OpenAI, for all its bells and whistles, is a loss-maker.

Fortune, citing HSBC Global Investment Research, projects OpenAI will still not be profitable by 2030, while its user base is estimated to grow to some 44% of the world’s adult population. Adding to this is the need for more cash and resources: at least another estimated $207 billion of computing power to maintain growth plans relative to current realities.

AI needs a lot of money to build infrastructure to support itself, and in a competitive market, there’s only so much to go around. Unfortunately, the introduction of advertising into artificial intelligence chatbots seemed like an all-too-common inevitability, especially given technological history.

How might this play out in the long run? It stands to reason that the advertising gambit is the start of OpenAI’s attempts to earn itself more money for sustenance.",https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2026/01/chatgpt-ads-jan-17-2025.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 13:01:58.166928

You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.
So What Do The Albertsons Companies Insider Transactions Indicate?
An insider sold Albertsons Companies shares recently, but they didn't buy any.
For example - Albertsons Companies has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.","We wouldn't blame Albertsons Companies, Inc. (NYSE:ACI) shareholders if they were a little worried about the fact that Michael Theilmann, the Executive VP and Chief Human Resources Officer recently netted about US$864k selling shares at an average price of US$17.63. That sale reduced their total holding by 14% which is hardly insignificant, but far from the worst we've seen.

Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Albertsons Companies

Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP and Chief Technology & Transformation Officer, Anuj Dhanda, for US$4.4m worth of shares, at about US$19.25 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$17.32. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.

Albertsons Companies insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!

If you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).

Insider Ownership

For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Albertsons Companies insiders own 1.5% of the company, currently worth about US$135m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.

So What Do The Albertsons Companies Insider Transactions Indicate?

An insider sold Albertsons Companies shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example - Albertsons Companies has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.

Of course Albertsons Companies may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.

The 25-per cent tariff, effective Thursday, applies to chips that are ‘transshipped through the United States to other foreign countries,’ White House staff secretary Will Scharf said at an event.
This covers technology like the Nvidia H200 chip and AMD’s MI325X, a government fact sheet added.
‘China wants them, and other people want them, and we’re going to be making 25 per cent on the sale of those chips,’ Trump said at an event on Wednesday.
The order follows an investigation into imports of chips and chip-making equipment launched last year.","President Donald Trump signed an order Wednesday imposing tariffs on imports of certain semiconductors, a necessary step in the White House’s decision to allow Nvidia to sell advanced AI chips to China.

The 25-per cent tariff, effective Thursday, applies to chips that are ‘transshipped through the United States to other foreign countries,’ White House staff secretary Will Scharf said at an event.

This covers technology like the Nvidia H200 chip and AMD’s MI325X, a government fact sheet added.

Trump said last month that he reached an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping to allow US chip giant Nvidia to export the H200s into China, with the US government getting a 25-per cent cut of sales.

The deal was confirmed by the US Commerce Department on Tuesday.

The change will permit Nvidia to sell its powerful H200 chip to Chinese buyers if certain conditions are met — including proof of ‘sufficient’ US supply — while sales of its most advanced processors would still be blocked.

‘China wants them, and other people want them, and we’re going to be making 25 per cent on the sale of those chips,’ Trump said at an event on Wednesday.

However, uncertainty has grown over how much demand there will be from Chinese companies, as Beijing has reportedly been encouraging tech companies to use homegrown chips.

The move marked a significant shift in US export policy for advanced AI chips, which Joe Biden’s administration had heavily restricted over national security concerns about Chinese military applications.

Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle in Congress have criticized the move as a mistake that will help China’s military and economy.

Separately, Wednesday’s order directed US trade officials to continue negotiations relating to the imports of semiconductors and chip-making equipment into the United States, as Washington tries to spur domestic manufacturing in the critical sector.

The order follows an investigation into imports of chips and chip-making equipment launched last year.

The probes were initiated under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, the same legal mechanism that Trump previously used to impose other sector-specific duties.",https://outspoken.newagebd.com/files/img/202601/67ba72466ba1a39941abcfa45889583e_og.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 13:01:37.370623

Lodging stocks were mixed. AHT rose 5%, BHR was down -5%.

In observance of the Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday, there will be no Daily Lodging Report on Monday, January 19th.

Barclays said Hyatt is their most favored lodging name but while lodging stocks have moved up on anticipation of better macro, they expect another soft-ish 4Q and at best, an in-line 2026. Barclays expects incremental hopefulness around a return to industry growth in 2026, driven by easy comps, the calendar and events (World Cup and America250), signs of more supportive domestic macro and tax refunds. Barclays believes a moderate RevPAR acceleration and development momentum are already priced into the stocks. They expect STR/CoStar to update RevPAR projections at ALIS, with a slight uptick in demand/pricing.

Morgan Stanley said their most preferred lodging name is Hyatt and their least preferred are Choice Hotels and Marriott Vacations. They downgraded VAC to Underweight from Equal Weight and Hilton Grand Vacations to Equal Weight from Overweight. They believe consumers should benefit from stimulus and businesses appear poised to increase travel but the cycle is later for services. They remain Overweight Travel+Leisure, Hilton, Marriott, and Wyndham, as well as H.

Wells Fargo reiterated their preference for HLT and MAR as they view NUG and FCF as the means of differentiation in the sector. They remain Equal Weight the C-Corps and Underweight the Timeshare names given ongoing growth concerns. WF said they have never been a big believer in one time events significantly moving stocks so they expect investors to only give credit to ex-World Cup growth levels.

If Park Hotels & Resorts has caught your attention, do not stop there.","Recent insider buying at Park Hotels & Resorts (PK), along with fresh coverage from Barclays within a broader hotel REIT review, has put the stock back on investors’ radar, especially around long term total return potential.

The recent insider purchase and fresh analyst coverage come as Park Hotels & Resorts trades at US$11.42. The 30-day share price return is 4.58% and the year-to-date share price return is 6.04%. Meanwhile, the 1-year total shareholder return shows an 8.02% decline, which contrasts with a 22.71% gain over three years. This suggests that longer term holders have seen stronger overall outcomes than more recent investors.

If insider interest has you looking more closely at REITs and income ideas, it can also be a good moment to broaden your search with .

So with insiders buying, mixed analyst views, a recent one-year decline and a long-term gain, is Park Hotels & Resorts now trading below its underlying value, or is the market already pricing in future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 10% Undervalued

Against the last close of US$11.42, the most followed narrative points to a fair value of about US$12.69, suggesting some upside based on its long term earnings and cash flow outlook under a 11.99% discount rate.

Significant reinvestment and renovations in key resort and urban assets (e.g., Royal Palm South Beach, Hilton Hawaiian Village, Waldorf Astoria Orlando) are expected to drive outsized growth in RevPAR, occupancy, and EBITDA once projects stabilize, leveraging travelers' increasing desire for experiential and high-end accommodations, which is likely to support above-market revenue and net margin expansion.

Curious what has to happen on revenue, margins, and earnings for that valuation to hold up? The narrative leans on specific timelines and profit assumptions. Want the full picture?

Result: Fair Value of $12.69 (UNDERVALUED)

However, there are still meaningful risks here, including the need to refinance over US$1.3b of debt in 2026, as well as pressure on margins from higher labor costs and softer travel demand.

The consensus price target among these firms stands at $103.12, implying a potential upside of about 8% from recent levels.
Entergy shares are currently trading near the upper end of their 52-week range, which spans from $75.55 to $98.58.","While Barclays reaffirmed its bullish stance on Entergy Corporation (ETR) late last week, a contrasting signal emerged from within the company's own ranks. The financial institution maintained its ""Buy"" recommendation and a $96.00 price target on the utility stock, which was trading near $95.60 at the time. This vote of confidence, however, coincides with regulatory filings showing a company insider selling a portion of their holdings.

The recent activity presents a nuanced picture for investors. On one hand, Barclays' reiterated ""Buy"" rating underscores a continued positive outlook from the analyst community. On the other, a Form 4 filing with the SEC revealed that an Entergy officer, Eliécer Viamontes, disposed of 947 shares for approximately $92,010. This transaction contributes to a broader six-month trend where selling activity has outweighed buying among the company's management.

Entergy's stock demonstrated notable resilience last Friday, holding steady around $95.60. This performance stood in stark contrast to sector peers like Constellation Energy and Vistra, which saw significant declines of roughly 10% and 8%, respectively, following reports concerning potential nationwide grid reforms.

Growth Projects and Premium Valuation

Central to Entergy's investment thesis are two major natural gas-fired power projects underway in Texas: the Legend Power Station in Port Arthur and the Lone Star 9 facility in Cleveland. With an estimated investment of $1.6 billion for the Legend project alone, the combined output of these plants is slated to exceed 1,200 megawatts by mid-2028. This expansion is designed to meet rising industrial demand in the region, which includes a planned $1.3 billion artificial intelligence data center in Port Arthur.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Entergy?

The market appears to be pricing in this anticipated growth. Entergy currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.79, a premium to some utility counterparts such as Exelon, which trades around 15.9 times earnings. Management has targeted earnings-per-share (EPS) growth exceeding 8% through 2028 and recently increased its capital expenditure plan by $3 billion to support an expected industrial growth rate of approximately 13% CAGR.

Analyst Consensus and Price Targets

The broader analyst sentiment remains favorable. Of the 17 analysts currently covering the stock, 76% rate it as a ""Buy"" or ""Strong Buy,"" with the remainder advising ""Hold."" The consensus price target among these firms stands at $103.12, implying a potential upside of about 8% from recent levels. Barclays' more conservative $96.00 target sits below this average. Entergy shares are currently trading near the upper end of their 52-week range, which spans from $75.55 to $98.58.

The Path Forward

The upcoming quarterly earnings report is viewed as the next significant catalyst. Investors will be scrutinizing whether management's raised forecasts are materializing through tangible increases in industrial demand and demonstrable progress on the Texas construction timelines. The successful on-time and on-budget completion of the Legend and Lone Star projects is considered crucial for supporting the projected EPS growth and justifying the stock's current premium valuation. Conversely, any material delays or cost overruns could place downward pressure on the company's valuation multiples.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2435388_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 10:00:04.540482

When you attend CES for the third time in a row since the pandemic, you stop being dazzled by spectacle. You start paying attention to what is actually changing. This year, the change was unmistakable.

Walking through the Venetian, one of CES 2026’s main convention hubs, something felt different. Not louder. Not trendier. More grounded. For the first time, accessibility was not hidden. It was not tucked into side rooms or framed as a specialty topic. The CTA Foundation Accessibility Stage, powered by Verizon, sat front and center inside the Venetian. CES participants walking by could not ignore the stage’s presence, pausing to see what was happening on their way to sessions and exhibit halls.

The appointment of Johnson and the recent launch of the ARGOS fluids brand come after a mixed stretch for investors. The 30 day share price return is 6.93%, while the 3 year total shareholder return has declined by 68.67%. This suggests that long term momentum has weakened even as shorter term sentiment has improved.

If you are looking beyond Advance Auto Parts for other auto related ideas, this could be a good moment to scan for fresh opportunities across the vehicle value chain.

With a 68.67% three year total shareholder return decline, recent share price gains, and a discount to analyst targets, investors are left asking a simple question: is AAP a reset value opportunity, or is the market already pricing in future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 20.4% Undervalued

Against the last close of US$43.20, the most followed narrative points to a fair value of US$54.30, framing Advance Auto Parts as undervalued on its own assumptions.

Advance Auto Parts is executing a 3-year strategic plan focused on improving profitability. Initiatives such as optimizing its asset base and divesting noncore operations are expected to deliver adjusted operating margins of approximately 7% by 2027, which could enhance net margins and earnings.

Curious how a business with recent losses is modeled to swing back to profits, grow margins, and still carry a modest future P/E? The narrative leans on gradual revenue improvement, margin repair and a valuation multiple that stays below the current industry average. If you want to see how those moving parts combine into that fair value, the full story lays out every assumption.

Result: Fair Value of US$54.30 (UNDERVALUED)

However, you still need to weigh risks such as weaker than expected sales trends and the costs and complexity of closing hundreds of stores, which could pressure margins.

Another View: Our DCF Flags Overvaluation

While the most popular narrative points to a fair value of US$54.30, our DCF model lands in a very different place. On that framework, AAP trades above an estimated fair value of US$6.94, which implies a wide gap that could matter if sentiment cools.

Centered on Liquefied Natural Gas Carrier (LNG carrier) orders, the scope of contracts is expanding to include large gas carriers and tankers.
GTT estimates that around 150 new LNG carriers will be needed to transport the volumes produced from LNG projects that have already been approved.
LNG carriers are a vessel type that requires advanced technology and are regarded as a flagship segment for South Korea's shipbuilding industry.

Centered on Liquefied Natural Gas Carrier (LNG carrier) orders, the scope of contracts is expanding to include large gas carriers and tankers.

According to industry sources on the 18th, HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (HDKSOE) recently signed a contract with a shipping company in the Americas to build four LNG carriers worth 1.4993 trillion won. The contract also includes options for four additional vessels, raising expectations for further orders.

Previously, Hanwha Ocean Co., Ltd. won an order last month for seven LNG carriers worth 2.5891 trillion won, and Samsung Heavy Industries also succeeded in securing an order in the same month for two LNG carriers worth 721.1 billion won.

The industry expects orders for LNG carriers to increase this year. Last year, high ship prices and delays in Final Investment Decision (FID) on major LNG projects dampened ordering activity. Annual orders amounted to just 31 LNG carriers: seven for HDKSOE, 13 for Hanwha Ocean Co., Ltd., and 11 for Samsung Heavy Industries.

This year, however, as FID decisions are being finalized one after another, particularly in the United States, expectations are rising for a resumption of ordering. According to Clarksons Research, global orders for LNG carriers are projected to reach 115 vessels this year. It explains that the expansion of new LNG project development, combined with replacement demand for aging vessels, will drive the increase in orders.

French engineering company Gaztransport & Technigaz (GTT) is presenting an even more aggressive outlook. GTT estimates that around 150 new LNG carriers will be needed to transport the volumes produced from LNG projects that have already been approved.

LNG carriers are a vessel type that requires advanced technology and are regarded as a flagship segment for South Korea's shipbuilding industry. The industry believes that if ordering continues this year, a substantial portion of the contracts is highly likely to be captured by Korean shipbuilders.

Although Chinese shipyards are rapidly improving their LNG carrier construction capabilities, global shipowners are still said to prefer Korean shipbuilders. As shipowners place a premium on proven construction track records, the technological prowess and reliability of Korean yards are seen as key competitive advantages.

Byun Yong-jin, an analyst at iM Securities, said, ""China's LNG carrier construction capabilities are improving, but except for Hudong–Zhonghua Shipbuilding (Group) Co., Ltd., other shipyards still face a significant technology gap,"" adding, ""Because it is unlikely that global LNG shipping companies will place many orders in China, we expect South Korea to maintain its dominance in LNG carriers for the time being.""

The order momentum centered on LNG carriers is also spreading to other high value-added vessel types. Since the start of the year, Hanwha Ocean Co., Ltd. has secured an order from a Middle Eastern shipowner for three Very Large Crude Oil Carrier (VLCC) vessels worth 572.2 billion won. With the global VLCC fleet aging rapidly, some observers expect continued newbuilding demand focused on replacing older vessels.

Eom Kyung-ah, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co., Ltd., noted, ""Korean shipbuilders are continuing a strategy of expanding their order portfolios around high value-added vessel types that can be built at their Korean yards,"" and added, ""It is important to secure an early foothold in regions such as the United States where vessel demand is expected to grow over the medium to long term.""

Japanese shipping company Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd. (MOL) and India’s state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) have set up a joint venture to order two Very Large Ethane Carrier (VLEC) vessels and are reportedly in talks with Korean shipbuilders. Canada-based shipowner Seaspan Corporation is also considering placing VLEC orders as it moves into the ethane transport business.

Market research firm Research and Markets forecasts that the global ethane market will reach 21.45 billion dollars by 2035.

The expansion in orders is not limited to major shipbuilders but is also spreading to small and mid-sized yards. Daehan Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. recently won orders this month for four Suezmax-class oil tanker vessels, recording about 500 billion won in contract value and achieving 30% of its annual order target. A Suezmax-class oil tanker is the largest size of crude oil carrier that can transit the Suez Canal when fully loaded.

He argued that, while FP64 emulation certainly warrants further research and experimentation, it's not quite ready for prime time.
In other words, whether or not FP64 emulation makes sense actually depends on the application in question.
One of the major sticking points for AMD is that FP64 emulation isn't exactly IEEE compliant.
Meanwhile, Nvidia has developed supplemental algorithms to detect and mitigate issues like non-numbers, infinite numbers, and inefficient emulation operations.","Double precision floating point computation (aka FP64) is what keeps modern aircraft in the sky, rockets going up, vaccines effective, and, yes, nuclear weapons operational. But rather than building dedicated chips that process this essential data type in hardware, Nvidia is leaning on emulation to increase performance for HPC and scientific computing applications, an area where AMD has had the lead in recent generations.

This emulation, we should note, hasn't replaced hardware FP64 in Nvidia's GPUs. Nvidia's newly unveiled Rubin GPUs still deliver about 33 teraFLOPS of peak FP64 performance, but that's actually one teraFLOP less than the now four-year-old H100.

If you switch on software emulation in Nvidia's CUDA libraries, the chip can purportedly achieve up to 200 teraFLOPS of FP64 matrix performance. That's 4.4x of what its outgoing Blackwell accelerators could muster in hardware.

On paper, Rubin isn't just Nvidia's most powerful AI accelerator ever, but it's the most potent GPU for scientific computing in years.

""What we found is, through many studies with partners and with our own internal investigations, is that the accuracy that we get from emulation is at least as good as what we would get out of a tensor core piece of hardware,"" Dan Ernst, senior director of supercomputing products at Nvidia, told El Reg.

Emulated FP64, which is not exclusive to Nvidia, has the potential to dramatically improve the throughput and efficiency of modern GPUs. But not everyone is convinced.

""It's quite good in some of the benchmarks, it's not obvious it's good in real, physical scientific simulations,"" Nicholas Malaya, an AMD fellow, told us. He argued that, while FP64 emulation certainly warrants further research and experimentation, it's not quite ready for prime time.

Why FP64 still matters in the age of AI

Even as chip designs push for ever lower-precision data types, FP64 remains the gold standard for scientific computing for good reason. FP64 is unmatched in its dynamic range, capable of expressing more than 18.44 quintillion (264) unique values.

To put that in perspective,-modern AI models like DeepSeek R1 are commonly trained at FP8, which can express a paltry 256 unique values. Taking advantage of general homogeneity of neural networks, block-floating-point data types like MXFP8 or MXFP4 can be used to expand their dynamic range.

That's fine for the fuzzy math that defines large language models, but it's no replacement for FP64, particularly when it's the difference between life or death.

Unlike AI workloads, which are highly error-tolerant, HPC simulations rely on fundamental physical principles like conservation of mass and energy. ""As soon as you start incurring errors, these finite errors propagate, and they cause things like blow ups,"" Malaya said.

Emulated FP64 and the Ozaki scheme

The idea of using lower-precision, often integer datatypes, to emulate FP64 isn't a new idea. ""Emulation is old as dirt,"" Ernst said. ""We had emulation in the mid '50s before we had hardware for floating point.""

This process required significantly more operations to complete, and often incurred a stiff performance penalty as a result, but enabled floating point mathematics even when hardware lacked a dedicated floating point unit (FPU).

By the 1980s, FPUs were becoming commonplace and the need for emulation largely disappeared. However, in early 2024, researchers at the Tokyo and Shibaura institutes of technology published a paper reviving the concept by showing that FP64 matrix operations could be decomposed into multiple INT8 operations that, when run on Nvidia's tensor cores, achieved higher-than-native performance.

This approach is commonly referred to as the Ozaki scheme, and it's the foundation for Nvidia's own FP64 emulation libraries, which were released late last year. And, as Ernst was quick to point out, ""it's still FP64. It's not mixed precision. It's just done and constructed in a different way from the hardware perspective.""

Modern GPUs are packed with low-precision tensor cores. Even without the fancy adaptive compression found in Rubin's tensor cores, the chips are capable of 35 petaFLOPS of dense FP4 compute. By comparison, at FP64, the chips are more than 1,000x slower.

These low-precision tensor cores are really efficient to build and run, so the question became why not use them to do FP64, Ernst explained. ""We have the hardware, let's try use it. That's the history of supercomputing.""

But is it actually accurate?

While Nvidia is keen to highlight the capabilities FP64 emulation enables on its Rubin and even its older Blackwell GPUs, rival AMD doesn't believe the approach is quite ready.

According to Malaya, FP64 emulation works best for well-conditioned numerical systems, with the High Performance Linpack (HPL) bench being a prime example. ""But when you look at material science, combustion codes, banded linear algebra systems, things like that, they are much less well conditioned systems, and suddenly it starts to break down,"" he said.

In other words, whether or not FP64 emulation makes sense actually depends on the application in question. For some it's fine, while in others it's not.

One of the major sticking points for AMD is that FP64 emulation isn't exactly IEEE compliant. Nvidia's algorithms don't account for things like positive versus negative zeros, not number errors, or infinite number errors.

Because of this, small errors in the intermediary operations used to emulate the higher precision can result in perturbations that can throw off the final result, Malaya explained.

One way around this is to increase the number of operations used. However, at a certain point, the sheer number of operations required outweighs any advantage emulation might have provided.

All of those operations also take up memory. ""We have data that shows you're using about twice the memory capacity in Ozaki to emulate that FP64 matrices,"" Malaya said.

For these reasons, the House of Zen is focusing its attention on specialized hardware for applications that rely on double and single precision. Its upcoming MI430X takes advantage of AMD's chiplet architecture to bolster double and single precision hardware performance.

Filling the gaps

The challenges facing FP64 emulation algorithms like the Ozaki scheme aren't lost on Ernst, who is well aware of the gaps in Nvidia's implementation.

Ernst contended that, for most HPC practitioners, things like positive negative zeroes aren't that big a deal. Meanwhile, Nvidia has developed supplemental algorithms to detect and mitigate issues like non-numbers, infinite numbers, and inefficient emulation operations.

As for memory consumption, Ernst conceded that it can be a bit higher but emphasized that this overhead is relative to the operation not the application itself. Most of the time, he said, we're talking about matrices that are at most a few gigabytes in size.

So while it's true that FP64 emulation isn't IEEE-compliant, whether this actually matters is heavily dependent on the application in question, Ernst argued. ""Most of the use cases where IEEE compliance ordering rules are in play don't come up in matrix, matrix multiplication cases. There's not a DGEMM that tends to actually follow that rule anyway,"" he said.

Great for matrices, not so much for vectors

Even if Nvidia can overcome the potential pitfalls of FP64 emulation, it doesn't change the fact that the method is only useful for a subset of HPC applications that rely on dense general matrix multiply (DGEMM) operations.

According to Malaya, for somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of HPC workloads, emulation offers little to no benefit.

""In our analysis the vast majority of real HPC workloads rely on vector FMA, not DGEMM,"" he said. ""I wouldn't say it's a tiny fraction of the market, but it's actually a niche piece.""

For vector-heavy workloads, like computational fluid dynamics, Nvidia's Rubin GPUs are forced to run on the slower FP64 vector accelerators in the chip's CUDA cores.

However, as Ernst was quick to point out: more FLOPS doesn't always mean useful FLOPS. The same workloads that tend to run on the FP64 vector engines rarely manage to harness more than a fraction of the chip's theoretical performance, all because the memory can't keep up.

We see this quite clearly on the TOP500's vector-heavy High Performance Conjugate Gradient benchmark where CPUs tend to dominate thanks to the higher ratio of bits per FLOPS afforded by their memory subsystems.

Rubin may not deliver the fastest FP64 vector perf, but with 22 TB/s of HBM4 its real world performance in these workloads, it is likely to be much higher than the spec sheet would suggest.

Ready or not, here FP64 emulation comes

With an influx of new supercomputers powered by Nvidia's Blackwell and Rubin GPUs coming online over the next few years, any questions regarding the viability of FP64 emulation will be put to the test sooner rather than later.

And since this emulation isn't tied to specific hardware, there's the potential for the algorithms to improve over time as researchers uncover scenarios where the technique excels or struggles.

Despite Malaya's concerns, he noted that AMD is also investigating the use of FP64 emulation on chips like the MI355X, through software flags, to see where it may be appropriate.

IEEE compliance, he told us, would go a long way towards validating the approach by ensuring that the results you get from emulation are the same as what you'd get from dedicated silicon.

""If I can go to a partner and say run these two binaries: this one gives you the same answer as the other and is faster, and yeah under the hood we're doing some scheme — think that's a compelling argument that is ready for prime time,"" Malaya said.

It may turn out that, for some applications, emulation is more reliable than others, he noted. ""We should, as a community, build a basket of apps to look at. I think that's the way to progress here."" ®",https://regmedia.co.uk/2026/01/16/shutterstock_376438123.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 07:59:07.541285

That conversation is now outdated. This next phase isn’t about converting paper to pixels but about building a fundamentally new operating model.

Throughout 2026, we predict the performance gap will be stark between organizations that rely solely on experience and those that blend human insight with data-driven intelligence. Leading the charge will be companies that treat data as a core strategic asset, and mold their workflows, systems and decisions around those insights.

Here, I explore several areas that will define the construction and engineering sector in 2026:

The Job Site Learns to Manage Itself

Labor constraints will persist, making automation a practical necessity. In 2026, job sites are expected to become adaptive systems, with computer vision, IoT sensors and geofencing technologies providing on-the-ground truth. Schedules will move from static networks to living plans that adjust to weather, equipment status, deliveries and crew availability. Assignments and lookahead plans will update as conditions change, ensuring the right trades and equipment are positioned at the right time for less manual triage.

Human expertise will remain integral but applied differently. Experienced supervisors will spend more time on validation recommendations, resolving edge cases and mentoring newer workers. Robotics and semi-autonomous equipment take on repetitive and higher-risk tasks – layout, scanning, rebar tying, and certain welds under controlled conditions. With industry estimates suggesting about 500,000 new workers needed to meet demand, a model that pairs human judgment with automated execution is the realistic path to sustained productivity. The GC’s role will include selecting tools, setting guardrails and ensuring that site operations function as a coherent system.

The General Contractor is the New Orchestrator

Increased visibility for owners does not diminish the GC’s role; it elevates their impact. Automated monitoring and analysis now handle routine progress tracking, risk identification and deviation detection. The GC’s highest-value work is orchestration: managing by exception, coordinating trades around timely insights and implementing adjustments quickly.

A weekly workflow looks different under this model. Teams begin by reviewing a concise set of alarms: items with the highest probability of affecting schedule or cost. If a material delivery slips, the system presents resequencing options, resource impacts and downstream effects on dependent activities. The GC convenes stakeholders, validates the options against field realities and implements the preferred path. Judgment is not replaced but applied where it matters most. In 2026, the GC’s role continues to evolve from reconciling data to integrating operations, keeping complex, multi-party projects aligned through shared information and disciplined execution.

Modular Construction Demands a New Kind of Integrator

Factory-built assembly is moving into mainstream practice where it fits the project. Modular delivery introduces a distinct complexity: aligning factory cadence, logistics, and on-site readiness with tighter tolerances and stricter sequence control. Success in 2026 will require a GC capability focused on modular integration.

Serving as the linchpin between manufacturing and installation, this role oversees a complex supply chain and verifies that every modular component’s digital twin mirrors site conditions. GCs who excel will unlock faster schedules, higher quality and lower costs, while those who fall short risk delays and disruptions.

Safety Becomes Your Best Operational Signal

Safety is no longer a siloed compliance function. In 2026, it’s a leading indicator of project health. The same vision systems and sensor data that detect personal protective equipment (PPE) violations and restricted-zone entries also expose workflow friction, sequence conflicts and emerging quality issues. A rise in near misses at a particular elevation may reveal access constraints that will soon reduce installation rates. Recurring violations around one trade can point to schedule compression or unclear workface boundaries.

Treating safety data as an operational signal shifts the focus to root causes. Alerts are tied to remedial actions. Resequencing tasks can avoid trade stacking, adjust delivery windows, add temporary access or rebalance crews. The primary objective is clear: reduce incidents and protect workers. The operational impact follows. Firms applying predictive safety have recorded incident reductions of 30% to 50% in the first year of operations, showing that safe job sites shouldn’t be sacrificed for efficiency and profitability.

The Industry Cloud Becomes the Default Operating System

Fragmented point solutions and custom integrations are no longer viable for complex capital projects. The industry cloud is emerging as the unified operating system for construction — one where advanced technologies like data fabric, semantic models and AI-native architectures are deeply embedded into the platform itself, not just application platforms layered on top of commercially available hosting services.

This intrinsic integration creates construction-specific data standards and codified workflows that deliver true native interoperability across owners, general contractors and trades. A design change automatically flows through to impacts on schedule, cost, procurement and risk — with full traceability and controlled permissions — because the platform is purpose-built for the industry's interconnected nature.

For Construction CIOs evaluating technology strategy, this architectural depth is what will cement the industry cloud as the default OS by 2026. It eliminates chronic waste from reconciling conflicting data sources and delayed reporting, providing a trusted single source of truth that accelerates decisions and reduces disputes.

Most importantly, the deep fusion of technology and application unleashes AI that transforms operations. For example, agentic AI that reasons across live project data can recommend and automate actions. Further, predictive models can leverage clean, connected historical and real-time data for accurate risk forecasting and scenario analysis. This embedded intelligence delivers proactive insights directly at the point of work — whether in the office or the field.

In 2026, data will be foundational, not an afterthought, and AI will evolve from an add-on feature to a core capability that learns from the industry's richest datasets — driving productivity, mitigating risk and improving outcomes at enterprise scale.",https://img.forconstructionpros.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2026/01/prim-adobestock-1844645465.r1sL0IkbWe.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2026-01-18 11:03:38.478421

The owners announced this week that they would be closing the store as part of their retirement plan.

The Wardrobe, located in Cardiff, has been selling classic and designer labels since it first opened in 1987.

On Facebook, the store owners said: “We would like to thank you all and express our gratitude for the support and custom we have received throughout our 38+ years in business.

“Many of our valued customers have supported us throughout the 80s & 90s right up to today. It has been heart warming to see their sons and even grandsons coming to us as regular customers too.

During those early years John Frost Square was thriving with a mixture of independent shops and many other stores of interest.

“The square was a meeting place and our shop a place to come for a chat and a browse.

“The Friars Walk development arrived and many feel that it took away the sense of the retail community spirit and the old feeling of the square.

The Wardrobe is owned by partners Rob Porter and Manuel Lima, who opened their first store in Cardiff in 1987.

They then decided to open another store in Newport, with both stores selling brands like Timberland, Burberry, Thomas Burberry, Chevignon, Aviatic, French Connection, Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, and many others.

In their announcement on Thursday, they spoke about the store’s struggle going through two recessions, a credit crunch, and the lock downs of the shop due to Covid 19.

“All of this took its toll on other independent businesses within Newport city centre, but we were lucky as your continued custom helped ensure we came through all of those events and maintained our place as the successful store it’s always been”, they added.

Talking about the current state of their store, the owners said that they had coped through a tough trading period with the cost of living crisis.

They ended their statement by thanking all of their loyal customers and marking the closure as the “end of an era”.

One customer commented on the announcement saying: “Great shop , but was the owners that made it so good. Really good service and top guys.”

“Bringing back memories of calling in on a Saturday afternoon to get a new shirt for the night out. Made Newport stand out. Sad to see it closing”, he added.

Another shopper said: “One of my favourite menswear shops of all time.

Zooming out, the stock has had a very mixed ride: strong years when smart-home hype and energy-efficiency mandates hit, and painful pullbacks when macro pressure and slower building projects kicked in. Think: not a meme rocket, but not a stable bond either. Volatile. Tradeable. Definitely not boring.

So no fantasy numbers here – just the reality: if you care about this stock, you’ve got to pull the live chart on your own favorite app and watch how it moves day to day.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

Forget the corporate slides. If you’re deciding whether Signify deserves a slot on your watchlist, these are the three pillars that matter.

1. The Smart-Home Flex: Philips Hue and Friends

This is the clout engine. Philips Hue is basically the Apple of smart lighting – not the cheapest, but the one people flex on camera.

Why this matters:

Sticky ecosystem: Once you’ve dropped cash on multiple smart bulbs, strips, and sensors, you’re not switching brands easily.

High-margin accessories: After your first starter kit, it’s all add-ons – more strips, more lamps, more room setups.

Integrations: Works with all the major smart-home ecosystems, which keeps Signify inside any conversation about connected homes.

Is it worth the hype? For creators and tech fans, yes. For investors, it’s one of the strongest product moats in consumer lighting right now.

2. The Boring–But–Huge Side: Pro Lighting, Cities, and Industry

This is where Signify feels less TikTok and more ""massive infrastructure money."" Think:

LED upgrades for offices, factories, and retail

Smart street lighting for cities trying to cut energy bills

Connected systems that track energy use and maintenance

It’s not viral, but it’s real revenue. Governments and big companies are under pressure to cut energy use, and LED + smart controls are one of the easiest wins.

Real talk: this part of the business can be lumpy – big contracts, long sales cycles – but when it hits, it hits heavy.

3. The Risk Factor: Cycles, Competition, and Consumer Squeeze

Here’s the side most promo posts never tell you.

Economic cycles: When building projects slow down or companies cut capex, lighting upgrades get delayed.

Consumer budgets: Smart lights are a ""nice-to-have"" when money is tight. That can mean slower Hue growth when wallets are hurting.

Price pressure: Cheaper smart bulbs and strips from budget brands keep undercutting on price, especially online.

So is Signify a no-brainer at any price? Definitely not. This is a stock you trade with eyes wide open, not with blind fanboy energy.

Signify N.V. vs. The Competition

If you’re going to put money behind lighting, you need to know who else is in the arena.

1. Signify vs. Cheap Smart-Light Brands

On Amazon, you’ll find tons of budget LED strips and bulbs from lesser-known brands. They’re cheaper, they look decent on camera, and for some setups, they’re ""good enough.""

Where Signify wins:

Reliability: Better software, fewer glitches, deeper integrations.

Brand trust: Philips Hue has serious name recognition with mainstream buyers.

Ecosystem depth: Lamps, fixtures, outdoor gear, sensors – not just a few cheap bulbs.

Where budget brands win: Straight-up price. If you’re outfitting a whole room on a tight budget, Hue can feel painful.

2. The Big Rival: Other Lighting Giants

On the pro and infrastructure side, Signify goes head-to-head with other global lighting and electronics players that also chase city projects, building upgrades, and industrial lighting.

Signify’s edge:

Scale in lighting-first tech – it lives and breathes lighting instead of treating it as a tiny side division.

Strong portfolio in both consumer and professional segments, spreading risk.

Brand recognition via the long Philips legacy in lighting.

But the flip side is brutal competition on pricing and specs in big contracts. You don’t win those just by vibes.

So who wins the clout war?

On social clout: Signify (through Philips Hue) takes it. The content is aesthetic, the setups go viral, and the brand looks premium.

On raw budget appeal: Cheaper smart-light brands steal younger, price-sensitive buyers who just want RGB and don’t care about ecosystems.

As an investor, you’re basically betting that the combo of premium smart-home clout + huge pro/industrial deals outweighs the cheap-copycat effect.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

So, should you treat Signify Aktie (ISIN NL0012866412) like a must-cop, or is this just overhyped mood lighting?

Cop – If this sounds like you:

You believe smart homes are still early and lighting will be a core part of that ecosystem.

You like companies with real products, real cash flows, and global reach – not just app-only hype.

You can handle volatility and you’re willing to buy dips instead of chasing peaks.

Drop (or just watch) – If this is you:

You want meme-level upside with zero patience for slow cycles.

You get stressed by choppy charts and cyclical business models.

You think cheaper smart lights and no-name brands will fully eat the premium market.

Real talk: Signify isn’t a ""get rich next week"" play. It’s a bet on:

Smart homes maturing

Cities and companies cutting energy costs long-term

Premium lighting staying relevant even as cheap copies pop up

That makes it more ""quiet compounder with volatility"" than meme rocket. If you’re going in, you do it with a plan: know your entry, know your exit, and always check the live price first.

Not financial advice. This is a breakdown so you’re not flying blind. Before you buy or sell anything tied to Signify N.V. or the Signify Aktie (ISIN NL0012866412), pull up a fresh chart, read the latest earnings, and decide if the risk fits your game.

Because in this market, even the best lights can leave you in the dark if you don’t know what you’re holding.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404993_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 03:58:35.446343

As we enter 2026, organisations are rightly prioritising strong AI foundations such as data, governance and human–AI collaboration.","Today, evidence-based, data-driven decisions are no longer optional—they are essential. “Inside the C-suite: How AI is quietly reshaping executive decisions”, the latest research brief from the Capgemini Research Institute, explores how CXOs are integrating AI into the strategic decision-making journey.

The report states that AI adoption is increasing, with one in six CXOs actively using AI in strategic decision-making—a figure set to more than double within three years. Based on a survey of 1,505 executives at large organisations globally, the report finds that 38% of organisations have already operationalised generative AI use cases, while six in ten are exploring agentic AI applications. About half of Chinese organisations are piloting or deploying agentic AI, ahead of their US and European counterparts. Two-thirds of business leaders believe that failing to scale AI as rapidly as competitors could result in missed strategic opportunities and loss of competitive edge.

Other key findings from the report include:

High experimentation: 41% of CEOs are already testing AI—more than any other leadership group.

Visible benefits: Over half of CXOs report significant improvements in cost efficiency, speed, foresight and creativity.

CXO concerns: Despite growing recognition of AI’s potential to augment strategic thinking, CXOs remain concerned about legal risks, explainability and data quality in AI-driven decisions.

To enable confident AI-powered decision-making, the report recommends revamping AI governance and accountability frameworks for the agentic era, building frameworks to assess decision readiness for AI support, and leveraging human–AI collaboration to unlock true competitive advantage.

Organisations view AI as a long-term growth lever

Another Capgemini Research Institute brief, “The multi-year AI advantage: Building the enterprise of tomorrow”, examines how businesses are accelerating AI adoption while balancing near-term priorities with long-term strategy. Based on a global survey of more than 1,500 leaders across 15 countries, key findings include:

Rising AI budgets: Organisations expect to allocate 5% of annual business budgets to AI by 2026, up from 3% in 2025. Leaders recognise that failing to scale AI quickly could lead to missed opportunities and strategic disadvantage.

AI across functions: More than half of organisations prioritise AI investments in sales, marketing and IT operations. Generative AI has moved beyond pilots, with 38% already operationalising use cases. Agentic AI and edge AI are also gaining traction.

Enterprise-wide adoption remains complex: Strong executive sponsorship (67%), external partnerships (59%), governance and ethical frameworks (53%), and scalable data infrastructure (51%) are seen as critical enablers for moving from pilots to full-scale deployment.

Human–AI collaboration matters: AI is amplifying—not replacing—human capabilities. About 66% of organisations report measurable improvements in productivity and decision quality through human–AI collaboration, while six in ten are redefining skills and investing in workforce upskilling.

Sovereignty and trust: Data and AI sovereignty are emerging as strategic priorities, with 54% of organisations prioritising data control. Firms are balancing build-versus-buy strategies to combine speed with differentiation.

“AI has crossed a critical threshold—the question is no longer whether to pursue AI, but how to embed it into the fabric of the enterprise. As we enter 2026, organisations are rightly prioritising strong AI foundations such as data, governance and human–AI collaboration.

Despite the recovery of financing situation, vast majority of small/ medium-sized Biotech companies are still in long and cold winter. The “wealth gap” within industry has been further widened.

If based on the threshold of HK$9 billion, the companies with a relatively high probability of entering the Hong Kong Stock Connect program at present include CARSgen and Ascletis.

WuXi Bio plans to place 150 million existing shares at a price of HK$38.52 each. However, the reduction in holdings by major shareholders is usually interpreted as a negative signal.

If you’re wondering what Boston Scientific has been up to lately, buckle up.

On January 15, the medtech heavyweight announced it would acquire Penumbra for a staggering $15 billion in a cash-and-stock deal, offering $374 per share.

That represents a 19% premium over Penumbra’s last close.

Penumbra Heats Up as M&A Rumors Swirl– Is a $12B Buyout Coming?

By Baptista Research

Penumbra shares climbed approximately 3.8% on January 14, 2026, amid swirling takeover speculation that sparked renewed investor interest.

The move came as traders reacted to an “uncooked” alert issued by Betaville, a UK-based M&A rumor source, suggesting Penumbra may be the subject of acquisition interest.

Though no specific suitor was identified, the rumor mill was active, and speculative activity elevated trading volumes.

Amgen’s Obesity Drug May Crush Novo Nordisk & Lilly With Just Four Shots A Year!

By Baptista Research

Amgen has reignited investor interest in the obesity drug space with its latest update on MariTide, a GLP-1 agonist that could reshape the competitive dynamics currently dominated by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.

In a Phase 2 study, MariTide helped patients maintain 17% to 18% weight loss into the second year—levels on par with current market leaders.

However, Amgen is positioning MariTide as a superior offering with a differentiated edge: the potential for less frequent dosing—monthly or even quarterly—compared to the weekly injections required for Lilly and Novo’s therapies.

Several industry executives anticipate that the market size for tokenized assets could grow to approximately $400 billion by 2026.

Samir Kerbage, Chief Investment Officer of Hashdex, stated that the current size of tokenized assets is approximately $36 billion. He noted that the next phase of growth will stem more from structural reshaping of value transfer methods rather than speculative demand alone. He pointed out that as stablecoins mature as ""on-chain cash,"" capital will naturally flow into investable assets, serving as a bridge between digital currencies and digital capital markets.

According to reports, the scale of tokenized assets is approaching $20 billion in the 2020s, with traditional financial institutions such as BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of New York Mellon deeply involved. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino believes that 2026 will be a pivotal year for banks to move from pilot projects to real-world deployment, especially in emerging markets, where tokenization can help issuers bypass limitations of traditional infrastructure.

In addition, Centrifuge's COO, Jürgen Blumberg, expects that by the end of 2026, the total value locked (TVL) in on-chain real-world assets (RWA) could exceed $100 billion, with more than half of the world's top 20 asset management firms launching tokenized products. Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, noted that natively tokenized stocks and ETFs will gradually replace synthetic asset models and become important high-quality collateral within DeFi.

For Barclays, the analysis starts with a Book Value of £4.50 per share and an Average Return on Equity of 11.36%.
Based on analyst expectations, this translates into a Stable EPS of £0.64 per share, with those EPS figures sourced from weighted future Return on Equity estimates from 10 analysts.
Putting these pieces together gives an estimated intrinsic value of about £8.73 per share, which points to an intrinsic discount of 44.0% relative to the recent £4.89 share price, so the stock screens as materially undervalued on this measure.
Approach 2: Barclays Price vs Earnings For profitable companies like Barclays, the P/E ratio is a useful shorthand because it links what you pay today directly to the earnings the bank is already producing.","If you are wondering whether Barclays shares still offer value after a strong run, this article walks through what the current price might be implying about the bank's future.

The stock recently closed at £4.89, with returns of 0.8% over 7 days, 6.7% over 30 days, 2.0% year to date, 73.5% over 1 year and 208.7% over 3 years, and the 5 year return sits at a very large 305.9%.

Recent news around big UK banks has focused on topics such as interest rate paths, competition in retail and investment banking, and regulatory oversight, all of which can influence how investors think about a bank's earnings power.

Simply Wall St currently gives Barclays a . Next, we will look at what different valuation methods say about that score, and then finish with a way to interpret valuation that can give you a fuller picture than the numbers alone.

Approach 1: Barclays Excess Returns Analysis

The Excess Returns model looks at how much profit a company can generate over and above the return that shareholders require, and then works out what that stream of extra profit might be worth per share today.

For Barclays, the analysis starts with a Book Value of £4.50 per share and an Average Return on Equity of 11.36%. Based on analyst expectations, this translates into a Stable EPS of £0.64 per share, with those EPS figures sourced from weighted future Return on Equity estimates from 10 analysts. The model compares this earning power with a Cost of Equity of £0.47 per share, which implies an Excess Return of £0.17 per share.

The Excess Returns approach then extends this earning power over time, using a Stable Book Value of £5.62 per share, sourced from weighted future Book Value estimates from 9 analysts. Putting these pieces together gives an estimated intrinsic value of about £8.73 per share, which points to an intrinsic discount of 44.0% relative to the recent £4.89 share price, so the stock screens as materially undervalued on this measure.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Our Excess Returns analysis suggests Barclays is undervalued by 44.0%. Track this in your or , or discover .

Approach 2: Barclays Price vs Earnings

For profitable companies like Barclays, the P/E ratio is a useful shorthand because it links what you pay today directly to the earnings the bank is already producing. It helps you see how many pounds investors are currently willing to pay for each pound of earnings.

What counts as a “normal” P/E depends on how the market views growth prospects and risk. Higher growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher multiple, while lower growth or higher risk usually points to a lower one.

Barclays currently trades on a P/E of 11.30x, close to the Banks industry average of 11.21x and below the peer average of 14.17x. Simply Wall St also calculates a “Fair Ratio” of 9.88x, which is the P/E it would expect for Barclays given factors such as its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics. This Fair Ratio is designed to be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry because it adjusts for those company specific drivers.

With the current P/E of 11.30x sitting above the Fair Ratio of 9.88x, the stock screens as somewhat expensive on this metric.

Result: OVERVALUED

P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? .

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Barclays Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. On Simply Wall St you can use Narratives, where you set out your story for Barclays in plain language, link that story to assumptions for future revenue, earnings and margins, and the platform turns it into a forecast and fair value. This updates when new information such as earnings or news arrives, allowing you to compare that Fair Value with the current price and decide if it looks like a buy, a hold or a sell for you. Different investors might, for example, plug in a higher Fair Value of £4.55 or a lower one of £3.06 based on their own views, all inside the Community page used by millions of investors.

ID33,OpenAI,2026-01-17 21:23:14+00:00,CNBC,Musk seeks up to $134 billion from OpenAI and Microsoft in 'wrongful gains' - CNBC,www.facebook.com,,,,,https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/17/musk-lawsuit-opena-microsoft.html,"Elon Musk is seeking up to $134 billion from OpenAI ⁠and Microsoft , saying he deserves the ""wrongful gains"" that they received from his early support, according to a court filing on Friday.
A pre-eminent expert quantified the value of that,"" Musk's lead trial lawyer Steven Molo said in a statement to Reuters.
OpenAI, in a statement, called it an ""unserious demand"" by Musk and said it was part of his ""harassment campaign"" against OpenAI.
Microsoft ⁠did not respond to a request for comment outside business hours on the amount of compensation Musk is seeking.
The filing says Musk's contributions to OpenAI and Microsoft were calculated by his expert witness, financial economist C. Paul Wazzan.","Elon Musk is seeking up to $134 billion from OpenAI ⁠and Microsoft , saying he deserves the ""wrongful gains"" that they received from his early support, according to a court filing on Friday.

OpenAI gained between $65.5 ‍billion and $109.4 billion from the billionaire entrepreneur's ‍contributions when he was co-founding ‍what was then a startup from 2015, while Microsoft gained between $13.3 billion and $25.1 billion, Musk said in the federal court filing ahead of his trial against the two companies.

""Without Elon Musk, there'd be no OpenAI. He provided the bulk of ‌the ‌seed funding, lent his reputation, and taught them all he knows ​about scaling a business. A pre-eminent expert quantified the value of that,"" Musk's lead trial lawyer Steven Molo said in a statement to Reuters.

OpenAI, in a statement, called it an ""unserious demand"" by Musk and said it was part of his ""harassment campaign"" against OpenAI.

Microsoft ⁠did not respond to a request for comment outside business hours on the amount of compensation Musk is seeking.

During the week, OpenAI called the lawsuit ""baseless"" and part of a ""harassment"" campaign by Musk. A Microsoft lawyer has said there is no evidence that the company ""aided and abetted"" OpenAI.

The two companies challenged Musk's damages claims in a separate filing on Friday.

Musk, who left OpenAI in 2018 and runs xAI, a competitor to ChatGPT, alleges that ChatGPT operator OpenAI violated its founding mission through a high-profile restructuring into a for-profit entity.

A judge in Oakland, California, ruled this month that a jury will hear the trial, expected to start in April.

Musk's filing says he contributed about $38 million, 60% of OpenAI's early seed funding, helped recruit staff, connect the founders with contacts and lend credibility to the project when it was created.

""Just as an early investor in a startup company may realize gains many ‍orders of magnitude greater than the investor's initial investment, the wrongful gains that OpenAI and Microsoft have earned - ‌and which Mr. Musk is now entitled to disgorge – are much larger than Mr. ⁠Musk's initial contributions,"" Musk argues.

The filing says Musk's contributions to OpenAI and Microsoft were calculated by his expert witness, financial economist C. Paul Wazzan.

Musk may seek punitive damages and other ‍penalties, including a possible injunction, if the jury finds either company liable, the filing says, without specifying what form any injunction might take.

In their own filing, OpenAI and Microsoft asked the judge to limit what Musk's expert may present to jurors, arguing his analysis should be excluded as ""made up,"" ""unverifiable"" and ""unprecedented"" and as seeking an ""implausible"" transfer of billions from a nonprofit to a former donor-turned-competitor.

The companies also disputed Musk's damages figures ⁠more broadly, saying the expert's approach is unreliable and ‌could mislead the jury.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108228375-1763570599577-108228375-1763570145468-gettyimages-2246882306-US_SAUDI.jpg?v=1767796601&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2026-01-17 18:00:11.868655
ID33,OpenAI,2026-01-17 20:59:31+00:00,Spyglass,Will OpenAI Ads Click with Users? - Spyglass,M.G. Siegler,,,,,https://spyglass.org/openai-ads-in-chatgpt/,"And much like with Google Search, such text often indicates an intent of some type.
And certainly it will never convert as Google Search ads have.
In a way, they're the new glossy magazine ads versus Google's ads which were more like old classified ads (on steroids, of course).
First, OpenAI needs to find the right chat-based model for ads inside of ChatGPT.
Again, it may be more similar to the Google Search model, but it won't be exactly like it, and new metrics will probably be needed to work at scale.","The ads are coming! The ads are coming!

Look, everything in OpenAI's blog post announcing that advertising is coming to ChatGPT seems reasonable. Fidji Simo smartly frames it as wanting to ensure they can bring their AI to more people, but at the same time, as everyone is well aware by now, it costs a lot of money to do that. Charging for more/better/faster access has worked well to date for the company, but that model will never be able to scale the way 'free' and/or 'cheap' can. It's a story as old as time – or at least, as old as advertising. Sam Altman may have said that he hoped to avoid this fate – ""a last resort"" – but it was always inevitable. You either die as an ad-free service or you live long enough to become an ad vessel.1

That's a bit unfair. But it's directionally true. And it's exactly why you hire someone like Simo to be the CEO reporting to the CEO. She has all the experience to make this work for OpenAI, not only thanks to her Meta days, but her Instacart days as well. She has been able to help get advertising working across several different types of businesses (and I think Instagram should be considered slightly different from Facebook itself – we'll get to that).

So, will this work for OpenAI?

I mean, the short answer is that it has to. Given the costs involved and the competition keeping pricing in check, this will be the only way to scale to billions without breaking the bank – which still might break, even with ads, by the way. The problem is that OpenAI clearly doesn't yet know how it will work. Because no one does. It's a new product and new type of experience – and my guess would be that to truly work, it will require a new type of advertising.

Google is the Google you know today because they figured this out. Meta is Meta because Facebook – and again, later Instagram – figured this out.

Conventional wisdom right now would suggest that the right ad model is going to be closer to that of Google because much like Search, what you type into a text box is key. And much like with Google Search, such text often indicates an intent of some type. But whereas Google aimed to match this intent with a website – well, at first, at least – ChatGPT tries to get you right to an answer. This is a problem for the Google-style of advertising because that was predicated around the notion of a click. Famously, because it's trying to get you the information directly rather than linking to a site that has the information, there are far fewer clicks on ChatGPT.

But Google's model was even better than that. Because a user was trained to know they'd be getting those famous ""10 blue links"" back as a result, they were also trained to quickly scan them. Sure, Google would try to surface the one it found most relevant to your query first, but with millions then billions of web pages and an infinite pool of queries, it wasn't reasonable to think that the top link would always be the correct one. That naturally let Google ""take over"" one of those link slots for an ad unit, knowing the ""impression"" would be there.

Even better, they could move such a unit to the top of the results without too much damage done to the product. Is the ad not what you were looking for? Then just don't click. But even better still, for certain types of queries, the ad often was what you were looking for, because the real genius and killer feature of the model was getting basically all businesses to advertise against the keyword queries related to their businesses – and to those of their rivals! As a result, when I search for ""iPhone"" the top result is often an Apple ad that Google gets paid to display. Because if not, Samsung would try to control that top slot and may divert a customer with clear smartphone interest to their Galaxy lineup.

Everyone knows all of this, of course, but it's worth spelling out just how brilliant this is. It's not an exaggeration to say that it may be the best business model in history. But it's also one that breaks down quickly without those clicks.

Now, ChatGPT is clearly making product tweaks to lead to more clicks. Conversations around shopping are the most clear example of this. Because at the end of the day, you can talk all you want about buying something, but if you actually want to buy it, you're going to have to click somewhere to go do that – even if it's within ChatGPT itself (which is what they're working on, obviously).2

Anyway, anything with some sort of purchase intent is clearly going to get more click-inducing UI tweaks. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it will also help the advertising push. Yet it still feels like that won't be the big breakthrough here. And certainly it will never convert as Google Search ads have. I'm more intrigued by OpenAI's notion that you might want to chat with an ad. On the surface, this sounds gross, but it's perhaps a clever way to integrate ads more natively into the product. Want to know more about the iPhone's specs versus that Galaxy device? Maybe Apple pays to sponsor ChatGPT's answer (without any oversight of the response aside from insuring it's accurate?) with a link to buy. And maybe Samsung pays too for their own link, just in case you deem that the better path.

Travel. Tickets. Etc. The categories will undoubtedly be the same, but the key will be not destroying user trust in the chat by letting advertisers turn said chat into a giant advertisement. ChatGPT is saying all the right things now, but... such things have a way of morphing over time. Bending towards the arc of more monetization...

But all of the above is too obvious. The more interesting ads may be simply about information, the native content of ChatGPT. Can they figure out a way to get advertisers to pay to sponsor relevant information – again, not spammy/pitchy – in response to ""regular"" chats? Is there some sort of new ""cost-per-information"" model?3 Or if a user engages with it, ""cost-per-interaction""? There obviously needs to be some sort of signal to showcase that it was useful to a user and again, it may not be a click. Otherwise, we're just back in the less interesting, and probably less useful, not to mention less lucrative, impression game.

Speaking of, Meta has historically played that game better because their breakthrough, the feed, is naturally more visual in nature. And the natural interaction there, the scroll, allows for easy ad insertion without annoying the user too much – if they don't like an ad, they just keep scrolling. But Meta, even more so than Google, at least in the early days, was able to leverage key knowledge about you thanks to their social graph. So while they didn't have the same search intent Google did, they had better targeting capabilities.

That's interesting as it relates to OpenAI because they should have sort of a hybrid of these two worlds and models (and, to be clear, Google undoubtedly knows more about you these days than Meta thanks to Gmail and Photos and Maps and everything else). ChatGPT can glean intent from what you type, but also better target ads based on all the knowledge it has about you from previous conversations. Google had this too with previous searches, but you're typing so much more, about so many more things, into ChatGPT than you would into a Search box.

Everyone – even Sam Altman – highlights how good Instagram ads are. It's obviously a combination of Meta's data and targeting mixed with the visual nature of that product. In a way, they're the new glossy magazine ads versus Google's ads which were more like old classified ads (on steroids, of course). Is there a way ChatGPT could leverage those types of ads too? Maybe if they continue to fully build out their image generation tools and can make it a true hub people visit. Meta is obviously trying to do this with their AI products. But it's not clear that will be a natural use behavior with AI content, we'll see.

Sora and AI video would be the next holy grail after that, of course. If OpenAI can break into the video advertising game – aka, commercials – well, that's another massive business opportunity. It's one YouTube is still in the process of siphoning away from TV, with TikTok and yes, Instagram pushing hard as well with some success. And then there's Netflix, Amazon, and everyone in streaming making their moves too.

But we're getting way ahead of ourselves here. First, OpenAI needs to find the right chat-based model for ads inside of ChatGPT. Again, it may be more similar to the Google Search model, but it won't be exactly like it, and new metrics will probably be needed to work at scale.

And there's a privacy angle, which OpenAI doesn't shy away from in their post, which makes it even more of a challenge. Many people are clearly already telling ChatGPT things that they don't necessarily want to be advertised against. And yet, an area like health is one of the most lucrative areas of advertising! So that's going to be a fine line to walk... For now, ChatGPT is probably wisely steering clear.

At the end of the day, OpenAI undoubtedly still wants to believe that they can have a more hybrid model than either Google or Meta have, in that they have millions of paying users from the get-go as they start this ads push – those other companies did not, at least not for the core products: search and social feeds. Can they take their existing model and layer in advertising, versus it consuming the entire product, ensuring ""enshittification""? In that way, it's almost more like Netflix.",https://spyglass.org/content/images/size/w1200/2026/01/Gemini_Generated_Image_n3rihyn3rihyn3ri.png,N,,2026-01-17 17:00:16.588189

It means a lot. It's a very proud moment for myself and also for my family, who are now only a 40-minute flight away. Liverpool is a massive club and I think when you join a club as big as Liverpool it comes with massive responsibility and I can't wait to get to work and to give 100 per cent every day.

Liverpool has a very proud association with Ireland in both the men's and women's teams, so how proud does it make you feel to be a part of that now?

Yes it does [make me proud]. There's a lot of Irish people over here and I've met a lot of people already and everyone is so kind. I've felt part of it already and everyone has been so welcoming. I also know a few of the girls here from Ireland so to have them here is very special and I'm looking forward to the journey.

You've won more than 125 caps for Ireland so far. How special is it to represent your country?

I love playing for my country. It's the pinnacle getting to represent Ireland and every time I put on that shirt it's special and hopefully many more caps.

What was the main attraction for you to sign for Liverpool?

I think there are a lot of things. Obviously Liverpool is a massive club and speaking to Gareth and seeing his direction and his ambitions for the club, I think the team has massive potential and I'm really excited to get started.

How impressed were you with head coach Gareth and managing director Andy O'Boyle with the vision they have for this club?

I was very impressed. I think they have a very clear vision of what they want from each player and from the team. Everything here is really special and I think the team has a lot of potential. Some of them are world-class and there's a lot of really impressive things that drew me to this club.

What are your first impressions of the AXA Melwood Training Centre?

Unbelievable. I've been getting videos of this place and it's really special. I think you have to be here to really realise what it's like. Everything is amazing here, it's where you want to be and I feel like you feel like you are a professional when you show up here and that's what I want.

Your Ireland teammate Leanne Kiernan of course is here and our former captain Niamh Fahey in her new role. Did you speak to them before you came to Liverpool?

I did. I've had conversations with them and they expressed what it meant for them to be here and how special it is. I was really excited to come here and having those girls here, I've known them for over 10 years. I played with Niamh for 10 to 15 years and I always looked up to her because she is a leader and I learned a lot from her. So to have her and Leanne here is very special. I think it's important to have people around you like that. You can really get along on the pitch but also off the pitch as well, they are there to support you and they are good friends as well as teammates and I'm very excited.

You know assistant manager Amber Whiteley pretty well, too…

I do, through Ireland. Amber is a really great person, she has got a lot of quality as a coach and that's what drew me here too.

You have played in the USA with North Carolina Courage and also had a spell in Australia. Why did you decide this is the right time for a new challenge?

I was with the Courage for 10 years. I had a really special time and have a lot of great memories from there but for me, I want to push myself and I wanted a new challenge. Also, I'm only 40 minutes away from my friends and family, which is really special and the past nine years they have not got to see me play very much as I've been a long way from home. So, to have them now come over and watch the games, especially for my mum, to be able to take care of her at a pretty short distance is really special.

From a football perspective, it's been a tough season for us here but I know you speak about yourself as someone who's never one to shy away from a challenge, you're determined to play your part in helping the girls turn things around…

Yes, 100 per cent and that's why I came here. I want to help this team and it's important to get results and that's what I'm here for, to have an impact. I want to come in and have an impact from the first minute and get going with the team. I am a natural leader, I want to lead by example and lead with humility as well, bring everyone up around me and that's what I'm here to do.

You bring not only a wealth of experience, but such strong leadership skills as well, which can be so important in tough times. Is that something you feel you can help bring to the young team?

We have a lot of young players here and I think I can make a difference and be a help to them. I want to lead by example, I want to show up every day and give 100 per cent and drive this team on to get results.

Talk to us about your style of play as well, because that strength of character we've just spoken about, it's how you play your football as well, you like to be quite competitive, enjoy a challenge on the field…

I've got a really competitive drive and that's from being the youngest in my family growing up! Also I have a winning mentality, I want to show up and I want to give 100 per cent. I want to set the standards and drive the team on. I think that's really important to drive everyone around you and I want to get results.

Has Gareth told you what he expects from you?

Yes. I've spoken with Gareth a few times and he expects me to come in and be a leader. He expects me to be a professional every single day and the position on the pitch he wants me to play. We've spoken about all that so I'm really excited to get going.

How much are you looking forward to meeting the Liverpool fans? I can tell you they are very passionate and will have a song for you very soon...

I'm really excited to meet the fans. They are the reason we can play the game so I'm excited to be in front of them and I want to show them I will give 100 per cent for the badge every day.

You've called America home for a number of years now but you're a Cork native, so living in the city now, this probably feels a lot closer to your roots. Are you looking forward to taking in the surroundings?

Yes, definitely. I've been to Liverpool before, my family have been to Liverpool a lot, they absolutely love it, so it's a great city and I'm excited to get to know the place.

I imagine your family will be coming over to watch games? It's a bit closer for them than America! You've got five brothers and four sisters, so you might have your hands full sorting tickets...

[Laughs] Yes, they have already been on to me trying to book flights! Look, it's very special and I'm very lucky to have them. They have supported me throughout my whole life so me signing for Liverpool is more for them as well and they are really proud.

Finally, do you have a message for the Liverpool supporters?

I just want to say I am really excited to be here.

Yes. I've spoken with Gareth a few times and he expects me to come in and be a leader. He expects me to be a professional every single day and the position on the pitch he wants me to play. We've spoken about all that so I'm really excited to get going.

How much are you looking forward to meeting the Liverpool fans? I can tell you they are very passionate and will have a song for you very soon...

I'm really excited to meet the fans. They are the reason we can play the game so I'm excited to be in front of them and I want to show them I will give 100 per cent for the badge every day.

You've called America home for a number of years now but you're a Cork native, so living in the city now, this probably feels a lot closer to your roots. Are you looking forward to taking in the surroundings?

Yes, definitely. I've been to Liverpool before, my family have been to Liverpool a lot, they absolutely love it, so it's a great city and I'm excited to get to know the place.

I imagine your family will be coming over to watch games? It's a bit closer for them than America! You've got five brothers and four sisters, so you might have your hands full sorting tickets...

[Laughs] Yes, they have already been on to me trying to book flights! Look, it's very special and I'm very lucky to have them. They have supported me throughout my whole life so me signing for Liverpool is more for them as well and they are really proud.

Finally, do you have a message for the Liverpool supporters?

I just want to say I am really excited to be here. I have heard so many great things about this team, you guys, the city, and I can't wait to go out and give 100 per cent every single day and show you what I can do to help this team.",https://backend.liverpoolfc.com/sites/default/files/styles/lg/public/2026-01/denise-osullivan-signing-interview-cover_ef06df5893076fdbf3a161629045333e.jpg?itok=izitalZN,N,,2026-01-17 17:00:01.009159

The Venezuela headlines have arrived at a time when momentum in Helmerich & Payne’s share price has been picking up, with a 30 day share price return of 15.60% and a 90 day share price return of 40.11%. This is occurring even though the 1 year total shareholder return stands at a 6.86% decline and the 3 year total shareholder return at a 20.87% decline, while the 5 year total shareholder return is 56.45%.

If this kind of news driven move has your attention, it could be worth broadening your watchlist to include as another pocket of potential opportunities.

With the share price already sitting close to the latest analyst targets yet also showing a 41% intrinsic discount estimate, is Helmerich & Payne still cheap, or is the market already pricing in all the future upside?

Most Popular Narrative: 7% Overvalued

The most followed narrative pegs Helmerich & Payne’s fair value at about US$30.27 per share, a little below the recent US$32.38 close. This sets up a mild valuation gap to unpack.

The company's growing international footprint, highlighted by the successful KCA integration and new tender opportunities in Saudi Arabia and Argentina, positions H&P to capture incremental market share and expand EBITDA as geopolitical instability and supply concerns reinforce demand for high-spec rigs.

Curious how steady top line growth, rising margins and a higher future P/E all fit together here? The narrative leans on a tight mix of revenue assumptions, profitability shifts and valuation multiples that are anything but plain vanilla.

Result: Fair Value of $30.27 (OVERVALUED)

However, in the longer term, rig overcapacity and heavy reliance on U.S. shale activity could still squeeze day rates and margins, challenging the upbeat fair value story.

Another Angle On Value

While the most popular narrative sees Helmerich & Payne as about 7% overvalued, our DCF model points in a different direction. On that view, HP trades around 41% below an estimated fair value of roughly US$54.80, which frames today’s price as a much steeper discount. Which story do you think fits the risks and cash flows better?

Wei said about the AI boom as a whole on the company's earnings call... AI is real.
That might sound familiar... Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also explicitly called out the ""AI bubble"" fears on the company's November earnings call...
This earnings report and the outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor suggest the same.
The company manufacturing all these AI chips still sees ferocious demand... And the AI boom still has legs.","The Weekend Edition is pulled from the daily Stansberry Digest.

We're searching for stability...

As uncertainties abound in the U.S. and abroad (i.e., Iran), most of us are looking for a little solid ground.

I didn't expect to find it in economic data releases. But here we are.

On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics published its latest inflation report on time for the first time in months... after being shuttered during the partial government shutdown.

The bad news? Inflation.

The December 2025 consumer price index (""CPI"") rose 2.7% year over year. Certain items saw much larger price gains – like some food categories (beef was up 16%), car parts and repair (up more than 5%), and natural gas service (up almost 11%).

Grocery prices and costs for ""food away from home"" (translation: restaurants) rose 0.7% from November. That's an annualized rate of more than 8%. So rising prices remain a challenge that Americans face every day.

That said, ""premium"" spending continues...

Earnings season is underway again. As usual, that means it's time to comb through quarterly financial reports and company executive comments for insights on the economy.

And so far, while investors have punished some stocks for earnings misses, the AI boom's outlook is strong...

On Tuesday morning, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), a few other banks, and Delta Air Lines (DAL) got things going for the quarter. These companies illustrated something similar in different ways. Let's start with JPMorgan...

The financial giant beat on both revenue and earnings (excluding a pre-announced $2.2 billion charge related to its takeover of the Apple Card loan portfolio from Goldman Sachs). Nearly all of JPMorgan's segments grew revenue in the fourth quarter, with only its investment banking business seeing a decline.

And CEO Jamie Dimon gave a positive view of the U.S. economy. From the press release...

The U.S. economy has remained resilient. While labor markets have softened, conditions do not appear to be worsening. Meanwhile, consumers continue to spend, and businesses generally remain healthy.

Shifting over to Delta Air Lines, the travel giant was also optimistic about consumers – especially on the wealthier end. The company's fourth-quarter results were mixed (earnings beat estimates, but revenue fell short), and its 2026 forecast missed expectations.

However, CEO Ed Bastian said that a year of record earnings is in reach for the company. He added that ""virtually all"" of Delta's growth will come from premium tickets, not ""main cabin"" bookings.

Still, investors punished Delta shares for its revenue and earnings forecast misses. That's a trend we're seeing so far this earnings season...

But of course, there's still a long way to go.

What This Earnings Season Could Mean for the AI Boom

Looking ahead to the rest...

All in all, Wall Street expects the S&P 500 Index's earnings per share to rise about 8% for the fourth quarter of 2025, according to FactSet. That would mark the 10th straight quarter of positive earnings growth for the index going all the way back to the ""earnings recession"" of 2022 and 2023.

Banks and other financial companies are among the first to report, but they won't be the most-watched group. That honor goes to AI stocks, many of which fall into the ""Information Technology"" sector.

And folks have been getting more bullish about AI's impact on the tech sector. From FactSet's Earnings Insight report...

Heading into the start of the earnings season, both analysts and companies have been more optimistic than normal in their earnings outlooks for the fourth quarter. However, it should be noted that most of this optimism is concentrated in one sector: Information Technology.

The S&P 500's information-tech sector includes companies like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Palantir Technologies (PLTR) – some investor favorites when it comes to AI.

But there's one company that's more important than the rest... chipmaker and AI darling Nvidia (NVDA). The AI boom has propelled Nvidia to become the largest company in the world by market cap. As a result, it now has the largest weighting in both the tech sector and the S&P 500.

Here's more from FactSet's report...

At the company level, Nvidia [at $1.52 vs. $0.89 earnings per share year over year] is expected to be the largest contributor to earnings growth for the sector. If this company were excluded, the estimated earnings growth rate for the Information Technology sector would fall to 18.1% from 25.9%.

As CNBC commentator Josh Brown noted at our annual conference in October, Wall Street is expecting more and more from Nvidia. And we don't know how Mr. Market will react if and when the company doesn't have a blowout quarter.

Folks will have to wait a while to find out, though. Nvidia's earnings likely won't come until late February. Until then, investors will have plenty of other reports to dig through.

These releases will tell us what's going on in the real economy and the ongoing AI boom.

On Thursday, we got our first clues on how the AI boom has gone in the most recent quarter...

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) is the world's largest contract AI-chip manufacturer. Its customers include Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). In the fourth quarter, Taiwan Semiconductor reported a 20.5% jump in revenue and a 35% increase in net income.

Looking forward, Taiwan Semiconductor forecasts a 38% jump in revenue in the first quarter.

When it comes to AI products specifically, the company sees sales growing 50% per year through 2029. And here's what CEO C.C. Wei said about the AI boom as a whole on the company's earnings call...

AI is real. Not only real, it's starting to grow into our daily life.

That might sound familiar... Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also explicitly called out the ""AI bubble"" fears on the company's November earnings call...

There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different.

This earnings report and the outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor suggest the same. The company manufacturing all these AI chips still sees ferocious demand... And the AI boom still has legs.

(NASDAQ: LOT)—the only mobility provider with Chinese-made EV entering the North American market above the $80,000 price segment.

Under the new policy, the planned retail price of the Eletre in Canada is expected to be revised down approximately 50%, with wholesale deliveries projected to achieve exponential growth.

Leveraging its North American homologation completed in 2024 and well-established retail network of authorized dealers in Canada, Lotus Tech is well-positioned to capitalize on this market opportunity.

NEW YORK, Jan. 17, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lotus Technology Inc. (“Lotus Tech” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: LOT), a leading global intelligent and luxury mobility provider has expressed significant attention and a warm welcome to the new tariff policy announced by the Canadian government. Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will allow an initial annual cap of 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles (“EV”) into the Canadian market under a preferential tariff rate of 6.1%. This landmark policy adjustment not only signifies positive progress in China-Canada trade relations but also strongly propels the further development of Lotus Tech in the North American market.

It opens a compelling opportunity for strategic repositioning for Lotus Tech. As the brand's first all-electric hyper SUV, Eletre, with its outstanding product capabilities, successfully completed rigorous North American market homologation in 2024. It stands as the only Chinese-made EV currently entering the North American market in the price segment above US$80,000. This favorable tariff policy is expected to directly reshape the Eletre's pricing strategy in the Canadian market with approximately 50% reduction to its planned retail price. Combined with Lotus’ ""For the Drivers"" philosophy of delivering an ultimate driving experience, a more competitive pricing strategy is anticipated to drive exponential growth in its sales volume in Canada.

The Company's global strategic layout with 210 regional stores covering 61 countries has laid a solid foundation for seizing this opportunity. Lotus Tech has a well-established retail network across Canada with 6 authorized dealerships, offering a full range of services from classic internal combustion engine models to the latest electric products. Thanks to its pre-established market access homologation and channel development, Lotus Tech is well-positioned to swiftly translate the policy benefits into market share.

Mr. Qingfeng Feng, Chief Executive Officer of Lotus Tech, commented: “Canada has always been a strategically vital market within Lotus’ global footprint, where auto consumers possess a high appreciation for performance and driving pleasure. We extend our warm welcome to the new, optimized tariff policy, which creates a more open and fair market environment for international auto brands. Building upon our prior groundwork in the North American market, we will seize this opportunity to enhance investment in Canada to explore any potential tactical advantages and strengthen our footprint in the North American market. We are committed to pursuing growth in a disciplined manner that aligns with market development and creates sustainable value.""

BOISE, Idaho, Jan. 17, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU) today announced it has signed an exclusive Letter of Intent (LOI) to acquire Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation’s (PSMC) P5 fabrication site in Tongluo, Miaoli County, Taiwan, for total cash consideration of US$1.8 billion. The acquisition includes an existing 300mm fab cleanroom of 300,000 square feet and will further position Micron to address growing global demand for memory solutions. The LOI also aims to establish a long-term relationship between Micron and PSMC for Micron’s post-wafer assembly processing and to support PSMC in its legacy DRAM portfolio.

“This strategic acquisition of an existing cleanroom complements our current Taiwan operations and will enable Micron to increase production and better serve our customers in a market where demand continues to outpace supply,” said Manish Bhatia, executive vice president of global operations at Micron Technology. “The Tongluo fab’s close proximity to Micron’s Taichung site will enable synergies across our Taiwan operations.”

The transaction is anticipated to close by calendar Q2 2026, following the closure of deal agreements and the required regulatory approvals. Upon closing the transaction, Micron will assume ownership and control of the P5 site to equip and ramp up DRAM production in phases, with PSMC relocating its Tongluo operations over a specific time. Micron expects this acquisition to contribute to meaningful DRAM wafer output beginning in the second half of calendar 2027.

This acquisition complements Micron’s ongoing global expansion plans as the company invests to meet long-term demand from its customers.

Rong Yan, the Chief Technology Officer at HeyGen, a visual storytelling platform, is telling tech professionals to think about how they measure success in their careers. Yan talked about his time working at companies like IBM, Meta, Square, Snapchat, and HubSpot on The Peterman Pod. He has also mentored many tech professionals along the way. His advice is simple: don't make getting promoted the most important thing. Yan said, “Don’t make promotions the objective of your work.” He said that linking job satisfaction too closely to titles can make it harder to grow and more stressful.

Former Meta employee Rong Yan: 'Career growth isn’t about titles'

Since getting his PhD in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 2006, Yan has worked in important roles at big tech companies. He started out as a researcher at IBM, then moved to Meta, where he went from researcher to manager in three years. After that, he was a director at Square and Snapchat. Before joining HeyGen in 2024, he was the vice president of engineering at HubSpot. Yan thought about his own path and saw a pattern among ambitious tech workers: “When you start to get into that mindset, you start to count your happiness or your career growth toward something that you don’t have full control over,” he said. He went on to say that only thinking about promotions can put too much stress on you. It often makes workers compare themselves to their coworkers instead of focusing on how far they've come.

Prioritise skill development and meaningful work

Yan tells professionals not to chase titles but to work on improving their skills, learning new things, and making meaningful contributions. He has learned that employees who think this way tend to move up in their careers without the constant stress of competition with their bosses. Andrea Wasserman, an executive coach, agrees with this point of view. She tells employees to think about the timing of opportunities in a strategic way: “Will this timing make it easier or harder for me to get a ‘yes?’” Yan stresses that the best way to grow your career is to keep learning and adding value, not waiting for recognition. By putting skills and impact first, professionals build a base that helps them move up in their careers and be happy at work.

Singapore Airlines Premium Economy can be found on Singapore Airlines A350-900s, A380s, and 777-300ERs, which have the fourth-best premium economy seats in the world according to Skytrax.
Alongside width and comfort, Singapore Airlines' transpacific premium economy seat also includes an excellent range of additional features.","Skytrax has released the rankings for its annual World Airline Awards. Within the World’s Best Premium Economy Class Airlines award is the sub-category Best Premium Economy Class Airline Seats. This award zooms in on the seats available in each carrier's premium economy cabin, rather than on the entire premium economy product. Unsurprisingly, the results are broadly similar, although not identical. For example, the top three in the overall premium economy award are Virgin Atlantic in first, followed by Japan Airlines and Emirates.

Meanwhile, the top three for the seats sub-category are Emirates in first, then Japan Airlines and Virgin Atlantic. However, not all the carriers placing high in these awards offer transpacific flights, including Emirates and Virgin Atlantic. This article explores the top airlines in Skytrax's premium economy seat classification that offer them on transpacific flights: Japan Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Air New Zealand, and Cathay Pacific Airways. It observes what makes each of these airlines offer such an incredible premium economy seat. The article finishes by exploring the world's best premium economy seat, Emirates, which is not available on any transpacific flights.

Japan Airlines

Japan Airlines offers the best transpacific premium economy seat. It remains the only major transpacific carrier to offer over 40 inches of pitch in premium economy for transpacific aviation. 38 inches (96.5 cm) of pitch is considered the industry standard, but Japan Airlines' passengers enjoy 42 inches (107 cm) of pitch aboard its Boeing 777-300ER and Boeing 787 fleets. That means passengers well over six feet tall can enjoy plenty of legroom. Seat width is between 18.9 and 19.3 inches (48 cm and 49 cm), and there is a substantial divider between each seat. For additional comfort, passengers have a three-step adjustable footrest and a large leg rest. You can use these features to get into a position that may feel close to business class products that don't lie flat.

Another important feature of the seats is their fixed-back shell design. The premium economy seats recline into this shell, rather than into the personal space of the passenger behind. That makes it far easier to work on a laptop or enjoy a meal.

Japan Airlines' updated premium economy product centers around the Airbus A350-1000. The carrier received its first of this aircraft type in December 2023 and hopes it will become its future flagship aircraft. These aircraft have 24 premium economy seats in an eight-abreast layout. The carrier utilizes the latest articulated fixed-shell seats from Safran.

Singapore Airlines

Premium Economy can be found on Singapore Airlines A350-900s, A380s, and 777-300ERs, which have the fourth-best premium economy seats in the world according to Skytrax. However, you can't fly premium economy aboard the airline's 787-10s. Singapore's 777s are equipped with Safran Z535 recliner seats. They have a pitch of 38 inches (96.5 cm), a width of 19.5 inches (50 cm), and a recline of 8 inches (20 cm). The premium economy seats available on Singapore's A350-900 are identical, but have a 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) less pitch.

Alongside width and comfort, Singapore Airlines' transpacific premium economy seat also includes an excellent range of additional features. It includes two USB ports to keep your devices operational, an adjustable reading light, dedicated stowage areas, and a fantastic leg rest.

Singapore Airlines' premium economy product was hanging in the balance before the carrier decided to commit to it. The carrier's executives were initially skeptical, believing that premium passengers would choose business or first class instead. It took significant market pressure for Singapore to launch a premium economy product, but the strength of its offering indicates just how committed it is to it.

Delta Air Lines

The only Western Hemisphere carrier that flies transpacific on this list is Delta Air Lines, which previously utilized a hub at Tokyo Narita Airport (NRT) as the center of its transpacific operations. However, its busiest transpacific route is now Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) to Seoul Incheon (ICN). The carrier operates this route twice daily with 275-seat Airbus A350-900s. In the '39H' configuration, this aircraft has 40 Premium Select seats available. The carrier ranks fifth in the Skytrax Best Premium Economy Class Airline Seats 2025 awards.

The table below shows the five most frequently flown transpacific routes for Delta Air Lines A350s in the winter, based on data collected for December 2025. Please note that there are many more routes flown 121 times in December than there is space for in the table:

Aboard Premium Select, passengers can enjoy 38 inches (96.5 cm) of pitch, 18.5 (47 cm) to 19 inches (48 cm) of width, and seven inches (17.8 cm) of recline. The typical layouts are 2-4-2 for Delta A350s and 2-3-2 for A330s. The denser 2-4-2 layout can feel more crowded than what passengers often expect from a premium product.

Cathay Pacific Airways

Placing sixth in the Skytrax ranking for premium economy seats is Cathay Pacific. Its premium economy is available on some A330-300s, all A350-900s, A350-1000s, and 777-300ERs. Yet, it is not available on the carrier's 777-300s. The A350s have 28 to 32 premium economy seats, and 32 to 34 aboard its 777-300ERs.

There is some variation in what is available depending on the aircraft that you are flying on. The A350-900s use the Collins Aerospace MiQ seats, which have 40 inches of pitch, 18.5 inches of width, and nine inches of recline. The dimensions differ for the 777-300ER's Recaro R5 seats, which have 38.2 inches of pitch, 19.5 inches of width, and six inches of recline. If possible, choose the aircraft you will be flying on for a premium economy seat that is more appropriate for your body type.

In its marketing materials for the premium economy product, Cathay Pacific details what they believe sets them apart from their transpacific competition: ""Across all fleets, our Premium Economy seats offer a generous recline and more legroom, as well as a supported headrest. Full-length calf rests and leather-padded footrests ensure your journey is even more comfortable.""

Air New Zealand

Some Australasian carriers also have superb premium economy products. The best seat among them belongs to Air New Zealand, placing seventh in the relevant Skytrax rankings. The carrier drops to 12th in the overall premium economy rankings, suggesting that it is let down by other aspects of the product.

Layouts and seat dimensions vary across the Air New Zealand widebody aircraft that offer premium economy. The standard Boeing 787-9 has premium economy seats in rows 23 to 25 for a total of 21 seats, with a pitch of 41 inches (104 cm). The V2 Boeing 787-9 configuration has 33 premium economy seats from rows 23 to 27. The pitch is 41 to 42 inches (104 to 106 cm). The Boeing 777-300ER has the same pitch. However, premium economy seats are available in rows 23 to 30 for a total of 54 seats.

New Zealand flies to a huge variety of destinations from its hub at Auckland International Airport (AKL), many of which are transpacific. Examples of US destinations include Honolulu (HNL), Houston (HOU), Los Angeles (LAX), and San Francisco (SFO). The carrier also flies transpacific to Vancouver (YVR).

The World's Best Premium Economy Seat Isn't Available On Transpacific Routes

Ranked first is Emirates, but due to the airline flying from the Middle East, you can't get it for any transpacific flights. Avgeeks will love Emirates' premium economy for flights to Europe, America, Asia, and Africa because it is available on rare aircraft. For example, in October 2025, Emirates rolled out premium economy on every Airbus A380 flight between Dubai and New York. This product has also been rolled out on flights with the same aircraft to London, Sydney, and Auckland. It's all part of a $2 billion cabin upgrade initiative.

These seats are particularly spacious, with a width of 19.5 inches (50 cm), an eight-inch (20 cm) recline, and a pitch of 40 inches (102 cm). The seats are in cream and feature leg rests, leg support cushions, and foot rests. The adjustable headrests allow passengers to customize the experience for their needs. This room is essential for comfortable long-haul flying. The layout aboard an A380 is 2-4-2, meaning fewer passengers get stuck in the dreaded middle seat. Aboard Emirates' A380s, these seats are located in the forward section of economy class. However, they are still on the main deck, so you won't get the unique experience of upper-deck flying.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/premiumeconomy-2.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-17 13:02:09.192336

In 2022, prices for food prepared at home jumped by a historic 11.8% from the year before, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index survey.

While prices didn’t drop in 2025, the rate of inflation for groceries has, for the most part, slowed.

In July, costs for groceries were 2.2% higher than the year before.

The nonprofit Consumers’ Checkbook’s latest evaluations of Puget Sound grocery stores found that most shoppers can save by shopping at low-cost stores.

Checkbook researchers shopped stores using a 150-item list to compare prices. To evaluate stores on the quality of products and service, we surveyed our members.

Here’s what we found.

Use this link for free access to Checkbook’s ratings of 21 grocery stores and delivery services in the Puget Sound area (good through 2/15/26).

Amazon Fresh, Grocery Outlet, Walmart, and WinCo offer the biggest savings.

WinCo offered prices about 24 percent lower than the average at all other stores we surveyed. Grocery Outlet, which offers a somewhat odd assortment of steeply discounted surplus national-brand products, offered prices that were about 21 percent lower than average.

Amazon Fresh and Walmart each had prices about 19 percent lower than the all-store average.

For a family that spends $300 per week at the supermarket, a 24 percent price difference totals savings of $3,744 per year.

Other price standouts: Fred Meyer and Target.

Target’s prices were about 14 percent lower than the average at all other stores we surveyed; Fred Meyer had prices about 10 percent lower.

Trader Joe’s remains popular and relatively inexpensive.

Seventy-five percent of survey respondents rated the funky-and-fun chain “superior” for “overall quality.” TJ’s prices were about 12 percent lower than the all-store average.

These savings are partly explained by Trader Joe’s smaller-format stores, which have much lower overhead costs than conventional supermarkets.

Whole Foods remains expensive—and its ratings for quality continue to dip.

Whole Foods built a loyal following by offering high-quality produce, meat, prepared foods, and generic staples. For years it earned high marks in our surveys of consumers, especially for

produce and meat quality. Now, Whole Foods’ customers give it far lower scores: On our “overall quality” survey question, its score has dropped to just 53 percent.

Our price survey found that Whole Foods remains an expensive choice among the large chains we shopped.

Its overall prices were about five percent higher than the average prices at all stores we surveyed, or about 17 percent higher than Fred Meyer and 30 percent higher than Amazon Fresh, its corporate sibling.

Albertsons, QFC, and Safeway charge similar prices.

Overall, the stores we shopped for the area’s remaining traditional supermarket powers all had prices that were one to six percent higher than average.

On average, they were 28 percent more expensive than Amazon Fresh and Walmart and 37 percent more expensive than WinCo.

On the quality side, the largest grocery chains performed dreadfully.

Albertsons, Fred Meyer, Grocery Outlet, QFC, Safeway, Target, and Walmart each failed to earn “superior” ratings overall from even half of their surveyed customers.

Target scored lowest—only 18 percent of its customers judged it “superior” overall, and none thought highly of its fresh produce offerings.

The highest-rated outlets are all small operators.

Central Co-op, Metropolitan Market, PCC Community Markets, Thriftway, and Town & Country were all rated “superior” for produce quality and for overall quality by more than 85 percent of their surveyed customers.

Unfortunately, the stores that rate highest for quality charge high prices.

Metropolitan’s prices were about 29 percent higher than the all-store average; the Town & Country location we shopped had prices 19 percent higher than average.

Within the largest chains, there is relatively little store-to-store price variation.

Prices at the Albertsons, Fred Meyer, QFC, Safeway, and Walmart locations we surveyed were about the same from store to store.

Costco will save you money—if you shop there often.

Using our market basket of 150 grocery items, we surveyed prices for Costco and compared them to Walmart, Target, and traditional supermarkets.

The Costco we surveyed carried few if any of the items in our market basket in the usual sizes. But when we looked for the same brands regardless of size, Costco stocked 39 percent of our 150 market basket items.

Since Costco stocked so few items in the sizes of our basic market basket, we looked for items of any size from the same brands.

We then used unit prices (for example, price per pound) to calculate Costco’s prices for amounts specified in the market basket.

Then we compared the prices of items at Costco with prices for the same brands at several other stores.

This is not an apples-to-apples comparison—the sizes of the items priced at Costco were usually larger than the sizes of the items priced at the other stores, so Costco enjoys an advantage in such a comparison.

Compared to Walmart and WinCo, its main local competitors, Costco has lost much of its price edge. The warehouse club’s prices were only six percent lower than WinCo’s and nine percent lower than Walmart’s.

Although Costco still offers low prices compared to, say, QFC, Safeway, and even Target, due to higher prices, it’s difficult to justify paying Costco’s $65 annual membership fee if you’re happy with Walmart or WinCo’s grocery offerings.

Costco continues to earn very high customer ratings for the quality of its meat.

The average age on the USS Ford is similar to a college campus.
A month after USS Ford left Norfolk, the engineering department was struggling to explain the problem to leadership.
Similar upgrades on CVN 77 (the carrier USS George HW Bush) have resulted in fewer VCHT maintenance issues,"" Lt. Cmdr.
The carrier USS Ford was already the most expensive ship ever built by the Navy.","New documents show the crew on board the United States' newest aircraft carrier are growing increasingly frustrated by design flaws that lead to regular failures in the ship's toilet system.

The USS Gerald R. Ford has been deployed for seven months since it left Norfolk in June. The carrier is currently at the center of the Trump administration's flotilla of Navy ships in the Caribbean. Since the raid that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, the carrier continues to work with the Coast Guard as the U.S. interdicts oil tankers tied to Venezuela.

On board the carrier, the crew is battling a toilet system that the General Accountability Office reported in 2020 was undersized and poorly designed. The system continues to fail during deployment, forcing the crew of 4,600 sailors to live with a system that randomly breaks down during their months at sea.

NPR has obtained documents that include a series of emails that detail the ship's effort to grapple with the breakdowns. Problems with the Vacuum Collection, Holding and Transfer (VCHT) system increased in 2025. The vacuum system was adopted in part from the cruise ship industry. It uses less water, but the system used by USS Ford is more complex. Breakdowns have been reported since the $13 billion carrier first deployed in 2023.

""Every day that the entire crew is present on the ship, a trouble call has been made for ship's force personnel to repair or unclog a portion of the VCHT system, since June 2023,"" reads an undated document provided by the Navy, through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.

The carrier has called for help outside the ship 42 times since 2023. The rate of calls is increasing, with 32 calls happening in 2025;12 calls were made after the carrier started its recent deployment in June.

A March 18, 2025 email from the engineering department sent out to all chiefs on the ship said there were 205 breakdowns in four days. The sailors who work on the sewage system, called hull maintenance technicians (HTs), fell behind in the months leading up to USS Ford's scheduled deployment.

""Our sewage system is being mistreated and destroyed by Sailors on a daily basis. My HT's are currently working 19 hours a day right now trying to keep up with the demand,"" according to the email.

The average age on the USS Ford is similar to a college campus. For many of the sailors, this is their first extended time away from home. At times the emails almost evoke a floating dorm room, revealing that everything from t-shirts to a four-foot piece of rope have been removed from the system. The vacuum pipes are narrow. Brown paper towels and even commercial toilet paper also cause breakdowns. The most common problem is a valve at the back of the toilets that can be knocked loose and cause all of the toilets (which the Navy calls heads) in one of 10 zones to lose suction.

""FYI, if you need to use the head, go now. At 13:30, expect the system to come down for about two hours. We are looking for a vacuum leak in zone 6,"" reads a March 18 email from the chief engineer on USS Ford.

A month after the carrier left Norfolk July 24, 2025, initially bound for Europe and the Mediterranean, the mother of a sailor contacted NPR to complain about the unsanitary conditions on the carrier. Around the same time, emails from USS Ford show the executive officer on the Ford was demanding answers from the engineering department about breakdowns.

The most expensive problem is calcium build-ups, which clog narrow pipes, especially in the lower decks of the ship. The 2020 GAO report said the Navy spends $400,000 for an acid flush to restore the system. A document showed the ship has been acid flushed at least 10 times since 2023. The work can only be done in port. A month after USS Ford left Norfolk, the engineering department was struggling to explain the problem to leadership.

""That's just the nature of VCHT. It's a closed system and thousands of components ship-wide that fail daily. With one commode control valve failure, depending on the location brings down the entire zone,"" according to an Aug. 15, 2025 email from the engineering department.

The crew has been reaching out to the A1B Propulsion Plant Planning Yard at Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia for answers, according to an email chain between the carrier and the planning yard. The planning yard is part of Huntington Ingalls Industries, which is the only shipyard in the world that builds Ford Class aircraft carriers. The Navy's In-Service Aircraft Carrier Program Office (PMS312) is responsible for maintaining the carriers.

""What we want to do is give you a temporary resolution to get your heads into a somewhat functional use until such time 10+ years down the road when PMS312 finally gets around to paying for a redesign,"" reads a July 24 email back to the carrier from the planning yard.

Longstanding problem

Whenever USS Ford wraps up its assignments in the Caribbean, the carrier is scheduled to go into maintenance this year at the Navy's public shipyard, Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Virginia, according to the emails. The Navy has known the system is undersized and riddled with issues for more than a decade. A similar vacuum system was installed on the last Nimitz-Class carrier USS George HW Bush. In 2013, the carrier experienced similar problems, with toilets going off line.

The Navy said Ford will eventually be given an upgrade.

""GRF (USS Gerald R. Ford) is scheduled to receive VCHT system improvements in upcoming maintenance availabilities. Similar upgrades on CVN 77 (the carrier USS George HW Bush) have resulted in fewer VCHT maintenance issues,"" Lt. Cmdr. David Carter, spokesman for Fleet Forces Command said in a statement to NPR.

The trail of emails provided through the Navy ends in August, before USS Ford sailed for the Caribbean in November to be part of the build up of U.S. forces around Venezuela.

Without providing details, Carter said the problems with the toilets have gotten better as the deployment continues. The average outage is between half an hour and two hours and the problems have had ""no operational impact,"" he said.

Experts say a long-term fix is not expected this year.

Problems with the carrier's waste system were known well before it was given to the Navy. Part of the solution may include putting more sailors on board the ship to keep up with the repairs, though the ship was actually designed to require fewer sailors to operate it than older Nimitz carriers, said Shelby Oakley, director of GAO.

""It's important to kind of think about, like we're asking you sailors to live in these conditions,"" she said. ""We should at least be able to provide them with living facilities, to be able to not have to kind of struggle in that regard. And it's unfortunate that this is where we're at.""

The carrier USS Ford was already the most expensive ship ever built by the Navy. It is stacked with new technology and many of the systems had not been proven in the field, which drove up the cost and delayed its delivery to the Navy. Borrowing the sewage system from commercial cruise ships may have been a mistake, said Bryan Clark with the Hudson Institute.

""Maybe this is an example where they should have kept the old system rather than going after the new technology,"" Clark said.

A cruise ship has a very different mission from a nuclear-powered warship, which is designed to remain at sea for months. It is a cautionary tale, as the Trump administration looks at increasing the pace of ship building, including a proposed battleship that would have potentially even more systems that have not been tested in the field, Clark said.

In a blog post, OpenAI said ChatGPT Go launched in India in August and has rolled out to more than 170 countries. The US entry now gives OpenAI three tiers for its subscription plans.

ChatGPT Go is $8 per month.

ChatGPT Pro is $200 per month.

ChatGPT Business is $25 per month for smaller companies. ChatGPT Enterprise pricing varies.

What remains to be seen is whether ChatGPT Plus subscribers trade down to ChatGPT Go, which carries ads. My working theory is that AI services may resemble streaming where customers realize ads aren't so bad if you can save money. ChatGPT Go has more messages, uploads and image creation tools than the free tier, but less than ChatGPT Plus. For many folks, that access may be fine. ChatGPT Plus will include GPT 5.2 Thinking, the ability to use legacy models and Codex. ChatGPT Plus can also retain details from past conversations longer.

More importantly to OpenAI's financial picture is its plans to roll out ads on the free tier and ChatGPT Go tiers.

Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco highlighted a pivotal moment for global healthcare. For years, providers, payers, and medtech companies have explored the potential of artificial intelligence, digital platforms, and precision medicine. This year, the focus shifted decisively from theory to action. Healthcare is no longer imagining the future; it is deploying it at scale, transforming patient care, operations, and research.

Generative AI platforms such asChatGPT Health andClaude for Healthcare are moving beyond pilot projects to enterprise applications. Conference leaders shared concrete examples of AI accelerating clinical workflows, improving revenue cycle management, enhancing patient engagement, and powering research and development. The consensus was clear: innovation alone is no longer enough.

The conference offered a clear message for the next decade. Organizations that succeed will be those that integrate AI into their core strategy, scale digital platforms effectively, and embed innovation across clinical, operational, and financial systems. At JPM26, it became evident that the future of healthcare will be defined not by ideas but by execution and measurable impact.

Health Systems: Integration as Strategic and Operational Imperative

Major nonprofit health systems demonstrated that scale without operational excellence no longer delivers an advantage.Advocate Health reported 1.5 billion in annual operating savings three years post-merger, achieved while adding more than 23,000 jobs. Executives highlighted improvements in vendor contract management, labor throughput, and enterprise-wide clinical standards. Leapfrog safety ratings expanded from five to 24 hospitals, signaling quality improvements alongside efficiency.

Mass General Brigham'sFor Every Patient initiative emphasized system-wide realignment to eliminate silos and accelerate decision-making, reducing length of stay, improving patient flow, and shortening behavioral health wait times. AdventHealth highlighted consolidation viaEpic and Workday platforms and the deployment of over 80 AI use cases, including smart inpatient rooms, enhancing remote care, and patient engagement.Providencereinforced organizational culture through in-office leadership, while Intermountain Healthcare emphasized collaboration and operational innovation with AeroTerra Health, a nationwide medical transport venture supporting care and margin resilience.

As AI becomes more central to operations, executives stress the importance of linking technology to strategy. Feby Abraham, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy and Innovations Officer at Memorial Hermann Health System, noted the necessity of embedding innovation into core health system priorities. “AI is most powerful when it is directly tied to system priorities. Innovation cannot sit on the sidelines. It has to be embedded in how we deliver care, manage operations, and plan for the future,” Abraham said.

CommonSpirit Health CEO Wright Lassiter outlined new divestiture plans and AI adoption milestones. The $40 billion Catholic health system has executed about half a dozen divestitures since its merger and will announce additional portfolio transitions in the next quarter, focusing on communities and care areas where impact is greatest, particularly ambulatory care and underserved regions. Lassiter highlighted the deployment of 242 AI tools, moving from point solutions to enterprise-scale applications. AI initiatives have generated an estimated 100 million in annual value, including automated clinical notetaking, patient call processing, and neuro emergency triage, reducing door-to-treatment times by over 40% across more than 50 facilities.

AI-enabled sepsis monitoring, active since 2015, contributed to saving 3,655 patients in fiscal year 2025. Lassiter emphasized responsible AI use, urging deployment to benefit both employees and patients, and launched an AI Workforce Readiness Academy to reskill and upskill several thousand employees. He also called for collaboration among providers and insurers to avoid competitive misuse of AI, focusing instead on operational efficiency and patient care.

Artificial Intelligence: From Pilot Projects to Enterprise Platforms

DTCC rejects the creation of “walled gardens” to allow digital assets to flow frictionlessly between different networks.

The initial infrastructure will rely on Canton Network and AppChain, prioritizing security and client liquidity demand.

Experts debate the nature of these assets, as the tokens represent claims on securities already safeguarded by the entity.

The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has defined its vision for the future of financial asset tokenization. Nadine Chakar, the firm’s head of digital assets, assured that they are not building “walled gardens”; instead, they are betting on interoperability so that digital securities can move efficiently and without extra costs across various blockchains.

Despite the open approach, the firm maintains a cautious stance due to cybersecurity risks within the crypto ecosystem. For this reason, the strategy focuses on connecting the traditional financial system with new digital infrastructures, using messaging standards that guarantee data integrity in an environment where new Layer 1 networks appear constantly.

Security and Flexibility in Blockchain Infrastructure

To achieve successful financial asset tokenization, DTCC selected Canton Network, a permissioned blockchain designed specifically for institutions. Brian Steele, a managing director at the firm, explained that this choice responds to the need for offering after-hours financing and improving liquidity for market makers, adapting to the operational demands of Wall Street.

However, the project is not without criticism from crypto-natives, who question the fact that the tokens are not “native” to the network but rather representations of safeguarded assets. In response, DTCC reaffirms that its priority is to offer clients the freedom to choose among multiple blockchains, provided they meet rigorous security and institutional resiliency parameters.",https://crypto-economy.com//wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tokenizacion-de-activos-financieros-.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 14:00:54.164320

Our Take On Uber Technologies' ROCE To the delight of most shareholders, Uber Technologies has now broken into profitability.","If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So when we looked at Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.

Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.

Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)

If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Uber Technologies:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.091 = US$4.6b ÷ (US$63b - US$13b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2025).

So, Uber Technologies has an ROCE of 9.1%. In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Transportation industry average of 9.7%.

So How Is Uber Technologies' ROCE Trending?

We're delighted to see that Uber Technologies is reaping rewards from its investments and is now generating some pre-tax profits. Shareholders would no doubt be pleased with this because the business was loss-making five years ago but is is now generating 9.1% on its capital. Not only that, but the company is utilizing 129% more capital than before, but that's to be expected from a company trying to break into profitability. This can tell us that the company has plenty of reinvestment opportunities that are able to generate higher returns.

Our Take On Uber Technologies' ROCE

To the delight of most shareholders, Uber Technologies has now broken into profitability. Since the stock has returned a solid 56% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.

ID46,Walmart,2026-01-17 13:02:30+00:00,Yahoo Finance,Bill Gates isn't even close to America's largest private landowner. It's 'Silent Stan' Kroenke ...,Sasha Rogelberg,,,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bill-gates-isn-t-even-202307853.html,"Kroenke owns 2.7 million acres, about as much as 2 million football fields and larger than the sprawling Yosemite National Park.
It was the largest land purchase in the U.S. in more than a decade.
Bill Gates, who owns 275,000 acres of land, ranks 44th.
Nearly 40% of U.S. farmland is now owned by landlords, who lease their property to farmers and operators.
For farmers in contemporary America, they are hard-pressed to outbid rivals like Silent Stan for farmland.","Stan Kroenke, the billionaire owner of the world’s most valuable portfolio of sports clubs, including the Los Angeles Rams and London’s Arsenal Football Club, can boast another title. The Colorado real-estate magnate, once dubbed “Silent Stan” for his reticence to talk to the press, is America’s largest private landowner, according to a report published this week by The Land Report. Kroenke owns 2.7 million acres, about as much as 2 million football fields and larger than the sprawling Yosemite National Park.

Rocketing up to the No. 1 spot on the list—up from No. 4 in 2025—Kroenke’s holdings ballooned largely thanks to a purchase of 937,000 acres of ranchland in December from the Singleton family behind industrial conglomerate Teledyne Technologies. It was the largest land purchase in the U.S. in more than a decade.

Kroenke owes the beginnings of his real estate empire to the success of Walmart, and not just because of his marriage (since 1974) to Walmart heiress Ann Walton Kroenke. The sports and real estate magnate made his first fortune by developing shopping centers, many with the big-box retailer as its core attraction.

In the past year, Kroenke leapfrogged fellow billionaires John “the Cable Cowboy” Malone, who ranks No. 2 on the list, and media mogul Ted Turner, who sits at No. 3. The Emmerson family, which operates forest products company Sierra Pacific Industries, owns an estimated 2.4 million acres, much of it timberland. Bill Gates, who owns 275,000 acres of land, ranks 44th. (He uses his property, the majority of which is farmland owned through his investment group Cascade Investment, to grow onions, carrots, and the potatoes used in McDonald’s fries.)

What many of the list share, besides their astonishing wealth, is the pursuit of snapping up farmland—including ranchlands and timberlands—an emerging asset class for the ultrawealthy to protect their wealth, hedging against inflation and the volatility of some traditional assets. In 2025, the value of U.S. farmland was about $4,350 per acre on average, a 4.3% year-over-year increase, or nearly 2% when adjusted for inflation, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Nearly 40% of U.S. farmland is now owned by landlords, who lease their property to farmers and operators.

Farmland has become a $4.3 trillion asset class as a result of its growing popularity, according to Steve Bruere, president of agricultural rest estate firm Peoples Company.

“If you believe you want diversification, and you also believe we’re going to have underlying inflation—which is what a lot of people want right now—then farmland is a great option for them,” Bruere told Fortune.

Kroenke, via his holding company, did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.

The rise of the farmland asset class

The 2008 financial crisis stirred in investors an urgent desire to seek out alternative investments, and America’s ultrawealthy turned to farmland to diversify their portfolios, much like how investors today are turning to alternative assets, from gold to private credit, to hedge against fears of an AI-driven market collapse.

Much like the real-estate boom of the 1970s, investors today are scooping up farmland as a hedge against inflation, a physical asset that can retain and grow its value because it’s a finite resource. Farmland value is, afterall, positively correlated with inflation—meaning farmless with appreciation in value as inflation rises—and non-correlated with markets. There’s also a theory among investors that because of growing populations, rising income, and therefore a rising demand for food and fuel, farms will only become more valuable.

“Getting your hands on some farmland where the number of arable acres in the world declines every year, that’s why a lot of people like it,” Bruere said.

That’s all in addition to the passive income of leasing out the land to farmers, many of whom don’t have the capital to be able to buy their own land, according to Bruere.

Erin Foster West, policy campaigns director for the National Young Farmers Coalition, said that many farmers aren’t able to buy the land they work, leaving renting as their only opportunity.

Farmland rent is increasing at a more modest rate than the price to buy the land, making it an appealing option: Average rent for U.S. cropland increased to $161 per acre in last year, just a 0.6% year-over-year increase, per data from the USDA’s Land Values survey. But the working farmer can hardly compete with deep-pocketed figures such as Kroenke.

To hear top analyst Tom Lee, of Fundstrat, describe the situation, farming never recovered from the invention of flash-frozen foods in the 1920s. Farming made up 40% of the economy before freezing freed up more of people’s time, he recently said in an appearance on the Prof G Markets podcast. “It allowed people to be repurposed, and it created a completely new labor force,” Lee said.

For farmers in contemporary America, they are hard-pressed to outbid rivals like Silent Stan for farmland.

“It makes it much harder for farmers to compete, especially beginning farmers who are maybe trying to acquire their first farm, or even an existing farmer who might want to grow and expand,” Foster West told Fortune.

The ‘Bermuda (Re)insurance Monitor: 2026’ attributed catastrophe losses to the rise, with about eight percentage points added in 2025, primarily from the California wildfires, up from 6.4 points in 2024.

The January 2026 reinsurance renewals demonstrated a strong shift to a buyers’ market, particularly for property risk, which experienced its largest rate declines in over a decade. Fitch anticipates softening market conditions to continue at the mid-year 2026 renewals as the competitive environment intensifies, although risk-adjusted returns should remain attractive.

Shareholders’ equity grew 12% at nine month end 2025 from year end 2024 due to underwriting gains, solid investment income and equity and bond market gains, partially offset by a sizable increase in capital returned to shareholders. Fitch expects ROE will remain favourable in 2025 at near 17%, down only slightly from 17.8% in 2024.

""For a century, Caterpillar has built the industrial machines that shaped the world,"" Nvidia Founder and CEO Jensen Huang said. ""In the age of AI, Nvidia and Caterpillar are partnering across the full spectrum — from autonomous construction fleets to the AI data centers powering the next industrial revolution.""

Equipping Machines for the AI Generation

The Nvidia Jetson Thor platform enables real-time AI inference on Cat construction, mining and power equipment. Caterpillar expects these upgrades to ensure assets are ready for AI-assisted and potentially autonomous operations.

For example:

An intelligent operator assistant providing customers with personalized insights

Construction and mining machines equipped with AI-driven recommendations, capable of processing billions of data points in milliseconds to navigate complex, variable jobsite conditions.

Cat fleets powered by AI, machine learning, computer vision and edge computing that process sensor data in real time and serve as a digital nervous system for customers' jobsites.

Debuting the Cat AI Assistant

At CES 2026, Caterpillar debuted the Cat AI Assistant, a proactive partner embedded in Cat digital and onboard products that helps customers take confident action. The Cat AI Assistant, which was built using Nvidia Riva open speech models, will answer questions and provide personalized recommendations on equipment, parts, maintenance and more.

In cab, it will use voice activation to enable settings, guide troubleshooting and connect users to the right resources across Cat apps and websites. It uses Caterpillar's own trusted data stored on the Helios unified data platform.

Transforming Manufacturing and Supply Chain Operations

To meet evolving industry needs, Caterpillar is using its Nvidia AI Factory to transform manufacturing and supply. The company's manufacturing digital data platform takes advantage of this accelerated AI infrastructure and Nvidia AI libraries to automate and accelerate important manufacturing processes, including forecasting and scheduling.

Caterpillar is also building physically accurate digital twins of its factories on Nvidia Omniverse libraries and OpenUSD. With these digital twins, Caterpillar teams can design, simulate and optimize layouts and production processes before building in the real world.

“A lot of work goes into making the county run, and this should be a cohesive group, working for Laurens County.","Five industrial prospects will have made, or will be in the process of making, their ways through the Laurens County Council incentives and approval process as the new year begins.

Briefed on the projects at their Jan. 12 meeting, Council gave unanimous approval to various incentives, fee in lieu of taxes agreements, and industrial park assignment measures. Just one of the five prospects was named - before 3rd and final reading, prospects generally are referred to by code-names for competitive reasons.

Adeptus USA LLC was identified as the industry behind a $93 Million, 126 new jobs prospect in the former Michelin distribution center at Metric Road, Laurens. A public hearing and final reading of the ordinance was conducted, and the industry will be included in the Octagon Industrial Park, which is not a physical place but a collection of industries located in various places (in a collaboration with Greenville County).

Project Floyd is a $68.6 Million, 50 jobs project in the Hunter Industrial Park, Laurens, going into an existing building. Council took the unusual step of having a public hearing before final reading - the industry had a last-minute issue with its real estate closing, but since the public hearing had been advertised (as though the project was going to get final reading), it was allowed to go forward.

Project Diamond is a new industry coming to the Clinton area in the city limits. It’s a $9 Million, 70 new jobs project. Previously, council was told it will behind the Nordsom plant, and at Monday’s meeting it was referenced that it would be “behind the truck stop”. This was the 2nd of 3 readings, and council gave 2nd reading to an ordinance to create the Clinton Industrial Park (in a collaboration with Spartanburg County; of the revenues, 25% goes to School District 56, 25% to the City of Clinton, 25% to Laurens County, and 25% to the Laurens County economic development fund).

Project Palmetto is a company moving its headquarters to Laurens County, with a $19 Million, 57 new jobs project. An inducement resolution and first reading of an ordinance were approved unanimously. Discussion indicated it will be in The Connexial Center, a local/state industrial area off I-385 near Gray Court.

Finally, Project Basel amends a current industrial agreement, as an existing industry changes its agreement with a $49 Million original investment that now is over $109 Million. Its ordinance was approved “by title only,” and Council Vice-chairman Matthew Brownlee abstained from this vote.

In other business, council heard from Treasurer Cynthia Burke that her office would become just the 3rd in the state, behind Spartanburg and Aiken, to provide one-stop-shopping for vehicle registrations, reducing the amount of time standing in line at the Treasurer’s Office to pay vehicle taxes and then at the DMV to pay for and acquire licenses plates and renewal stickers.

Council agreed to buy 1 & 3 Gallon St., Laurens, for $75,000 to facilitate a stormwater improvement project that is federally funded.

Council agreed to have a second meeting quarterly on the 4th Monday to allow citizens to bring forth any topic they want to the governing body. This is in place of public comments at the 2nd Monday regular meeting which now are for agenda items only.

Pertaining to the Potters Field burial ground for indigent people (near the county airport), Council agreed that the Laurens County Chamber of Commerce Foundation can be designated as a collection point for anyone who wants to donate money to the burial ground’s upkeep. At least one donation already has been made, council was told.

In Council Comments, members wished the audience and the public a good new year. Brownlee introduced the council to his fiancee, saying they had become engaged on Jan. 1, and said he had asked her to attend at least one meeting to “see what she was in for.” Council Member Arthur Philson Jr. provided county department heads with certificates showing his appreciation for their work, and for the work of their employees.

Serving his first year on council, Philson said, “This year, I’d like to see the penny sales tax people get together and come up with items that need to be addressed. The county needs an audit, we have been through 2-3 county administrators and no money has been counted. We need a county pay raise for these people, we have people making $12/hour — $15/hr should be the minimum for county salaries. We have people moving from one department to another for pay. And all these housing developments, I’m learning. Show me where the money’s at.”

Council Chairman Jeff Carroll did not respond directly but he made it clear that county finances are audited independently every year. “The county administrator can help you know where the money is. It’s budget time and that is an opportunity for everyone to learn how government works, how things are funded,” he said. “A lot of work goes into making the county run, and this should be a cohesive group, working for Laurens County. We want to start this year good and calm, and (to employees) thank you for what you do.”",https://beta.creativecirclecdn.com/clinton/original/20260116-133715-ae3-Development%20Hunter%20Park.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 04:58:59.668520

“I love that.” Filed Under: clinical trials, Drug Discovery","Clinical trials are drowning in data. In a TransCelerate/Tufts analysis published in late 2025, phase 3 protocols averaged more than 5.9 million data points, up 67% since 2020. The researchers found that nearly one-third of procedures and associated data were non-core or non-essential. In other words, a good portion of this data does not directly support primary objectives or key secondary endpoints.

That complexity matters because every extra field carries a downstream cost: more time for site staff, more queries, more monitoring, more protocol amendments and more burden for participants.

Unwinding that degree of complexity is no easy feat, and too big of a task for any single organization, said Janice Chang, CEO of TransCelerate. “The system is built with friction, fragmentation and systemic barriers.”

TransCelerate, founded in 2012, brings biopharma sponsors together to work on shared clinical trial pain points that single companies struggle to solve alone, Chang said. The nonprofit’s goal is to bring more patients into clinical research by reducing friction in how trials are designed and run.

“My North Star is about bringing clinical research to the patients and meeting them where they are. My dream would be that there is no more ‘enrollment.’ Every patient is just on a trial as part of their care,” she said.

Chang points first to geography. In the U.S., a significant share of counties do not have access to clinical research, she said. County-level analyses in oncology show how sharp that gradient can be. A 2023 ASCO policy analysis, for example, found that about 70% of U.S. counties had no active cancer treatment clinical trial, with availability concentrated around metro areas and academic centers.

Access is only one barrier. “Many people can’t reach trials, or don’t believe trials are designed for them,” Chang said. Sites are also strained, she added, citing statistics suggesting approximately 50% report being overburdened by administrative work such as training, paperwork, and contracts.

In one breast cancer program, Chang said the protocol initially required a second biopsy for screening. After study teams gathered early patient feedback, they learned the procedure was too burdensome and logistically difficult. The protocol was amended to allow archived diagnostic samples instead, reducing burden and improving feasibility.

Technology is often pitched as the answer: decentralized trials, remote monitoring, AI-powered patient matching. But the industry’s ability to deploy those tools lags behind the marketing.

A recent McKinsey report found that while most companies are investing in AI, only 1% describe their gen AI rollouts as mature. “We’re far from mastering it,” Chang said.

Chang framed the technology as disruptive. “Companies face a fairly binary decision: either you lead, or you get disrupted.”

Yet for now, she sees AI mostly supporting existing processes rather than transforming them, but the near-term gains are real. One member company reduced clinical study report drafting from approximately 180 hours to 80 hours using generative AI, she said. She also said some member companies report approximately 10% to 20% recruitment improvement from better patient matching.

But without shared frameworks, those wins stay siloed. “There’s no aligned regulatory guidance, and everyone is experimenting differently,” Chang said. TransCelerate is positioning itself as a neutral convener, bringing sponsors together for vendor-agnostic conversations with regulators. “One regulator told us this is a good space to ‘co-learn,’” she said. “I love that.”

Guerlain’s Spring 2026 Blooming Denim collection applies circular fashion sourcing to beauty packaging through a collaboration with LVMH’s Nona Source.

Guerlain’s Spring 2026 lineup places sustainability and material innovation at the forefront with the launch of Blooming Denim, a makeup collection developed in collaboration with circular design platform Nona Source. The partnership applies fashion-industry textile reuse to the packaging, marking one of Guerlain’s most visible experiments to date with circular sourcing at the product level.

At the core of the collaboration is Nona Source, a platform founded in 2021 to redistribute unused luxury fabrics, including deadstock and offcuts from couture and ready-to-wear production. Backed by LVMH, Nona Source was created to reduce textile waste by reconnecting dormant materials with designers and brands looking to integrate circular economy principles into new products. The fabrics are sourced from existing inventories rather than newly manufactured textiles, lowering material waste while preserving luxury-grade quality.

For Blooming Denim, Guerlain selected upcycled denim offcuts originally produced for luxury fashion houses and reworked them into decorative cases for several of its best-known makeup lines. The denim is transformed through dyeing, embossing, embroidery, and gold screen-printing, allowing the material to function both structurally and visually rather than as a surface-level sustainability gesture.

How Blooming Denim is applied across the collection

The most prominent application appears in Rouge G, Guerlain’s refillable lipstick line. Denim-wrapped cases are offered in three floral finishes — Cherry Blossom, Denim Flora, and Red Rose — each designed to reinforce collectability while maintaining the brand’s existing refill model. Six new lipstick shades accompany the cases, developed to align with the collection’s color palette rather than functioning as stand-alone launches.

Ombres G introduces an exclusive eyeshadow harmony that pairs metallic and matte textures inspired by denim hardware and floral tones, while Météorites Blooming Glow revisits the 02 Cool/Rosé shade with the addition of a denim-blue pearl. Both products are housed in denim-covered packaging using the same upcycled sourcing approach.

The collection also includes KissKiss Bee Glow Oil in two new floral shades, extending the Blooming Denim story across lip care while maintaining consistency with Guerlain’s existing formulations and packaging formats.

Guerlain launches rolling out in 2026

Beyond Blooming Denim, Guerlain’s broader 2026 portfolio spans skincare, fragrance, and lifestyle. Orchidée Impériale Gold Nobile Goldessence expands the ultra-premium skincare line with an activating lotion positioned as the first step in the routine. The formula was developed over three years and uses a two-phase system designed to improve skin texture and radiance.

In fragrance, La Petite Robe Noire Parfum introduces a more concentrated version of the existing franchise, formulated with French beetroot alcohol from responsible farming. The bottle incorporates recycled glass and a bio-based cap, continuing Guerlain’s material sustainability commitments within fragrance packaging.

Additional launches include L’Homme Idéal Cologne Forte, which uses alcohol derived from upcycled pea crop waste, and Absolus Allegoria Tabac Sahara, formulated with more than 90 percent naturally derived ingredients and packaged in recycled glass produced in France.

How L’Oréal Is Testing Sustainable Innovation at Scale

L’Oréal has revealed the first cohort for L’AcceleratOR, its €100 million sustainable innovation program, selecting 13 companies focused on packaging, ingredients, circular systems, and emissions data. The group was chosen from nearly 1,000 applicants and represents the first pilot phase of the five-year initiative, which is designed to identify, test, and potentially scale sustainability-focused technologies across the company’s global operations and the wider beauty industry. https://www.loreal.com/en/press-release/sustainable-development/-l-oreal-announces-the-first-13-change-makers-chosen-to-join-its-eur-100-million-sustainable-innovation-l-accelerator-program/ Launched in 2024, L’AcceleratOR was created to move beyond concept-stage innovation and toward commercial deployment, with a particular emphasis on solutions that can be piloted within existing industrial systems. The program is operated in partnership with the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, which is overseeing a structured support phase centered on pilot readiness and business integration. https://www.cisl.cam.ac.uk/ Rather than narrowing its scope to a single sustainability challenge, L’Oréal has positioned the accelerator around a broad set of operational priorities, including low-carbon materials and energy, nature-sourced ingredients, water resilience, the reduction of fossil-based plastics, circular manufacturing processes, and inclusive business models. The composition of the first cohort reflects that approach, with selected companies spanning physical materials, chemical inputs, waste transformation, and digital infrastructure. https://www.esgtoday.com/loreal-backs-13-climate-nature-and-circularity-solutions-startups/ Packaging, Materials, and the Push Away From Fossil Inputs Several of the selected companies focus on rethinking packaging formats that remain deeply embedded in beauty supply chains. United Kingdom-based Pulpex is developing recyclable paper bottles intended to replace rigid plastic packaging, while Japan’s Bioworks produces bioplastics derived from sugarcane and other plant-based feedstocks.

Parker-Hannifin Investment Narrative Recap

To own Parker-Hannifin, you need to be comfortable with an industrial business that blends cyclical exposure with disciplined execution and a long dividend track record. The latest strong quarter and raised guidance support the near term earnings catalyst, while the biggest risk, in my view, remains the company’s growing reliance on aerospace and the possibility that a slowdown there could offset otherwise solid performance.

Among recent developments, the raised fiscal 2026 guidance, calling for total sales growth of 4.0% to 7.0% and adjusted EPS of US$29.60 to US$30.40, feels most relevant. It reinforces why analysts have been lifting price targets and why many observers are focused on how much of this momentum is tied to aerospace strength and how resilient those earnings could be if industrial demand stays muted.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Three fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$677.90 to US$907.86 per share, showing how far apart individual views can be.

This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

David Guggina, who has been the chief e-commerce officer of Walmart U.S., has been promoted to CEO of the division — the company’s biggest and most important business.

John Furner, who has held that job for about six years, was named top boss of the company in conjunction with the retirement of outgoing CEO Doug McMillon.

Guggina joined Walmart from Amazon.com Inc. about eight years ago, quickly moving up through the ranks at the retail chain. He has led the online business in the U.S. since last January after running supply chain operations.

By broadening delivery areas and cutting shipping costs, the digital business has been fueling growth in the U.S. and is reaching profitability.

He is tasked with leading the unit that generates hundreds of billions of dollars in sales against the backdrop of discerning shoppers, weakening consumer sentiment and persistent woes about the job market.

Competition continues to be fierce in the U.S., with peers Costco Wholesale Corp., Target Corp. and Aldi Inc. investing to keep prices low and improve shopping experiences. Amazon has been increasingly encroaching on Walmart’s turf, signaling its intent to further expand its physical footprint and grocery offerings.

“A key part of maintaining our momentum is making sure we have the right structure to win,” Furner wrote in a memo to staff, adding that the company is making changes to increase efficiency and allow divisions to focus more on customers.

Walmart is entering a consequential period of change as McMillon retires at the end of the month. He is credited with transforming the company into a digital powerhouse from a brick-and-mortar retailer.

The Bentonville, Ark.-based company is now racing to get ahead of the artificial intelligence race, incorporating the technology across operations including shopping. Its market capitalization is inching toward $1 trillion — a first for a U.S. retailer — on the heels of strong growth and tech investments.

The company also named Latriece Watkins, chief merchant for Walmart U.S., as the CEO of Sam’s Club. The club chain is opening new stores and remodeling existing locations in the U.S., as it seeks to grow its membership and compete against bigger rival Costco.

Chris Nicholas, chief of Sam’s Club, will now serve as the boss of Walmart International. China, India and Mexico are among the markets driving growth for the international business. He is succeeding Kathryn McLay, who is leaving the company. She was once viewed as a potential successor to McMillon.

Elsewhere, Seth Dallaire has been promoted to chief growth officer for the company. He has led advertising, membership and other non-retail units at Walmart U.S. He will also help guide expansion strategies for Walmart’s marketplace business. Those businesses are helping fuel profit growth.

All changes are effective Feb. 1.

↑ X NOW PLAYING Why YouTube Is The 'Crown Jewel' In Google's Media Empire

Wall Street analysts have mixed views on the threat to Google from an OpenAI advertising push.

On the one hand, big brands and other advertisers could move a portion ad budgets that Google garners to a new option — ChatGPT. But for OpenAI, adding the digital infrastructure to sell advertising will be challenging. Also, OpenAI would not want to damage the ChatGPT user experience.

However, OpenAI is still unprofitable and needs revenue sources beyond subscriptions, analysts say.

""The question of when not if surrounding OpenAI's aspiration for ads persists,"" RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson said in a recent report. ""Given the rails of distribution necessary to run an effective ads product, we'd look at a scaled ramp of ads by OpenAI as unlikely to pose noticeable disruption risk to Google's search numbers for several years at least.""

Bank of America analyst Justin Post, though, does expect an eventual impact on Google's core business.

""According to press reports, OpenAI is targeting $200 billion revenue by 2030, which includes roughly $41 billion from new products, including advertising,"" Post said in a report.

""A key question for Alphabet sentiment in 2026 is whether ad budgets on OpenAI will represent incremental spend or will come at the expense of existing search budgets. We believe OpenAI ad growth will likely be a mix of both: New AI-native ad formats and better performance are improving advertiser outcomes and willingness to spend, effectively increasing the overall digital advertising addressable market. At the same time, as OpenAI captures a growing share of usage and intent, a portion of budgets is likely to shift from incumbent platforms.""

Google Stock: OpenAI Rivalry Grows

At Mizuho Securities, analyst Lloyd Walmsley downplayed the near-term threat to Google.

""OpenAI is signaling interest in monetizing ChatGPT through advertising, but our recent conversations with multiple ad experts indicate near-term prospects continue to appear to be slow-moving,"" Walmsley said in a report. ""We understand the company plans a fresh outreach with ad agencies and advertisers. Feedback suggests industry players are pressing for concrete plans rather than speculative concepts. One industry contact estimates that a scaled ad model is unlikely before 2027 to 2028, with any meaningful sales efforts requiring pilots by mid-2026 to capture second-half advertisers' budgets.""

The IBD Methodology: How To Invest In Stocks While Managing Risks

Meanwhile, Alphabet plans to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 4.

New search competition from OpenAI's ChatGPT, Perplexity and others has forced Google to overhaul its search results. ChatGPT delivers answers to search queries, while Google's business model has been based on providing weblinks.

Google began deploying AI Overviews in the U.S. in mid-2024, with conversational summaries topping links for many search queries. Google also has introduced ""AI-mode,"" as an option for traditional search users. AI mode is still in the early stages of monetizing via ads, a Deutsche Bank report said.

Meanwhile, OpenAI in October announced an artificial intelligence-powered web browser called ChatGPT Atlas. The Atlas browser features agents that complete tasks on the internet as well as an opt-in memory feature that improves search results.

Google Technical Ratings

On the stock market today, Google stock fell about 1% to 329.57. Google stock has climbed about 5% in 2026 after surging 65% last year.

In late 2025, Google introduced its newest artificial intelligence system: Gemini 3. Google improved the chatbot's ability to code, search and create images. Gemini 3 is battling against OpenAI's GPT-5 and Anthropic's Claude family in reasoning performance reviews.

Google stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A. That institutional ownership rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of a C grade as neutral.

Further, Google stock holds a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. IBD's Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.

Cencora ( (COR) ) just unveiled an update.

On January 12, 2026, Cencora, Inc. amended its existing revolving credit agreement, increasing total commitments by $1.0 billion to $5.5 billion, enhancing its overall liquidity profile. On the same date, the company secured a new senior unsecured multi-year term loan facility totaling $1.5 billion in two tranches and a separate $3.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured term loan facility, both primarily to finance its proposed acquisition of the remaining majority equity interests in OneOncology, refinance OneOncology’s existing debt and cover related fees and expenses, with the loans bearing interest at SOFR- or base-rate benchmarks plus ratings-based margins and subject to leverage and other customary covenants and events of default. Together, these new term facilities fully displaced the previously arranged $4.5 billion bridge financing commitment, reducing it to zero, and further embedded major relationship banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, Société Générale and MUFG in Cencora’s capital structure through roles as lenders, advisors, underwriters and securitization counterparties, underscoring the scale and importance of the OneOncology transaction for the company’s financing strategy and banking relationships.

The most recent analyst rating on (COR) stock is a Buy with a $415.00 price target. To see the full list of analyst forecasts on Cencora stock, see the COR Stock Forecast page.

Spark’s Take on COR Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, COR is a Neutral.

Cencora’s strong financial performance and positive earnings call sentiment are major strengths, driving the score. However, high leverage, potential overvaluation, and technical indicators suggesting bearish momentum are notable risks.

Hormel Foods Investment Narrative Recap

To own Hormel Foods, you need to believe in the resilience of its branded retail portfolio as it works through margin pressure from higher input costs and slower revenue growth. The appointment of Domenic Borrelli to lead the Retail unit does not immediately change the near term focus on rebuilding profitability or the key risk around persistent commodity inflation and the lag in passing through higher costs to consumers.

The most relevant recent development alongside Borrelli’s hire is Hormel’s 2026 guidance, which calls for US$12.2 billion to US$12.5 billion in net sales and US$0.96 billion to US$1.03 billion in operating income. Retail leadership execution will be central to how the company tracks against these targets, particularly as it balances pricing, mix and innovation against evolving consumer preferences for alternative and clean label proteins.

However, investors should also be aware of the risk that input cost volatility and slower pricing pass through could...

Hormel Foods’ narrative projects $13.0 billion revenue and $952.2 million earnings by 2028. This requires 2.5% yearly revenue growth and about a $197.7 million earnings increase from $754.5 million today.

, a 10% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Five members of the Simply Wall St Community see Hormel’s fair value between US$24.36 and US$47.20, underscoring how far opinions can spread. You should weigh these views against the risk that ongoing commodity cost volatility and slower retail pricing pass through continue to pressure margins and the company’s progress toward its 2026 earnings goals.

The net asset value (NAV) of a closed-end fund is the market value of the underlying investments (i.e., stocks and bonds) in the Fund’s portfolio, minus liabilities, divided by the total number of Fund shares outstanding. However, the Fund also has a market price; the value at which it trades on an exchange. If the market price is above the NAV the Fund is trading at a premium. If the market price is below the NAV the Fund is trading at a discount.

Performance returns for the Fund are total returns, which includes dividends, and are net of management fees and other Fund expenses. Returns are calculated assuming that a shareholder reinvested all distributions. Past performance cannot predict future investment results.

Performance will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown. Performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of taxes that shareholders would pay on Fund distributions or the sale of Fund shares. Shareholders must be willing to tolerate significant fluctuations in the value of their investment. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including loss of principal.

Sources of distributions to shareholders may include ordinary dividends, long-term capital gains and return of capital. The final determination of the source of all distributions in 2025 for tax reporting purposes will be made after year end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Based on current estimates a portion of the distributions consist of a return of capital. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year’s distributions) contained in shareholder 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year.",https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20260116202294/en/2694783/22/Business_Wire_Logo-_FINAL.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 18:03:49.934662

According to OpenAI’s blog post, the company plans to test ads “at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service.” Ads will be labeled and separated from the answer.
OpenAI is not the only AI company exploring advertising revenue.
Financial pressures and a changing tune OpenAI’s advertising experiment reflects the enormous financial pressures facing the company.
“As we introduce ads, it’s crucial we preserve what makes ChatGPT valuable in the first place,” Simo wrote.","On Friday, OpenAI announced it will begin testing advertisements inside the ChatGPT app for some US users in a bid to expand its customer base and diversify revenue. The move represents a reversal for CEO Sam Altman, who in 2024 described advertising in ChatGPT as a “last resort” and expressed concerns that ads could erode user trust, although he did not completely rule out the possibility at the time.

The banner ads will appear in the coming weeks for logged-in users of the free version of ChatGPT as well as the new $8 per month ChatGPT Go plan, which OpenAI also announced Friday is now available worldwide. OpenAI first launched ChatGPT Go in India in August 2025 and has since rolled it out to over 170 countries.

Users paying for the more expensive Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will not see advertisements.

According to OpenAI’s blog post, the company plans to test ads “at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service.” Ads will be labeled and separated from the answer.

In example screenshots shared by the company, the ads look like blocked off sections of the chat window with a small image and some advertising copy. Asking ChatGPT for places to visit in Mexico could result in holiday ads appearing, for instance.

“Our enterprise and subscription businesses are already strong,” Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, wrote in the blog post. “We believe in having a diverse revenue model where ads can play a part in making intelligence more accessible to everyone.”

OpenAI’s announcement follows the company’s April 2025 introduction of shopping features to ChatGPT Search. At that time, OpenAI’s Adam Fry told Wired that product recommendations were “not ads” and “not sponsored,” but it felt like a potential step in that direction at the time.

OpenAI is not the only AI company exploring advertising revenue. Google began testing AdSense ads in chatbot experiences through partnerships with AI startups in late 2024.

Financial pressures and a changing tune

OpenAI’s advertising experiment reflects the enormous financial pressures facing the company. OpenAI does not expect to be profitable until 2030 and has committed to spend about $1.4 trillion on massive data centers and chips for AI.

According to financial documents obtained by The Wall Street Journal in November, OpenAI expects to burn through roughly $9 billion this year while generating $13 billion in revenue. Only about 5 percent of ChatGPT’s 800 million weekly users pay for subscriptions, so it’s not enough to cover all of OpenAI’s operating costs.

Not everyone is convinced ads will solve OpenAI’s financial problems. “I am extremely bearish on this ads product,” tech critic Ed Zitron wrote on Bluesky. “Even if this becomes a good business line, OpenAI’s services cost too much for it to matter!”

OpenAI’s embrace of ads appears to come reluctantly, since it runs counter to a “personal bias” against advertising that Altman has shared in earlier public statements. For example, during a fireside chat at Harvard University in 2024, Altman said he found the combination of ads and AI “uniquely unsettling,” implying that he would not like it if the chatbot itself changed its responses due to advertising pressure. He added: “When I think of like GPT writing me a response, if I had to go figure out exactly how much was who paying here to influence what I’m being shown, I don’t think I would like that.”

Along those lines, OpenAI’s approach appears to be a compromise between needing ad revenue and not wanting sponsored content to appear directly within ChatGPT’s written responses. By placing banner ads at the bottom of answers separated from the conversation history, OpenAI appears to be addressing Altman’s concern: The AI assistant’s actual output, the company says, will remain uninfluenced by advertisers.

Indeed, Simo wrote in a blog post that OpenAI’s ads will not influence ChatGPT’s conversational responses and that the company will not share conversations with advertisers and will not show ads on sensitive topics such as mental health and politics to users it determines to be under 18.

“As we introduce ads, it’s crucial we preserve what makes ChatGPT valuable in the first place,” Simo wrote. “That means you need to trust that ChatGPT’s responses are driven by what’s objectively useful, never by advertising.”",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/openai_glowing_green-1152x648.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 20:01:21.386878

On January 12, 2026, Cencora, Inc.

The Amendment increased the aggregate amount of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement by $1.0 billion to $5.5 billion.

The foregoing description of the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

Multi-Year Term Loan Facility

On January 12, 2026, the Company entered into a Term Credit Agreement (the “Term Credit Agreement”), among the Company, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, in connection with the previously announced proposed acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of the majority of the outstanding equity interests that the Company does not currently own in OneOncology. The Term Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured term loan facility of $1.5 billion consisting of two tranches: (a) $500 million (“Tranche One Loans”) and (b) $1.0 billion (“Tranche Two Loans” and together with Tranche One Loans, the “Term Loans”). Tranche One Loans mature two years from the date on which they are drawn. Tranche Two Loans mature three years from the date on which they are drawn. The Company will use the proceeds of the Term Loans to pay a portion of the consideration in respect of the Acquisition, to repay existing debt of OneOncology and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. The funding of the Term Loans is subject to customary conditions, including the consummation of the Acquisition.

The Term Loans will bear interest at a rate equal to either a Term SOFR rate or a Daily Simple SOFR rate (each as defined in the Term Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin, or an alternate base rate, plus an applicable margin, in each case based on the Company’s public debt ratings by S&P Global Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch, Inc. Such applicable margins range from 75 basis points to 125 basis points over both the Term SOFR rate and the Daily Simple SOFR rate and 0 basis points to 25 basis points over the alternate base rate, as determined in accordance with the provisions of the Term Credit Agreement. The Company has also agreed to pay a ticking fee that will, commencing on April 1, 2026, accrue at specified rates based on the Company’s public debt ratings, ranging from 5.5 basis points to 15 basis points on the daily amount of unused commitments under the Term Credit Agreement. The Company has the right to prepay the Term Loans at any time, in whole or in part and without premium or penalty (other than, if applicable, any breakage costs). The Company may also choose to reduce its commitments under the Term Credit Agreement at any time.

The covenants contained in the Term Credit Agreement are substantially similar to the covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Term Credit Agreement includes limitations on indebtedness of subsidiaries, liens, fundamental changes and asset sales and a covenant requiring compliance with a financial leverage ratio not to exceed 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter (which may be increased to 4.50 to 1.00 at the Company’s election as of the last day of any fiscal quarter during which the Company closes a material acquisition). The Term Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (which are in some cases subject to certain exceptions, thresholds and grace periods) including, but not limited to, nonpayment of principal and interest, failure to perform or observe covenants, breaches of representations and warranties and certain bankruptcy-related events.

The foregoing description of the Term Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Term Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

364-Day Term Credit Facility

On January 12, 2026, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “364-Day Term Credit Agreement”), among the Company, the lenders party thereto and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, in connection with the Acquisition.

The 364-Day Term Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured term loan facility of $3.0 billion (the “364-Day Term Loan”). The 364-Day Term Loan matures 364 days from the date on which it is drawn. The Company will use the proceeds of the 364-Day Term Loan to pay a portion of the consideration in respect of the Acquisition, to repay existing debt of OneOncology and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. The funding of the 364-Day Term Loan is subject to customary conditions, including the consummation of the Acquisition.

The 364-Day Term Loan will bear interest at a rate equal to either a Term SOFR rate or a Daily Simple SOFR rate, plus an applicable margin, or an alternate base rate, plus an applicable margin, in each case based on the Company’s public debt ratings by S&P Global Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch, Inc. Such applicable margins range from 87.5 basis points to 112.5 basis points over both the Term SOFR rate and the Daily Simple SOFR rate and 0 basis points to 12.5 basis points over the alternate base rate, as determined in accordance with the provisions of the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement. The Company has also agreed to pay a ticking fee that will, commencing on April 1, 2026, accrue at specified rates based on the Company’s public debt ratings, ranging from 6 basis points to 10 basis points on the daily amount of unused commitments under the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement. The Company has the right to prepay the 364-Day Term Loan at any time, in whole or in part and without premium or penalty (other than, if applicable, any breakage costs). The Company may also choose to reduce its commitments under the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement at any time.

The covenants contained in the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement are substantially similar to the covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Agreement. The 364-Day Term Credit Agreement includes limitations on indebtedness of subsidiaries, liens, fundamental changes and asset sales and a covenant requiring compliance with a financial leverage ratio not to exceed 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter (which may be increased to 4.50 to 1.00 at the Company’s election as of the last day of any fiscal quarter during which the Company closes a material acquisition). The 364-Day Term Credit Agreement contains certain representations, warranties and events of default (which are, in some cases, subject to certain exceptions, thresholds and grace periods) including, but not limited to, non-payment of principal and interest, failure to perform or observe covenants, breaches of representations and warranties and certain bankruptcy-related events.

The foregoing description of the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

Termination of Bridge Financing Commitment

As previously disclosed, in connection with the Acquisition, the Company obtained $4.5 billion in bridge financing commitments to fund the Acquisition. As a result of entering into the Term Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement, such bridge financing commitments have been automatically reduced by $4.5 billion, which is the amount of the commitments under the Term Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement, to zero.

Other Relationships

Certain of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement, and their affiliates, have various relationships with the Company and are providing in connection with the Acquisition, have in the past provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, commercial banking, derivative transactions and financial advisory services to the Company and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they will receive, have received and may continue to receive fees and commissions. In particular, in connection with the Acquisition, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., an affiliate of Citibank, N.A., is serving as lead financial advisor to the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, an affiliate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., is serving as financial advisor to the Company.

However, a new breed of biotech companies are leveraging AI and advanced data technologies in an attempt to accelerate and streamline the process.
Chai Discovery, an AI startup founded in 2024, is one such company.
Last Friday, Chai also announced a partnership with Eli Lilly, a deal in which the pharmaceutical giant will use the startup’s software to help develop new medicines.
The startup’s deal was announced shortly before Eli Lilly said it would also collaborate with Nvidia on a $1 billion partnership to create an AI drug discovery lab in San Francisco.","Drug discovery, the art of identifying new molecules to develop pharmaceuticals, is a notoriously time-consuming and difficult process. Traditional techniques, like high-throughput screening, offer an expensive scattershot approach — one that is not often successful. However, a new breed of biotech companies are leveraging AI and advanced data technologies in an attempt to accelerate and streamline the process.

Chai Discovery, an AI startup founded in 2024, is one such company. In a little over 12 months, its young co-founders have managed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars and rally the backing of some of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, making it one of the flashiest firms in a growing industry. In December, the company completed its Series B, bringing in an additional $130 million and a valuation of $1.3 billion.

Last Friday, Chai also announced a partnership with Eli Lilly, a deal in which the pharmaceutical giant will use the startup’s software to help develop new medicines. Chai’s algorithm, called Chai-2, is designed to develop antibodies — the proteins necessary to fight illnesses. The startup has said it hopes to serve as a kind of “computer-aided design suite” for molecules.

It’s a critical moment for Chai’s particular field. The startup’s deal was announced shortly before Eli Lilly said it would also collaborate with Nvidia on a $1 billion partnership to create an AI drug discovery lab in San Francisco. This “co-innovation lab,” as it’s being called, will combine big data, compute resources, and scientific expertise, all in an attempt to accelerate the speed of new medicine development.

The industry isn’t without its detractors. Some industry veterans seem to feel that — given how difficult traditional drug development is — these new technologies are unlikely to have a major impact. However, for every naysayer, there seem to be just as many believers.

Elena Viboch, managing director at General Catalyst — one of Chai’s major backers — told TechCrunch that her firm is confident that companies that adopt the startup’s services will see results. “We believe the biopharma companies that move the most quickly to partner with companies like Chai will be the first to get molecules into the clinic, and will make medicines that matter,” Viboch said. “In practice that means partnering in 2026 and by the end of 2027 seeing first-in-class medicines enter into clinical trials.”

Aliza Apple, the head of Lilly’s TuneLab program — which uses AI and machine learning to advance drug discovery — also expressed confidence in Chai’s product. “By combining Chai’s generative design models with Lilly’s deep biologics expertise and proprietary data, we intend to push the frontier of how AI can design better molecules from the outset, with the ultimate goal to help accelerate the development of innovative medicines for patients,” she said.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cvZZmc1_FvJIHDtJ2Ykkaw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_finance_785/3f5e08d2ec791ff8f8eebc2cd6aed023,N,,2026-01-16 17:06:00.570352
ID22,Instacart,2026-01-16 20:57:06+00:00,The Motley Fool,"Costco Really Wants Its Gold Star Members to Upgrade to Executive Status, and ... - The Motley Fool","Sean Williams, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/16/costco-gold-star-members-upgrade-executive-3-perks/,"Members pay $65 (Gold Star and Business) or $130 (Executive) annually for the right to shop in its stores.
However, the company is making a strong push, fueled by three new or adjusted perks, to entice tens of millions of U.S.-based Gold Star members to upgrade to Executive status.
A second dangling carrot was added for Costco's Executive members on June 30, 2025.
Although Costco aims to provide value to all 81.4 million of its members worldwide, encouraging domestic Gold Star member upgrades is vital to its long-term success.
Keeping Executive members happy and ensuring that renewal rates remain in the low-to-mid 90% range in the U.S. and Canada is paramount to the company's success.","For the last three years, the talk on Wall Street has centered on the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential to positively impact corporate growth and the lives of billions worldwide. But based on addressable opportunity, the global retail industry dwarfs the AI market.

According to a report from Mordor Intelligence, the worldwide retail industry is expected to expand from a $27.3 trillion market in 2025 to an estimated $36.9 trillion opportunity by 2030. For those keeping score at home, this translates to a compound annual growth rate that exceeds 6%.

Although the retail industry is highly competitive, businesses that are able to stand out can reap significant rewards. Examples of leading retailers include e-commerce titan Amazon (AMZN +0.40%), retail kingpin Walmart (WMT +0.42%), and warehouse club Costco Wholesale (COST +0.72%).

Arguably, no retailer has had a more unique path to success than Costco, whose membership-based operating model fuels its growth.

Differentiation has been central to Costco's long-term success

Based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were more than 1 million private retail establishments in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2024. While Costco isn't competing with all 1 million-plus businesses, it's constantly battling to stay relevant and attract shoppers to its stores. Some of the strategies it relies on are straightforward, while others are truly unique.

For example, Costco uses its size to its advantage. Similar to Amazon and Walmart, it purchases products in bulk, which lowers the per-unit cost of each item. These cost savings can be passed along to its shoppers, thereby allowing it to undercut local stores and national grocery chains on price. Few retailers can match the value proposition that Costco brings to the table for its members.

To build on this point, Costco offers a wide range of basic necessities, including groceries and toiletries, as well as a broad assortment of discretionary goods. These necessities ensure shoppers will come to its stores in any economic climate. While the margins tend to be razor-thin on groceries, it takes just one or more discretionary item purchases for a shopper's trip to be highly profitable.

Costco also enhances the lure of its warehouses by carrying rare or one-off items, such as luxury jewelry and gold bars/ingots.

But the most significant differentiating factor for Costco Wholesale is its memberships. Members pay $65 (Gold Star and Business) or $130 (Executive) annually for the right to shop in its stores. It's only natural for these individuals to want to get the most out of their membership fee. This makes Costco a prime destination for large shopping trips and works toward keeping consumers within its ecosystem.

Costco is introducing and updating perks to encourage Executive-level upgrades

As of the end of its fiscal first quarter for 2026 (Nov. 23, 2025), Costco had 81.4 million paying members worldwide, 39.7 million of which were Executive cardholders. However, the company is making a strong push, fueled by three new or adjusted perks, to entice tens of millions of U.S.-based Gold Star members to upgrade to Executive status.

For instance, when the company enacted its first membership fee increase since 2017 on Sept. 1, 2024, it also lifted the maximum annual 2% cash back reward from $1,000 to $1,250 for its Executive members. While purchases of gas, tobacco, alcohol (in most states), Costco gift cards, and membership fees don't count toward this 2% cash back reward, most in-store and online purchases will.

A second dangling carrot was added for Costco's Executive members on June 30, 2025. Beginning at the midpoint of last year, the company's highest-tier cardholders would receive a $10 monthly Instacart credit for same-day online delivery orders above $150 in the U.S. and Canada. Management fully understands the convenience that online shopping offers -- and 20.5% digitally enabled comparable sales growth in the fiscal first quarter suggests this perk is hitting home.

The third and easily most polarizing perk that Costco Wholesale bestowed on its Executive cardholders is special shopping hours. Beginning Sept. 2, 2025, Executive members can shop in Costco's stores exclusively from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. on weekdays and Sundays, and from 9 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. on Saturdays. CEO Ron Vachris has noted in quarterly conference calls since implementing these new shopping hours for its top-tier members that it's had a positive impact on sales.

Although Costco aims to provide value to all 81.4 million of its members worldwide, encouraging domestic Gold Star member upgrades is vital to its long-term success. Membership fees account for the lion's share of Costco's profits and provide the necessary margin buffer to undercut other retailers on price.

Even though Executive cardholders account for less than 49% of paying members, their purchases totaled 74.3% of net sales for Costco during the fiscal first quarter of 2026. Keeping Executive members happy and ensuring that renewal rates remain in the low-to-mid 90% range in the U.S. and Canada is paramount to the company's success.

With Costco aggressively targeting membership upgrades, expect new perks to be added or adjusted in the new year (and beyond).",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F851245%2Fcostco-wholesale-warehouse-groceries-staples-discretionary-retail-gdp-inflation.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-16 17:05:49.971029

BNY has engineered Eliza to be model-agnostic, allowing agents to switch between different high-performance models based on the specific task.
Initial reactions from the AI research community have been overwhelmingly positive, particularly regarding BNY’s commitment to ""Explainable AI"" (XAI).
The New Standard for Institutional Finance The deployment of 20,000 AI agents at BNY marks the definitive end of the ""experimentation phase"" for generative AI in the financial sector.
The key takeaways are clear: agentic AI is no longer a futuristic concept; it is an active, revenue-impacting reality.","In a move that signals a tectonic shift in the digital transformation of global finance, BNY (NYSE: BNY), formerly known as BNY Mellon, has officially reached a massive milestone in its AI strategy. As of January 16, 2026, the world’s largest custody bank has successfully deployed tens of thousands of ""Agentic Assistants"" across its global operations. This deployment represents one of the first successful transitions from experimental generative AI to a full-scale ""agentic"" operating model, where AI systems perform complex, autonomous tasks rather than just responding to prompts.

The bank’s initiative, built upon its proprietary Eliza platform, has divided its AI workforce into two distinct categories: over 20,000 ""Empowered Builders""—human employees trained to create custom agents—and a growing fleet of over 130 specialized ""Digital Employees."" These digital entities possess their own system credentials, email accounts, and communication access, effectively operating as autonomous members of the bank’s workforce. This development is being hailed as the ""operating system of the bank,"" fundamentally altering how BNY handles trillions of dollars in assets daily.

Technical Deep Dive: From Chatbots to Digital Employees

The technical backbone of this initiative is the Eliza 2.0 platform, a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration layer that represents a departure from the simple Large Language Model (LLM) interfaces of 2023 and 2024. Unlike previous iterations that focused on text generation, Eliza 2.0 is centered on ""reasoning"" and ""agency."" These agents are not just processing data; they are executing workflows that involve multiple steps, such as cross-referencing internal databases, validating external regulatory updates, and communicating findings via Microsoft Teams to their human managers.

A critical component of this deployment is the ""menu of models"" approach. BNY has engineered Eliza to be model-agnostic, allowing agents to switch between different high-performance models based on the specific task. For instance, agents might use GPT-4 from OpenAI for complex logical reasoning, Google Cloud’s Gemini Enterprise for multimodal deep research, and specialized Llama-based models for internal code remediation. This architecture ensures that the bank is not locked into a single provider while maximizing the unique strengths of each AI ecosystem.

Initial reactions from the AI research community have been overwhelmingly positive, particularly regarding BNY’s commitment to ""Explainable AI"" (XAI). Every agentic model must pass a rigorous ""Model-Risk Review"" before deployment, generating detailed ""model cards"" and feature importance charts that allow auditors to understand the ""why"" behind an agent's decision. This level of transparency addresses a major hurdle in the adoption of AI within highly regulated environments, where ""black-box"" decision-making is often a non-starter for compliance officers.

The Multi-Vendor Powerhouse: Big Tech's Role in the Agentic Shift

The scale of BNY's deployment has created a lucrative blueprint for major technology providers. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) played a foundational role by supplying the hardware infrastructure; BNY was the first major bank to deploy an Nvidia DGX SuperPOD with H100 systems, providing the localized compute power necessary to train and run these agents securely on-premises. This partnership has solidified Nvidia’s position not just as a chipmaker, but as a critical infrastructure partner for ""Sovereign AI"" within the private sector.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are also deeply integrated into the Eliza ecosystem. Microsoft Azure hosts much of the Eliza infrastructure, providing the integration layer for agents to interact with the Microsoft 365 suite, including Outlook and Teams. Meanwhile, Google Cloud’s Gemini Enterprise is being utilized for ""agentic deep research,"" synthesizing vast datasets to provide predictive analytics on trade settlements. This competitive landscape shows that while tech giants are vying for dominance, the ""agentic era"" is fostering a multi-provider reality where enterprise clients demand interoperability and the ability to leverage the best-of-breed models from various labs.

For AI startups, BNY’s move is both a challenge and an opportunity. While the bank has the resources to build its own orchestration layer, the demand for specialized, niche agents—such as those focused on specific international tax laws or ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) compliance—is expected to create a secondary market for smaller AI firms that can plug into platforms like Eliza. The success of BNY’s internal ""Empowered Builders"" program suggests that the future of enterprise AI may lie in tools that allow non-technical staff to build and maintain their own agents, rather than relying on off-the-shelf software.

Reshaping the Global Finance Landscape

The broader significance of BNY’s move cannot be overstated. By empowering 40% of its global workforce to build and use AI agents, the bank has effectively democratized AI in a way that parallels the introduction of the personal computer or the spreadsheet. This is a far cry from the pilot projects of 2024; it is a full-scale industrialization of AI. BNY has reported a roughly 5% reduction in unit costs for core custody trades, a significant margin in the high-volume, low-margin world of asset servicing.

Beyond cost savings, the deployment addresses the increasing complexity of regulatory compliance. BNY’s ""Contract Review Assistant"" agents can now benchmark thousands of negotiated agreements against global regulations in a fraction of the time it would take human legal teams. This ""always-on"" compliance capability mitigates risk and allows the bank to adapt to shifting geopolitical and regulatory landscapes with unprecedented speed.

Comparisons are already being drawn to previous technological milestones, such as the transition to electronic trading in the 1990s. However, the agentic shift is potentially more disruptive because it targets the ""cognitive labor"" of the middle and back office. While earlier waves of automation replaced manual data entry, these agents are performing tasks that previously required human judgment and cross-departmental coordination. The potential concern remains the ""human-in-the-loop"" requirement; as agents become more autonomous, the pressure on human managers to supervise dozens of digital employees will require new management frameworks and training.

The Next Frontier: Proactive Agents and Automated Remediation

Looking toward the remainder of 2026 and into 2027, the bank is expected to expand the capabilities of its agents from reactive to proactive. Near-term developments include ""Predictive Trade Analytics,"" where agents will not only identify settlement risks but also autonomously initiate remediation protocols to prevent trade failures before they occur. This move from ""detect and report"" to ""anticipate and act"" will be the true test of agentic autonomy in finance.

One of the most anticipated applications on the horizon is the integration of these agents into client-facing roles. While currently focused on internal operations, BNY is reportedly exploring ""Client Co-pilots"" that would give the bank’s institutional clients direct access to agentic research and analysis tools. However, this will require addressing significant challenges regarding data privacy and ""multi-tenant"" agent security to ensure that agents do not inadvertently share proprietary insights across different client accounts.

Experts predict that other ""Global Systemically Important Banks"" (G-SIBs) will be forced to follow suit or risk falling behind in operational efficiency. We are likely to see a ""space race"" for AI talent and compute resources, as institutions realize that the ""Agentic Assistant"" model is the only way to manage the exponential growth of financial data and regulatory requirements in the late 2020s.

The New Standard for Institutional Finance

The deployment of 20,000 AI agents at BNY marks the definitive end of the ""experimentation phase"" for generative AI in the financial sector. The key takeaways are clear: agentic AI is no longer a futuristic concept; it is an active, revenue-impacting reality. BNY’s success with the Eliza platform demonstrates that with the right governance, infrastructure, and multi-vendor strategy, even the most traditional financial institutions can reinvent themselves for the AI era.

This development will likely be remembered as a turning point in AI history—the moment when ""agents"" moved from tech demos to the front lines of global capitalism. In the coming weeks and months, the industry will be watching closely for BNY’s quarterly earnings to see how these efficiencies translate into bottom-line growth. Furthermore, the response from regulators like the Federal Reserve and the SEC will be crucial in determining how fast other institutions are allowed to adopt similar autonomous systems.

As we move further into 2026, the question is no longer whether AI will change finance, but which institutions will have the infrastructure and the vision to lead the agentic revolution. BNY has made its move, setting a high bar for the rest of the industry to follow.

© Copyright 2025 Capital Markets Elite Group – All Rights Reserved","Novo Nordisk A/S shares surged in U.S. trading after U.K. regulators cleared a triple-dose of the company’s flagship obesity drug, heightening rivalry with Eli Lilly & Co. in the $100 billion weight-loss market.

The Danish drugmaker’s American depositary receipts climbed 3.2% in premarket trading Friday following the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency’s approval of a 7.2-milligram weekly dose of semaglutide—three times the previous 2.4-mg limit. The higher dose requires three separate injections and is restricted to adult patients with obesity. Eli Lilly shares dipped 0.3%.

Market Dynamics Shift

The approval comes as Novo encounters increasing pressure from Lilly’s Zepbound, which has achieved considerable market share despite Novo’s early-mover position with semaglutide-based treatments. Ozempic received FDA approval for Type 2 diabetes in 2017, with Wegovy following for chronic weight management in 2021.

Novo’s counterstrategy centers on product diversification. The company launched an oral Wegovy formulation in the U.S. on January 5, with a U.K. regulatory decision anticipated by year-end.

Revenue Projections

Speaking at this week’s J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, Novo CEO Mike Doustdar pointed out the oral medication’s strategic importance. “Right now, we are being judged by how many patients are being switched between Eli Lilly and us,” Doustdar said. “A big part of those people don’t want an injection. They’re waiting for the pill.”

Berenberg analysts project the oral version could generate approximately $1 billion in 2025 revenue, possibly counterbalancing headwinds from U.S. pricing pressures and patent expirations. The bank’s base-case scenario forecasts $2 billion by 2027, with upside potential to $6 billion if Novo leverages its first-mover advantage.

Competitive Landscape

Lilly is developing orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 competitor expected to launch this year following last month’s FDA application submission. December data showed orforglipron enables patients to maintain weight loss after transitioning from injectable treatments, including Wegovy and Zepbound, with participants switching directly from maximum tolerated injectable doses to oral formulations.
