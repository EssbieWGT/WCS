The regulatory focus is not limited to explicit ""no artificial dyes"" statements.
Industry Reaction Following federal and state pressure, major brands have announced plans to remove artificial dyes from their U.S. product lines.
Both companies have stated that they will phase out FD&C artificial dyes by the end of 2027.
The removal of artificial dyes by industry leaders is rapidly setting new expectations for ingredient transparency and marketing accuracy across the CPG sector.","The regulatory landscape for consumer-packaged goods (CPG) brands is shifting, with artificial food dyes emerging as a central focus of both state and federal scrutiny. Recent actions by the federal and state governments, most notably in Texas, have placed a spotlight on the marketing and labeling practices of major food manufacturers, particularly those making claims about the absence of artificial dyes or the healthfulness of their products that include artificial dyes. This heightened attention is not limited to a single company or product category, and it signals a broader trend that could reshape compliance expectations and litigation risk across the food and beverage industry.

The significance of this development lies in its potential to trigger a wave of regulatory investigations, consumer class actions and reputational challenges for brands that market products as ""healthy,"" ""natural"" or ""free from artificial additives"" while still using synthetic dyes. As public health authorities and consumer advocates intensify their calls for transparency and reformulation, CPG companies should reassess their ingredient disclosures, marketing strategies and risk management protocols to navigate this evolving landscape.

Texas Targets Artificial Dye Use in Food Products

Following the announcements by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Food and Drug Administration of their plans to phase out artificial dyes in U.S. food products, Texas launched investigations into the use of artificial dyes by various large CPG companies based on potential violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act. According to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, these companies may have misled consumers by marketing products as ""healthy"" and artificial dye-free while still containing synthetic dyes such as Red 40 and Yellow 6. The regulatory focus is not limited to explicit ""no artificial dyes"" statements. Broad health-related claims such as ""'good source of vitamins and minerals,"" ""healthy,"" ""all natural"" or other clean label claims will be under scrutiny if those products contain artificial dyes.

The Texas investigations are significant not only for their immediate implications for the targeted companies being investigated, but also for their potential to set a precedent for how similar claims are evaluated and enforced across the food and beverage industry. These actions underscore the importance of rigorous internal controls, transparent ingredient disclosures and substantiated marketing practices for brands operating in an increasingly scrutinized regulatory environment. Any disconnect between marketing claims and actual ingredients can expose brands to both regulatory and civil actions.

Industry Reaction

Following federal and state pressure, major brands have announced plans to remove artificial dyes from their U.S. product lines. On June 18, 2025, Kraft Heinz and General Mills announced that they will be removing artificial dyes from their products sold in the U.S. Both companies have stated that they will phase out FD&C artificial dyes by the end of 2027. General Mills also stated that it will be prioritizing the removal of such dyes in its cereals sold in K-12 schools by summer 2026. And Kraft Heinz will not launch new products in the U.S. that include FD&C colors moving forward. The removal of artificial dyes by industry leaders is rapidly setting new expectations for ingredient transparency and marketing accuracy across the CPG sector.

Takeaways

These federal mandates and state investigations mark a significant escalation in regulatory and legal risk for CPG brands making ""good for you,"" ""natural"" or other health claims, particularly marketed to children. Companies face increased exposure to class actions and consumer lawsuits alleging false advertising and mislabeling, particularly where independent testing contradicts marketing claims. Companies should review product formulations, marketing statements and compliance protocols to mitigate exposure in this rapidly developing area.",https://www.hklaw.com/-/media/images/twittercards/blogs/barbitesblog.png?rev=fe9a958372464941bae81d11b270652a&sc_lang=en&hash=E59ABAAFE7A4A7119E9B83D2D5C9EA17,N,,2025-07-14 17:06:15.705250

The possible splitfirst reported by The Wall Street Journalwould likely leave Kraft Heinz with brands like Heinz ketchup and Grey Poupon mustard, while legacy Kraft-branded items would go to the new company. A spokesperson confirmed that the company has been evaluating strategic transactions since May to unlock shareholder value.

Kraft Heinz stock closed up 2.5% on the day; the company currently holds a market capitalization of $31.3 billion. A final decision on the spinoff could emerge in the coming weeks, though plans may still change.

The proposed move echoes Kellogg's (KLG, Financials) 2023 decision to spin off its cereal businesswhich had suffered volume declinesinto WK Kellogg, which was recently acquired by Ferrero for $3.1 billion. Analysts say other packaged food makers could follow suit; the industry faces a tough mix of inflationary headwinds, cost-conscious consumers, and demand for healthier, fresher alternatives.

Kraft Heinz, backed by Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazil's 3G Capital, has struggled in recent years. In April, the company slashed its full-year forecast after a weak quarter; last month, it also halted U.S. product launches involving artificial food dyes after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pushed for regulatory action.

Connor Rattigan of Consumer Edge said the move is part of a larger trend in which consumer packaged goods companies are reevaluating their category exposure; M&A or corporate restructurings may offer a way out, he said; but investors will be watching closely to see whether this is a quick fixor the start of something more strategic.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.finance.gurufocus/a004ddbce557262dd0c06f7ce1e367e7,N,,2025-07-14 17:06:24.381101

The key is using image embeddings.
Image embeddings are mathematical representations of an image’s visual features.
This was how Philips’ image library shrank from 200,000 to 8,000 of the best ones in just hours.
The AI also makes it easier to manage the images across all marketing channels.","Philips, a Dutch health technology company, faced the same issue. So it built a solution using Google Cloud’s Vertex AI platform to narrow down 200,000 images into the best 8,000 on-brand images in just hours.

The initiative addressed a long-standing challenge: the need to maintain visual consistency across a wide product portfolio and global digital presence. The volume and variety of content created over time had become difficult to organize and maintain using traditional systems.

“We manage a large volume of proprietary assets, many of which historically weren’t fully centralized,” Claudia Calori, Philips’ head of marketing excellence, personal health, told PYMNTS. “Properly managing the life cycle of these assets is critical to maintaining brand consistency and integrity across every touchpoint.”

Companies like Philips are using artificial intelligence (AI) to gain a competitive advantage, according to a PYMNTS Intelligence report. AI has changed from being a buzzword to a business enabler. In the goods and technology sectors, users said they could accelerate early-stage creativity to support concept development, prototyping and visual design.

Nearly 2 out of 3 product leaders use generative AI to innovate products and services, while 38% use it to generate feedback on the production process. Here, generative AI serves as a “creative partner” in the idea phase that turns weeks spent in cross-functional team alignment to surfacing designs in just one meeting, the report said.

At Philips, developers created a custom algorithm that used a form of AI called computer vision to sort images — bypassing the use of file names, manual tags or metadata, which are file descriptions that are often less precise and can be outdated.

Computer vision enabled Philips to compare and group images based on what’s in the image itself, even if the image is cropped, resized or compressed into a different format. The key is using image embeddings.

Image embeddings are mathematical representations of an image’s visual features. These embeddings capture patterns such as color, shapes, composition and textures for the AI to parse through.

“Using image embeddings, the system compares degrees of similarity between images across multiple databases and delivers instant results, even when scanning hundreds of thousands of images at once,” Calori explained. “It’s a metadata-free approach that’s driven entirely by the visual content itself.”

Bypassing the Metadata

Once the embeddings are in place, the AI then does searches based on visual similarities across Philips’ image libraries.

After similar images are identified, the algorithm puts them into groups. From each group, the best version based on quality or newness is chosen as the “master” image. Duplicates and outdated visuals were discarded. This was how Philips’ image library shrank from 200,000 to 8,000 of the best ones in just hours.

Under the old way, “we relied heavily on metadata to track image variants, but as assets were modified, reformatted or reused, that metadata could easily become disconnected or outdated,” Calori said. Using AI that bypassed metadata saved “significant” amounts of time and improved accuracy, freeing the team to focus on strategy and creativity.

The AI also makes it easier to manage the images across all marketing channels. Any revised versions can be traced back to its source to ensure that only approved images are used. This mitigates compliance risks.

“It also allows us to strengthen and ensure compliance, automates what used to be a manual effort and improves the consistency of the assets we present to our customers and consumers,” Calori said. “Ultimately, this helps drive stronger engagement and trust in the brand.”

The system supports additional use cases as well, such as enabling faster A/B testing, accelerating campaign launches, and curating up-to-date asset collections for marketing teams.

“Marketing plays a key role in how we help people take charge of their well-being,” Calori said. “Managing our digital assets effectively supports that mission. It allows us to tell a more consistent, clear story across all touchpoints.”

Philips said the new AI capabilities not only address current operational challenges but also establish a foundation for future innovation in marketing content strategy.

“This innovation marks a major leap forward for Philips’ asset life cycle management strategy,” the company said in a statement. “By using advanced visual matching, Philips can refresh touchpoints faster, limit compliance risk, and maximize the impact of current and new assets.”

Hundreds of locations in California, including all the remaining Rite Aid stores in Stanislaus County, are set to close.

While the Philadelphia-based pharmacy chain initially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 2023, Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy for a second time in May 2025.

In a May 5 news release, Rite Aid CEO Matt Schroeder said the company has been facing “financial challenges, intensified by the rapidly evolving retail and health care landscapes.”

“As we move forward, our key priorities are ensuring uninterrupted pharmacy services for our customers and preserving jobs for as many associates as possible,” Schroeder said in the release.

Here’s when Rite Aid stores will close in Stanislaus County — and what will happen to prescriptions:

What is Rite Aid?

Rite Aid is a national pharmacy chain that began in 1962 as Thrift D Discount Center in Scranton, Pennsylvania, according to the company’s website.

Along with in-store pharmacies, Rite Aid locations sell over-the-counter medications, vitamins, beauty products and household essentials.

Where are Rite Aid locations closing in Stanislaus County? When?

In an earlier round of closures, Rite Aid shut down its location at 1300 West F St. in Oakdale on June 25, followed by its Ceres store at 1830 Mitchell Road, which closed on July 1.

The Rite Aid location at 1707 McHenry Ave. in Modesto closed on July 9.

Rite Aid will close its remaining stores in Stanislaus County later in July.

In Turlock, the Rite Aid location at 653 North Golden State Blvd. will close on Wednesday, July 16, while the store at 1000 West Monte Vista Ave. will close on Thursday, July 17.

Rite Aid will close its last remaining Oakdale location at 1449 East F St., Suite 102, on Monday July 28, while its last remaining location in Modesto will close at 1032 Oakdale Road on Tuesday, July 15.

Although Rite Aid’s official closure list did not include its location at 1935 North St. in Newman, media outlet Westside Connect reported in May that the North Street spot was scheduled to close as part of the pharmacy chain’s bankruptcy proceedings.

As of Monday, July 14, the Newman location was listed as “closed” on Rite Aid’s website.

Where will my prescriptions be transferred?

According to Rite Aid, prescriptions from closing stores will be transferred to nearby pharmacies to ensure patients continue receiving their medications without interruption.

The lawsuit, originally filed in Missouri state court in May and moved to federal court on July 2, centers around a dispute over Blue KC’s use of clinical validation audits to retrospectively reject diagnosis codes tied to inpatient hospital claims. Merriam, Kan.-based Shawnee Mission alleges that the audits, performed by third-party vendors, routinely overturn its physicians’ documented diagnoses without meaningful engagement or adequate justification, thereby violating the two organizations’ contract.

The complaint specifically mentions Apixio, a vendor hired by Blue KC in early 2024 to conduct clinical audits after the insurer had previously used another vendor, Cotiviti. According to the complaint, Apixio uses artificial intelligence tools marketed as being able to conduct complex reviews “in minutes, not days,” and has asserted that 60% of inpatient diagnoses are clinically invalid, which AdventHealth called staggering and deeply flawed. The lawsuit alleges that neither Apixio nor Cotiviti consulted with physicians or provided transparency into their qualifications or use of AI in reviewing medical records, arguing that the process bypassed standard medical review safeguards.

AdventHealth is alleging that more than 350 claims involving diagnoses such as malnutrition, respiratory failure, and sepsis were denied, even when supported by patient records and confirmed by providers. The denials are allegedly disproportionately focused on conditions that, when coded, increase reimbursement rates due to their complexity and the resources required to treat them. The hospital claims that Blue KC’s selective auditing of the diagnoses is an intentional strategy to minimize its financial obligations.

The lawsuit is seeking a declaratory judgment stating that Blue KC’s clinical validation audit practices breach the provider agreement and violate the law. AdventHealth is asking the court to require the insurer to pay for denied claims that are documented in medical records and to permanently halt the clinical validation audit process unless performed by qualified personnel in a transparent manner. The hospital is also requesting damages for the alleged underpayments.

The vital role of marketplaces Marketplaces play a crucial role in Every Man Jack's ecommerce strategy, offering benefits beyond sales.","Men’s care brand Every Man Jack employs a strategic calendar-based marketing approach that shifts focus throughout the year, responding to consumer behavior and competitive pressures.

“[Our marketing approach] really depends on the time of the year,” said Nick Hasselberg, vice president of performance marketing and ecommerce at men’s care brand Every Man Jack on a recent episode of “Behind the Numbers.” “At the beginning of the year, it’s brand marketing. In the back half of the year, it’s probably a little bit more [about] performance marketing.”

The brand front-loads awareness campaigns at the beginning of the year, recognizing competitors are aggressively generating demand immediately after the holiday season.

""We realized last year that our competitors were not standing pat and really after the holiday focusing intensely on generating awareness and demand,"" Hasselberg explained.

This early-year brand marketing creates a foundation of awareness that the company can leverage in the second half of the year through more performance-focused tactics.

These include rewards programs through partners like Ibotta or Neptune, and increased investment in search marketing to convert aware consumers into customers.

This approach aligns with broader retail trends.

“Nowadays, with the holiday calendars, especially being pulled forward more, it becomes more important to get brand awareness earlier into the year,” said our analyst Sky Canaves.

Men's personal care: A category in transformation

The men's personal care category is experiencing significant growth, outpacing personal care at large, driven by several converging trends.

""Men are increasingly interested in 'better for you' offerings,"" Hasselberg noted, pointing to the rise of clean ingredients in men's products mirroring broader trends.

This shift has been accelerated by social media creating greater appearance consciousness and COVID prompting increased health awareness.

But men's personal care marketing requires a distinct approach compared to women's beauty marketing, focusing more on outcomes than ingredients.

""Beauty shoppers are so much further along the adoption curve. They know what they're looking for. They know what those ingredients are on the back of the bottle,"" said Hasselberg. ""Men still need to be educated. And really for men, it tends to be a bit more outcome focused.""

This education gap means that while ingredient transparency matters, connecting those ingredients to specific benefits is crucial for male consumers who may not understand the significance of components like aloe vera or jojoba beads without clear explanation of their effects.

The vital role of marketplaces

Marketplaces play a crucial role in Every Man Jack's ecommerce strategy, offering benefits beyond sales.

""Marketplaces are vital to this brand's growth. First and foremost, they provide the most consistency in terms of return within marketing, which is essential to planning,"" said Hasselberg.

This consistency helps stabilize marketing performance when other plans encounter challenges.

Marketplaces can also contribute to upper-funnel marketing goals or serve as testing grounds for new products.

“One of our greatest sources of awareness amongst all consumers is seeing us on Amazon or seeing us at Walmart.com,” said Hasselberg.

The brand recently launched a new deodorant on Amazon, using the platform to gather consumer feedback on creative elements, reviews, and purchasing patterns.

“Reddit is the number one platform for product-related discussions, including health, wellness and beauty,” she said.
The collaboration not only expands CMX’s audience reach but offers brands a chance to tap into the reasons behind purchase behaviors.
“It’s being able to hone in on not just what they purchase, but why they purchase, or maybe even why not, and bring those insights further to our brands,” Walsh said.
“It’s new communities, new ways to engage on discoverability and growth, and it will just yield a lot more transactions for our brands,” Walsh concluded.","CANNES — CVS Media Exchange (CMX), the retail media arm of CVS Health, is teaming up with Reddit to unlock new advertising opportunities for brands, tapping into Reddit’s vast, high-intent communities focused on health, wellness and beauty.

“Our collaboration with Reddit will be available early Q4 of this year,” said Raphaela Walsh, head of product at CMX, during an interview with Jon Watts, managing director of the Coalition for Innovation in Media Measurement, at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. “We’re super excited to see the results and performance, and based on that beta, we’ll then look to extend it further.”

Walsh said Reddit’s unmatched role in product discovery and conversation, particularly in health and wellness. “Reddit is the number one platform for product-related discussions, including health, wellness and beauty,” she said. “Over 51% of product mentions actually happen on Reddit, so it’s just a powerful, powerful platform.”

The partnership will integrate CMX’s first-party data, including insights from CVS’s ExtraCare loyalty members, with Reddit’s 108 million daily active users across 100,000 communities. Of particular interest are the 700-plus Reddit communities dedicated to health and wellness, which Walsh described as “really unique conversations that are happening with really high intent.”

Beyond scale, Walsh said both companies share a focus on authenticity, transparency and verification. Reddit’s existing partnerships with brand safety platforms such as DoubleVerify and IAS “really checked the box in a critical way that helped us move forward,” she added.

The collaboration not only expands CMX’s audience reach but offers brands a chance to tap into the reasons behind purchase behaviors.

“It’s being able to hone in on not just what they purchase, but why they purchase, or maybe even why not, and bring those insights further to our brands,” Walsh said.

Walsh framed the partnership as part of a larger trend where consumers move beyond traditional social media to seek peer recommendations and meaningful product discussions.

“It’s not just about social anymore,” she said. “It’s where they can consult with peers on topics that are meaningful for them and where brands can deliver highly targeted offerings with measurement.”

The beta launch is set for later this year, with plans to scale pending performance results. “It’s new communities, new ways to engage on discoverability and growth, and it will just yield a lot more transactions for our brands,” Walsh concluded.",https://www.beet.tv/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/97873-thumbnail-2-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 16:07:47.022623

A smart strategy But don’t worry, anyone who wants the classic Egg McMuffin can still get it.
More than just a product, a cultural evolution The Egg McMuffin isn’t just another item on the menu: it’s part of McDonald’s DNA!","McDonald’s has just announced some changes. Its most iconic breakfast item, the Egg McMuffin (which has been winning over American breakfast tables for over half a century) isn’t going anywhere, let’s be clear, it’s getting a makeover! You and I both know there’s nothing better than an Egg McMuffin breakfast, but market trends are shifting and so are consumer tastes, so Ray Kroc’s favourite breakfast, the founder of McDonald’s, is about to get a new look… and it starts this week!

The goal is to win over new generations, with a spicier, bolder, and more modern version adapted to today’s consumers. Starting July 8, customers will be able to enjoy the new Spicy McMuffin (yummy!) a limited edition that adds the house spicy sauce to the classic recipe. We love it!!

Will it be enough to win the hearts of young spice lovers? It definitely won us over!

The launch is a celebration of the product’s 50th anniversary, but also a clear marketing strategy to keep it alive. McDonald’s has realized that consumer preferences have changed, and that bold, spicy flavours are now the norm, not the exception. Will this move keep the legacy of the Egg McMuffin alive in a world that doesn’t eat breakfast the same way anymore?

A breakfast with history

In 1972, a McDonald’s franchisee named Herb Peterson presented a completely new product to founder Ray Kroc: a breakfast sandwich that combined egg, ham, and cheese in an English muffin. Kroc was hesitant, but after trying it, he was thrilled. The Egg McMuffin became McDonald’s first official breakfast item, opening a new business line and changing the way Americans eat breakfast. Kroc even wrote in his memoirs the three reasons why he liked this breakfast:

He liked the surprise of not knowing what he was going to taste

He was amazed by the presentation and loved the flavour

The Egg McMuffin paved the way in the breakfast market

Since then, the sandwich has remained practically unchanged. But the world has changed, and millennials and gen z are crazy about bold flavours!

Half a century later: new tastes, new generations

Nowadays, consumers don’t just look for speed or convenience. They want bolder, more personalized products with character. And especially among younger people, the love for spicy food has exploded. According to an Instacart survey, 74% of Americans eat hot sauce frequently, and 78% of Gen Z members say they love spicy food. More spice, more flavour, more delicious, don’t you think?

The new Spicy McMuffin

So, since July, all McDonald’s locations across the U.S. will offer three new spicy options: the Spicy McMuffin, the Spicy Sausage McMuffin, and the Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg. The main difference between them is in the brand’s exclusive spicy sauce, which adds a punch of flavour without changing the base of the product. And if you haven’t tried it, we recommend it because it’s delicious!!

A smart strategy

But don’t worry, anyone who wants the classic Egg McMuffin can still get it. But for those looking for something stronger and different, there’s now a new, eye-catching option. This way, the chain doesn’t risk alienating its most loyal customers while capturing the attention of a new, bolder audience eager to try new flavours!

More than just a product, a cultural evolution

The Egg McMuffin isn’t just another item on the menu: it’s part of McDonald’s DNA! The fact that the chain dares to tweak it, even temporarily, reflects a deep shift in food culture. Traditional breakfast is giving way to more dynamic formats, influenced by globalization, social media, and changing tastes.

They’re also aiming for (free, of course) social media buzz. The Spicy McMuffin won’t just be eaten: it’ll be filmed, shared on TikTok, reviewed on YouTube… It’s a way to keep the brand alive among an audience that consumes experiences!

50 years and still going strong, now it’s reinventing itself too. We’re already looking forward to getting in line to try that bold new flavour, we can’t wait!",https://unionrayo.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Egg_McMuffin-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 17:06:41.746305

PYMNTS reported in September that while businesses have traditionally focused on internal cybersecurity measures, today’s interconnected digital ecosystem demands a more holistic approach.","The fast-food giant didn’t have its information compromised as a result of sophisticated malware or a zero-day exploit. Instead, the hackers won the war with a simple guessing game. McHire, McDonald’s AI-powered hiring chatbot, was configured with the default credentials 123456/123456 to access the administration interface for McHire restaurant accounts. No MFA, no brute-force protection, nothing.

Designed by Paradox.ai and deployed across tens of thousands of restaurants globally, McHire automates much of the company’s frontline hiring, from collecting applications to conducting interviews via a bot named “Olivia.” The chatbot had access to detailed personal information on job seekers across dozens of countries, and yet it appears that the keys to its admin panel required nothing more than the most guessable password in digital history.

This wasn’t an elite attack, and that’s exactly what makes it so troubling. It didn’t involve backdoors, rootkits or polymorphic code. It involved typing “123456” into a login box and making one small tweak to a URL.

From exposed cloud environments to third-party vendor vulnerabilities, today’s cyber threats are becoming more varied and insidious. In this new digital battlefield, safeguarding your perimeter is no longer about firewalls or antivirus software. It’s about identity, integration, and insight.

Passwords Make Everything Leaky as Attack Chains Move From Credentials to Chaos

For decades, enterprise cybersecurity strategies revolved around the notion of a clearly defined perimeter: secure what’s inside, keep the bad actors out. But cloud adoption, hybrid work, third-party tools, and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies have fragmented that perimeter into a patchwork of distributed endpoints and unseen attack vectors.

Still, the McHire breach highlights an uncomfortable truth about modern cybersecurity: while companies invest in next-generation technologies, many still fall victim to yesterday’s mistakes. In this case, the most avoidable mistake of all — using a default password — opened the door.

“It’s the tried and true advice that is often given,” Belsasar Lepe, co-founder and CEO of Cerby, stressed to PYMNTS. “Make it easy to turn on multifactor authentication for your end users. Ninety-nine percent of identity attacks are due to a lack of MFA just being turned on.”

One of Amazon’s flagship products, Amazon Web Services (AWS), last summer announced it was pushing ahead with making MFA mandatory for certain users.

Still, part of the problem lies in how technology like McHire is deployed. The McDonald’s franchise system is highly decentralized. Individual restaurant owners, not corporate headquarters, often manage the technology stack that governs hiring, scheduling, and operations. This structure creates opportunities for inconsistency — and gaps. A third-party platform like McHire may be integrated locally, configured quickly, and left largely untouched once operational. That’s how default credentials persist. That’s how no one notices until a researcher stumbles upon them.

McDonald’s did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment.

Expanding Attack Surface Provides a Blueprint for Exploitation

The deeper issue can frequently lie in how enterprises view cybersecurity, especially when it comes to tools adopted outside traditional IT oversight. AI-driven tools are increasingly being implemented by line-of-business teams: HR, marketing, logistics. They’re seen as software as a service, quick to install, easy to use, and rarely scrutinized. The belief that “someone else” is handling security is pervasive.

PYMNTS reported in September that while businesses have traditionally focused on internal cybersecurity measures, today’s interconnected digital ecosystem demands a more holistic approach.

“In 2021, there were 400 data breach lawsuits filed,” Philip Yannella co-chair of the privacy, security and data protection practice at Blank Rome and the author of “Cyber Litigation: Data Breach, Data Privacy & Digital Rights,” 2025 edition, told PYMNTS. “Last year, there were over 2,000.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/McDonalds-data-breach.png,N,,2025-07-14 16:09:07.079661

The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace. Congress also created associated tax credits that have helped some offset those costs even further. Over 261,000 people in Virginia have Aetna healthcare, according to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services.

Aetna is under the CVS umbrella and has participated in the ACA marketplace. Recipients have received emails this summer alerting them of the forthcoming change and the company website outlines it as well.

“As we considered plan options for the future, it became clear we would not be able to provide the same level of value we’ve offered in prior years,” the health insurer’s website stated.

Both the online statement and a request for comment from CVS Health did not clarify what made it “clear” the company felt the need to withdraw, but the shifting federal health care policy landscape could be part of the equation.

Congress has yet to renew ACA tax credits that further help people lower their premium payments and the recently-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not extend the credits either.

As partisan disputes boil, it’s still unclear how new federal law will impact Medicaid in Virginia

Relatedly, the OBBB includes forthcoming changes to hospital funding and Medicaid (another provision of ACA that helps insure pregnant people, children, those with disabilities and lower-income earners).

The Republican-led megabill fielded opposition from Democratic and some Republican federal lawmakers but ultimately passed and was signed by President Donald Trump on July 4. Republican dominance in Congress also threatens the renewal of the ACA tax credits that help people purchase insurance in state marketplaces, which Democrats have championed.

An Aetna spokeswoman did not directly respond when asked if Congress’ pending renewal or failure to renew ACA tax credits had anything to do with the decision. She did reiterate the same statement from the website that CVS remains “committed to helping members make the most of their benefits in 2025.”

An email forwarded to The Mercury by a reader with Aetna insurance outlines how clients will need to shop for a new insurer when the 2026 enrollment period opens in the fall.

“You will get more information and helpful guidance as open enrollment approaches,” the Aetna letter reads.

Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May. Since then, as Congress debated the OBBB, lawmakers and hospital professionals around the nation and in Virginia have expressed concerns about what shrinking health care coverage options might mean across all income brackets.

“As uninsured rates climb, so too will health care costs for everyone,” said U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.

Days after declaring victory in his administration’s push to cut regulatory red tape by 25%, Gov. Glenn Youngkin is now looking to artificial intelligence to help push that number even higher.

In an executive order issued Friday, Youngkin announced Virginia will launch the nation’s first “agentic AI” pilot program designed to streamline state regulations and guidance documents. The initiative will scan thousands of pages of agency rules using generative AI to identify redundancies, contradictions and overly complex language — all in the name of efficiency.

“We have made tremendous strides towards streamlining regulations and the regulatory process in the commonwealth,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Using emergent artificial intelligence tools, we will push this effort further in order to continue our mission of unleashing Virginia’s economy in a way that benefits all of its citizens.”

The move builds on the administration’s broader deregulation campaign, which this week marked a milestone by surpassing a 25% reduction in regulatory requirements across state government six months ahead of schedule. It’s unclear exactly which regulations have been shaved off, and Youngkin’s press officer hasn’t responded to questions about the methodology powering the process.

“The 25% was broken through, and I’m convinced we can get to 35,” Youngkin said Tuesday at an event in Richmond. “It’s about setting targets and hitting them — and then blowing through them and doing even more.”

The new AI pilot, officials say, is a first-of-its-kind effort at the state level. The technology will comb through existing regulations and guidance documents to flag conflicting language, suggest clearer phrasing, and help agencies that haven’t already met or exceeded the 25% reduction benchmark hit the mark. The administration says the tool will also empower agencies to conduct future reviews with greater ease.

“The ‘Virginia model’ for regulatory modernization has become the gold standard across the U.S., with other states and federal agencies looking to replicate our reforms,” said Reeve Bull, director of the Office of Regulatory Management.

A Youngkin spokesman told The Mercury on Friday that artificial intelligence has not played a role in reaching the initial 25% cut. But officials say the new pilot will “supercharge” the process — especially for agencies still struggling to hit the original target.

As of this week, Virginia agencies had eliminated 47.9% of the words in their guidance documents and streamlined 26.8% of the regulatory requirements on the books, the administration said in a news release, emphasizing that most agencies are on track to meet or exceed the 25% goal, while a handful may need an extra push — potentially from AI.

“The Office of Transformation continues to look for ways to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our state government,” said Chief Transformation Officer Rob Ward. “We look forward to working with our Office of Regulatory Management to apply the power of AI to our regulatory environment.”

Youngkin has tied the regulatory rollback to what he views as broader economic success in Virginia. At Tuesday’s event inside a sweltering Southside Richmond warehouse, he rattled off investment and job creation numbers alongside regulatory cuts — $120 billion in new business commitments, 270,000 new jobs, and 15,000 high-growth startups.

“Today is about results,” he told supporters and business leaders. “Today is about commitments kept. Today is about promises made — and a team of extraordinary individuals working together to keep those promises.”

The reform effort stems from Executive Order 19, signed in 2022, which launched a sweeping, government-wide audit of regulations, permitting practices, and guidance documents. That process has resulted in the streamlining or repeal of nearly 89,000 individual requirements, officials said.

Among the most visible impacts are regulatory timelines at the Department of Environmental Quality that have reportedly dropped by 65%, while the Virginia Department of Transportation has cut 20,000 regulatory items.

In housing, Youngkin said updated building code rules reduced the cost of constructing a new home by nearly 6%, saving homebuyers roughly $24,000. Brian Horn, at the time director of the Department of Housing and Community Development, led the charge on that front, streamlining more than 48,000 housing-related regulations.

Environmental regulations were also a target. Andrew Wheeler, former EPA chief under President Donald Trump and now a key architect of Virginia’s regulatory review system, said his office found that more than half of all regulations had been drafted by agencies without external review. He highlighted stormwater regulations as one area where the volume of rules was drastically reduced — from 23 inches of printed materials to just five.

Still, Youngkin has emphasized that the effort wasn’t about cutting corners. “We’re not saying all regs are bad,” he said. “What we’re saying is excess regulation is bad.”

To track agency progress, Youngkin told reporters that the administration has been using a color-coded dashboard — green for those ahead of schedule, yellow for those close behind, and red for laggards.

And as Virginia eyes a new 35% reduction target, the AI pilot is expected to help maintain momentum across the board, the administration said.

Federal funding to Planned Parenthood facilities in Virginia and across the nation are tied up in legal battles for the time being. A provision in Congress’ “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” signed by President Donald Trump last week would block Medicaid payments for services at facilities like Planned Parenthood for up to a year.

Planned Parenthood sued the Trump administration over the provision on Monday and a district court judge granted the organization a two-week restraining order against the federal government. On Friday, the Department of Justice called the judge’s order unlawful and asked for it to be withdrawn, saying the judge “didn’t follow procedure and should have given the government’s lawyers time to respond before ruling,” States Newsroom reported.

In the commonwealth, about 700 to 800 patients per month use Medicaid to pay for services, said RaeAnn Pickett, communications director for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia. The organization’s clinics serve around 25,000 patients overall per year at its facilities around the state, she said.

The next set of arguments in Planned Parenthood’s case will occur on July 21 and determine whether a longer pause will be granted. Meanwhile, The Guardian reported that some clinics in the country have posted notices on their websites alerting patients they can no longer accept Medicaid in order to comply with the law.

While the national organization has drawn ire from anti-abortion advocates and many Republicans over the years for ending pregnancies, that is just one of the health care services the group provides. Planned Parenthood clinics around the nation also offer cancer screenings, sexual health testing, contraception and breast exams.

The most recent data from 2023, Pickett said, shows that Virginia’s centers provided contraception to over 12,000 patients, conducted more than 12,000 sexually transmitted disease tests, performed nearly 1,300 breast exams and performed 705 cervical cancer screenings (which yielded 53 abnormal results, prompting patients to seek follow-up care).

“Every cancer that goes undetected, every STI that goes untreated, every patient who can’t get birth control or abortion care when they need it — all of it is on their hands,” Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia director Jamie Lockart said in a statement as Congress was passing the reconciliation bill.

Federal law has long prohibited Medicaid coverage from funding abortions, save for specific circumstances. The organization emphasizes that targeting Medicaid funding being used in its facilities will actually affect other components of reproductive health care that low-income families rely on.

“The Defund Provision is a naked attempt to leverage the government’s spending power to attack and penalize Planned Parenthood and impermissibly single it out for unfavorable treatment,” the organization said in the filing.

Earlier this year, three Planned Parenthood clinics in Virginia were affected by the Trump administration’s freeze on Title X funding — a decades-old federal program that helps extremely low income families access family planning care at little to no cost. That equaled about 11,000 Virginia patients who were subject to higher costs for care.

In states like Virginia without tight restrictions or bans on abortion, organizations like Planned Parenthood have been a critical access point for travelers seeking abortions.

Pickett said that close to 30% of abortions provided by Planned Parenthood are from out-of-state patients — meaning that about 3,000 people are traveling for care. Overall abortion providers in Virginia have reported a rise in out-of-state patients in recent years, as surrounding states have enacted restrictions or near-total bans on the procedure.

The “big beautiful bill” was passed by both chambers of Congress and last week, President Donald Trump signed it into law, triggering a countdown until sweeping changes to Medicaid take effect, including potential coverage loss for millions nationwide, financial strain to hospitals and new work requirements for Medicaid recipients. While the changes won’t kick in for more than a year, Virginia lawmakers are already preparing for the transformation of the state’s health care landscape.

It’s still unclear exactly how many Virginians could lose Medicaid coverage because final analyses from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) haven’t dropped yet. The uncertainty has left many wondering if they or loved ones will be impacted — and set the stage for partisan bickering.

Democrats have warned for weeks that over 322,000 Virginians could lose health insurance, based on a state-by-state breakdown from the U.S. Senate’s Joint Economic Committee and previous CBO estimates released as the bill made its way through Congress.

What happens to Medicaid in Virginia if massive federal bill to slash billions becomes law?

Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Tuesday that figure is “literally made up,” while other Republicans have pointed to a 7-year-old state study, conducted before Virginia expanded its Medicaid program in 2018, to claim far fewer would be booted from Medicaid.

Clearer understandings of just what will happen to Medicaid in Virginia and other states may be best found in future OMB reports but its most recent estimates found 10.8 million Americans nationwide could lose insurance as a result of the bill.

‘A moving target’

The bill’s rapid race over the finish line, from the House to the Senate to Trump’s desk in a span of mere weeks, could be the root of confusion about its full impact concerning health care, and lawmakers’ differing interpretations. Analysts and organizations tracking the legislation also tried to keep pace.

While the CBO was able to do further analysis on the House version of the bill earlier in the summer, the shortened timeline for the Senate version before passage, paired with a federal holiday has contributed to a lack of final analysis.

Freddy Mejia, a policy director with The Commonwealth Institute, noted the whiplash lawmakers and analysts experienced trying to keep track of the House and Senate versions of the OBBB.

The impact between the two different bills is “kind of a bit of a moving target,” he said.

He plans to keep an eye out for further reports from CBO now that OBBB has fully passed.

On a national scale, Democrats have stressed that the number of Americans facing the loss of their Medicaid coverage could be close to 17 million. This, a CBO spokesperson said, is because the office created another analysis with provisions that weren’t in the bill that passed, but which could also have an effect: expiration of ACA premium tax credits and a proposed Health and Human Services rule for marketplaces.

Beyond just health insurance, CBO estimated that in general, resources would decrease for lower-income households while increasing for middle class and higher-income households. That supposition, however, stems from the House version of the bill, supported by Virginia Republican U.S. Reps. Jen Kiggans of Virginia Beach and Rob Wittman of Westmoreland, which did not become law. Fresh CBO review could reveal how people in different income brackets will fare with the new law overall.

Old data, new frustrations

State Republicans’ allegations that Democrats’ Medicaid coverage loss estimations were inflated first circulated as the big beautiful bill wound through congress. This week, the debate came to a head with Youngkin accusing Democrats of “extreme assumptions” at an event announcing a slate of regulatory reductions on Tuesday.

“The number that Democrats are throwing around on Virginians who will lose their health coverage is made up,” Youngkin said Tuesday while talking with the media at the event. “They choose extreme assumptions in every measure.”

It’s unclear what data Youngkin is using to refute Virginia Democrats’ Medicaid loss estimates and members of his staff did not respond when asked.

Meanwhile, Republicans in Virginia’s House of Delegates have cited n a 2018 study from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC). Garren Shipley, a communications staffer for the House Republican Caucus, shared the study with emphasis that the party doesn’t believe mass disenrollment would happen because of Congress’ bill.

Like CBO, JLARC is a nonpartisan research entity in state government that lawmakers often tap to study various issues. The 2018 JLARC study Shipley referenced came the same year Virginia expanded its Medicaid program.

At the time, JLARC estimated that about 32% of Virginia’s Medicaid expansion population would be subject to work requirements and 7% would be deterred from enrolling or leaving the program due to the requirements.

As the JLARC study is over seven years old, it’s likely some of its estimations are no longer relevant or accurate. What is certain, however, is that changes to Medicaid requirements and hospital funding mechanisms are on the horizon.

Work requirements, risk to hospitals

Youngkin also framed the work requirements as an important part of Medicaid reform. It’s something state lawmakers had initially considered when expanding the program seven years ago. The new law will require those receiving Medicaid benefits to maintain full-time employment subject to twice-yearly verification, which some lawmakers and advocates say are either unnecessary because many recipients already work, or needlessly burdensome to those living with a disability.

“Redetermination is a really important process,” he said. “It asks us to redetermine every six months, and that gives us a chance to assess who’s gotten a job, (and) who hasn’t complied with the work requirements.”

Youngkin emphasized how Medicaid is supposed to ensure that the “deeply impoverished,” mothers, and children have health insurance rather than able-bodied people “who can get a job and have simply chosen not to.”

Most Medicaid recipients do work, though some like Richmond-area resident Andrew Daughtry, currently do not. A construction worker, he’s tapped into Medicaid for surgeries to recover from an injury that’s left him temporarily unable to work. Earlier this summer he said that it felt “insulting” to have his work ethic questioned.

The twice-yearly employment verification is meant to kick people off their insurance if they aren’t able to keep their jobs while the phase-down of Medicaid provider taxes and state-directed payments are also meant to curb costs for the federal government.

But hospitals warn of heightened chances for closures — particularly in rural areas —- or trimming of offered services and staff. Several hospitals in Southwest and South Side Virginia had already closed obstetrics units, for example, prior to the new congressional bill.

Virginia’s state budget will fund OB-GYN medical residencies amid obstetrics closures

Julian Walker, spokesman for the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association, reflected on the intent of the Affordable Care Act — a hallmark law of Democrat Barack Obama’s presidency that allowed states to expand their Medicaid eligibility to provide health care to more people to begin with. The law was about keeping people insured and healthy in order to keep everyone’s bills down.

“The impact is not exclusive to the Medicaid population,” Walker said. “It has ripple effects.”

He noted that uninsured people are likely at or closer to poverty levels than insured people. Without health coverage, they’re more likely to put off preventative care or seek treatment for conditions until emergencies arise.

Walker said people’s conditions are likely to be worse by then — requiring more resources between staff, medications, treatments and length of stay in a hospital. Longer stays mean less available beds for others, regardless of Medicaid status.

Ballad Health CEO Alan Levine, remained vocal on social media throughout the reconciliation process to warn that some hospitals would be strained and likely to close. Sometimes, he tagged Virginia’s congressional Republicans, whose districts include rural hospitals and sizable amounts of Medicaid patients.

Hospitals are also federally required to provide care regardless of whether someone can pay their bills or not, so they absorb that cost while also trying to offset it. As hospitals periodically negotiate with private health insurers, Walker said rates will likely go up for employers and employees with private insurance.

“Different constituencies may feel the impacts differently,” Walker said. “Some more than others — but this has potential to have much more far-reaching implications.”

In the wake of deadly flooding in central Texas and New Mexico that claimed over 100 lives with nearly 200 still missing, scrutiny of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which provides disaster recovery services and funding, has mounted.

Before the floods, the federal government had announced plans to eliminate or remake the agency and is now reviewing its procedures, funding, and execution of agency missions, a process in which Virginia’s governor is taking an active role.

Virginia agencies assist Texas flood recovery, share how state prepares for dangerous weather events

As part of an executive order from President Donald Trump, the FEMA Review Council is analyzing the emergency response agency for potential changes or reductions. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin was appointed to the council and now serves on a subcommittee that will report on the roles of localities and other agencies outside of FEMA when it comes to disaster response.

The goal is to create better communication and to put more of the recovery responsibilities on the shoulders of the states.

“We will be receiving inputs from governors, from local leaders, from emergency response personnel, and, of course, from the review council itself,” Youngkin said. “I think we will be able to chart a very clear delineation of the way things work today,” Youngkin added, noting the “deep challenges” of FEMA’s current system and the group’s goal to “shift responsibility to the states and therefore move FEMA from being a supplant role into a support role.”

Traditionally before disasters, FEMA promotes emergency preparedness and provides the National Flood Insurance Program. They also help stage resources in areas where a known storm such as a hurricane is headed towards.

During an event that received a presidential disaster declaration, the agency helps provide recovery centers to disseminate resources as well as funding application locations across the affected areas. The agency works with local and state resources to aid affected communities in the immediate and long-term aftermath of a disaster.

Following Hurricane Helene last year, Virginia was awarded over $18 million from FEMA for individual and household programs. However, low-income families did not often meet the threshold for FEMA funding, leaving them in the lurch when trying to build back their lives. The agency has drawn the ire of Trump and other Republicans, despite some analysts and state officials framing FEMA as a critical resource whose assistance states would likely not be able to replicate on their own.

“Despite obligating nearly $30 billion in disaster aid each of the past three years, FEMA has managed to leave vulnerable Americans without the resources or support they need when they need it most,” Trump said in his executive order establishing the review council.

Youngkin said in his statements to the council on Wednesday that during the response to devastating flooding it was unclear what FEMA would provide in addition to other federal agencies.

“How do we move forward with haste in order to meet our citizens’ needs when we don’t really even know how much the resources are going to be to provide the answers to the basic needs of housing, food, and recovery. This is the work that we are undertaking,” Youngkin said.

FEMA has had to deal with a growing number of high-dollar disasters across the country leading to strained services and slower response times. That is on top of reductions in funding from the federal government under the second Trump administration, which have impacted flood resiliency projects, National Weather Service staffing, and other programs in Virginia.

As mandated by the executive order, the council’s final report will include a review of FEMA’s disaster response in the last four years, comparing FEMA’s response to how local and state agencies responded to the same disasters, what programs were in place before FEMA, and how the agency can be more of a support than the main response to disasters.

The order does not explicitly state when a final report is due, and a date wasn’t mentioned in Wednesday’s meeting, but the council is only ordered to exist for one year.

The newly formed joint commission tasked with overseeing Virginia’s transition to a legal retail cannabis market held its inaugural meeting in Richmond Wednesday, launching what lawmakers described as the next chapter in the commonwealth’s winding path toward a regulated marijuana industry.

Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, who sponsored the House resolution creating the commission earlier this year, was elected chair during the meeting at the state Capitol. While no other formal action was taken, the panel laid out its mission and signaled it would use previously vetoed legislation as a foundation to craft a new proposal for 2026 — when Virginia will have a new governor.

“Our goal is to create a successful approach to cannabis that’s rooted in protecting the public, the principles of restorative justice, economic equity and public health,” Krizek said in his opening remarks.

“The need is to regulate, control, and tax marijuana, to generate significant revenue dedicated to community reinvestment, create hundreds of new, small local businesses, strengthen Virginia’s vital agricultural sector, and end the racially disparate impacts of prohibition.”

The commission, which was established through House Joint Resolution 497 without needing the governor’s signature, is set to operate through July 1, 2028. It will serve as a forum for public engagement and legislative planning, aiming to build consensus on cannabis policy amid shifting political dynamics in the state.

Krizek noted that although the effort to legalize retail cannabis has faced repeated setbacks — most notably from Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s vetoes — the groundwork is already in place.

“We’ve already been pretty successful,” he said. “We’ve made some big progress, and this will be the final capstone on that progress.”

A blueprint already written

In March, Youngkin vetoed House Bill 2485 — legislation sponsored by Krizek and backed by lawmakers from both parties that would have established the framework for a licensed and taxed cannabis market. The identical Senate version, sponsored by Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, passed with bipartisan support as well.

The legislation would have authorized adult-use retail sales starting May 1, 2026, with licenses for cultivation, processing, testing, and retail set to be issued as early as September 2025. It included a microbusiness license tier aimed at lowering entry barriers for historically disadvantaged entrepreneurs and implemented a seed-to-sale tracking system to monitor all commercial activity.

Youngkin’s vetoes take another hit on cannabis reform in Virginia

A projected $87.8 million in annual tax revenue by 2031 was to be allocated across public priorities: 40% for early childhood education, 30% for equity reinvestment, 25% for substance use treatment and 5% for public health.

But Youngkin rejected the measure, saying it would endanger public safety and contribute to negative social outcomes, including “increased gang activity,” impaired road safety, and “adverse effects on children’s and adolescents’ health.” He argued the bill would not eliminate illegal sales or guarantee product safety.

Youngkin also vetoed related bills, including proposals to expunge or reduce sentences for marijuana-related offenses, and a bill to prevent legal cannabis use from being used against parents in child custody cases. Reform advocates decried the vetoes as a continuation of policies that ignore the realities of marijuana use in Virginia.

Legal, but still in the shadows

Virginia made headlines in 2021 as the first Southern state to legalize small-scale possession and home cultivation of cannabis. But despite legalization, no retail infrastructure was ever implemented, leaving the state in a legal limbo. Cannabis remains readily available — just not regulated, tested, or taxed.

“We know that marijuana is being sold in this commonwealth,” said Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, who helped legalize personal possession and now sits on the commission. “And thanks to Governor Youngkin’s veto pen, the way it’s being sold is with illegal, un-taxed enterprises outside of the medical program.”

Ebbin urged fellow commission members to keep the big picture in mind.

“My goal is to move sales away from the illegal market on the street corner to behind an age-verified counter with tested products, and I think that’s a goal that most of the members of this commission share,” he said.

Voices from the public

During Wednesday’s meeting, advocates, growers, wellness professionals, and business leaders addressed the commission in a public comment session that highlighted the wide-ranging hopes — and frustrations — of those awaiting a regulated market.

Chelsea Higgs Wise, founder of Marijuana Justice, praised the commission for opening a space for dialogue but urged members to stay grounded in the equity framework laid out in the state’s original adult-use blueprint.

“The 2020 JLARC report was key to be lifted,” she said, referring to the legislative audit report that called for an equitable cannabis market.

“From the public comments, it appears Virginians are unified on wanting broad inclusion within the market versus only benefiting a well-resourced few. There is still much work to be done and we are confident the commission will take this seriously,” she added.

Jason Blanchette, president of the Virginia Cannabis Association, pointed out that the core elements of the legislation have already passed twice — just not survived Youngkin’s vetoes.

“So obviously our hope in representing small Virginia businesses and small farmers … is that we can all come to an agreement at some point here, right?” he said.

That hope was echoed by Thelonius Cook, a farmer on the Eastern Shore and president of the Mid-Atlantic Black Farmers Caucus.

“I’m here to represent the voice of small farmers, and in particular, Black farmers,” Cook said. “Had it not been for the enslaved labor of Africans producing tobacco and the plantations of Virginia, this colony would have not survived, let alone went on to become America. We want to make sure we have an opportunity to participate in this agricultural revolution.”

Jabria Craft, a cannabis wellness coach from Richmond, spoke passionately about moving beyond product hype and fear-based regulation.

“My platform is rooted in helping people build sustainable and informed relationships with this plant,” she said. “Education is either nonexistent or filled with shame at risks, instead of benefits and support. I would like to see Virginia cannabis as an industry that’s centered in education, intention, and equity… and that us Black and brown and queer folks aren’t left behind on a system that was built on their backs.”

A policy puzzle with political stakes

While Democrats are banking on winning back the governor’s mansion in November — with former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger as their nominee — the cannabis debate remains far from settled. The commission’s task now is to rework and refine the blueprint for legislation that can be enacted under new leadership.

Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery, a local prosecutor and one of two House Republicans who supported Krizek’s retail bill earlier this year, has publicly advocated for a pragmatic approach to cannabis reform.

“I have been an advocate for common-sense legislation to regulate the adult cannabis market in Virginia,” Obenshain told The Mercury in March.

“I’ll continue working in a bipartisan fashion until we find the right balance on legislation that can keep Virginians safe while also eliminating the confusing legal regime and proliferation of potentially dangerous products that currently exists.”

Yet Youngkin has remained firm in his opposition. His administration warned that legal cannabis use could harm children, deteriorate mental health outcomes, and worsen public safety — claims many advocates reject as overblown or unfounded.

One of the bills Youngkin vetoed, HB 2555 by Del. Rozia Henson, D-Woodbridge, would have allowed incarcerated individuals with marijuana-related felonies before 2021 to seek sentence modifications. The governor said that could apply to people convicted of more serious drug offenses, including fentanyl trafficking, and impose “undue burdens” on courts and victims.

Another vetoed measure, HB 2613 by Del. Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, aimed to prevent courts from using legal cannabis consumption against parents in custody or visitation decisions.

Youngkin argued the bill could “risk exposing children to harm.”

The road ahead

As the commission begins its work, members say they will focus on listening to the public, gathering expert input and refining a proposal that can finally bring structure to Virginia’s cannabis landscape.

Krizek said public engagement would be a top priority in the first year. “The idea will be to craft the best bill possible to reintroduce next session,” he said. “So you know it’s a priority of mine.”

Though the governor’s mansion has served as a roadblock so far, Democrats hope the upcoming election — and a shift in executive leadership — will provide the opening they need to bring a legal retail cannabis system to fruition.

Until then, the panel has its work cut out for it. It is set to meet next on Aug. 20.

After years of inconsistencies and complaints, Virginia has moved closer to revising its process for reporting issues with special education services, aiming to improve the structure and ensure that families receive the necessary services for their students with disabilities.

The issues with the state’s dispute resolution system — an impartial procedure for parents and schools to resolve disagreements over issues with special education services — have created a divide among parents and public school leaders for at least the past five years.

As federal law states, Virginia is required to provide all students with disabilities a “free and appropriate public education” through personalized plans under the Individualized Education Program. Last year, Virginia recorded over 185,000 students receiving special education services during the 2024-25 school year.

Wendy Little, a parent advocating for her son who is autistic, spoke on Monday to the state’s dispute resolution system advisory group as it reviewed a study with findings about the existing system and recommendations for bettering it. Her son’s story was a key inspiration for the formation of the advisory committee through successful legislation to address the system. She called for an overhaul of the current system to resolve problems special needs families face concerning their children’s education.

“There is no resolution,” Little said. “It’s a dispute to the parents and you get nowhere. It’s not only broken, it is completely corrupt.”

A history of noncompliance

The system, which has been studied for the past five years, has been criticized by parents and advocacy groups for failing to monitor and respond to complaints raised by families. The situation reached a critical point when the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) was investigated by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, which looked into why the agency had failed to resolve complaints.

“The time for continued study should end, and focus should turn to implementing the many reforms that have been offered throughout the years, and in this study,” said Deusdedi Merced, managing member for Special Education Solutions, LLC, which conducted the July 1 study. “The time to address the concerns of many is now. Only then will the full breadth of the protections afforded to students with disabilities on the (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) will be realized.”

The report’s findings highlighted that dispute hearing officers did not meet standard legal practices. It also noted a public perception that VDOE has not effectively enforced the outcomes of investigations related to state complaint orders.

The findings align with a 2020 study conducted by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC), which analyzes and provides oversight of state agencies on behalf of the General Assembly, regarding K-12 Special Education.

In that report, researchers identified significant shortcomings in the state’s provision of special education services, including low-quality Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) — customized learning plans for student’s disabilities — a lack of knowledge among educators about how to effectively support students with disabilities, and shortfalls in VDOE’s oversight of local divisions.

JLARC’s study also found that the VDOE does not require school divisions to carry out corrective actions that fully and appropriately remedy instances of noncompliance.

The state education agency began turning things around starting with the Board of Education updating Virginia’s regulations on due process on March 28, 2024. Last December, the Office for Civil Rights wrote a letter closing its findings and requirements against VDOE.

Next steps

Some of the draft recommendations the advisory group will be voting on to improve the system include training for all stakeholders compared to a select few, expanding data collection and improving special education mediation.

Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, chair of the Virginia Commission on Youth, said she hopes the draft recommendations will provide more standardization of the IEP process, better training across the system for the mediators and the hearing officers, and increased clarity and support for parents. Favola, along with Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, carried legislation to overhaul special education in 2024.

“We’re trying to bolster the system in a way that makes it more responsive to the parents and ensures a certain amount of quality across the state and I think that’s going to be the message in the report that we go forward with,” Favola said.

But some committee members, including Favola, expressed concern about whether the recommendations could be met, considering the threat to resources and programs posed by federal funding cuts. VDOE Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson said the agency will provide details about some of the cost impacts to special education at a future meeting.

The advisory group invited comments from the public, some of whom urged the committee to consider recommending a $10,000 cap on awards for parents, schools and hearing officers to reduce litigation costs. They also recommended better enforcement of federal laws, which includes the potential loss of licenses for non-compliance, and consistency across all divisions.

Kandise Lucas, an academic civil rights advocate, and parents also raised concerns about the mistrust the public has in Virginia’s public schools due to inconsistent eligibility determinations for students with disabilities and inadequate training across divisions.

“IDEA is a civil rights law that was created to make sure that children with disabilities are not marginalized; are not thrown away,” Lucas said.

The advisory committee’s draft recommendations will be presented to the Virginia Commission on Youth on Sept. 3, and will be open for public comment until October 15. The commission will vote on these recommendations during its meeting on Oct. 21.

TD Cowen analysts say food-industry megamergers haven't worked

With Kraft Heinz Co. reportedly considering a breakup of its business, some analysts believe more of its food-industry peers should do the same.

TD Cowen analyst Robert Moskow, in a research note on Monday, said the company's (KHC) potential split underscores his view that megamergers in the food industry often haven't worked out. He added that companies that focused more deeply on specific products did better than those aiming for a wider range of offerings.

""The skill set and investment requirements to succeed in disparate parts of the grocery store (e.g. refrigerated, frozen, shelf-stable and snacks) tend to differ,"" he wrote.

Moskow added: ""We believe that food companies with focused portfolios and category leadership (e.g. Hershey (HSY)) have a better chance of long-term success than diversified companies trying to leverage operating and marketing capabilities across a wide range of categories.""

Moskow made the remarks after the Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that Kraft Heinz was planning to spin off a big portion of its grocery segment, including many Kraft items. Another company would oversee sauces and spreads, the Journal said.

In response, Kraft Heinz - which sells Kraft Mac & Cheese, Heinz Ketchup, Oscar Mayer meats, Philadelphia Cream Cheese and other products - said it has ""been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value,"" but didn't comment further. Shares were up more than 2% on Monday.

Kraft and Heinz merged in 2015, in a deal coordinated by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A) (BRK.B) and private-equity firm 3G Capital Partners. But the combined company has since faced competition, including from higher-end brands, as well as the rising popularity of options geared toward health-conscious consumers. Meanwhile, GLP-1 weight-loss drugs have also reshaped how some people think about their diets.

Moskow, in a note from April, said that the big food companies whose products line most grocery-store shelves raised their prices too much through the pandemic, while sacrificing quality and opportunities to offer more ""premium"" fare.

In Monday's note, he called out other companies that might be better off separating or otherwise shuffling around the brands they already own. He said he would rather see more of that reshuffling than mergers to rein in costs.

""PepsiCo (PEP) and Campbell's (CPB) strike us as the companies with the best opportunity to create value by splitting up,"" he wrote. ""Utz Brands (UTZ) would be a good combination with Campbell's Snacks, in our opinion. Clorox's (CLX) Hidden Valley Ranch brand belongs in the hands of a food company, not a bleach company from our perspective.""

""Conagra (CAG) and General Mills (GIS) both need to continue to shed brands, in our view,"" he added. ""Perhaps there is more news to come on these fronts.""

Elsewhere in the food industry, privately owned Mars Inc. wants to buy Kellanova (K), which owns snack foods like Cheez-Its, Pringles and Pop Tarts. In 2023, Kellanova, which was formerly known as Kellogg, broke off its North American cereal business into WK Kellogg Co. (KLG) This month, WK Kellogg - which makes Corn Flakes and Froot Loops - agreed to be acquired by Ferrero, which makes Ferrero Rocher candies and Nutella.

CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram on Monday also said more food companies could follow in Kraft Heinz's path, assuming a separation occurs.

""Given ongoing sales softness and lackluster equity valuations across the industry, more packaged-food companies may pursue similar strategies to accelerate value creation, especially given limited visibility into when volume sales will return to growth,"" he said.

""While high prices remain a key factor behind the ongoing volume softness, other forces may be at play as well, including the impact of weight-loss drugs (e.g., GLP-1s) and a broader consumer shift toward healthier food choices,"" he continued.

ID31,Polaris,2025-07-14 18:48:07+00:00,Chicago Tribune,This Minnesota recycled aluminum plant will help stem tariff costs - Chicago Tribune,Star Tribune,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/07/14/minnesota-recycled-aluminum/,"ROSEMOUNT, Minnesota — With its new $71 million expansion, EGA Spectro Alloys in this southern suburb of the Twin Cities becomes one of only about 40 plants in the U.S. that can make recycled aluminum billets.
We are in a really good position,” said EGA Spectro Alloys President Luke Palen.
“With this expansion, we will make 120 million pounds a year of high-quality, recycled billet,” said Palen, who said it also helps companies meet environmental goals.
With the new billet plant, Minnesota will no longer have to send all of its curbside-collected aluminum-can scrap to other states for processing.
Some of Spectro’s billet alloy recipes will allow for some old cans, in addition to the usual industrial aluminum scrap.","ROSEMOUNT, Minnesota — With its new $71 million expansion, EGA Spectro Alloys in this southern suburb of the Twin Cities becomes one of only about 40 plants in the U.S. that can make recycled aluminum billets.

Think 25-foot-long poles of solid aluminum.

The 90,000-square-foot plant gives companies a needed domestic source for the much-in-demand billets at a time when most aluminum in the U.S. is imported and faces a 50% tariff set in June by President Donald Trump.

At the same time, it becomes a much bigger buyer of industrial metal scrap, a new buyer in Minnesota for recycled beer and pop cans and gives Spectro Alloys its first new product line in 53 years.

“So there’s a lot of demand. We are in a really good position,” said EGA Spectro Alloys President Luke Palen.

Because aluminum is used in everything from cars and fighter jets to food containers and America’s ever-expanding energy grid, U.S. demand “approached near record levels in 2024,” said Aluminum Association spokesperson Katie Rosebrook.

Spectro Alloy employs about 150 workers in its original aluminum recycling plant, which makes 28-pound bricks, called ingots, that eventually become parts for Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Polaris ATVs and products made by companies like General Motors, Tesla, Black & Decker and Caterpillar.

The company, which is majority owned by Emirates Global Aluminum in the United Arab Emirates, now is scrambling to add 50 new workers and expects the new billet operation to boost business by 50%, Palen said.

“Their investment (of) $71 million and creating 50 new jobs for the area is a huge impact for us,” said Adam Kienberger, community development director for Rosemount.

The first molten metal recently glided from one new three-story furnace, oozed down chutes and spilled into 26-foot casting cylinders, deep in the floor of the expansion.

Three new rumbling furnaces came from Austria.

Once they had cooled, crane operator Lorenzo Martinez gingerly hoisted 10 billets from the “vertical casting pit” and onto a giant conveyor belt. The load weighed nearly 18,000 pounds.

The billets will be marketed under the RevivAL brand name, a nod to the fact the aluminum came from 250 recyclers.

“With this expansion, we will make 120 million pounds a year of high-quality, recycled billet,” said Palen, who said it also helps companies meet environmental goals. “It will … contribute to a circular economy in our region and throughout the U.S.”

Customers are already lined up for the billets, which will be used to build door frames, stair railings and boat docks besides auto parts and more.

Last week, the first truck load shipped to Crown Extrusions in Chaska, which is working with a dock maker.

The company plans to add more equipment so it can produce other products such as sheet metal alloys.

Since selling 80% of the company to EGA last year, the Palens have sent engineers, technicians, chemists and metallurgists to Abu Dhabi for billet training.

With the new billet plant, Minnesota will no longer have to send all of its curbside-collected aluminum-can scrap to other states for processing. Some of Spectro’s billet alloy recipes will allow for some old cans, in addition to the usual industrial aluminum scrap.

“This is exciting, because it’s not only going to increase the aluminum that’s recycled overall, but it’s the first local outlet for aluminum cans in Minnesota, at least that I’m aware of,” said Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) spokesman Mark Rust. “It is critically important that people understand there’s a reason to recycle. These products really do have value. The more material that enters the market, that adds value to Minnesota’s economy.”

Gwen Jenkins, MPCA’s recycling and organics specialist, said she hopes Spectro’s ability to use additional types of aluminum scrap will remind and encourage Minnesotans to recycle more.

Right now, Minnesotans recycle just 51% of aluminum beverage cans or about 14,000 tons a year, she said.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CTC-Z-Minnesota-recycled-aluminum-01.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-07-14 16:09:21.917397

The Seattle-based company said that all corporate “people leaders” must be based in either Seattle or Toronto within 12 months. That is a change from February, when it required vice presidents to relocate to Seattle or Toronto.

Starbucks said individual employees working under those leaders would not be asked to relocate. But the company said all hiring for future roles and lateral moves will require employees to be based in Seattle or Toronto.

“We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we’re together. We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster,” Niccol wrote in the letter.

Niccol said affected workers who choose not to relocate will be eligible for a one-time voluntary exit program with a cash payment.

While many workers grew to enjoy working from home during the pandemic, the call for workers to return to offices full-time has been growing over the past year. Major employers such as Amazon, AT&T and the federal government have required employees to work in company sites five days per week. Competition for fully-remote jobs is fierce.

Starbucks spokeswoman Lori Torgerson said she didn’t have a count of employees who are currently working as “people leaders” or are working remotely. Starbucks has 16,000 corporate support employees worldwide, but that includes coffee roasters and warehouse staff.

Niccol was not required to relocate to Seattle when he was hired to lead Starbucks last August. Instead, the company said it would help him set up an office near his home in Newport Beach, California, and would give him the use of a corporate jet to commute to Seattle.

Since then, Niccol has bought a home in Seattle and is frequently seen at the company’s headquarters, Torgerson said.

Starting next year, Aetna clients in Virginia and other states will no longer be able to purchase individual or family health insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace. Congress also created associated tax credits that have helped some offset those costs even further. Over 261,000 people in Virginia have Aetna healthcare, according to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services and the soon-to-be extinguished plans cover nearly 5,000 enrollees, as of January of this year.

Aetna is under the CVS umbrella and has participated in the ACA marketplace. Recipients have received emails this summer alerting them of the forthcoming change and the company website outlines it as well.

“As we considered plan options for the future, it became clear we would not be able to provide the same level of value we’ve offered in prior years,” the health insurer’s website stated.

Both the online statement and a request for comment from CVS Health did not clarify what made it “clear” the company felt the need to withdraw, but the shifting federal health care policy landscape could be part of the equation.

Congress has yet to renew ACA tax credits that further help people lower their premium payments and the recently-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not extend the credits either.

Relatedly, the OBBB includes forthcoming changes to hospital funding and Medicaid (another provision of ACA that helps insure pregnant people, children, those with disabilities and lower-income earners).

The Republican-led megabill fielded opposition from Democratic and some Republican federal lawmakers but ultimately passed and was signed by President Donald Trump on July 4. Republican dominance in Congress also threatens the renewal of the ACA tax credits that help people purchase insurance in state marketplaces, which Democrats have championed.

An Aetna spokeswoman did not directly respond when asked if Congress’ pending renewal or failure to renew ACA tax credits had anything to do with the decision. She did reiterate the same statement from the website that CVS remains “committed to helping members make the most of their benefits in 2025.”

An email forwarded to The Mercury by a reader with Aetna insurance outlines how clients will need to shop for a new insurer when the 2026 enrollment period opens in the fall.

“You will get more information and helpful guidance as open enrollment approaches,” the Aetna letter reads.

Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May. Since then, as Congress debated the OBBB, lawmakers and hospital professionals around the nation and in Virginia have expressed concerns about what shrinking health care coverage options might mean across all income brackets.

“As uninsured rates climb, so too will health care costs for everyone,” said U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.

A recent study published in Health Affairs Scholar found that payer-operated primary care practices accounted for 4.2% of Medicare primary care services in 2023, up from 0.78% in 2016. Although this payer-provider integration varied significantly by area.

Still, payer-operated practices were the dominant source of primary care in some counties. Overall, 15.1% of the U.S. population lived in counties where payers controlled over 10% of the primary care market by 2023.

Primary care services delivered by payer-operated practices were also especially salient in Medicare Advantage, or MA, at 5.73% nationally, compared to 1.84% in Traditional Medicare.

MA penetration was one of the market characteristics associated with the local level of payer operation of primary care practices, according to the study. In 2022, payers operated 5.5% of the primary care market in counties with above-average MA penetration of over 49% compared to just 1.5% in counties with below-average MA penetration.

The finding suggests that payers are more likely to integrate with primary care practices where MA is more popular, the study's researchers said.

Conversely, payers operated fewer primary care practices in areas where hospital market concentration was high, indicating an unwillingness or constrained ability of payers to own primary care practices in areas with major hospitals.

Payer entry into primary care was also significantly less common in counties with highly concentrated payer markets for employer-sponsored insurance.

Additionally, the study found that Optum, part of UnitedHealth Group, controlled the most primary care services delivered by payer-operated practices.

The study showed that Optum controlled 2.71% of the national primary care market by service volume in 2023. In some counties, though, Optum controlled substantially more of the market, with 10.1% of the U.S. population residing in counties where payers controlled over 10% of the primary care market.

Optum's market concentration was over 40% in several counties, including Snohomish County, Washington, where it was 44.9%, Contra Costa County, California, where it was 40.1% and Clark County, Nevada, where it was 35.8%.

Other payers analyzed in the study included Humana, Aetna-CVS Health, Elevance and Cigna.

This vertical integration of payers and providers could improve care coordination, chronic disease management and value-based care adoption, according to the study's researchers. However, increasing consolidation among payers and primary care providers, in particular, raises serious concerns about competition and access to care, they added.

""One concern is that payer-owned physician practices may be used to optimize risk adjustment coding, increasing government payments to their own MA plans without necessarily improving patient care,"" they explained in the study. ""Vertical integration could also give insurers an advantage over competing health plans by steering patients toward their own services or making it harder for other insurers to contract with their physician groups.""

Consolidation could also lead to higher prices or fewer choices for patients if payer ownership of physician practices leads to less competition in physician markets, they added.

These concerns have prompted regulatory scrutiny, antitrust investigations and increased calls for market transparency. Notably, former UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty testified in front of Congress, receiving criticism about the company's alleged monopolistic activities. Witty reported during the hearing that Optum alone employs about 10,000 physicians, or about 1% of all U.S. physicians, while affiliates employ another 80,000 physicians.",https://www.techtarget.com/visuals/ComputerWeekly/Hero Images/healthcare-medical-statistics-stethoscope-adobe.jpeg,N,,2025-07-14 15:08:55.333045

In a letter to employees posted on Monday, Starbucks Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol said corporate employees would need to be in the office four days a week starting in early October instead of three days a week.

The Seattle-based company said that all corporate “people leaders” must be based in either Seattle or Toronto within 12 months. That is a change from February, when it required vice presidents to relocate to Seattle or Toronto.

Starbucks said individual employees working under those leaders would not be asked to relocate. But the company said all hiring for future roles and lateral moves will require employees to be based in Seattle or Toronto.

“We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we’re together. We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster,” Niccol wrote in the letter.

Niccol said affected workers who choose not to relocate will be eligible for a one-time voluntary exit program with a cash payment.

While many workers grew to enjoy working from home during the pandemic, the call for workers to return to offices full-time has been growing over the past year. Major employers such as Amazon, AT&T and the federal government have required employees to work in company sites five days per week. Competition for fully-remote jobs is fierce.

Starbucks spokeswoman Lori Torgerson said she didn’t have a count of employees who are currently working as “people leaders” or are working remotely. Starbucks has 16,000 corporate support employees worldwide, but that includes coffee roasters and warehouse staff.

Niccol was not required to relocate to Seattle when he was hired to lead Starbucks last August. Instead, the company said it would help him set up an office near his home in Newport Beach, California, and would give him the use of a corporate jet to commute to Seattle.

Since then, Niccol has bought a home in Seattle and is frequently seen at the company’s headquarters, Torgerson said.

Niccol and Starbucks have spent the last several months trying to improve sales at the coffee chain. Their efforts have ranged from changing Starbucks' bathroom policy to increasing staffing at stores to improve service.

Niccol said during Starbucks' last earnings report in April that the company's results haven't improved yet. Sales for that quarter slipped 1%.

Final Stance: - Hold ELV if you believe Carelon's expansion and MA growth can offset margin pressures.
Until margin pressures ease or Medicaid membership stabilizes, the stock may underperform peers in this cost-driven healthcare landscape.","The healthcare sector continues to grapple with evolving regulatory pressures, shifting member demographics, and escalating operational costs. Elevance Health (ELV), a major player in health insurance and care delivery, faces a pivotal moment as it reports Q2 2025 earnings on July 17. While revenue growth remains robust, profit margins are under siege from rising benefit costs, digital investments, and Medicaid membership declines. This article dissects whether ELV's valuation holds up amid these headwinds or if investors should pivot to peers like CVS (CVS) or Boston Scientific (BSX), which exhibit stronger beat probabilities.

Revenue Growth: A Closer Look at Sustaining Momentum

Elevance's Q2 2025 revenue is projected to rise 11.4% YoY to $48.13 billion, driven by strategic acquisitions (e.g., CarelonRx) and premium growth in commercial individual plans. The Carelon division, which includes pharmacy and home health services, is a standout performer, with operating income up 14.1% YoY. However, this growth comes at a cost:

Benefit Expenses Surge: The medical cost ratio (benefit expenses/revenue) is expected to hit 88.4%, up from 86.3% in Q2 **2024. This reflects higher utilization of care and inflationary pressures in areas like prescription drugs and home health.

Operational Overhaul Costs: Investments in digital infrastructure and interest expenses are pushing total operational costs up ~11% YoY, compressing margins.

Membership Dynamics: Medicaid membership dropped 135,000 due to post-pandemic eligibility redeterminations, but Medicare Advantage (MA) membership grew 12.4% YoY in Q1 2025.

Margin Pressures: Why the EPS Estimate Faces Headwinds

The consensus EPS estimate of $9.20 (down 9.1% YoY) hinges on managing these costs. Key risks:

- Benefit Ratio Volatility: A 1% increase in the benefit ratio could reduce EPS by ~$0.37, given ELV's scale.

- Health Benefits Segment Slump: Operating income here is projected to fall 12.4% YoY, reflecting Medicaid declines and margin pressures.

- Competitor Outperformance: Peers like CVS (Earnings ESP +2.06%) and BSX (Earnings ESP +0.88%) have stronger beat probabilities, as highlighted by Zacks' metrics.

Medicaid vs. Medicare: Balancing Act or Structural Shift?

While Medicaid membership dipped due to eligibility reviews, Elevance's total medical membership stayed stable at 45.8 million, driven by growth in Medicare Advantage (MA) and ACA plans. The 60% re-enrollment rate among Medicaid-eligible members using digital tools suggests some recovery potential. However, the Medicaid redetermination backlog—expected to take over a year to resolve—could prolong margin strain.

Investors should note that MA growth, though strong, faces its own risks:

- A False Claims Act lawsuit alleges improper broker incentives in MA sales, which, if settled unfavorably, could disrupt enrollment.

- Slower MA industry growth (3.8% in Q1 2025 vs. 6.5% in 2023) may limit Elevance's upside.

Valuation and Investment Takeaway

Elevance's stock trades at a 14.2x forward P/E, slightly below its five-year average of 15.6x. While the company raised full-year EPS guidance to $32.85+, its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of 0.00% suggest limited upside surprises. Meanwhile, peers like CVS (Zacks Rank #2) and BSX (Zacks Rank #2) offer better beat odds and faster growth trajectories.

Historically, ELV has shown resilience around earnings releases: from 2022 to present, a buy-and-hold strategy yielded a 71.43% win rate over 10 days, with a maximum return of 1.01% on day 58. This underscores the stock's potential to rebound after near-term volatility.

Final Stance:

- Hold ELV if you believe Carelon's expansion and MA growth can offset margin pressures. The stock's historical performance around earnings events—such as a 57.14% 3-day win rate and 64.29% 30-day win rate—supports this stance.

- Consider pivoting to CVS or BSX for safer upside, given their stronger beat probabilities and less exposure to Medicaid volatility.

Elevance's story remains tied to execution in high-growth segments like CarelonRx and managing the Medicaid redetermination tailwind. Until margin pressures ease or Medicaid membership stabilizes, the stock may underperform peers in this cost-driven healthcare landscape.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-14 17:06:05.262022

But outside of those areas, it’s been more hit or miss for Nike Running in recent years.
Having enjoyed the Vomero 18 himself, he was curious what his friend would think of it.","Nike chief executive officer Elliott Hill told investors in the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 conference call last month that the worst is now over.

Net income and sales both declined again in the period, but based on Nike’s “Win Now” actions over the prior 90 days, Hill said: “From here, we expect our business results to improve. It’s time to turn the page.” Investors agreed, with shares closing with a 15 percent increase the following day.

One spot where the numbers are already showing improvement is in running. Nike Running grew by “high single digits” in Q4, and Hill called out the success of the Vomero 18, which has already grown into a $100 million franchise after launching at the end of February.

Three specialty retailers who spoke with Footwear News all agreed: the Nike Running comeback is very much on.

Chris Farley, owner and president of Pacers Running, said Nike is outpacing all of its other vendors, with a 20 percent growth in sales so far in 2025. With five stores in Washington D.C. and Northern Virginia, Pacers has seen the Vomero 18 become its top-seller.

The story is the same for Philadelphia Runner and Heartbreak Hill Running Company, which has locations in Boston, Chicago and Santa Monica, Calif.

“I really liked the [Vomero 17], but we did not sell very many of them,” said Philadelphia Runner co-owner Ross Martinson. “The new Vomeros are the best-selling Nike right away. The problem has been the men’s (sizes), we haven’t been able to get enough of them. But that’s sort of a good problem.”

The Vomero 18 has come in the early days of a streamlined new era for focused on three franchises: Pegasus, Structure and Vomero. In order, the franchises are targeted toward responsive cushioning, supportive cushioning and maximum cushioning.

Each banner gets three different silhouettes, starting with the numbered baseline model and offering upgrades through the Plus and Premium variants. The Pegasus is the only franchise to see all three of its models come to stores already with the Pegasus 41, Pegasus Plus and Pegasus Premium, the latter of which is Nike’s first sneaker to ever feature a curved, full-length Zoom Air unit.

Nike will follow up the Vomero 18, which uses a combination of ReactX and ZoomX foams, on August 7 with the Vomero Plus, which is boosted by a full ZoomX midsole. The Vomero Premium will then come October 2 with Air Zoom units at the forefoot and heel taking the max-cushioned proposition to the highest level.

Heartbreak Hill Running Co. co-founder Dan Fitzgerald, who’s also a Nike Running coach, said the Pegasus franchise has always sold well in his stores and credits the Swoosh with creating the super shoe. But outside of those areas, it’s been more hit or miss for Nike Running in recent years.

Anecdotally, Fitzgerald points to a personal friend who logs 10 miles a day and runs in On. Having enjoyed the Vomero 18 himself, he was curious what his friend would think of it. “He put them on and he said, ‘Yeah it feels pretty good.’ Then I hit up a week later and he said: ‘I’m actually blown away. That’s my favorite shoe.”

With only five of the nine sneakers from the Vomero, Pegasus and Structure lines having launched, it’s still too early to tell what effect the relaunch will have on consumers. At the very least, though, the new dividing lines does it make it easier for retailers to explain to customers.

“Our staff really dictate the experience on the floor,” Farley said. “I think [the shoes’ purposes] are more clear. A simpler approach has been much better, so they’re more comfortable bringing out, talking about features, benefits and all those things where they may not have been as clear in the past.”

The new silos serve to replace the Infinity and Invincible, the purposes of which weren’t quite as clear and were easy to conflate with each other because they have “In” as prefixes.

There is still some concern that the difference, for example, between a base and Plus model may not be quite as recognizable. “The Vomero Plus looks awesome too,” Martinson said. “I’m curious to see how that affects sales of he regular Vomero because it’s kind of a different feel, but they still look fairly similar. So we’ll see how that goes.”

As promising as this year’s returns have been for Nike Running, as well as the positivity of its forecast, it does indeed still have ground to make up in the sport.

For runners who may go out just once or twice a week, as well as walkers and broader fitness enthusiasts, Farley said Nike still isn’t winning that conversation. With those consumers, Brooks, Asics and Hoka still reign.

And because the super shoe race has become so crowded, Martinson believes it will be more important than ever for Nike to win over the more casual runners and offer the best shoes that won’t be used on race days. “[Nike has] dominated super shoes and still leads it, but where they were 90 percent of those sales, maybe they’re going to be 50 to 60 [percent] going forward,” he said. “So it feels like good timing for them. It certainly feels like a turnaround for Nike or a vibe shift.”",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nike-running-comeback-001.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,N,,2025-07-14 15:09:23.547151

Those workers expected to be in-person in either location will have a year to make the move. The company said it will also offer buyouts to employees who don't plan to meet these expectations as part of this broader mandate.

""We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we're together,"" CEO Brian Niccol wrote. ""We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster. Being in person also helps us build and strengthen our culture. As we work to turn the business around, all these things matter more than ever.""

In April, the company reported US same-store sales fell for the fifth straight quarter to start 2025, a result Niccol called ""disappointing.""

Starbucks' stock is up just 2% year to date, compared to the S&P 500's nearly 7% gain.

The company is navigating a major brand overhaul amid an environment in which consumer spending has been under pressure. Niccol joined the company last year in a high-profile move from Chipotle, where he had served as CEO since 2018.

Citi analyst Jon Tower wrote in a recent note to clients that he's eager to hear more about ""updates on timeline and potential costs related to remodels and progress on menu simplification"" in the company's upcoming quarterly report.

The company disclosed in a filing earlier this month that top executives could earn up to $6 million in stock grants if it meets cost-cutting reduction goals.

""We’re driving significant change across the company while staying true to our core values,"" Niccol wrote Monday.

""We know we’re asking a lot of every partner as we work to turn the business around. And we understand that the updated in-office culture may not work for everyone.""

The measures are a win not only for some 20,000 gig workers, but also for rival delivery apps that had complained they were being singled out unfairly under the existing law.
Council officials told Crain’s that the expansion bills were discussed during settlement talks but were not a formal part of the agreement.
The companies also argue that grocery delivery is a necessity for some low-income New Yorkers, not a luxury item like restaurant food.
Advocates for delivery workers support the bills, which they say will benefit a workforce that includes large numbers of African immigrants.","The City Council on Monday is expected to pass two bills that expand New York’s landmark protections for restaurant delivery workers to cover workers who deliver groceries. The measures are a win not only for some 20,000 gig workers, but also for rival delivery apps that had complained they were being singled out unfairly under the existing law.

The two bills build on the 2021 measures that set a minimum wage for delivery drivers — $21.44 as of April, a figure that will rise with inflation — and also guarantee other protections, including access to bathrooms at the businesses they serve. The legislation closes what the website Streetsblog dubbed the “Instacart loophole,” referring to the major grocery-delivery app, which had been exempt from the laws even as they applied to restaurant apps such as DoorDash, Grubhub and UberEats.

Although those app companies opposed the laws when they first applied to them, they supported the new measures as a way to even the playing field. A DoorDash executive told the council in December that “some platforms are at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to their peers, and workers are caught in the middle, left to navigate a regulatory scheme that denies them equal pay for equal work.”

The new minimum-pay expansion “reflects a pragmatic step toward treating all delivery workers consistently, regardless of what they deliver,” said Kassandra Perez-Desir, senior manager of government relations at DoorDash, in a statement on Monday.

Monday’s vote comes a month after the city softened another law that limited the fees that app companies can charge to restaurants. In exchange for that rollback, DoorDash, Grubhub and UberEats agreed to drop two pending lawsuits against the city over the fee cap and the minimum-pay law.

Council officials told Crain’s that the expansion bills were discussed during settlement talks but were not a formal part of the agreement.

Instacart and other grocery apps like Shipt remain opposed to the bills, which they say will increase prices for customers and limit the number of jobs available to gig workers. The companies also argue that grocery delivery is a necessity for some low-income New Yorkers, not a luxury item like restaurant food.

“It’s simply unconscionable that the City Council would pass a bill that would have such devastating consequences for New Yorkers,” said Thomas McNeil, senior manager for government affairs at Instacart, in a statement. “Grocery delivery is a lifeline for thousands of people across the city, especially those facing health, mobility, or transportation challenges.”

Mayor Eric Adams has not said whether he will veto the bills, although the council would likely vote to override his rejection. Instacart is widely expected to sue if the measures become law.

Advocates for delivery workers support the bills, which they say will benefit a workforce that includes large numbers of African immigrants.

Brooklyn Councilwoman Sandy Nurse, who sponsored the bill expanding the pay rate, told Crain’s that the complaints of unfairness by the likes of DoorDash and Grubhub were not a significant factor in pushing the bills toward passage.

“Instacart is fighting really hard to stop this legislation, but we did this because any business model that is not able to survive a minimum pay rate is not a successful model,” she said. “We cannot legislate to save individual companies — we have to legislate to protect the workers who are being exploited.”

Regulating delivery apps has been a top priority of city lawmakers since the industry exploded in popularity during the pandemic. The latest legislation also coincides with the apps’ emergence as unexpected political players in the June primary elections: DoorDash spent $1 million to support Andrew Cuomo’s mayoral campaign and spent another $1.2 million on council races, while Uber spent $2.4 million in council contests.",https://s3-prod.crainsnewyork.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/main-%20instacart_i.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:12:31.165644

But in the case of Starbucks, it’s part of a brilliant promotional strategy by its new chief brand officer Tressie Lieberman.
How will Starbucks’s Secret Menu work?
“[With the Secret Menu] We’re really just working to help put media behind [fans] and get more reach around new ideas.
The only question remaining is, can a secret menu stay cool when it’s available to millions of customers?","Starbucks has been in a bit of a slump, facing stagnant growth as it awaits its new CEO Brian Niccol’s turnaround. His strategy? Nicer stores you want to sit in. Protein-loaded coffee. And now . . . turning every day at Starbucks into a viral drop.

The company is launching a “secret menu” in its app today, building off the momentum of its “not-so-secret menu” broadcast channel on Instagram. Secret menus, of course, are irresistible to the fleshy consumer brain. A mystery and treat in one! But in the case of Starbucks, it’s part of a brilliant promotional strategy by its new chief brand officer Tressie Lieberman.

How will Starbucks’s Secret Menu work?

The menu will contain rotating offers for drinks. But instead of being born inside its Seattle headquarters coffee lab, these drinks are created by fans on social media who use Starbucks’s customization options to create particularly alluring beverages.

“That’s what people do today: create their own Starbucks order,” says Lieberman. “And so how do we tap into that?”

Indeed, customization is a big part of Starbucks’s appeal; you can order a drink just as you like it. But its menu has become so sprawling and complicated for baristas to produce that Niccol has actually cut it back by nearly a third to simplify production.

What’s brilliant about the Starbucks Secret Menu—which is launching with a $25,000 prize to stoke interest—is twofold: Instead of creating a TikTok trend, it can simply ride a TikTok trend, since people are already promoting their own custom drinks on the service. But the second component is just as important for a company with tens of thousands of locations worldwide. These glitzy, viral drinks are being made with the ingredients Starbucks already has lying around. In other words, it’s all turnkey. Starbucks doesn’t need to spin up a whole production supply chain to sell the equivalent of a McRib. It can just rearrange its food stuffs to make something novel, a lot like Taco Bell combines its shells and sauces to make something new—but crowdsourced.

This strategy is a far cry from how Starbucks used to look at viral creations: as operational headaches that were at odds with its own business model. Instead, Starbucks can analyze a viral menu item, decide if it needs to be tweaked for scale, and then share it back with its audience in a way that can work.

“Some of the best ideas are coming from customers. Customers decide what’s in; customers decide what’s cool,” says Lieberman. “[With the Secret Menu] We’re really just working to help put media behind [fans] and get more reach around new ideas. It’s a lot about being visible, visible to our audience, and being really strategic about how we approach these different trends as well,” says Lieberman.

She points to a recent viral drink called the Gummy Shark, where TikTokers took the Summer Berry Refresher and added cold foam so it would taste like the popular candy, as a recent proof point of this strategy.

“That’s a gift from our customers,” says Lieberman. “Let’s jump on that. Let’s create content around it and celebrate it, instead of moving away from it.”

In other words, with its new Secret Menu, Starbucks is building a workflow so that they don’t need to come up with their next hit, while ensuring that you can taste the wild thing you’re gawking at online easily. (Its new point-of-sale terminals will even be getting a viral drinks tab so that if you walk into a store without your phone, you can order off this menu as well.)

The only question remaining is, can a secret menu stay cool when it’s available to millions of customers? Anyone who’s ordered a speak-easy-inspired Neapolitan shake or animal style fries from In-N-Out knows . . . the answer is a sad and true, “absolutely yes.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/p-1-91365360-starbucks-secret-menu.jpg",N,,2025-07-14 14:13:36.773810

Polaris followed the launch with an internal survey, in which 100% of respondents said they wanted to learn more about women’s health.
This is just one of the examples of how the League can organically respond to women’s real-world concerns.
“I will praise the men at Polaris because of the allyship and the support they’re giving us,” Muir said.
Even now, as the League continues to grow, it has created a stronger sense of community among Polaris employees.","Polaris Transportation Group has officially launched the Polaris Women’s League — an initiative borne from the vision of late highway dispatcher Pam Lambe, who dreamed of creating a safe, inclusive space for women at the company.

The idea was first raised several years ago during one of Polaris’ virtual “hot chocolate hours,” informal social gatherings the company hosted to support employee morale during remote work. This is according to Laura Muir, Polaris’ chief human resources officer, who told trucknews.com that during one such gathering, Lambe suggested having women-only meetings to talk openly about topics like health, home life, and mental wellness.

“She said, ‘How great would it be to have just the women, where we could talk about health and just generally, have a free space to speak?'” Muir said. “She passed some time ago last year, and I wanted to launch this in her memory. She would be so happy.”

Launched on International Women’s Day this March, the League’s inaugural event — a tea party held both in-person and virtually — drew unexpectedly high turnout and overwhelming enthusiasm, she adds. Polaris followed the launch with an internal survey, in which 100% of respondents said they wanted to learn more about women’s health.

Since then, the League has evolved into a dynamic, employee-led initiative offering quarterly formal events and a range of ongoing activities that have branched out since. These include a book club, movie club, a walking group that meets weekly — and sometimes daily — during warmer months. Muir says there was even a discussion about general auto mechanics, sparked after someone asked how to check tire pressure and change a tire.

The conversation came up casually during one tea party, after Muir mentioned she had low air in her tires. Several women said they didn’t know how to check or refill them. That led to plans for Polaris’ driver manager to attend an upcoming session to give a hands-on demonstration of basic auto maintenance.

This is just one of the examples of how the League can organically respond to women’s real-world concerns.

“It’s just really brought us all together,” Muir said. “I’m seeing departments such as our dispatch department, our HR department, you know, we’re all working alongside with people we wouldn’t regularly work with, or chat with. So it’s really nice.”

Topics that have resonated the most with attendees include menopause, mental wellness, work-life balance and navigating family life. Women in the group have swapped meal prep tips, discussed parenting, and shared wellness resources, including information from Polaris’ community partners and benefits providers.

Polaris is also partnering with its benefits broker to host educational sessions on menopause in the workplace this fall.

Enabling the league with company-wide allyship

Muir emphasized that the League’s success wouldn’t be possible without company-wide support — including from male colleagues and leadership. Managers across departments have encouraged participation, and men at the company have even stepped in to cover duties so women can attend.

“I will praise the men at Polaris because of the allyship and the support they’re giving us,” Muir said. “It really does tighten the family of Polaris.”

As Polaris welcomes new hires, Muir hopes the League will serve as a lasting reminder of Lambe’s legacy and a model for fostering genuine connection and support at work.

“Polaris isn’t just the employees…In Pam’s case, her sister was an extension of her. Our whole families become part of this,” she said recalling the times of Lambe’s illness, adding that Muir and the team stayed in close contact with her sister. Even now, as the League continues to grow, it has created a stronger sense of community among Polaris employees.

Q2 Earnings Whispers for Elevance

Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for the company this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is not the case here.

ELV has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

What’s Shaping Elevance’s Q2 Results?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for product revenues indicates 11.1% growth from the year-ago period’s $5.5 billion. The consensus estimate for premiums indicates an 11.9% increase from the year-ago period. These are likely to have aided revenues in the second quarter.

The consensus mark for Commercial Individual membership implies 5.9% growth from a year ago, while our model estimate indicates a 5.6% increase. However, the consensus estimate for Commercial Fee-based memberships indicates a 0.1% year-over-year decline.

Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Carelon brand’s operating income for the second quarter indicates a 14.1% year-over-year increase. Growth in CarelonRx is primarily expected to have aided the brand. The results are likely to have been supported by the recent buyouts in home health and pharmacy services.

However, its expenses are likely to have remained elevated in the quarter due to substantial investments in digital capabilities and platforms. High benefit expenses, cost of products sold and interest expenses are likely to have affected profit margins, making earnings beat uncertain. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the benefit expense ratio is pegged at 88.4, higher than the year-ago level of 86.3. We expect total expenses to jump nearly 11% year over year in the second quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Health Benefits segment’s operating income for the second quarter indicates a 12.4% year-over-year decrease. Also, declining memberships in Medicaid are likely to have kept second-quarter premium growth in check.

Stocks That Warrant a Look

While an earnings beat looks uncertain for Elevance, here are some companies from the broader Medical space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:

Boston Scientific Corporation BSX has an Earnings ESP of +0.88% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boston Scientific’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter indicates a 16.1% year-over-year growth. Boston Scientific’s earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average surprise of 8.8%.

CVS Health Corporation CVS has an Earnings ESP of +2.06% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVS Health’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.47. CVS Health’s earnings beat estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 18.1%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Summit Therapeutics’ bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter has witnessed one upward estimate revision in the past 60 days with no opposite movement.

Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson is facing legal action in the UK over claims that its talcum powder products contained asbestos and caused cancer in thousands of people.

Law firm KP Law says more than 100,000 people could have developed cancer, including ovarian cancer, mesothelioma, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer after regularly using the company’s talc products.

“They knew it was dangerous”: Lawyers say company failed to warn public

As early as the 1970s, it is claimed that Johnson & Johnson knew that asbestos contamination in its talc-based products posed a serious cancer risk – but continued selling them in the UK until 2023 without consumer warnings. In 2023, Johnson & Johnson switched to a corn starch-based product despite making this change in the US in 2020.

“This once-trusted corporation knew for decades that asbestos in its talc products was dangerous,” said Tom Longstaff, partner at KP Law and the barrister leading the UK case.

“They did nothing to notify consumers, who are now paying the highest price imaginable for the sake of corporate greed.”

We’ve teamed up with KP Law to raise awareness of this claim. Have you been affected? Read more or start your claim with KP Law now.

Thousands of potential claimants step forward

KP Law is currently representing over 4,000 people who have joined the group action against Johnson & Johnson. The firm has issued a letter before action and is now preparing to file its claim against Johnson & Johnson.

Talcum powder linked to cancer by global health authorities

In July 2024, the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified talc as “probably carcinogenic” to humans, including in relation to ovarian cancer.

Who may be affected by asbestos in talcum powder?

People who used talcum powder regularly for five or more years, starting 10 or more years before a cancer diagnosis, may be eligible to join the claim.

This includes people diagnosed with:

Ovarian cancer

Fallopian tube cancer

Primary peritoneal cancer

Mesothelioma (including in men)

“There are thousands of women in the UK with ovarian or related cancers who could be eligible to make a claim against Johnson & Johnson,” said Longstaff.

“Some men also qualify in relation to peritoneal cancer and mesothelioma.”

Claimants speak out: “We all used talc”

Linda Jones, 66, from North Devon, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2023. She used Johnson & Johnson talc from birth until her 20s.

“We all used talc, without exception,” she said. “If there was any suggestion that it could cause harm to babies or women, it should have been taken off the market decades ago.”

Cassandra Wardle, 44, from Derbyshire, was diagnosed in 2022 and shared a similar experience:

“Johnson & Johnson talcum powder was in every home and a trusted brand,” she said. “I want to know why they didn’t change the ingredients when they knew it was dangerous.”

Substantial compensation claims expected

KP Law says potential damages would reach six figures per claimant, especially for those who have experienced major health consequences or loss of life.

In the US, Johnson & Johnson has set aside more than $13 billion (£9.6 billion) to settle similar claims.

Johnson & Johnson denies claims, maintains product safety

In response, a Johnson & Johnson spokesperson said the company has always followed advanced testing protocols and worked transparently with regulators.

“Our findings show no asbestos contamination in Johnson’s Baby Powder or in the talc we used,” the company said.

“We’ve won the majority of US trials either initially or on appeal.”

The company ceased global sales of talc-based powders in 2022, switching to cornstarch-based formulas, and discontinued UK sales of mineral-based talc in 2023.",https://consumervoice.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/iStock-859936614-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:12:36.099402

Kenvue said Monday that board member Kirk Perry will serve as interim CEO, effective immediately. Perry has served as a director since December and most recently served as CEO of Circana, a provider of market research. He spent more than 20 years at Procter & Gamble in various roles.

Kenvue also said that it is continuing to work with its strategic review committee to explore options for the company.

“The Board’s strategic review is underway, and we are considering a broad range of potential alternatives, including ways to simplify the Company’s portfolio and how it operates,” Chair Larry Merlo said in a statement.

Kenvue provided some preliminary results for its fiscal second quarter. The company anticipates adjusted earnings in a range of 28 cents to 29 cents per share. Analysts polled by FactSet expect earnings of 28 cents per share.

However, despite the flatlining in the US, the global performance remains positive.
PC shipments rose 6.5% year-over-year in Q2 2025, reaching 68.4 million units according to data from IDC.
After a spike in Q1 shipments, timed to beat potential tariffs, sales in the U.S. have slowed significantly.","Earlier this year, PC vendors rushed to get ahead of what looked like trouble. With import tariffs on the horizon, shipments to the U.S. surged, inventory filled up, and the market posted strong early signs of growth. But that head start came with a catch: now, in the second quarter, U.S. PC sales have flattened slightly, dampening the global momentum.

However, despite the flatlining in the US, the global performance remains positive. PC shipments rose 6.5% year-over-year in Q2 2025, reaching 68.4 million units according to data from IDC. Demand across Europe, Asia, and other key regions continues to see traction. This was driven by an ageing installed base, combined with the continued rollout of Windows 11.

This international appetite for PCs is doing a lot of the heavy lifting. Without it, global numbers would look very different. The U.S. current stagnation is being felt across supply chains and in vendor strategies. After a spike in Q1 shipments, timed to beat potential tariffs, sales in the U.S. have slowed significantly. Not a collapse, but a pause that adds friction to the broader recovery.

Still, the global market is holding firm. Lenovo grew shipments by more than 15% and maintained its position at the top of the market. Apple saw the biggest jump, up over 21% year-over-year, thanks in part to strong MacBook demand. HP posted modest gains, while Dell slipped into negative territory, down 3%. Overall, the performance was respectable, but it’s uneven.

As the second half of the year approaches, the challenge will be sustaining that momentum. The global market is proving it can grow even with headwinds, but the situation in the U.S.—great in Q1, flat in Q2—remains the wild card. If demand there continues to slow or tariffs shift pricing strategies too sharply, it could begin to drag on the broader performance.

That uncertainty is keeping the entire industry on edge. Ryan Reith, IDC’s group vice president for Worldwide Device Trackers, says the current growth feels counterintuitive, but not without explanation. Supply chain players, still cautious from past shocks, are moving to capture demand while they can, but walking a tightrope. Overextending means running the risk of bloated inventories. Holding back could mean missing the moment. If tariffs go into effect as expected, prices are likely to rise, but not uniformly.

For now, global sales are carrying the industry forward. But navigating the next few quarters will require adaptability and a close watch on the market that still sets the pace for much of the world.",https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1652430871152-0b95b204f8e5?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDM5fHxwY3xlbnwwfHx8fDE3NTI1MDIxNDd8MA&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=2000,N,,2025-07-14 13:33:44.276599

The triple ceremony, which took place at the Fincantieri shipyard in Genoa, will see the MSC Cruises-owned line grow to six ships by 2028 – making it one of the fastest growing luxury lines in the world.

The 922-passenger Explora III joins the fleet next year and will be the first to run on LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas).

Explora IV and V launch in 2027 and Explora VI launches in 2028; these three ships will have onboard fuel cells to convert the LNG into hydrogen.

“This triple celebration reflects the strength of our vision and the power of collaboration between our team, our partners at Fincantieri, and the unwavering support of the Aponte-Vago family.”

(TRUE:CSE; TREIF:OTCMKTS; 939:FRA), through its subsidiary Rocket Doctor Inc., has launched a new virtual health screening initiative for adults over the age of 60 in collaboration with EngageWell IPA. The program, known as the Healthy Aging Program, is backed by a five-year US$1 million grant from the CVS Health Foundation and aims to improve healthcare access for older adults in New York City.

The program provides no-cost virtual screenings for heart health, cognitive and memory function, and mental health. Board-certified physicians conduct consultations via phone or video and offer follow-up care plans tailored to each patient. Community Health Workers assist with navigation and help participants access necessary local services. Patients on Medicaid can access the service at no cost, while Medicare patients are covered through insurance.

Dr. William Cherniak, Founder and CEO of Rocket Doctor, stated in the press release, ""We're proud to again partner with EngageWell to bring high-quality, proactive care directly into the homes of older adults across New York City."" The pilot aims to reduce barriers related to language, digital literacy, and mobility, and to address healthcare access issues in underserved communities.

The launch follows Treatment.com AI's recent acquisition of Rocket Doctor, finalized earlier this year. Since then, Rocket Doctor has reported significant growth across its operations. In Alberta, Canada, patient volume increased by 112% year-over-year, with 36,779 patients served in the past 12 months. Physician participation also grew from 22 to 70 over the same period, a 218% rise.

Rocket Doctor has also entered into new partnerships, including a virtual care program with Central California Alliance for Health, which serves approximately 450,000 Medi-Cal members, and an initiative with Melanoma Canada to improve follow-up care for high-risk skin cancer patients. In recognition of its clinical innovation, Rocket Doctor was named a Top Clinical Innovator by the American Telemedicine Association and was featured at events hosted by Harvard Medical School and the AARP AgeTech Accelerator.

The parent company, Treatment.com AI, continues to evolve and integrate its AI-powered diagnostic engine, the Global Library of Medicine (GLM), across medical education, telehealth, and provider platforms. According to the company's July 2025 investor presentation, the GLM currently includes over 10,000 expert medical reviews and is designed to assist with diagnosing more than 1,000 diseases in real time.

Telehealth Sector Faces New Standards and Growing Regulatory Demands

The virtual care and telehealth sector remained in a period of transition during mid-2025, as stakeholders navigated growing regulatory pressures, operational scrutiny, and efforts to redefine ethical practices across the industry.

On April 3, Fierce Healthcare published a retrospective analysis examining how the COVID-19 pandemic reshaped healthcare delivery in the United States. Jesse Ehrenfeld, M.D., immediate past president of the American Medical Association, emphasized that ""you can't have a conversation about the last five years and not talk about telehealth."" He noted a dramatic rise in adoption, with three-quarters of physicians offering telehealth by late 2023, compared to only one-quarter before the pandemic. Fierce Healthcare reported that this expansion improved access to care, especially for mental health services and patients in remote areas, and encouraged broader use of patient portals. However, experts like Patricia McGaffigan of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement advised that adoption must remain measured, stating, ""it's important for us to proceed with a reasonable level of enthusiasm, but also a clear degree of caution.""

The introduction of artificial intelligence tools into telehealth also drew attention. According to Ehrenfeld, ""AI is coming into practice in a way that is really exciting,"" citing a 78% increase in physician usage of health-related AI tools from 2023 to 2024. Yet, regulatory gaps and concerns around responsible implementation continued. Fierce Healthcare noted that general-purpose AI models were sometimes used for clinical decisions, raising questions about patient safety and oversight.

According to a June 12 report from Future Market Insights, the global wireless healthcare asset management market was projected to increase from US$52.06 billion in 2025 to US$155.40 billion by 2035. The report attributed this growth to the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and real-time tracking tools within hospitals. These technologies were used to monitor high-value equipment such as infusion pumps and surgical instruments, improve maintenance scheduling, and enhance patient safety through predictive analytics.

The report also noted that cloud-based platforms enabled real-time equipment monitoring, predictive maintenance, and compliance tracking. It identified a trend toward integrating AI systems with electronic health records (EHRs) and hospital information systems (HIS) to support resource optimization and more informed clinical decisions.

Strategic Positioning in Virtual Care and AI Health Tools

The collaboration with EngageWell and the CVS Health Foundation aligns with Treatment.com AI's broader strategy to merge artificial intelligence with physician-led care models. The company's AI platform has been implemented in university clinical training programs, including the University of Minnesota Medical School, where it enabled OSCE testing of 240 students using AI-simulated patients. The institution estimates that the AI-driven platform could reduce exam costs by approximately 40%.

Rocket Doctor's model combines telehealth infrastructure with physician autonomy, allowing doctors to independently manage virtual clinics. As of July 2025, Rocket Doctor has facilitated care for over 600,000 patients across four Canadian provinces and three U.S. states, supported by a physician network of over 300 professionals.

Revenue generation is driven by a mix of per-appointment fees in the U.S. and Canada, monthly platform fees from physicians, and direct-to-consumer partnerships. According to Treatment's July 2025 presentation, these include pharmacy kiosks and device-enabled care stations used by independent provider associations.

The company has also attracted national attention through accelerator programs at institutions such as UC Berkeley and public recognition through speaking engagements and awards. These developments reinforce Treatment.com AI's role as a key player in expanding access to virtual care for aging and underserved populations through scalable, physician-led, AI-enhanced platforms.

Analyst Identifies Technical Rebound and Operational Strength at AI Healthtech Company

*On May 21, Technical Analyst Clive Maund published an assessment of Treatment.com AI Inc., highlighting what he described as the company's strategic positioning within the evolving artificial intelligence (AI) healthcare landscape.

Maund noted that Treatment.com AI had developed a physician-designed platform intended to address inefficiencies in healthcare by combining clinical intelligence, virtual care capabilities, and voice assistant technology into a unified system. He referred to the company's diagnostic tools — powered by the proprietary Global Library of Medicine (GLM) — as offering continuous availability and AI-driven voice interactivity intended to support clinical workflows.

He also referenced the company's Rocket Doctor subsidiary, describing it as a ""Shopify for physicians"" that allowed practitioners to launch remote clinics and expand access to virtual care. Maund cited the model's scalability as a factor in its relevance to the broader telehealth market.

From a technical standpoint, Maund observed that the company's stock had recently completed what he interpreted as a three-wave A-B-C correction pattern and was rising from a long-term base established over a 30-month period. He identified technical support levels that, in his view, marked a potential inflection point for the stock's movement.

In his analysis, Maund stated that recent volume patterns signaled growing investor interest, describing the accumulation since early 2024 as ""supportive of a significant new uptrend."" He outlined an initial target range of CA$1.08 to CA$1.12, with a secondary target of CA$4.00. Maund concluded that the combination of market positioning and technical indicators suggested, in his opinion, that it was ""an excellent time to buy or add to positions in Treatment.com AI.""

Related: Private investors pumping billions into primary care

Loren Adler, a Brookings Institution researcher, led the team that wrote the article.

The team came up with the figures by analyzing Medicare program data. The authors did not look at figures for physicians who bill commercial health plans, but they likely reflect most primary care physicians in the United States, because Medicare program managers have estimated that 98% of U.S. physicians take Medicare.

The backdrop: A ""vertical integration"" deal involves efforts by one or more vendors to combine with one or more of their suppliers.

Defenders of vertical integration involving health insurers and health care providers have argued that at least some of the deals may improve the cost and quality of care in at least some markets. In 2018, for example, Ken Pokalsky, a vice president with the Business Council of New York State, wrote to the U.S. Justice Department Antitrust Division to support the CVS acquisition of Aetna. Pokalsky predicted that the deal would help CVS and Aetna hold down premiums, improve preventive care and improve primary care.

But Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, suggested in January in a public letter to Elon Musk, who then was overseeing efforts by the administration of President Donald Trump to streamline the federal government, that the government should consider breaking up UnitedHealth because of its dominant size and breadth.

The researchers' views: The Adler team did not look in the new paper at the impact of vertical integration on the cost, availability or quality of primary care.

In May 2023, Adler told members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Health Subcommittee that vertical integration in health care could have both positive and negative effects.

Adler and his colleagues do recommend in the new paper that policymakers and other researchers look into the impact of vertical integration on the primary care market.

Vertical integration could ""give insurers an advantage over competing health plans by steering patients toward their own services or making it harder for other insurers to contract with their physician groups,"" the authors wrote. ""Additionally, payer acquisitions can directly reduce competition in local physician markets, potentially leading to higher prices or less choice for patients.""

The store is located at 6939 Coal Creek Parkway S.E. in Newcastle.

In May, it was announced that CVS would take over many of the Rite Aid and Bartell Drugs locations that were closing in Washington, according to regulatory filings. The Newcastle location is one of 64 stores CVS is converting across Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, according to The Puget Sound Business Journal.

That includes 20 Bartell Drugs locations, marking the end of an era for the local brand.

Rite Aid, which filed for bankruptcy for the second time in less than two years, agreed to sell more than 1,000 of its stores to a group of competitors. That group includes Walgreens, Albertsons, Kroger, Giant Eagle, and, for the Pacific Northwest, CVS Pharmacy. The Pennsylvania-based pharmacy chain entered bankruptcy with more than $2 billion in debt.

CVS wants to make the switch smooth for customers, as prescription files have already been transferred and loyalty programs are in place. Some former Bartell employees were kept on through the conversion.

All stores plan to be open by Oct. 1.

Which Rite Aid stores in WA are closing?

Eight Rite Aid stores are closing in Washington across eight different cities.

Anacortes is losing its location at 1517 Commercial Avenue, while Ephrata is losing its store at 250 Basin Street. The other Rite Aid stores affected are in Granite Falls (608 W.

The Ephrata and North Bend locations are Bartell’s pharmacy stores.

Bartell, founded in 1890 in Seattle, was believed to be the nation’s oldest existing family-owned drugstore chain until it was sold to Rite Aid in 2020 for $95 million.

Heinz Co. and Kraft Foods.

News of the potentially impeding breakup was reported July 11 by The Wall Street Journal.

Under the plan, several Kraft products would be spun off into a new entity, and the remaining company would produce and market a portfolio focused on condiments and sauces, including the Heinz brand, the Journal said.

Kraft grocery brands include Mac & Cheese, Ore-Ida, Philadelphia cream cheese, Oscar Mayer, Capri Sun, Velveeta, Lunchables and Jell-O.

In response to an inquiry from the publication, a Kraft Heinz spokesperson said: “As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value.”

The X Line Grip D tire will be available in sizes 295/75R22.5 and 11R22.5.
“This fantastic leap in drive tire technology brings new levels of performance to the road and new levels of savings for our customers.”","Michelin recently introduced the X Line Grip D tire, which provides exceptional mileage, lasting traction, and features a durable casing designed to reach up to 1 million miles with up to four retreads—all of which assists fleets that are moving goods to consumers across North America.

Recently, Michelin partnered with television host and MythBusters legend Adam Savage and his team, providing an opportunity to witness testing demonstrations on the new X Line Grip D tire and learn about this revolutionary tire on his show Tested.

“We at Michelin are dedicated to evolving tire performance through relentless innovation and ongoing technological advancements,” Pierluigi Cumo, Michelin North America VP of B2B marketing, said in a news release. “That’s why Michelin is proud to introduce the Michelin X Line Grip D tire. This tire has the potential to redefine the drive tire standard in fleets for years to come.

“It is not an evolution to existing products, but something entirely different the fleet world has not seen before.”

The X Line Grip D tire is an example of benefit-focused innovation, and Michelin tire designers characterize this new product as a “once-in-a-lifetime” leap in tire technology for fleets, the company reported. This new SmartWay-verified drive tire helps fleets control their operational costs, providing 20% more mileage and 20% reduction in rolling resistance than the XDN2 tire. Drivers can also remain confident in this 3PMSF-rated drive tire’s excellent traction performance in wet and snowy conditions thanks to the unique chevron tread design. Based on testing of worn tires, the X Line Grip D tire provides more than 90% better snow-starting traction and more than 25% better wet-starting traction than the XDN2 tire. Additionally, fleets can get more out of their assets as the X Line Grip D tire is built on Michelin’s Duracore casing, featuring Infinicoil and Powercoil technologies.

The X Line Grip D tire will be available in sizes 295/75R22.5 and 11R22.5.

According to HP research, workers who feel confident using AI tools are significantly more likely to report high-quality connections with their colleagues.","In the workplace, as in life, humans crave connection. But how we connect is evolving. Today’s impromptu hallway conversation has been supplanted by video calls, chat threads, shared whiteboards, and AI-enabled platforms that aim to replicate—and even enhance—that sense of spontaneous collaboration.

But when these tools are fragmented or poorly designed, they can do more harm than good. That’s why business leaders must be intentional about how technology bridges physical distances and fosters connection, trust, and creativity.

Recently, a panel of experts discussed how to reimagine workspaces while at Fast Company’s New World of Work Summit, held in partnership with HP. Here are three takeaways from their conversation. (Some comments have been edited for length and clarity; scroll to the bottom to watch the entire panel discussion.)

1. Let people focus on the work, not the tech.

In the future of work, the workplace is no longer a fixed location—it is wherever the work is happening. “The focus will shift from the place where I do my work to the work I am doing and the people I’m collaborating with,” said Helen Sheirbon, svp and chief operating officer, Global HP Solutions.

That collaboration is increasingly virtual. To keep it fluid, technology needs to fade into the background—not get in the way. Sheirbon pointed out that video conferencing tools should work intuitively using AI to handle things like auto-framing the speaker, filtering out background noise, or adjusting lighting so people’s nuanced expressions and gestures can be clearly seen and heard.

“People need to be able to focus on what they’re talking about, not wondering if they look right on camera, or whether their colleague can hear the lawnmower,” Sheirbon said.

2. Design for inclusion—so everyone is seen and heard.

Historically, workplaces have been designed to maximize productivity. But comfort, belonging, and accessibility? Not always considered. That’s changing.

Rani Johnson, chief information officer at Workday, shared how poor lighting during a customer video call left her feeling like just a “set of teeth” on screen. “If I think about my IT team, 52% of whom are in India and many of whom share my complexion—if they’re not feeling seen, that’s a problem,” she said.

Her team took action—experimenting with lighting, conferencing tools, adjusting camera placement, and training employees on how to create a video-friendly space. In some rooms, cameras were positioned too low, creating awkward angles—especially for those wearing dresses or skirts.

They also layered in AI tools to improve accessibility, like real-time transcripts in Zoom for hearing-impaired team members. But tech is just part of the equation. Creating space for every voice to be heard—especially quieter or more introverted team members—requires cultural shifts too.

“I often use this analogy of double Dutch: I’m in a meeting and I’m trying to say something, but I don’t know when to jump in,” Johnson said. “We need to make sure we’re creating environments where everyone feels comfortable to offer their opinions.

“Some of it is tech, but a lot of it is how to facilitate the best environment to get the most out of the creativity that can’t be replaced by AI,” she added. “That’s just innately human.”

3. Demystify AI to unlock its potential.

According to HP research, workers who feel confident using AI tools are significantly more likely to report high-quality connections with their colleagues. But building that proficiency and trust takes more than tools. It takes leadership.

At Workday, Johnson launched a company-wide “Everyday AI” initiative to help employees explore AI through practical training and grassroots support. The company created a network of “AI champions” within departments to model use cases, share results, and answer questions—in some cases leading to three times more adoption of AI in those groups.

“It wasn’t the IT team or the leader coming down and saying, ‘You will do this,’ ” Johnson said. “It’s your teammate showing how it can be used and how to get to true ROI.”

Unlocking the potential of AI needs to happen at the functional level, the panelists agreed. When leaders publicly embrace opportunities to model its use, they create space for others to do so.

“People say all the time, ‘I asked ChatGPT to do this.’ Well, you can also say in a meeting, ‘Shall we get a transcript going?’ or, ‘Sorry I was late, but I’m all caught up because I checked out the AI meeting summary,’ ” Sheirbon said.

This modeling behavior is critical for building trust and normalizing AI adoption, she added. It sends a signal not just of endorsement but of accessibility. “Exploration is part of the process,” she said. “We don’t just want people to adopt AI, we want them to experiment, share, and grow more confident with it.”

Sheirbon added that small, visible actions like sharing how a tool saved time or improved a meeting can trigger curiosity and accelerate learning across teams. “Create that space where it may seem like play, but it’s not—it’s an exploration of what is possible.”

That was the focus of Fast Company’s recent New World of Work Summit in partnership with HP, which included a panel discussion on how to lead in this new era, featuring experts from different fields.
Two factors are shaping this new world: hybrid work and AI.
Hybrid work is here to stay, despite return-to-office mandates over the past few years, said Dave Shull, president, HP Solutions.
“IT working hand-in-hand with HR will allow companies to work through AI and hybrid in a very different way,” he said.","We’re in an era of hyperinnovation, full of rapid technological advancements in artificial intelligence and beyond. This environment is creating a new world of work, one that offers both opportunities and challenges. What are business leaders to do in such exciting, volatile times? That was the focus of Fast Company’s recent New World of Work Summit in partnership with HP, which included a panel discussion on how to lead in this new era, featuring experts from different fields. Here are three takeaways from their conversation. (Some comments have been edited for length and clarity; scroll to the bottom to watch the entire panel discussion.)

1. Two factors are shaping this new world: hybrid work and AI.

Hybrid work is here to stay, despite return-to-office mandates over the past few years, said Dave Shull, president, HP Solutions. He cited research from digital collaboration firm Vyopta showing that the number of virtual meetings has not declined, even as in-person meetings more than doubled as people returned to the office. “We thought hybrid was going to go away, and it hasn’t,” Shull said. “That’s a reality and a real challenge that I think we as companies need to address.”

Meanwhile, AI is also changing the face of work in multiple ways. For one, it can help people work cross-functionally and better understand other roles within the business, said Tobias Chen, CEO of Volumetric Camera Systems, which creates immersive video content for film, TV, and other media. He provided an example from the visual effects industry, in which technical backend workers historically had very separate tasks from artists—yet both sides are needed to make projects come to life.

“Now with AI tools, if you’re in a technical role, you can use AI to pre-visualize what those creative graphics could look like,” Chen said. “And those in a creative role can use AI to do those technical steps for you. That cross-pollination helps the whole organization better understand what everyone’s doing.”

AI also enables team members to experiment and iterate with concepts before deciding on the best solution. This iterative process allowed Volumetrics to create a project for The Sphere, an immersive entertainment arena in Las Vegas, in just one month—a deadline that, Chen said, would have been “impossible” otherwise. “Through AI, we’re able to create a lot of concepts and different ideas, then test them out really quickly and iteratively before locking in something and going through the final process.”

“It’s the intersection of those two points—hybrid work and AI—that defines the new world of work,” Shull added. “And the challenge for all of us is to figure out how to solve for our employees.”

2. Tools must foster connection to fuel productivity.

The panelists discussed the tension between engagement and productivity, with some noting that too many tools with too little guidance can undercut the employee experience. If employees do not feel engaged, their productivity will plummet.

Shull noted that technology is now so baked into the employee experience, that the IT function is as critical as the HR function. “IT working hand-in-hand with HR will allow companies to work through AI and hybrid in a very different way,” he said. “IT is key to the employee experience: Are we taking care of that employee experience as the primary metric? And how are we making sure our employees are as impactful as possible, whether they’re at home or in the office?”

As a result, the chief information officer and chief people officer roles are converging, Shull said. He recommended close collaboration between these two leaders and functions, including joint projects like an “early warning system” that flags the beginnings of waning employee engagement.

“There’s going to have to be a reinvention of IT,” Shull said. “It’s being charged in a strategic way like never before: ‘Take AI and transform the company.’ It is now a driving force for growth.”

3. Leaders must trust team members to choose the best way to execute their tasks.

Brian Elliott, the CEO at Work Forward, an advisory group dedicated to helping leaders build better ways of working through data, said the rapid pace of change and emergence of new tools is causing many executives to fall back on “command and control.” Rather than putting more policies in place in order to figure things out, he said they should be asking, “How do I align people around purpose, because that’s what’s going to [engage] them.”

Elliott’s advice is twofold. First, leaders must get their own hands on AI and other new tools if they expect their team members to adopt them. Too often, he pointed out, this isn’t the case. When employees see that their leaders are learning and adapting alongside the rest of the team, it inherently builds trust.

Second, Elliott recommends that leaders ensure they remain focused on business outcomes. Rather than dictate use of a certain tool or process, present it as one tool of an entire arsenal that team members can use to achieve that outcome. Trusting them to execute will engender trust in you as a leader.

“Give them a little bit of latitude instead of command and control,” he said. “Say, ‘Look, these are the big audacious goals we’ve got, but I want you to figure out how we’re going to get there. That’s why I’ve hired you.’ ”

According to Ryan Fournier, the press secretary for Environment and Protected Areas, “no stop work order has been issued.”

“Construction was voluntarily paused as we work with the developer to ensure all requirements under the Water Act are met. Until this work is complete, it would be inappropriate to comment further but we look forward to a timely resolution to this matter,” said Fournier.

The McDonald’s is being built by Kor Alta Construction, an Edmonton-based company that does industrial and commercial projects in Western Canada. The construction site is located west of the Independent Grocer on 101 Ave.

According to Lac La Biche Mayor Paul Reutov, pausing construction is “merely a formality” because of the proximity of the location to a wetland.

“They had to tie into the utilities, which are in that area, but there’s no way you can tie into the utilities unless you go into that spot,” said Reutov. “We [Lac La Biche County] went through the same process when we did construction on the other side.”",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/lakelandtoday/images/mcdonalds_7519.jpg;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop,N,,2025-07-14 13:35:00.984810

Depetris, Arick Wierson, Daoud Kuttab, Jesse Edwards, Josh Hammer",,,,,https://www.newsweek.com/womens-global-impact-2025-bridget-ryan-berman-2089128,"Being on a board of directors is more than just a fancy title and compensation package.
Bridget Ryan Berman serves on three boards: Newell Brands, Tanger Factory Outlet Centers and Asbury Automotive Group.
""I was fortunate to have held various executive leadership roles in world-class brands and companies during high-growth periods.
The CEO and Executive leadership team are essential to executing the company's vision and strategic plan.
How can a board of directors be a table of leaders that set about transformational business change at a business?","Being on a board of directors is more than just a fancy title and compensation package. For many, the opportunity to serve on a board of directors allows them to assist in moving a company into the future, enabling the long-term strategic thought that is needed for guiding high-level executives to perform at their peak capabilities.

Bridget Ryan Berman serves on three boards: Newell Brands, Tanger Factory Outlet Centers and Asbury Automotive Group. She has extensive executive experience at brands that are household names including Ralph Lauren, Apple (Chief Operating Officer for Retail), Giorgio Armani and Victoria's Secret Direct (Chief Executive Officer).

All that experience has put Berman in the position of offering advice to those who aspire to be in her position one day. She told Newsweek how she got to where she is today and offered advice for those looking to reach new heights in their career.

Newsweek: How did you get into the role of serving on a board?

Berman: ""I appreciate the value of strong working relationships. Most of my board roles have come by way of recommendations from people who I previously worked with, or who served with me as a director on other boards. Personal references can be extremely powerful, particularly when someone has direct knowledge of your skills and understands the advantages you bring to the boardroom.""

What successes drove you to serving on boards? What are your areas of expertise?

""I was fortunate to have held various executive leadership roles in world-class brands and companies during high-growth periods. My experience has been in consumer and retail businesses where the breadth of responsibility is vast, and the ability to have a meaningful impact is significant. Retail is a dynamic industry with constant change and evolution. I felt prepared having led companies and organizations through large scale transformative growth and understood how to work constructively with CEOs and peer directors.""

Why is the leadership of a board of directors important to a company in ways that can complement a traditional corporate leadership hierarchy?

""I believe in strong partnerships between the board and management, and that theirs is a healthy and productive balance of responsibilities. A board is vital to a company's success. Their role is to set the strategic direction, provide oversight and accountability, and ensure that the company manages both its operations and potential risks effectively, while protecting shareholder interests. The CEO and Executive leadership team are essential to executing the company's vision and strategic plan. They oversee the company's goals, and provide the organizational talent, structure, and resources to deliver expected results. Given the speed by which business is changing and industries are evolving, boards are increasingly interested in understanding how technology and innovation can drive growth, enhance efficiency, and influence future strategies.""

How can a board of directors be a table of leaders that set about transformational business change at a business?

""It starts with building consensus amongst the directors about the future of the company. Boards should dedicate the right amount of time in every meeting to talk about strategy and growth. Though it is not the board's role to direct change in the business, they can be highly influential and encourage management to realize the need or potential. Where I have seen it work best is when there is ongoing honest conversation between management and the board about the future vision. The board should be a helpful resource, particularly when individual directors have had experience in large scale transformation and understand the dynamics and the risks. It requires patience and a nuanced style of management from both sides.""

What have you learned during your time on various boards that you implement as a strategy on others?

""Board governance and effectiveness comes to mind. We are dealing with a broadening range of complex issues, and having the right mix of diverse skills and experience on the board is important. I have focused on improving board performance, spending time on the most critical matters, and ensuring there is organizational succession and readiness to address significant issues and opportunities.""

The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace.
Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May.
“As uninsured rates climb, so too will health care costs for everyone,” said U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.
Editor’s note: This story has been updated to include the number of Virginia enrollees covered by the Aetna health insurance plans leaving the ACA marketplace.","Starting next year, Aetna clients in Virginia and other states will no longer be able to purchase individual or family health insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace. Congress also created associated tax credits that have helped some offset those costs even further. Over 261,000 people in Virginia have Aetna healthcare, according to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services and the soon-to-be extinguished plans cover nearly 5,000 enrollees, as of January of this year.

Aetna is under the CVS umbrella and has participated in the ACA marketplace. Recipients have received emails this summer alerting them of the forthcoming change and the company website outlines it as well.

“As we considered plan options for the future, it became clear we would not be able to provide the same level of value we’ve offered in prior years,” the health insurer’s website stated.

Both the online statement and a request for comment from CVS Health did not clarify what made it “clear” the company felt the need to withdraw, but the shifting federal health care policy landscape could be part of the equation.

Congress has yet to renew ACA tax credits that further help people lower their premium payments and the recently-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not extend the credits either.

As partisan disputes boil, it’s still unclear how new federal law will impact Medicaid in Virginia

Relatedly, the OBBB includes forthcoming changes to hospital funding and Medicaid (another provision of ACA that helps insure pregnant people, children, those with disabilities and lower-income earners).

The Republican-led megabill fielded opposition from Democratic and some Republican federal lawmakers but ultimately passed and was signed by President Donald Trump on July 4. Republican dominance in Congress also threatens the renewal of the ACA tax credits that help people purchase insurance in state marketplaces, which Democrats have championed.

An Aetna spokeswoman did not directly respond when asked if Congress’ pending renewal or failure to renew ACA tax credits had anything to do with the decision. She did reiterate the same statement from the website that CVS remains “committed to helping members make the most of their benefits in 2025.”

An email forwarded to The Mercury by a reader with Aetna insurance outlines how clients will need to shop for a new insurer when the 2026 enrollment period opens in the fall.

“You will get more information and helpful guidance as open enrollment approaches,” the Aetna letter reads.

Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May. Since then, as Congress debated the OBBB, lawmakers and hospital professionals around the nation and in Virginia have expressed concerns about what shrinking health care coverage options might mean across all income brackets.

“As uninsured rates climb, so too will health care costs for everyone,” said U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.

“HMRC is under a lot of pressure help fill the shortfall in tax revenues by cracking down on large companies.","The UK’s HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has reported that US companies may have underpaid taxes amounting to £8.8bn ($11.8bn) in the previous financial year, according to UHY Hacker Young, a national accountancy firm.

This figure marks a 57% increase from the estimated £5.6bn underpayment recorded the year before.

US corporations represent the largest share of tax underpayment among foreign entities, contributing to 46% of the total £19bn in tax underpaid by all international companies operating in the UK.

In light of these findings, HMRC has intensified its scrutiny of major US firms, particularly those in the technology sector.

Some analysts have suggested that these companies are minimising their tax obligations in the UK by reallocating profits to jurisdictions with lower tax rates, such as Dublin.

UHY Hacker Young pointed out that a prevalent strategy used by these firms is known as ‘transfer pricing’.

This involves transactions between subsidiaries, where one entity compensates another for goods and services, including intellectual property rights, potentially leading to reduced taxable income in the UK.

The US government has expressed concerns regarding what it perceives as unfair taxation practices imposed by other countries on American businesses.

The UK’s implementation of a “diverted profit tax” and a digital services tax has previously been identified by the US as examples of such unfair measures.

UHY Hacker Young partner and tax head Phil Kinzett-Evans said: “The amount of tax owed that HMRC suspects that US companies owe is continuing to grow at a scale that HMRC knows it can’t ignore.

“HMRC is under a lot of pressure help fill the shortfall in tax revenues by cracking down on large companies. However, that conflicts with the need to keep the US government onside but not to be seen as too aggressive towards US companies.

“HMRC needs to tread carefully as it faces the challenge of ensuring the UK keeps a good relationship current US administration whilst also investigating US companies for underpaying tax.

In sum – what to know:

SKT goes open source – SK Telecom released AX 3.1 Lite, a mobile-friendly Korean LLM, to an open-source AI hub to promote collaboration and open development.

Built for efficiency – The 7B-parameter model offers strong performance with lower power needs, optimized for mobile deployments and language-heavy apps like call assistants.

Korean LLM expertise – Developed from scratch, the model showcases SKT’s long-term investment in sovereign LLMs and local AI talent, with benchmark scores rivaling much larger models.

Koran carrier SK Telecom (SKT) has taken another step in its AI strategy by releasing AX 3.1 Lite, a compact large language model (LLM) designed for mobile applications, to the open-source AI hub Hugging Face, according to a Korean press report.

The new model, featuring 7 billion parameters, builds on the AX 3.0 Lite previously used in SKT’s A-dot AI call assistant and is part of the telco’s ongoing efforts to optimize LLMs for smartphones.

SK Telecom said AX 3.1 Lite offers Korean language capabilities on par with its larger sibling, AX 4.0 Lite, which has 72 billion parameters. The lightweight version achieved strong benchmark scores — 96% on the Korean language KMMLU2 test and 102% on CLIcK3, which measures cultural understanding, according to the report.

The company emphasized that AX 3.1 Lite was developed from scratch in-house, a continuation of a strategy that began in 2018.

The Korean carrier said the model will enable companies to deploy more efficient, power-conscious AI systems directly on mobile devices, especially where localised language processing is critical.

The model’s release via Hugging Face aims to encourage community feedback and collaboration, the reprot added.

Through its “AI Infrastructure Superhighway” and “AI Pyramid Strategy” initiatives, the Asian telco is investing heavily in AI data centers, cloud-based GPU services and edge computing to support the growing demands of AI applications and services.​

At the core of SK Telecom’s AI ambitions is the development of an “AI Infrastructure Superhighway,” a strategic initiative focused on three main components:​

-AI Data Centers (AIDCs): The carrier is constructing hyperscale AI data centers across South Korea, each designed to exceed 100 megawatts in capacity. These facilities aim to serve as central hubs for AI processing and storage, supporting both domestic and international AI workloads. ​

-GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS): To democratize access to high-performance computing, the company has launched a cloud-based GPU service. This platform allows businesses and developers to utilize powerful GPU resources on-demand, facilitating AI model training and deployment without the need for significant upfront hardware investments. ​

-Edge AI: Recognizing the importance of low-latency processing, the Asian telco is expanding its edge computing capabilities. By integrating AI processing closer to data sources, such as mobile devices and IoT sensors, the company aims to enhance real-time data analysis and decision-making across various applications.

​ SK Telecom previously said it experienced solid revenue growth in its artificial intelligence (AI) businesses, such as AI data centers (AIDC) and AI transformation (AIX), during the first quarter of the year.

In the first quarter, SK Telecom’s AIDC business recorded a 11.1% year-on-year increase, driven by increased data center capacity and utilization rates. AIDC is set to accelerate its push into hyperscale AIDC in the mid to long term, SK Telecom said.

In the AI services domain, the cumulative user base of the ‘A.’ (A-DoT) service surpassed 9 million. Meanwhile, ‘Aster’ (A*), SK Telecom’s global AI agent service, launched open beta testing in the U.S. at the end of March.

ArcelorMittal South Africa (Amsa), which continues to pay heavy prices for government infrastructure and policy failures, may be left with no option but to prepare for the wind down process of its Longs Business, well in advance of September 30, 2025.

This announcement, and despite a forecast of slightly reduced headline earnings losses for the six months to June 30, caused the share price to slump 7.89% to 105 cents on the JSE by Monday afternoon - considering that three years ago the price traded above R5 a share.

On March 31, Amsa announced its decision to wind down the Long Steel Business had been deferred for at least 6 months to September 30 after it received a R1.68 billion funding facility from the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC).

The facility was now fully drawn and would enable the Longs Business to operate through the third quarter. The business would also continue to trade until the end of September, having regard to the commitments made to its customers.

However, so far, “limited” progress was made to redress major structural issues, which was the main aim of the deferral period.

“High imports continue to flood into the domestic market. Transnet's rail performance deteriorated to its lowest levels ever, resulting in significantly elevated operating risk and unaffordable additional costs being borne by the company,” Amsa’s directors said.

The challenges that have faced the group over several years include structural distortions created by the Preferential Pricing System (PPS) and export tax on ferrous scrap in favour of scrap-based steel makers to the disadvantage of integrated steel makers, weak domestic demand, and the lack of growth projects for steel.

There is also insufficient import protection and continued circumvention of tariff protections by local companies, without prosecution.

The rail service performance remained poor with associated, high, globally uncompetitive and unaffordable tariffs. In addition, electricity tariffs were unaffordable and globally uncompetitive, they said.

On two occasions in the past six months, the risk of uncontrolled blast furnace stops arose due to major rail service interruptions, on account of an ""unprecedented spate of cable theft and locomotive failures.""

“Additional unplanned road transport had to be deployed, resulting in higher direct, operational and handling costs of R317 million for the period,” the group's directors said.

Since March, Amsa had been exploring options to address these challenges, while the IDC conducted due diligence into the company, and the government had been pursuing structural interventions, all of which were still ongoing, they said.

“Unless a solution is implemented timeously, and to ensure the orderly closure of the Longs Business as soon as possible after the deferral period, ArcelorMittal South Africa may have no option but to take certain operational steps to prepare for the wind down process well in advance of September 30, 2025.”

Meanwhile, the group predicted that earnings per share would improve 15% to a loss of between R0.82 and R0.93 a share for the six months to June 30, from a loss of R1.09 per share at the same time last year. The full interim results are expected to be released on July 31.

The group said a global cyclical downturn in the steel industry has continued now for almost two years, which is longer than the norm. Global crude steel production fell by 1.3% from January to May 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, according to the World Steel Association.

In South Africa, all sectors except agriculture contributed to a weaker annual GDP outlook, with tough trading conditions in key steel-consuming sectors: construction, automotive, mining, fabrication, and energy and transport.

First half sales volumes were expected to be about 10% down compared to 2024’s first half. Apart from lower demand, sales volumes for flat steel products continued to be affected by high import levels, whilst long steel product sales reflected the uncertainty around its continuation.

Net realised prices in rand terms were anticipated to be more than 5% lower, impacted in part by a stronger rand-dollar exchange rate.

The steel and manufacturing industry, represented by various industry associations, appeared before the portfolio committee responsible for trade, industry and competition on June 4, 2025.

The industry expressed disillusionment with policy developments and dissatisfaction with the continued decline of the steel sector, which is creating a challenging business and investment climate in South Africa.

Imports now represented more than 35% of apparent steel consumption and significantly undermined domestic supply.

These two financial hubs – in Dubai and Riyadh respectively – have become essential destinations.

African banking offices in the Arab world

Three major African banks have recently announced plans to either open or expand offices in these locations.

Even if global banks are present in the Gulf, they can no longer easily manage the entire corridor. This creates opportunities for African banks to step in

South Africa’s Absa Bank and Kenya’s Equity Bank will both establish offices at Dubai’s DIFC in early 2026, while Nigeria’s United Bank for Africa, already present at DIFC, plans to open an additional office at Riyadh’s KAFD by year-end.

“The primary rationale for these banks is following their clients’ growth ambitions. If major corporations are selling in the Middle East, banks must be there too,” says Frédéric Boutet, an associate director at Africa specialists Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

Since 2016, African exports destined for countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – comprising Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar – have grown faster than to any other region: up 145%, compared to 100% for China and 70% for the EU.

Dubai: Gateway to global markets

Equity Bank, ranked as Africa’s 16th-largest financial institution according to The Africa Report’s latest top 300 ranking, sees Dubai as integral to its strategic plans. Its goal is to build value chains across East and Central Africa by connecting these to global markets, with the UAE acting as a key entry point.

Equity CEO James Mwangi, alongside fellow banking chiefs Tony Elumelu (UBA) and Kenny Fihla (Absa Bank), recognises the importance of being present in the Arabian Peninsula. The region is a strategic marketplace where banks’ corporate clients find crucial business opportunities in energy, agriculture, and mining.

“Even if global banks are present in the Gulf, they can no longer easily manage the entire corridor. This creates opportunities for African banks to step in,” says Tijsbert Creemers-Chaturvedi, managing director and senior partner at BCG South Africa.

On 8 July, Emirati holding company NG9 agreed to a deal with authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where Equity Bank and UBA have strong footholds, to finance a copper and cobalt refinery.

In May, Saudi energy firm ACWA pledged to invest R7bn (around $378m) over five years in water and energy projects, under an agreement with South Africa. African banks in the Gulf could act as co-arrangers for these initiatives.

Taking advantage of international bank withdrawals

Tijsbert Creemers-Chaturvedi, who leads BCG’s financial services practice in Africa, notes that major African banks are well-positioned to benefit from the development of these financial hubs, especially as global banks have struggled to sustain their African presence.

“BNP Paribas, Standard Chartered, and Société Générale have closed branches. Even though these banks remain active in the Gulf, they no longer operate seamlessly across the entire Africa-Gulf corridor – African banks can therefore fill this gap.”

International banks see Africa as risky, politically and economically, leaving significant market opportunities open to continental banks.

Gulf nations also offer greater openness to diversified financing compared to their American and Chinese rivals.

A recent Afreximbank report highlights that “GCC investments focus on resource security and economic diversification, while American investment typically emphasises development initiatives and energy challenges. China’s strategy centres on the Belt and Road initiative, expanding markets and acquiring resources to boost trade and connectivity in Asia and Africa”.

A decisive part of African finance now unfolds in Dubai, shaped by East-West dialogue. Here, speed, robust legal frameworks, and deep markets are redefining capital flows

African banks thus stand to gain more than just following their corporate clients. The Middle East doesn’t only import – it invests substantially. Between 2012 and 2022, GCC countries injected $100bn into Africa. Investments between 2022 and 2023 alone reached $113bn, surpassing the previous decade. Over the next five years, investments are expected to range between $20bn and $30bn annually.

Diaspora: A new niche

African banks do not intend to compete directly with local Gulf banks for local customers. Yet, their presence unlocks another important niche: diaspora communities. In 2023, remittances from the Middle East accounted for 27% of total inflows into Africa, overtaking Western Europe’s 23%.

Money transfers from GCC nations to Kenya alone surpassed $3bn, significantly boosting foreign exchange reserves, according to Afreximbank.

Finally, at financial centres such as DIFC or KAFD, African banks aim to gain expertise in structured finance. Mastering these skills will allow them to become lead arrangers and bookrunners in major projects across Africa – roles currently dominated by international banks.

“African banks at DIFC find an ideal environment for creating special-purpose vehicles to structure debt portfolios, securitise trade flows, or set up debt funds, accessing institutional investors, family offices, and advanced compliance platforms,” says Moustafa Mourouvaye, CEO of Brweidge, a structured finance firm operating between Africa, Asia, and the Gulf.

“A decisive part of African finance now unfolds in Dubai, shaped by East-West dialogue. Here, speed, robust legal frameworks, and deep markets are redefining capital flows.”

Firms like Capgemini and HCL Tech are building moats with offshore talent, AI, and IoT expertise.","The global Product Engineering Services (PES) market is on a tear, projected to hit $1.8 trillion by 2030, growing at a 6.8% CAGR fueled by automotive electrification, IoT integration, and the rise of Asia Pacific's talent hubs. This isn't just another tech boom—it's a structural shift toward cost-efficient, AI-driven engineering that's rewriting the rules of product development. For investors, the question isn't whether to allocate capital here, but how quickly to act.

The Drivers: A Perfect Storm of Tech and Talent

The PES market's growth hinges on three pillars:

Automotive Electrification: Automakers are racing to modernize legacy systems for EVs, autonomous features, and “digital-first” consumer expectations. Partnerships like Tata Technologies' collaboration with BMW to build next-gen vehicle platforms are emblematic of this shift. Meanwhile, HCLTech's IoT-enabled vehicle-to-cloud integration and over-the-air updates are cornerstones of modernization.

IoT Integration: IoT isn't just a buzzword—it's a revenue engine. Businesses are embedding connected tech into products, from predictive maintenance systems in factories to telematics in cars. IoT engineering services are booming, with AI and edge computing enabling real-time data analysis.

Asia Pacific Talent Hubs: India's 1,700+ Global Capability Centers (GCCs) are the unsung heroes here. These hubs specialize in product engineering and platform modernization, leveraging 24/7 collaboration, AI-driven test automation, and cost efficiencies. North America leads in market share (thanks to aerospace and advanced manufacturing), but Asia Pacific's talent and scalability are its secret weapon.

The Winners: HCL Tech and Capgemini Are Leading the Charge

The firms best positioned to capitalize on this trend are those with offshore innovation centers and AI-driven engineering at their core. Let's dissect two leaders:

Capgemini: AI as the New Mainframe

Capgemini's Resonance AI Framework is a game-changer. Launched in July 2025, it uses generative AI to accelerate product modernization, with RAISE—a generative AI and AI agents gallery—already contributing 5% of bookings in Q4 2024. Their 6G lab in Gurugram and 5G lab in Mumbai are R&D powerhouses, while their CAALM (AI-Assisted Legacy Modernization) solution automates mainframe refactoring, cutting costs and time for clients like a U.S. life insurer that modernized its COBOL-based systems.

Capgemini's ESG commitments also stand out: 98% renewable energy usage, a 35% emissions reduction since 2019, and partnerships with tech giants like AWS and Mistral AI. This isn't just about profit—it's about future-proofing for a greener, smarter world.

HCL Tech: IoT and Automotive as Growth Engines

HCL's IoT-driven vehicle-to-cloud integration and over-the-air updates are direct responses to automakers' demands for agility. Their focus on model-based systems engineering and AI-driven test automation aligns with the need for faster, more reliable product cycles.

HCL's Global Delivery Model, with hubs in India and Eastern Europe, ensures scalability. Their partnership with Tata Technologies (BMW) and focus on cost-efficient talent pools give them an edge in a market where clients demand both innovation and affordability.

Why Act Now? The Clock Is Ticking

The urgency here is twofold:

1. Demand is outpacing supply: Automotive and IoT firms are desperate to modernize, but legacy systems are a bottleneck. Companies like Capgemini and HCL are the only ones with the tools to solve this at scale.

2. AI is a multiplier, not a fad: Generative AI isn't just a gimmick—it's slashing modernization timelines and costs. Firms that ignore this risk being left behind.

The Investment Case

This isn't a recommendation to “buy the dip.” It's a call to allocate capital now to companies at the forefront of PES modernization. Key metrics to watch:

- Capgemini: Track their AI bookings growth and CAALM adoption rates.

- HCL Tech: Monitor IoT and automotive revenue streams.

The window for cheap entry is narrowing. As automotive giants like GE Aerospace (which invested $1B in additive manufacturing) and IoT-heavy industries ramp up spending, PES providers will be the silent beneficiaries.

Final Take: Don't Miss the Boat

The PES market's 6.8% CAGR isn't just a number—it's a mandate. Firms like Capgemini and HCL Tech are building moats with offshore talent, AI, and IoT expertise. For investors, this is a decade-long opportunity. The question is: Will you be on the boat or left staring at the wake?

Action Items:

1. Add Capgemini and HCL Tech to your watchlist.

2. Monitor sector trends:

3. Act before the herd catches on—these companies are already ahead, but the best gains come early.

Shares of Monogram more than doubled to $6.70 in premarket trading. WHY IT’S IMPORTANT

Medical device makers, including larger peers Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson are seeking to strengthen their robotic surgery offerings.

The global market for robotic surgery devices is expected to be worth nearly $16 billion by the end of this decade, according to data analytics firm GlobalData.

The deal will allow Warsaw, Indiana-based Zimmer to broaden its robotics platform and gain access to Monogram’s semi-autonomous knee replacement technology, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March 2025. Zimmer expects to integrate Monogram’s technology and launch fully autonomous surgical robots and additional applications beyond prosthetic knee replacement by 2027.

BY THE NUMBERS

Monogram stockholders will receive $4.04 per share in cash upfront, which represents a premium of 22.8% to its last close. The terms also include up to $12.37 per share in contingent value rights, dependent on certain milestones being met by 2030.

Zimmer Biomet plans to fund the deal with a combination of cash and available debt financing.

WHAT’S NEXT

The deal is expected to close later this year. Zimmer expects the deal to be neutral to adjusted earnings per share until 2027, and accretive to earnings from 2028 onward.

The company stated that the update to its pulsed field ablation (PFA) platform reflects its commitment to advancing PFA innovation. Its update came on the back of real-world clinical practice.

Johnson & Johnson MedTech’s Varipulse platform treats AFib with a single device that combines PFA with the Carto 3 mapping system. Its variable-loop, multi-electrode Varipulse catheter uses laser-cut nitinol tubing for its loop shape. The platform also includes TruPulse generator and the Carto 3 3D cardiac mapping system.

The company joined Medtronic and Boston Scientific as companies with PFA technologies approved for treating AFib when it received an FDA nod in November 2024. Commercial activity hit a snag earlier this year when the company temporarily halted all U.S. cases using Varipulse in January. After reviewing four reported neurovascular events, the company resumed sales a month later.

At present, the company reports that it has now surpassed 10,000 Varipulse procedures across the U.S., Europe, Canada, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Korea, Taiwan and Australia. It also notes that the platform has sustained a neurovascular adverse event rate of less than 0.5% to date.

Part 1 — Less than half of client-facing employees in public accounting were CPAs last year

The share of CPA-licensed staff working in public accounting firms dropped below 50% in 2024, according to Inside Public Accounting’s latest Data Dive. Research indicates that from 2020 to 2024, the average percentage of staff holding CPA licenses at said firms fell from 56% to 48.4%. At larger firms — where advisory and consulting services continue to expand as private equity money flows in — just over four in 10 (41.5%) of staff held CPA licenses in 2024.

Despite the trend occurring more frequently at larger firms, the decline spans firms of all sizes. This suggests a systemic change in credentialing trends, recruiting strategies and the makeup of public accounting teams — ideas CFOs have shared their thoughts on extensively.

As the accounting profession adapts to talent shortages, how the industry has done so has received mixed reviews. States are now lessening education requirements, while companies have been trying to change the way accountants are perceived through entertainment media and, most recently, highly criticized advertising campaigns from massive technology providers and public accounting firms.

On the inside, firms are increasingly hiring professionals without CPA licenses to fill roles once filled by credentialed or soon-to-be credentialed accountants. Many are also investing in AI tools to automate routine work in audit, tax and financial transformation, further shifting the types of skills they prioritize in new hires. It’s also worth noting that this shift is happening despite a recent, modest uptick in undergraduate accounting enrollment following several years of decline.

For CFOs, these staffing changes have implications beyond the firms themselves. Many finance leaders who rely on these firms for core services like audit, outsourced accounting and consulting expect a certain level of technical expertise. As firms broaden their talent mix, CFOs may need to re-evaluate how they engage with providers and what credentials and capabilities they prioritize when buying services from public accounting firms.

Singh pointed to the strength of Levi’s brand and customer relationships as key drivers of confidence. “The brand has never been stronger,” he told interviewers.

A successful Circle trust bank would validate the model, encouraging competitors to seek their own national trust charter crypto approvals.","Is Circle launching a digital currency bank?

Circle, the fintech firm behind USDC, has filed an application with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to establish America’s first digital currency bank, a national trust institution that would bring stablecoins fully into the federally regulated financial system.

The proposed entity, First National Digital Currency Bank, wouldn’t operate like a traditional consumer bank. It wouldn’t offer deposits or loans. Instead, it would focus on Circle USDC trust bank functions: safeguarding USDC USDCUSD reserves, managing cash and short-term Treasury holdings and offering digital asset custody services to institutional clients.

Circle is becoming a serious contender in global finance. In fact, with over $62 billion in USDC in circulation, it’s the second-largest stablecoin globally.

Until now, reserve management relied on third-party custodians like BlackRock and BNY Mellon. By pursuing a Circle OCC charter application, Circle aims to internalize control, streamline operations, minimize risk and strengthen transparency.

It also aligns Circle with current legislation. The GENIUS Act, passed by the US Senate in June 2025, sets a new bar for regulated stablecoin infrastructure: 1:1 reserve backing, monthly attestations and federal oversight.

By applying for a federal trust charter, Circle shows it’s ready to meet (and help define) future US standards for digital currency banking.

Did you know? In 2024, USDC overtook Tether’s USDt (USDT) in onchain transaction volume (despite being smaller in market capitalization).

Why Circle’s Federal Charter matters for stablecoins and institutional crypto

A federal charter gives Circle regulatory credibility, full control over USDC reserves and the ability to offer secure custody services to institutions.

A stronger regulatory footing

A federal OCC trust charter would immediately improve Circle’s position.

Rather than operating as a BitLicense-only entity or depending on state-by-state clarity, Circle would become a federally regulated bank subject to OCC and Federal Reserve oversight.

For institutions wary of dealing with crypto-native firms, this change demonstrates compliance, permanence and trust, following in the steps taken by Anchorage Digital (currently the only other firm with a crypto bank charter) but with far broader implications, given USDC’s adoption.

Analysts suggest the charter could bolster Circle investor confidence, enabling broader partnerships across banking, fintech and capital markets.

Full control over USDC reserve management

Gaining a national trust charter would bring Circle’s $62.1 billion of reserves in-house. This means Circle can directly oversee the assets that back its stablecoin, adding operational efficiency while reducing counterparty risk.

As trust in stablecoins increasingly hinges on how reserves are held and reported, this move gives Circle stronger guarantees around security, liquidity and compliance with both US and international standards, like Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) compliance and the GENIUS Act stablecoin regulation.

Opening new institutional services

As explored, Circle’s new trust wouldn’t offer deposits or retail lending. It would, however, unlock a suite of business-to-business opportunities.

With federal approval, Circle could expand its digital asset custody services — not just for USDC, but for tokenized assets, corporate treasuries and other blockchain-based financial instruments.

In doing so, Circle would develop into payment infrastructure, bridging traditional finance and Web3.

As firms across the globe, from Europe to the United Arab Emirates, pursue licenses (such as the Abu Dhabi crypto license), Circle’s US-based trust bank could serve as a model of how to structurally align with both US stablecoin legislation and global compliance norms.

Did you know? Circle earned roughly $1.7 billion in interest income in 2024 — almost all from holding USDC reserve assets.

Is it the right time for a Circle federally regulated bank?

With investor confidence surging after Circle’s blockbuster initial public offering (IPO) and new federal rules giving stablecoins a regulatory path forward, the conditions are finally right to launch a fully regulated digital currency bank.

Circle’s June 5 debut on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker: CRCL) sent a clear message that markets are ready to back a regulated stablecoin issuer.

The stock opened at $69 — more than doubling its $31 listing price — and briefly topped $100 before settling at $83. That day, Circle NYSE IPO CRCL closed with a market cap near $6.9 billion and nearly 200% growth, reflecting soaring demand for companies that sit at the intersection of TradFi and DeFi.

At the same time, Washington gave its strongest nod yet to stablecoin regulation. As touched upon, the GENIUS Act stablecoin regulation, passed by the Senate just 12 days after Circle’s IPO, set out comprehensive guardrails: 1:1 dollar backing, real-time attestations and oversight by federal banking regulators such as the OCC.

Under Acting Comptroller Rodney Hood, the agency has signaled support for responsible crypto integration, especially through the Circle OCC charter application process.

With this in mind, Circle’s decision to pursue America’s first digital currency bank feels like a precisely calculated one.

Did you know? Stablecoins facilitated an estimated $27.6 trillion in transactions in 2024, surpassing the combined volume of Visa and Mastercard by about 7.7%

Impacts of the Circle federally regulated bank

Circle’s bank could unlock institutional access, fuel USDC adoption and transmute how stablecoins fit into the global financial system.

Bridging stablecoins and traditional institutions

As a federally regulated bank, Circle would act as connective tissue between crypto and established finance. Pension funds, asset managers and insurers often require federally supervised partners before engaging in digital assets. A Circle digital currency bank, governed under OCC oversight, could unlock these channels.

Moreover, just as money market funds became mainstream after tighter rules boosted trust, Circle aims to make USDC reserve management a benchmark for stability.

Accelerating real-world stablecoin use

One key advantage of a Circle stablecoin bank is flawless integration. Institutional-grade digital asset custody services would support tokenized securities, real-time payments and programmable finance.

With partners like Visa, Stripe and BlackRock already experimenting with Circle payment infrastructure, the next phase is deeper adoption — OAuth-style plug-and-play modules that let banks and fintechs offer USDC without friction.

Industry-wide impacts

Circle’s charter could pave the way for a new category of federally recognized crypto bank charter holders.

Legacy firms like JPMorgan and Bank of America are reportedly working on jointly issuing a stablecoin. A successful Circle trust bank would validate the model, encouraging competitors to seek their own national trust charter crypto approvals.

In terms of the broader impact, we can expect stronger interoperability, better compliance frameworks and greater Circle investor confidence. Whether for regulators, institutions or global partners (like those pursuing MiCA compliance or Abu Dhabi crypto license equivalents), Circle’s move sets a precedent that stablecoins can evolve into bank-grade, regulated infrastructure.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:18:58.049283

CPI inflation this week Aside from the earnings kick off, there are two major economic reports to drop this week, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Tuesday.
CPI inflation rose in May to 2.4%, marking the first time since January it has gone up.","Also, the CPI inflation report for June comes out on Tuesday.

While there have been a smattering of second quarter earnings trickling out in the past two weeks, they begin to roll out in earnest this week, starting, as always, with large banks and financial companies.

On Tuesday morning, five mega banks report Q2 earnings, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK), and State Street (NYSE:STT). Also, the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) releases its first quarter results.

On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), PNC (NYSE:PNC), Bank (NYSE:MTB), and First Horizon (NYSE:FHN) follow suit.

Other notable banks to report this week are US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG) on Thursday. Finally, American Express (NYSE:AXP), Ally (NYSE:ALLY), Charles Schwab (NASDAQ:SCHW), Truist (NYSE:TFC), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF) and Comerica (NYSE:CMA) report Friday.

What should we expect? Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck anticipates investment banking, trading volumes, and higher asset levels to lead the Q2 growth. M&A activity was up 30% in Q2 compared to the same quarter a year ago, while trading volume rose 49% year-over-year, wrote Graseck in a research note, according to Seeking Alpha. In addition, the Nasdaq gained some 13% in Q2 while the S&P 500 gained roughly 4%.

These results should spur higher revenue and earnings from these banks and financial firms. Banks could also see lower loss provisions due to an improved economic outlook compared to Q1.

Netflix expected to have strong quarter

While banks are in the spotlight, there are some other significant names to report earnings this week, starting with streaming leader Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) on Thursday. Analysts expect earnings of $7.06 per share on revenue of $11.04 billion.

Analysts at Wedbush are even more bullish, calling for earnings of $7.18 per share on revenue of $11.16 billion.

“Given the strong backdrop heading into the second half of 2025, we believe Netflix will be well-positioned to exceed its Q2 guidance and provide solid guidance for the remainder of the year,” Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese wrote in a research note, according to Kiplinger’s.

Other notable earnings this week are grocery store chain Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) on Tuesday; semiconductor firm ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), United Airlines (NYSE:UAL), and consumer staple Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) on Wednesday; Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT), GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE), and PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) on Thursday, and chemical company 3M (NYSE:MMM) on Friday.

CPI inflation this week

Aside from the earnings kick off, there are two major economic reports to drop this week, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Tuesday. CPI inflation rose in May to 2.4%, marking the first time since January it has gone up.

With the tariffs in full effect, economists expect inflation to rise again in June, with the consensus targeting 2.7% inflation and 3.0% core CPI inflation. The core CPI would be up from 2.8% in May.

The direction of inflation, and the size of any move one way or another, could have a major impact on what the Federal Reserve does with interest rates when it meets on July 30.

The other key economic report to come this week is Retail Sales on Thursday. In May, retail sales actually declined by 0.9%, performing worse than expected, as consumers were cautious in uncertain economic conditions and wary of price hikes. In June, economists project retail sales to increase 0.2%.",https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/banks_1554265923-150x150.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:20:48.742769

Also in May, the company shared that Berkshire Hathaway will no longer have a seat on the board, emphasizing that the move was not related to any disagreement with the company or its board.

Financial analysts report that Kraft Heinz is valued at $31.33 billion. In April, the company reported a 6.4% year-over-year decrease in net sales and an 8.1% slide in operating income. The company will announce its second quarter fiscal results on July 30.

A second center in the Netherlands specializes in medical nutrition products, such as supplements for cancer patients.
Danone is also using artificial intelligence to study the more than 100 trillion microorganisms that make up the microbiota.
That means production must be efficient to avoid passing excess costs on to the market.","Danone is close to meeting its global sugar-reduction target in Brazil. A new version of its children’s product Danoninho, set to launch in August, will help align the Brazilian portfolio with the company’s goal: by 2025, 95% of its children’s products must contain no more than 10% sugar. Currently, one cup contains 11.5% sugar, above the World Health Organization’s recommendation that sugar make up no more than 10% of total calorie intake.

“This reduction couldn’t come at the expense of flavor, otherwise people would stop buying,” said Isabelle Esser, Danone’s executive vice president for human resources, research and innovation, food quality and safety. She said the change in formula reflects investments in innovations using fermentation cultures that help deliver texture, flavor, and natural sweetness.

In 2024, the company invested €447 million in research and development, a 12.3% increase from 2023, according to its financial report. Danone’s global innovation team has 1,700 people, including 45 in Brazil. The country ranks as Danone’s 10th-largest market, with estimated annual revenue of $1 billion. The U.S. leads the ranking with $6 billion, followed by China with $3 billion.

Danone’s main revenue sources are dairy and plant-based beverages, specialized nutrition, and bottled water, including brands like Evian. “Brazil is considered a strategic market with strong growth potential,” said Gustavo Alvarez, director of research and innovation for Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay.

Founded 106 years ago to help address childhood digestive issues through food, Danone has recently focused on targeted nutrition. One recent launch in Indonesia includes ingredients that enhance iron absorption, helping treat anemia.

In China, the company introduced a beverage designed to restore gut microbiota diversity—microorganisms in the digestive system—as a way to promote longevity.

Much of Danone’s research is conducted at the Paris-Saclay science and technology cluster, nicknamed the “Silicon Valley of France”, where it operates a research center focused on dairy and plant-based foods. The company developed 130 products there last year and expects to match that output in 2025.

The 21,000-square-meter facility includes laboratories with 1,900 types of fermentation cultures, a pilot factory, and testing rooms where consumers sample innovations and share feedback. A second center in the Netherlands specializes in medical nutrition products, such as supplements for cancer patients.

Danone is also using artificial intelligence to study the more than 100 trillion microorganisms that make up the microbiota. These findings are analyzed at D-Lab in Singapore, which also handles open data analysis. The digital innovation lab has received over €30 million in funding over the past five years.

Biotechnology investments come at a time when global food systems face major challenges, including limited natural resources to produce both animal and plant-based protein. “Science is emerging as an alternative. But most consumers aren’t willing to pay more for sustainable or low-carbon products, it’s just a bonus to them,” Ms. Esser noted.

That means production must be efficient to avoid passing excess costs on to the market. At Danone’s automated plant in Bailleul, France, 5 million yogurt cups are produced daily, 96% of which are consumed domestically, where yogurt is typically eaten as dessert. In the first quarter, Danone’s global sales rose 0.8% to €6.84 billion.

ArcelorMittal South Africa is in last-minute talks with the government to save its struggling steel plants from shutting down, hoping to secure the future for 3,500 workers.

What does this mean?

ArcelorMittal’s South African division is facing tough times, with its long steel operations on the brink due to weak local demand and stiff competition. High electricity prices and inefficient freight logistics worsen the situation, pushing the company toward controversial plant closures. Government discussions are ongoing to prevent these closures, even after previous financial relief from the Industrial Development Corporation. Imports now supply over 35% of local steel needs, and with faltering logistics services, ArcelorMittal's challenges are growing. The firm showed slight improvement in expected headline losses per share, but sales volumes fell 10% in early 2025. Their half-year financial results, due July 31, will reveal more.

Why should I care?

For markets: Industry staples under pressure.

ArcelorMittal's troubles highlight broader issues in South Africa's industrial sector. Escalating operational costs and import dominance are red flags for similar firms, potentially reshaping which sectors investors should monitor. Steel, a backbone for construction and manufacturing, now demands careful watch amid global competition and local inefficiencies.

The bigger picture: Shifting foundations in global trade.

The challenges faced by ArcelorMittal underscore larger trends in global trade dynamics. With China’s exports unsettling markets and local operations struggling, it's a wake-up call for international businesses and governments to rethink strategies.

Zimmer Biomet’s move signals growing confidence in surgical robotics, snapping up Monogram Technologies and its FDA-approved semi-autonomous knee replacement system. The deal puts Zimmer Biomet head-to-head with the likes of Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic, both eager to expand their medical tech footprint. Monogram’s rapid-fire FDA green light for its knee tech just four months back, plus plans for wider robot-assisted surgeries, could help Zimmer leapfrog into the next wave of healthcare innovation. Investors took notice: Monogram shares more than doubled after the news, trading up to $6.70 premarket.

“Investors lapped it up and Kraft Heinz hit a maximum enterprise value of $140bn in 2017.
Alongside the first-quarter numbers, Kraft Heinz also cut its 2025 outlook across a range of metrics to factor in the potential upward pressure on input-cost inflation from changes in tariffs.
Kellogg demerger “There can be no assurance that the company’s assessment process will result in any transaction, or any assurance as to its outcome or timing,” Kraft Heinz said in a statement in May as it revealed the strategic transaction proposition.
“We view a potential spin of the lower growth and lower-margin retail businesses as a way to unlock value within the higher growth and higher-margin remaining businesses.” ""Ill-fated 2015 merger comes to fore amid Kraft Heinz spin-off speculation"" was originally created and published by Just Drinks, a GlobalData owned brand.","Smith said the Stifel analysts believe the faster-growing assets to remain would include Kraft Heinz's North America retail ""accelerate"" platforms, the company's global away-from-home unit and its emerging markets businesses. The assets spun off could house the retail portions of the company’s ""protect"" and ""balance"" platforms.

Stifel's analysts quantified the accelerate platforms as including condiments, ready-meals brands Mac & Cheese and Ore-Ida, plus snacking lines such as Lunchables and Delimex.

The assets that could be spun off would include Oscar Mayer meats, Jell-O desserts, drinks brands Capri-Sun and Kool-Aid, cheese with Kraft and Velveeta, plus coffee, as in Maxwell House and Gevalia.

Meanwhile, Peter McDonald, a food-industry consultant and former General Mills executive of 20-plus years, weighed in on the failed merger angle of 2015 in what he described as one of the “darkest chapters in CPG food during my career”.

McDonald explained his thoughts in a LinkedIn post: “The new entity pursued a new-to-the-industry aggressive margin expansion playbook that sent competitors chasing ‘zero-based budgeting’ and other nonsensical corporate initiatives in a desperate attempt to avoid being gobbled up themselves.

“Investors lapped it up and Kraft Heinz hit a maximum enterprise value of $140bn in 2017. Since then, food-industry reality has reasserted itself and the margin extraction from innovation, marketing, talent, and pricing aggression has taken its toll,” he wrote, putting Kraft Heinz’s current enterprise value at $50bn.

And acknowledging the reports of a spin-off are only based on speculation at this point, he added: “Now the company may be broken up into constituent parts not unlike things were when the whole fiasco started”.

Sales pressure

Kraft Heinz’s 2024 reported sales dropped 3% to $25.85bn, with organic growth down 2.1% in what CEO Abrams-Rivera described as “a challenging year with our top-line results coming in below our expectations”.

Net income fell to $2.74bn, from the $2.86bn booked for 2023. The company also reported a 63.2% slump in full-year operating profit to $1.7bn, which was linked to $3.7bn in non-cash impairment losses.

It was a poor performance echoed in the opening quarter of 2025, too. Net sales dropped 6.4% on a reported basis and declined 4.7% in organic terms to just shy of $7bn. In the three months to 29 March, operating income decreased 8.1% to $1.2bn.

Net income stood at $712m versus $801m a year earlier.

Alongside the first-quarter numbers, Kraft Heinz also cut its 2025 outlook across a range of metrics to factor in the potential upward pressure on input-cost inflation from changes in tariffs.

Kellogg demerger

“There can be no assurance that the company’s assessment process will result in any transaction, or any assurance as to its outcome or timing,” Kraft Heinz said in a statement in May as it revealed the strategic transaction proposition.

“The company has not set a timetable for completion of this process and does not intend to make any further announcements regarding the process unless and until it determines that further disclosure is appropriate or necessary.”

Picking up on the WSJ report, TD Cowen analyst Robert Moskow estimated the likely valuation of the part of the Kraft Heinz grocery business spin-off at $14.5bn, short of the $20bn put forward by the publication.

He, too, linked his observations to the Kellogg demerger. “Bankers and board members of the food industry certainly have noticed the value capture of the 2023 Kellogg split up. After accounting for the Mars and Ferrero acquisitions of the two parts, investors will have realised 41% since the spin, while consumer staples stocks (by our math) fell 6% and fundamentals deteriorated due to changes in consumer preferences and external factors like GLP-1s,” Moskow wrote in a research note.

The TD Cowen analyst also speculated a buyer might step in – whether that’s Kraft Heinz’s intention or not – to snap up the offload, naming McCormick as a potential suitor.

“Our sum-of-the-parts analysis indicates 11% upside to KHC's current enterprise value based on eight times EV/EBITDA for grocery and 10.5x EV/EBITDA for sauces, condiments and spreads,” Moskow suggested.

“However, we could see another 20% upside if a strategic acquirer steps up to buy the sauces and condiments business (about 44% of KHC sales), which will look a lot like the original pre-merger Heinz business of 2013. For example, we see a good strategic fit with McCormick, which has been expanding into the condiments space for several years through tack-on deals, and a high degree of EPS accretion.”

Moskow added to his thesis by explaining that “mega-mergers in food have low success rates and that ‘depth’ tends to beat ‘breadth’”.

He continued: “The skill set and investment requirements to succeed in disparate parts of the grocery store (e.g. refrigerated, frozen, shelf-stable, and snacks) tend to differ.

“We believe that food companies with focused portfolios and category leadership (e.g. Hershey) have a better chance of long-term success than diversified companies trying to leverage operating and marketing capabilities across a wide range of categories.”

Back to 2015

A common theme emanating from food-industry analysts is the throw back to the pre-2015 merger, what AllianceBernstein’s Alexia Howard deemed as a “reversal”.

“When we looked into the relative growth rates of the legacy Heinz company since the companies were merged in 2015, it looks as though the legacy Heinz business has grown retail sales at a 5.3% CAGR over the past decade, while the legacy Kraft brands have grown at only 2%,” Howard wrote in a research note.

“Looking at how the company could break up might mean that the remaining faster-growing company comprises the 25% of companywide sales in international markets plus another 30% of the 75% of the US sales for a total of around 47.5% of companywide sales.”

Howard explained further: “Looking at how the sales could break down, it seems that the faster-growing remaining company could represent around 47.5% of company-wide sales. Clearly, the margins in the international markets are significantly lower than in North America, which could mean that 38.2% of the total company’s adjusted EBITDA of $6.36bn in 2024 potentially sits with the faster-growing remaining company, while the remaining 61.8% sits with the spin-off.”

The Stifel analysts added: “The hypothetical slower growth ‘Spin Co’ would incorporate the retail protect platform featuring a projected low-single digit, ten-year, industry CAGR, high gross margins and low private-label penetration, as well as the retail balance commoditised business platform featuring a flat projected ten-year industry CAGR, low gross margins, and high private-label penetration.

“We view a potential spin of the lower growth and lower-margin retail businesses as a way to unlock value within the higher growth and higher-margin remaining businesses.”

In a world where business decisions are ultimately based on revenue, sales and profits, circular business models are often siloed in sustainability strategies. To mitigate this reality, many fashion businesses are shifting their success metrics to provide clear, quantifiable evidence of how these models unlock resilience and competitiveness.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s latest project — The Fashion ReModel — is working with leading brands, from high-street to high-end, on what it will take to implement circular business models at scale and begin to make the economics work, while also targeting key intervention points to improve commercial viability.

One year into the project, insights reveal which success metrics are most effective for building a compelling business case that drives internal buy-in and brings stakeholders on board.

Establish a revenue-based ambition for circular business models

Resale, rental, repair and remaking models enable businesses to offer new services, providing multiple revenue streams from one product. At the same time, costs can be reduced due to savings from better resource productivity and risk reduction. What the industry is missing is a meaningful metric to demonstrate the contribution of these models to a business’ overall revenue.

Participants of The Fashion ReModel are working towards their own revenue ambitions to increase the percentage of their total revenue derived from circular business models. By using gross percentage revenue, these brands and retailers have moved the success of circular business models into the core of their businesses, with a clear metric to monitor and align around.

H&M Group, for example, has invested in resale models to create additional growth. In 2024, resell sales represented 0.6 percent of H&M Group’s total turnover, up from 0.3 percent in 2022. Contributing to this growth is Sellpy, Europe’s largest secondhand clothing peer-to-peer platform. Sellpy has significantly increased its revenue contribution to H&M, doubling its share since 2022.

Identify new ways to articulate value — starting with customer benefits

In today’s linear system, the profit margins of circular business models can appear lower when compared like-for-like with linear models. The Fashion ReModel partnered with the NYU Stern Center for Sustainable Business to identify several benefits areas that showcase how circular models can drive business resilience in ways businesses aren’t currently tracking.

One of the critical areas identified is customer benefits. Circular business models offer an opportunity to diversify the relationship with the customer — improving loyalty, engagement and acquisition. Businesses can rethink their customer experiences, designing touchpoints beyond a single product sale.

Arc’teryx, for example, is capitalizing on this opportunity to tap into new customer bases. Its platform for resale and repair services, ReBIRD, has doubled its business year-on-year. Customers can visit ReBIRD Service Centers in stores to assess, wash or repair their product, keeping clothing in the loop and out of landfill.

Quantify the climate mitigation opportunity

With over 500 textiles, apparel, and footwear companies committed to science-based targets or commitments, circular business models offer an opportunity to deliver and demonstrate progress on ambitions by displacing upstream production and keeping products in use for longer, thereby cutting emissions.

Some organizations participating in The Fashion ReModel are using a combination of climate metrics to quantify this impact and further strengthen the business case. Absolute emissions, in particular, is the only metric able to evidence whether businesses are on track to meet decarbonization ambitions.

Take Coach’s Soho denim bag, a product that has been both commercially successful and lowered carbon emissions. It was created by two brands with a long history of reuse and repair. Tapestry (the parent company of Coach) partnered with Bank & Vogue (Canada’s largest secondhand clothing trader) to demonstrate how remaking products out of post-consumer existing denim has a lower environmental impact.

To quantify this, Tapestry commissioned a life-cycle assessment which found that Bank & Vogue’s repurposed denim has up to an 80 percent reduction in GHG emissions compared with conventional first-use denim. With this data, Tapestry can show this product’s ability to help meet its ambitious goal to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.

Largest expected beats, misses

Analysts predict Expand Energy Corp. will post the widest normalized EPS beat against expectations in its second-quarter earnings report on July 29, with the predicted $1.34 per share well outpacing the 1 cent normalized EPS reported in the same quarter of 2024.

Albemarle Corp., meanwhile, is forecast to post the largest annual decline in second-quarter earnings, swinging to a normalized loss per share of 67 cents from EPS of 4 cents a year earlier. In a first-quarter earnings release, Albemarle maintained its fiscal 2025 earnings outlook, citing exemptions on tariffs for certain critical minerals that offered a degree of certainty amid an unclear global trade picture.

Most of Magnificent 7 likely to grow as smaller companies struggle

The S&P 500's largest stocks at the end of the second quarter — NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. — are all expected to post normalized EPS gains year over year on higher revenues, according to Market Intelligence data. The companies are all part of the market-driving ""Magnificent Seven"" group, that also includes Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc.

Analysts predict Meta's normalized EPS will rise by about 13% to $5.83, though Tesla's earnings are forecast to fall by more than 19% on an expected drop in revenue.

He’s expected to testify about fallout at Facebook’s parent company from the Cambridge Analytica data mining scandal, in a trial starting Wednesday at the state’s Chancery Court. Meta settled similar class action claims in a California federal court in 2022.

The company may view the derivative case as good for them, win or lose. The claims at issue are notoriously difficult to prove, and the trial comes as Meta explores other states for its corporate home in the wake of unpopular Chancery rulings blamed for pushing Tesla Inc., Dropbox Inc., and other companies out of Delaware.

“Maybe they think the possible threat of them also leaving is enough to sway the court to rule their way and they don’t need to settle anymore,” Southern Methodist University law professor Carliss Chatman said. “Or maybe they want a bad decision so they can justify to the shareholders why they’re moving.”

‘Caremark’ Claims

The main claims in the trial are named for the 1996 Chancery ruling in In re Caremark Int’l Inc. Derivative Litig., which set parameters for oversight liability under Delaware law.

A group of pension funds allege Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg led Facebook to violate a 2012 Federal Trade Commission consent order regarding data sharing. Facebook’s board also failed to monitor the platform’s compliance, they say. They also accuse Zuckerberg of insider trading.

The Delaware lawsuit predates the company’s $5 billion settlement with the FTC in 2019 over policies that allowed Cambridge Analytica, a UK consulting firm linked to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, to acquire data from 87 million Facebook users. The pension funds say the board approved the accord to shield Zuckerberg from personal liability.

The FTC’s fine may have been crucial to the court’s 2023 decision allowing the claims to survive a motion to dismiss, but Zuckerberg’s and Sandberg’s high-profile personalities also likely advanced the case, Chatman said.

When corporate leaders’ identities become entwined with the branding, “it kind of makes sense that the Caremark claims should survive, because they give the public the perception that they are more aware and more involved in the company than a typical CEO,” she said. “It feels more like things are their personal decisions.”

Facebook thrived after reaching the FTC settlement, according to the defendants. It invested over $8 billion in its privacy program and preserved Zuckerberg’s reputation, they said.

“Cambridge Analytica was decidedly a traumatic episode for Facebook and its stockholders,” they said. “But it was the product of Cambridge Analytica’s studied deceit—not remotely the product of the bad faith inattention of Facebook’s fiduciaries.”

Evidence and Guidance

Earlier this year, the court sanctioned Sandberg over deleted emails. How the court handles the evidence will be interesting, said Joshua Newcomer of McKool Smith.

“The genesis of Caremark is lack of controls, right? So what does it say, if one of the board members is using personal email and the other board members go along with that, about the overall narrative of control?” Corporate attorneys and their clients want to know what remedies the court could impose if it finds the evidence points to a legal violation, he said.

“I really am going to be looking to see whether the Texas courts take any guidance from the Delaware courts regarding the appropriate relief at the end of a Caremark trial, particularly where the company has already made some adjustments, and whether that’s good evidence or bad evidence for the company,” Newcomer said. “And then what it means in terms of any order for remedial oversight requirements at the company, as opposed to just monetary damages.”

Other companies shouldn’t have anything to worry about so long as their internal controls are implemented in good faith, he said.

Dexit Drama

The trial is being overseen by Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, who took over the case in March without explanation, years into litigation that had been before Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster.

The two judges have been lauded as “fearless,” but they’ve also weathered personal attacks from Elon Musk and other critics who believe their rulings illustrate a bias toward minority shareholders.

The venture capital firm co-founded by Meta director Marc Andreessen, who’s expected to testify during trial, cited “an unprecedented level of subjectivity” from the Chancery Court in its decision to relocate to Nevada.

Delaware lawmakers rewrote its corporate statutes in the last couple years in response to rulings by McCormick and Laster. Public records showed Meta executives participated in backroom meetings that led to a new law this year that lowered judge-made guardrails around insider deals, narrowed the definition of a “controlling stockholder,” and limited shareholder access to director texts and emails.

Meta might feel confident because of the unusual outside pressure that any judge in McCormick’s situation would have to acknowledge, said Renee Zaytsev of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP.

The tech giant might expect “that a court is going to be wary about putting out another decision against another really big company,” she said.

However McCormick eventually rules—a decision would follow months after post-trial arguments—the stakes are high for Delaware’s attempts to portray itself as balancing the needs of shareholders with those of corporate leaders.

A pro-Meta outcome would send a strong signal that Delaware is pro-company. With a ruling against Meta, however, “I think you’re going to hear renewed discussions about how Delaware remains an unfriendly place for companies,” Zaytsev said.

Digital sales have proven to be crucial to grocery industry growth over the past year.
Albertsons launched its first-party digital experiences through its app just four years ago, and has been working to catch up to its competitors since then, Jill Pavlovich, SVP of digital shopping experiences at Albertsons, who oversees the grocer’s app, website, and in-store digital offerings, told Retail Brew.
Digital native: Four platforms—e-commerce, loyalty, pharmacy and health, and its mobile app—have been key to its blossoming digital business, Sankaran said in January.
Pavlovich is hopeful that customers will be receptive to digital in-store screens, though she noted the grocer has had “varying successes” with other innovations.","Since its highly publicized breakup with Kroger in December, Albertsons has been on a journey to prove that it’s just fine on its own.

The grocer has managed to get its “mojo” back, per former CEO Vivek Sankaran, in part by doubling down on its digital business to help it compete with giants like Walmart and Costco. Albertsons’ digital sales rose 24% YoY in Q4, the company reported in April, while its loyalty members jumped 15% to 45.6 million.

Digital sales have proven to be crucial to grocery industry growth over the past year. E-grocery sales surged during the Covid-19 pandemic, then cooled between 2021 and mid-2024 as shoppers returned to IRL shopping. But sales have picked back up again in the past year as retailers double down on promotions for their pickup and delivery services. Sales jumped 27% YoY to $8.7 billion in May, according to Brick Meets Click.

Albertsons launched its first-party digital experiences through its app just four years ago, and has been working to catch up to its competitors since then, Jill Pavlovich, SVP of digital shopping experiences at Albertsons, who oversees the grocer’s app, website, and in-store digital offerings, told Retail Brew.

“As we think about this year, the path that we have ahead of us, it’s really taking what we’ve developed a step farther and really bringing the digital experiences more deeply into stores,” she said.

Digital native: Four platforms—e-commerce, loyalty, pharmacy and health, and its mobile app—have been key to its blossoming digital business, Sankaran said in January.

Albertsons’s mobile app has served as a “Swiss Army knife of tools” to help shoppers, Pavlovich said, adding that last year was centered around “strengthen[ing] the core” and focusing on the “basics,” with updates that included in-store geolocation with real-time coupons. It’s also recently added a capability for consumers to upload their own recipes or recipes they’ve found online into the app and, using generative AI, digitize them, making the recipes shoppable across Albertsons’s offerings.

“This year is all about taking the things that reduce the cognitive load and taking them a step farther, leveraging the rate at which technology is changing to really give our customers a human multiplier—make it super easy for them to shop with us,” she said.

Daily monitoring of call service logs, checking reviews in the App Store and Google Play Store, and connecting with customers (and non-customers) directly to get their feedback helps the retailer establish both its annual digital product roadmap as well as make any real time adjustments necessary, Pavlovich said.

That continual iteration is necessary as more tech-savvy, younger consumers opt for online shopping for themselves and their early-stage families for the first time, she noted.

“Their expectation of technology is omnichannel experiences, so they have a lot less barriers to entry to engage digitally and convert online,” she said. “If we continue to keep up with our customer and meet their needs through our digital and omnichannel experiences, we’ll see that growth continue for Albertsons and also for the industry as well.”

As Albertsons takes on online grocery leaders like Walmart and Amazon, Pavlovich said its loyalty program (which it streamlined last year) and its “differentiated services” including special occasion planning offerings like catering and party supplies, will help it compete. This year, the grocer aims to add digital ordering capabilities for in-store services like its bakery and floral department, she noted.

Sharp as a tech: Albertsons also announced at Cannes Lions this year that it’s piloting in-store digital ad displays as it looks to grow the reach of its retail media network Albertsons Media Collective. The pilot is in its early days, but Pavlovich said “initial feedback is positive” as the grocer aims to use ads to boost discovery and brand awareness for shoppers.

“It’s not just an ad to be an ad; it really has to aid in the customer shopping journey and purchasing decision,” she said.

Pavlovich is hopeful that customers will be receptive to digital in-store screens, though she noted the grocer has had “varying successes” with other innovations. The in-store mode for its app has been a bright spot, quickly adopted by 10 million customers, Pavlovich said. However, checkout options similar to Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology, which the grocer previously piloted, hasn’t been so well-received.

""It’s been very experience-dependent, and we just continue to watch and keep a pulse, because the trends continue to emerge, and we’re learning of adoption in other industries or from other retailers,” she said. “We want to make sure that we keep up and we try again.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/deae628cabd516381a36c88247ff2c9d973e39cf-5197x3000.jpg?rect=0,135,5197,2728&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-07-14 11:08:43.330504

CVS is also exiting the individual health insurance business, leaving about 1 million Aetna members in 17 states looking for new coverage in 2026.","For years now, UnitedHealth Group has been the first of the major health insurers to report its quarterly earnings. And Wall Street analysts and investors have looked to the healthcare giant -- which owns the nation’s largest health insurer – for clues on how the sector is doing.

But not this week.

On Thursday, Elevance Health, the nation’s second largest health insurer, will be the first health insurer out of the box to report second quarter earnings as rivals reel or recover from higher-than-expected medical costs. UnitedHealth isn’t reporting its second quarter earnings until the end of the month.

Much is at stake. The Elevance Health report comes after government-subsidized health insurance provider Centene withdrew its 2025 financial guidance earlier this month due to higher costs in the individual health plans it sells under the Affordable Care Act as well as rising expenses from enrollees in its Medicaid plans.

Centene’s announcement was only the latest from a parade of health insurance companies that have struggled in the last two years to control costs of subscribers in plans subsidized by the government. Just last week, Molina Healthcare lowered its earnings guidance for the rest of the year in the face of cost pressures in all three of the government-subsidized health insurance programs it helps manage: Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and individual coverage under the ACA, also known as Obamacare.

And in May, UnitedHealth suspended its financial outlook for the rest of the year and replaced its top executive as the parent of UnitedHealthcare grapples with rising healthcare costs in its Medicare Advantage business. Medicare Advantage plans contract with the federal government to provide health benefits to seniors.

Medicare Advantage plans also contributed to struggles last year for Humana and CVS Health, which elevated a new chief executive in part to help gain control of its struggling Aetna health insurance business. CVS is also exiting the individual health insurance business, leaving about 1 million Aetna members in 17 states looking for new coverage in 2026.

In Elevance Health’s case, chief executive officer Gail Boudreaux, has kept the company’s portfolio of health insurance businesses diversified and somewhat free of issues that have dogged some of its rivals with more than half of its health plan membership coming from commercial or employer group accounts.

Elevance operates a healthy commercial business and is best know for its operation of Anthem brand Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states. In addition, Elevance manages Medicaid via contracts with multiple states and also sells individual coverage under the Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare.

Analysts at GimmeCredit noted in a report in late April that Elevance’s Medicare Advantage book of business is “considerably smaller than UnitedHealth’s with 2.3 million members, according for 5% of its member mix, of which 15% is group Medicare Advantage.”

Still, Elevance does have exposure to some of the issues its rivals have faced with more than 8 million Americans enrolled in its Medicaid plans and more than 1 million enrolled in individual coverage under the ACA.

“We are constructive on Elevance for its diverse member mix, balance between commercial and government businesses, franchise value and brand recognition in 14 key states through its licenses with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, and efforts to diversify and expand services at Carelon,” GimmeCredit analyst Terri Cancelarich wrote in April.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/634fd98138f2f6f4c4c9a291/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-07-14 11:09:12.245924

ABT Q2 Estimates

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $11.07 billion, suggesting a 6.7% rise from the year-ago reported figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is pinned at $1.25, indicating a 9.6% improvement from the prior-year registered figure.

Estimate Revision Trend Ahead of Earnings

Estimates for Q2 earnings have remained unchanged at $1.25 per share in the past 30 days.

Let's look at how things might have progressed for the MedTech major prior to the announcement.

Diagnostics: Similar to the previous quarters, we expect the segment’s revenue growth to have been impacted by the year-over-year decline in COVID-19 testing revenues.

However, the Diagnostics arm is expected to have benefited from the widespread adoption of its top-tier systems and high testing demand across a variety of settings, including hospitals, laboratories, physician offices, retail pharmacies and blood screening facilities.

In the core lab business, continued global demand for routine diagnostic testing and continued adoption of the company’s market-leading immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology and blood screening testing panels, including recent large account wins, are likely to have helped sustain growth in the second quarter. The rapid diagnostics business is expected to have gained from the continued expansion of test menus and the growing demand for respiratory tests that can be performed at home or in more traditional healthcare settings.

Going by the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Diagnostics second-quarter revenues are likely to increase 0.1% year over year.

Established Pharmaceuticals (EPD): Abbott’s EPD business is likely to have continued its impressive streak of strong performance across several regions and therapeutic areas, including gastroenterology, women's health, central nervous system and pain management. In addition, the company recently identified biosimilars as a new strategic growth pillar for EPD. Biosimilars currently represent the highest growth segment in the branded generic pharmaceutical market. Abbott achieved several milestones in recent times, advancing its portfolio of biosimilars, which are expected to have positively contributed to the company’s second-quarter top line.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s second-quarter revenues indicates a year-over-year increase of 6.1%.

Medical Devices: The segment has been a standout performer for the company, steadily growing over the past several quarters and making a notable impact on the margin performance. In the second quarter of 2025, the business sales are likely to have gained from the Diabetes Care division. This is expected to have been driven by the increasing adoption of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) systems, whose sales surged 20% in the previous quarter.

The electrophysiology portfolio is likely to have delivered robust performance across key regions and product categories. Within Structural Heart, we expect the company to report robust performance, led by the market-leading portfolio of surgical valves, structural interventions and transcatheter repair and replacement products. In May, Abbotts’s Tendyne transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) system (designed to treat people with mitral valve disease) received FDA approval.

Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise

Abbott Laboratories price-eps-surprise | Abbott Laboratories Quote

Within the Rhythm Management arm, Abbott’s new leadless pacemaker, AVEIR, and the company’s newest implantable cardiac monitor, Assert, are making strides. In April, ABT released favorable clinical study data for its AVEIR and Volt PFA system. In Heart Failure, growth is expected to have been driven by its market-leading portfolio of heart assist devices, which offers treatment for chronic and temporary conditions.

Meanwhile, Vascular arm’s growth can be attributed to Esprit, the company’s below-the-knee resorbable stent. Furthermore, the growth in the Neuromodulation division might have been led by the launch of next-generation delivery system, which will be used to streamline the implantation process for electrodes used as part of its Proclaim dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurostimulation system. All these developments are anticipated to have boosted Abbott’s top line in the quarter under review.

According to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the Medical device segment’s second-quarter revenues are expected to improve 10.9% year over year.

Nutrition: In this division, the robust sales of adult nutrition brand Ensure are likely to have contributed to its second-quarter top-line performance. We also expect solid quarterly growth across the U.S. portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a 4.3% year-over-year improvement in the segment’s second-quarter revenues.

What Our Model Suggests

Other Stocks Worth a Look

CVS Health CVS has an Earnings ESP of +2.06% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. The company is slated to release second-quarter 2025 results on July 31. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

CVS’ earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 18.08%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter EPS implies a year-over-year decline of 19.7%.

Cencora COR has an Earnings ESP of +1.49% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. The company is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Aug. 6.

The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 6.00%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter EPS implies a year-over-year increase of 13.2%.

Cardinal Health CAH has an Earnings ESP of +0.68% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. The company is expected to release fiscal fourth-quarter results soon.

CAH’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.30%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter EPS suggests a year-over-year improvement of 1.3%.

Supply of labour expands at steepest rate since November 2020.

Permanent placements drop at fastest pace in 22 months.

Pay growth weakens for perm and temp staff.

Data collected 12-24 June

Summary

Uncertainty over the business outlook and budget constraints led companies to reduce their hiring activity again in June, according to the latest KPMG and REC UK Report on Jobs survey, compiled by S&P Global. Permanent staff appointments fell at the steepest rate for nearly two years, while the downturn in temp billings also gathered pace. At the same time, overall vacancies continued to fall, particularly for permanent positions.

Recruiters also signalled a rapid upturn in overall candidate availability, which increased at the sharpest pace since November 2020, amid reports of redundancies and reduced appetite for staff. Improved labour supply, tighter budgets and lower demand for workers dampened pay growth in June, with starting salaries and temp wages increasing only modestly overall.

The report is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to a panel of around 400 UK recruitment and employment consultancies.

Steeper reduction in recruitment activity in June

The latest survey of recruitment consultancies signalled an accelerated decline in hiring activity across the UK at the end of the second quarter. Permanent staff appointments fell at a substantial pace that was the quickest in nearly two years, while temp billings decreased at the fastest rate since February. There were widespread reports that companies had pulled back on hiring due to reduced confidence around the outlook and worries over costs.

50.0 = no-change

Candidate supply expands at fastest pace since late 2020

The overall availability of staff increased rapidly in June amid reports of redundancies and weaker demand for workers. While the supply of permanent labour expanded at a slightly faster rate than that seen for temporary candidates, in each case the rate of growth was the sharpest recorded since November 2020.

Steeper decline in overall vacancies signalled

Total demand for workers continued to decline during June, and at a quicker pace than in May. Underlying data indicated that this reflected a steeper reduction in permanent vacancies, as demand for short-term staff fell at the softest rate in ten months.

Slower growth in starting salaries and temp wages

Lower demand for workers, tighter client budgets and improvements in candidate supply dampened pay growth in June. Starting salaries and temp wages both increased modestly overall, with rates of inflation notably weaker than their historical trends.

Regional and Sector Variations

Permanent placements fell markedly across all four monitored English regions in June, with the steepest decline seen in the South of England.

Apart from a fractional rise in the Midlands, the decline in temp billings was broad-based and led by the South of England.

Retail saw by far the steepest reduction in demand for permanent staff across the eight job categories that posted a decline. The only sectors to record an increase in permanent vacancies were Construction and Engineering, though upturns were only mild overall.

Six of the ten broad job sectors monitored by the survey registered lower demand for temporary workers in June. The sharpest drops were signalled for Retail and Secretarial/Clerical roles. Construction recorded the strongest growth, experiencing a renewed and solid increase in vacancies.

Comments

Commenting on the latest survey results, Jon Holt, Group Chief Executive and UK Senior Partner KPMG, said:

“Ongoing geopolitical turbulence and the threat of rising costs, alongside the promise of technology efficiencies, mean companies continue to wait and see with their hiring. But where there have been recent Government commitments, such as in housebuilding and infrastructure, we are seeing a small increase in permanent vacancies in related sectors – construction and engineering - which is encouraging.

“As we head into the second half of the year, global headwinds will continue to impact the overall economic outlook, but clear priorities set out in the Industrial and Trade Strategies and growth in the services sector should provide some of that confidence business leaders need to start planning future investments and to consider their hiring activities.”

Commenting, Neil Carberry, REC Chief Executive, said:

“There is more volatility month by month in the jobs market right now, as employers assess a complex picture and hire when they need to, but not yet at the rate they might want to. Much of that hesitation stems from the scar tissue left by the Spring tax hikes and fear of further business tax rises. But underlying this, there are some signs of improving demand. Temporary vacancies, especially in the private sector, are resilient. And we are seeing more sectors adding vacancies in construction, logistics, engineering and healthcare. There is potential out there – if businesses are given a clear run at doing what they do best.

“Clarity and transparency from government is vital to build trust with business and drive recovery. The new roadmap for the Employment Rights Bill allows for full and frank consultation on how the new rules will be shaped and gives breathing space to embattled businesses. Updating workplace protections is important, but striking the right balance with the business growth ambitions is the crucial part.”

Methodology

The KPMG and REC, UK Report on Jobs is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to a panel of around 400 UK recruitment and employment consultancies.

Survey responses are collected in the second half of each month and indicate the direction of change compared to the previous month. A diffusion index is calculated for each survey variable. The index is the sum of the percentage of ‘higher’ responses and half the percentage of ‘unchanged’ responses. The indices vary between 0 and 100, with a reading above 50 indicating an overall increase compared to the previous month, and below 50 an overall decrease. The indices are then seasonally adjusted.

Underlying survey data are not revised after publication, but seasonal adjustment factors may be revised from time to time as appropriate which will affect the seasonally adjusted data series.

For further information on the survey methodology, please contact economics@spglobal.com.

The introduction of Express Self-Checkout has improved checkout times at both self-checkout and staffed lanes by 8%, the company said.
Other retailers that have recently set new limits on self-checkout items include discounter Five Below and grocery retailer Schnucks.","Why it matters:

Nearly four in five consumers (79.3%) use self-checkout regularly, according to a recent CapitalOne Shopping Research report.

Consumers appreciate the speed of self-checkout, according to NCR Voyix, which found that 70% of shoppers surveyed said they chose self-checkout over staffed lanes because it was faster.

As a result, retailers continue to invest in new self-checkout solutions such in-app checkouts, product-scanning smart carts, and item count limits to enhance the operational efficiency, meet the demands of their customers, and minimize theft.

Retailers are evolving their self-checkout strategies, in many cases leveraging advanced scanning technology and artificial intelligence. They are seeking to derive efficiencies and increase customer satisfaction through these labor-saving solutions while also addressing concerns about retail theft.

Consumers—especially young shoppers—have come to expect self-checkout at retail stores, and many consider it faster and more convenient than attended checkout. A recent CapitalOne Shopping Research report noted that 73% of shoppers prefer self-checkout, and 79.3% use self-checkout regularly. The report also projected that the market for self-checkout technology in North America will more than double during the next five years, reaching $5.43 billion in 2030, up from an estimated $2.63 billion in 2025.

Speed of checkout is one of consumers’ primary reasons for choosing self-checkout, according to a recent report from technology solutions provider NCR Voyix. The company’s research found that 70% of shoppers surveyed said they chose self-checkout over staffed lanes because it was faster. Nearly half (46%) said they prefer self-checkout because they like to bag their own items, and 36% said they opt to do it themselves because the lines are shorter.

Meanwhile, theft continues to be a concern for retailers offering self-checkout. A Lending Tree survey of 2,000 consumers found that 15% of self-checkout users have purposely stolen an item and that 44% of those who have stolen items planned to do so again.

In fact, a few large retailers have removed self-checkout from some of their stores, including Walmart, which eliminated self-checkout machines in a handful of locations last year. While those moves generated some headlines, the retail industry appears determined to make self-checkout work with a variety of strategies that seek to minimize theft, optimize efficiency, and cater to their shoppers’ preferences.

Following are some of that ways that retailers are seeking to turn self-checkout in a win-win for both businesses and consumers.

Retailers such as Target enforce a limit on number of items to speed checkout

Some retailers have made efforts to move their customers through checkout faster by enforcing a limit on the number of items consumers can purchase in self-checkout lanes. This seeks to reduce the bottlenecks that can occur at self-checkout lanes and makes them easier for store employees to monitor.

For example, last year, Target launched a 10-item limit in self-checkout lanes and renamed the service “Express Self-Checkout.” The efforts, combined with a new employee training initiative, have yielded positive results, the company said in a recent blog post.

The introduction of Express Self-Checkout has improved checkout times at both self-checkout and staffed lanes by 8%, the company said. Customers have also reported better checkout experiences overall, whichever option they choose. Target’s Net Promoter Score (NPS, a measure of customer experience) for checkout has improved by five points for wait times and by three points for interaction with employees.

“Express Self-Checkout has been a great success … with both our guests and team members seeing the benefits,” the retailer said.

Other retailers that have recently set new limits on self-checkout items include discounter Five Below and grocery retailer Schnucks.

The mobile-app solution: Putting self-checkout in the palm of customers’ hands

Another variation of self-checkout puts the entire checkout process—or most of it in many cases—in the palm of customers’ hands.

Mobile app–based checkout, which has been available in various forms for several years, gained some traction during the pandemic, with mixed results. More recently, app-based checkout has gained more attention with the announcement that Sam’s Club, the Walmart-owned warehouse-club retailer, is rolling out its latest Scan & Go checkout system at all of its 600-plus locations in the United States.

The system leverages the retailer’s Scan & Go mobile app, which shoppers use to scan items as they shop and pay for their purchases automatically, without the use of a self-checkout lane at all. The app has been available to members of the warehouse club since 2016, but Sam’s Club said it is now using AI-powered scanning technology to verify the content of shopping carts, which eliminates the need for employees to visually compare shoppers’ paper receipts to the content in their carts.

Sam’s Club’s two major rivals, Costco and BJ’s, have self-checkout apps of their own that they’ve been promoting to their customers. In addition to eliminating the need to wait in lines at checkout, the apps also off other features, such as product location and access to coupons and promotions.

In Costco’s recent fiscal third-quarter conference call with investors, CEO Ron Vachris said the company has been testing digital technologies to improve the speed of checkout.

“We’ve engaged in some ‘Scan & Go done by Costco’ kind of tests that have been extremely successful moving people through the lines and expediting the transactions,” he said.

Some “very, very early” results have been positive, and member adoption has also been encouraging, he said.

Amazon’s ‘Just Walk Out’ tech still has legs; in test mode at WHSmith North America

High-tech checkout solutions that use cameras and other monitors to record shoppers’ purchases are also expanding, despite some early challenges. Amazon’s aptly named Just Walk Out technology, for example, has proven to be successful at small retail stores where customers are pressed for time, such as in airports and sports venues and at student halls on college campuses, according to the company.

With the Just Walk Out platform, customers generally scan a credit card when they enter the store, and a system of sensors and cameras monitors which items they select and leave the store with. Amazon last year said it had plans to double the number of third-party stores using Just Walk Out. Among the retailers testing the technology is WHSmith North America, which operates retail stores in airports. It debuted Just Walk Out at a location in New York’s LaGuardia Airport in 2022.

The technology appears to be gaining traction in small stores where customers are buying a limited number of items—like a bottle of water or a box of popcorn—but it has yet to prove itself in bigger, more complicated shopping trips such as a weekly grocery shop at a full-scale grocery store.

Smart carts, ‘self-checkout on wheels,’ are on a roll

Sometimes described as “self-checkout on wheels,” so-called smart carts use a combination of sensors, built-in scales, and cameras to automatically scan items as customers shop. They also incorporate interactive touch screens and features that enable digital payments in order to smooth the checkout process.

Instacart, the third-party grocery delivery specialist, has rolled out a smart cart called Caper Cart that allows brands and retailers to promote products to customers as they shop, among other features. Customers can also see a running tally of their purchases, sync with their digital shopping list, and search for products’ locations in the store. The carts have been tested or rolled out at several grocery chains, including Schnucks and Save Mart.

Amazon, meanwhile, as its own version of smart carts called Dash Carts, which it has deployed in its 65 Amazon Fresh grocery stores in lieu of Just Walk Out technology. The company is also testing the technology in a handful of its Whole Foods Market locations. When customers are done shopping, they simply push their carts through special, sensor-equipped Dash Cart lanes, and then bag their own groceries.

Workers at Stater Bros., Gelson’s, Super A and El Super stores in Southern California are negotiating similar terms with their employers, according to the UFCW.","LOS ANGELES – The United Food and Commercial Workers announced Friday night that its approximately 45,000 members at Albertsons, Pavilions, Ralphs and Vons stores from San Luis Obispo to the U.S.-Mexico border voted to approve a new three-year contract.

A spokeswoman for Albertsons Saturday called the recently approved contract covering unionized workers at four Southern California supermarket chains “fair and equitable.”

“We are pleased to have reached a fair and equitable agreement with the UFCW,” said Courtney Carranza, director of communications and public affairs of the Southern California Division of Albertsons. Albertsons is also the parent company of Pavilions and Vons.

“We appreciate the union’s partnership in reaching a contract that will benefit our associates and allow us to continue to serve our customers in Southern California.”

Key provisions of the agreement include substantial wage increases, a new supplemental pension plan to help workers in their retirement, increased health care benefit contributions, faster health care eligibility for new hires and staffing language that includes the union “in evaluating reasonable staffing levels that address efficient operation of the stores, the health and safety of employees, and the quality of customer service,” according to the union.

The six UFCW locals released a statement saying “the journey to contract ratification saw a record turnout of grocery workers, customers, and community members, all fighting for the same thing — better stores, better lives, better communities. They fought to ensure that grocery workers could feed their own families and afford health benefits and a dignified retirement at the end of a long career. They also fought for more staffing to improve the customer experience at their stores.

“Their fight took to the streets where they organized numerous rallies and marches that showed their power. It took to their stores where they stood up and demonstrated their unity by signing petitions and wearing buttons. Grocery workers also joined with customers in the fight for better staffing, talking to over 3,000 customers about their shopping experiences and sharing their feedback with these companies that can afford to do better.

“These actions built the strength needed to reach this agreement. Only by rising up together were grocery workers able to make a change in their workplaces that will benefit all grocery workers and customers in the future.”

The contracts will go into effect immediately.

Workers’ separate contracts with Ralphs and Albertsons expired on March 2.

The union announced June 11 that its members had voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike. Although a walkout had not been called by the union, workers held a series of “practice strike” demonstrations.

A tentative agreement had been reached July 2, subject to approval by union members.

There was no immediate response to an email sent late Friday night to a spokesman for Ralphs seeking comment.

Without the Albertsons merger to carry it into the future, it must now streamline, refocus, and perhaps even reinvent.
And in American retail, empty spaces never stay empty for long.","It begins not with fanfare, but with a flickering fluorescent light and a “store closing” sign hung with quiet resignation. For loyal customers and longtime employees, the announcement feels less like a corporate manoeuvre and more like the end of a relationship. Kroger, one of America’s most recognised supermarket names, is preparing to close 60 stores across the country—a surgical cut to its vast empire of over 2,700 outlets.

But this is more than a routine consolidation. It is, in many ways, the visible scar left by an invisible war—a failed merger, regulatory pressure, shifting consumer patterns, and the changing geography of American retail.

Texas First, but Not Alone

The first confirmed farewell comes from McKinney, Texas, at 1707 W. University Drive—30 miles from Dallas, where generations of families picked up their weekly groceries, prescriptions, and household staples. Over the next 18 months, more doors will shut in Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Indiana, Louisiana, and Virginia.

These closures are not abrupt—there will be no sudden extinguishing of lights. Kroger is planning a slow retreat, giving communities time to adjust, employees time to transfer, and competitors time to circle.

The Collapse of a Supermarket Superpower Dream

Just months ago, Kroger was preparing for a different kind of announcement: a historic merger with Albertsons that promised to rewrite the rules of grocery retail in the United States. Together, the two giants would have rivalled Walmart’s dominance and defied Amazon’s digital siege on the physical store.

But regulators thought otherwise. The FTC, under increasing political and public scrutiny, blocked the deal. They feared monopoly, price hikes, and a vanishing middle ground for consumers. In rejecting the merger, the government sent a clear message: big isn’t always better.

Now, without its Albertsons alliance, Kroger must navigate alone. And the map has changed.

Why the Closures Matter

On paper, 60 stores out of 2,731 sounds negligible—just over 2%. But to the communities they serve, they are the cornerstones of daily life. A supermarket is never just a place to buy food. It is a place of routine, familiarity, sometimes even sanctuary.

For employees, many of whom have worked in these stores for years or decades, the closures are personal. The company insists relocation options are on the table—but not everyone will find their way back into the fold.

And for shoppers? It’s not just about convenience. It’s about trust. Trust built on weekly visits, knowing where every item sits, and being greeted by name. When a supermarket vanishes, it creates a hole in the neighbourhood that no press release can fill.

An Industry at a Crossroads

Kroger’s retreat marks a moment of reckoning. The American grocery landscape is being reshaped not just by economics, but by emotion, ethics, and evolving expectations.

Consumers want value—but also connection. They demand technology—but not at the expense of human touch. They are shopping with their values, their wallets, and increasingly, their feet.

Kroger’s closures are a lesson for all large retailers: scale is not security. Survival now hinges on precision, empathy, and adaptability.

What’s Next for the Retail Giant?

Kroger has not said this explicitly, but the closure of underperforming stores is an act of self-preservation. Without the Albertsons merger to carry it into the future, it must now streamline, refocus, and perhaps even reinvent.

Whether this is the beginning of a leaner, smarter Kroger or the slow fade of a once-unquestioned titan remains to be seen. What’s certain is this: in every zip code where the lights go out, Kroger leaves behind more than a vacant building—it leaves behind memories, habits, and a space waiting to be filled.

And in American retail, empty spaces never stay empty for long.",https://internationalsupermarketnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-download-4-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 11:08:51.166187

Nike is said to be focusing on different sports categories across its various brands, including Nike, Jordan, and Converse.

The brand has been grappling with slower sales growth and increasing competition within the global market recently.

In its fourth-quarter revenues of fiscal 2025, Converse recorded a 26% decrease in sales, amounting to $357m on both reported and currency-neutral bases. The brand also saw a 19% drop in annual revenue to $1.7bn, with an 18% decline on a currency-neutral basis.

Revenues at Nike fell 10% to $46.31bn in FY25.

These challenges have led to cost-cutting initiatives and a strategic shift towards performance-oriented sports products.

Carver's tenure at Converse spanned 15 years and included key leadership positions in North America and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).

Cain, who has been with Nike for over two decades and currently serves as vice president and general manager of Nike Global Men's, is set to assume his new responsibilities after a transition period concluding at the end of July.

Cain's appointment follows a broader series of executive reshuffles at Nike.

In May this year, the company promoted Amy Montagne, Global Women’s VP/GM to president at Nike.

Phil McCartney, formerly VP of Footwear advanced to EVP, chief innovation, design and product officer.

Chief marketing officer Nicole Graham was also promoted to EVP, chief marketing officer to lead Nike, Jordan and Converse.

Tom Clarke, the strategic advisor to the CEO, transitioned into the role of chief growth initiatives officer.

“This marks the first deployment of Caper Carts at Wegmans,” the press release said.

“Caper Carts are transforming everyday grocery shopping into a faster, more personalized experience,” the Chief Connected Stores Officer at Instacart, David McIntosh, said in a statement.

The popular grocery store chain is testing AI-powered smart shopping carts in four of its upstate New York locations in a bid to offer consumers a “smarter, more seamless way to shop in-store.”

Wegmans announced the launch of Caper Carts, Instacart’s AI-powered smart carts, at its Dewitt location in Syracuse, New York, earlier this month.

“This marks the first deployment of Caper Carts at Wegmans,” the press release said.

The innovation — part of the Instacart’s technology Connected Stores — allows customers to track their spending while shopping. The carts will automatically recognize items as they are put into them, and customers can bag as they shop.

The tech — including cameras, a digital scale and location sensors — also allows for a seamless checkout, enabling payment for items directly from a cart and eliminating having to wait in a checkout line.

The tool that tracks spending as you shop could make a huge difference for shoppers on a budget, as they won’t have to anxiously await the total cost at checkout.

To use the wheeled tool, Wegmans shoppers can log in to their Shoppers Club account via a screen on the cart.

“Caper Carts are transforming everyday grocery shopping into a faster, more personalized experience,” the Chief Connected Stores Officer at Instacart, David McIntosh, said in a statement.

While Instacart’s Caper Carts are only being tested at the Syracuse location, a representative for Wegmans told Food & Wine that they are “doing smart cart test-and-learn pilots in four stores — Perinton and Pittsford in Rochester, Alberta Drive in Buffalo, and at our Dewitt store in Syracuse — with two different technology providers,” adding that they “are limiting the program to these stores as we gather customer feedback to drive improvements.”

Whether the technology will expand to more Wegmans stores is dependent on how smoothly the grocery shopping process goes at the test stores.

Kraft Heinz Co is considering spinning off a large portion of its grocery business into a separate company that could be valued at up to $20 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The proposed separation would carve out several Kraft-branded products - primarily packaged meals, processed meats, and slower-moving grocery staples - into a new entity. The existing company would retain higher-growth categories such as condiments and sauces, including Heinz ketchup and Grey Poupon mustard.

Kraft Heinz said in May that it was reviewing strategic options to unlock shareholder value but has not confirmed any specifics regarding a spinoff.

Spinoff mirrors industry pivot as processed food demand slows

The planned breakup marks a major shift for a company once seen as a symbol of efficiency and global scale after the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz, orchestrated by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and private equity firm 3G Capital. Since then, the firm has faced headwinds from changing consumer preferences, inflation, and growing competition from private labels.

Kraft Heinz has also faced setbacks in selling underperforming brands like Oscar Mayer and Maxwell House, and in 2019, it wrote down $15 billion in value from its Kraft and Oscar Mayer businesses. The company has promised to remove artificial colours from U.S. products, following increased scrutiny of food additives.

Shares of Kraft Heinz rose 2% on Friday following the Journal's report. The stock has lost over 60% of its value since the merger, erasing nearly $57 billion in market capitalisation.

The potential split reflects a broader trend in the packaged food industry. Kellogg Co separated its business into Kellanova and WK Kellogg last year, and this week, WK Kellogg agreed to a $3 billion sale to Italy's Ferrero Group.

While discussions are ongoing and final terms may change, the spinoff would result in two independently operated companies with focused portfolios. Berkshire Hathaway remains Kraft Heinz’s largest shareholder but has stepped back from board involvement, while 3G Capital exited the company in 2023.

The move underscores how legacy food giants are adapting to a market that increasingly favours fresher products, streamlined operations, and sharper brand focus.

ArcelorMittal South Africa will release its half-year financial results on July 31.","July 14 (Reuters) – Talks with the South African government have so far yielded little progress to avert the closure of loss-making long steel operations at ArcelorMittal South Africa, the company said on Monday.

The South African unit of world number two steelmaker ArcelorMittal SA initially said in November 2023 it planned to close the two plants, citing weak domestic demand, high electricity tariffs, poor freight logistics and competition from local scrap metal recycling mini-mills and imports from China.

“Regrettably, limited progress has been made to date in redressing the major structural impediments,” ArcelorMittal South Africa said in a trading update. It said the closure could no longer be postponed beyond September 30 unless a solution is found soon.

South Africa’s trade and industry minister Parks Tau told lawmakers on July 4 that the government was in “firefighting mode” as it tries to avoid the closure of ArcelorMittal’s operations in KwaZulu Natal and near Johannesburg.

The closure of the plants, which supply rail, roads and bars to the construction, mining and manufacturing sectors as well as components for the automotive industry, has been deferred twice as the company and the government sought to save the 3,500 jobs directly under threat.

In March, the steel company postponed the closures to September 30 after the state-owned Industrial Development Corporation injected 1.683 billion rand ($94.22 million) in cash.

Imports have flooded the domestic market, taking up more than 35% of local steel demand, while freight rail service “deteriorated to its lowest levels ever, resulting in significantly elevated operating risk,” the steelmaker’s statement said.

ArcelorMittal South Africa expects to report a headline loss per share between 0.89 rand and 0.99 rand ($0.0498-$0.0554) for the six months to June 30, narrowing its loss from 1 rand per share during the same period last year.

Sales volumes declined by about 10% in the first half of 2025 compared to last year, the company said.

The WSJ report, meanwhile, came days after Kraft Heinz announced the sale of a handful of brands in Italy to the recently created NewPrinces for €120m ($140.2m).
“Investors lapped it up and Kraft Heinz hit a maximum enterprise value of $140bn in 2017.
Alongside the first-quarter numbers, Kraft Heinz also cut its 2025 outlook across a range of metrics to factor in the potential upward pressure on input-cost inflation from changes in tariffs.","A “strategic transaction” proposition put forward by Kraft Heinz in May could well be about to emerge with a business split a tad over the ten-year anniversary of the mega-merger of Kraft Foods and HJ Heinz.

Such a development would surely not be much of a surprise to market watchers following a slew of poor results from Kraft Heinz and perhaps a veiled submission of what might be considered as the failed combination of 2015 – the company’s shares are currently trading at $27.14 in New York compared to circa $88 when that deal was completed on 2 July of that year.

Berkshire Hathaway, the US investment group led by Warren Buffett, is reportedly weighing up the disposal of its estimated 27% share in the Heinz ketchup maker, while private-equity firm 3G Capital, which joined the billionaire in the 2015 business combination, is long gone having sold its shares in 2023.

Kraft Heinz pledged in May to “unlock shareholder value” as the company assessed strategic options for a business that generated revenue of $26bn last year. CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera, in the job for only 18 months, may well have been encouraged by the split initiated by Kellogg Company in 2023.

Confectionery giant Ferrero announced a $3.1bn deal for WK Kellogg last week, the North American breakfast cereals business that emerged from that separation. The other portion, Kellanova, is in the throes of a $35.9bn takeover by another sweets heavyweight, Mars.

A valuation of $20bn has been attached to a potential spin-off by Kraft Heinz, according to unnamed sources at The Wall Street Journal, which reported on Friday (11 July) a demerger may feature a ‘large chunk of its grocery business’. Sauces, condiments and spreads such as its namesake ketchup brand and the Grey Poupon Dijon mustard line would remain as Kraft Heinz.

Industry analysts were quick off the blocks to comment on the speculation, no doubt galvanised by the speed in which the Ferrero-WK Kellogg deal came to fruition last week, from speculation through to fact the same day.

The WSJ report, meanwhile, came days after Kraft Heinz announced the sale of a handful of brands in Italy to the recently created NewPrinces for €120m ($140.2m).

“Non–sensical”

Investment bank Stifel, in a report led by Matthew Smith, threw some perspective on what might emerge.

“We believe the potential spin of a part of the grocery business would include the company’s slower growth and highly competitive/commoditised categories, with the remaining entity keeping Kraft’s priority platforms including sauces/condiments and snacking/easy meals.

Smith said the Stifel analysts believe the faster-growing assets to remain would include Kraft Heinz’s North America retail “accelerate” platforms, the company’s global away-from-home unit and its emerging markets businesses. The assets spun off could house the retail portions of the company’s “protect” and “balance” platforms.

Stifel’s analysts quantified the accelerate platforms as including condiments, ready-meals brands Mac & Cheese and Ore-Ida, plus snacking lines such as Lunchables and Delimex.

The assets that could be spun off would include Oscar Mayer meats, Jell-O desserts, drinks brands Capri-Sun and Kool-Aid, cheese with Kraft and Velveeta, plus coffee, as in Maxwell House and Gevalia.

Meanwhile, Peter McDonald, a food-industry consultant and former General Mills executive of 20-plus years, weighed in on the failed merger angle of 2015 in what he described as one of the “darkest chapters in CPG food during my career”.

McDonald explained his thoughts in a LinkedIn post: “The new entity pursued a new-to-the-industry aggressive margin expansion playbook that sent competitors chasing ‘zero-based budgeting’ and other nonsensical corporate initiatives in a desperate attempt to avoid being gobbled up themselves.

“Investors lapped it up and Kraft Heinz hit a maximum enterprise value of $140bn in 2017. Since then, food-industry reality has reasserted itself and the margin extraction from innovation, marketing, talent, and pricing aggression has taken its toll,” he wrote, putting Kraft Heinz’s current enterprise value at $50bn.

And acknowledging the reports of a spin-off are only based on speculation at this point, he added: “Now the company may be broken up into constituent parts not unlike things were when the whole fiasco started”.

Sales pressure

Kraft Heinz’s 2024 reported sales dropped 3% to $25.85bn, with organic growth down 2.1% in what CEO Abrams-Rivera described as “a challenging year with our top-line results coming in below our expectations”.

Net income fell to $2.74bn, from the $2.86bn booked for 2023. The company also reported a 63.2% slump in full-year operating profit to $1.7bn, which was linked to $3.7bn in non-cash impairment losses.

It was a poor performance echoed in the opening quarter of 2025, too. Net sales dropped 6.4% on a reported basis and declined 4.7% in organic terms to just shy of $7bn. In the three months to 29 March, operating income decreased 8.1% to $1.2bn.

Net income stood at $712m versus $801m a year earlier.

Alongside the first-quarter numbers, Kraft Heinz also cut its 2025 outlook across a range of metrics to factor in the potential upward pressure on input-cost inflation from changes in tariffs.

Kellogg demerger

“There can be no assurance that the company’s assessment process will result in any transaction, or any assurance as to its outcome or timing,” Kraft Heinz said in a statement in May as it revealed the strategic transaction proposition.

“The company has not set a timetable for completion of this process and does not intend to make any further announcements regarding the process unless and until it determines that further disclosure is appropriate or necessary.”

Picking up on the WSJ report, TD Cowen analyst Robert Moskow estimated the likely valuation of the part of the Kraft Heinz grocery business spin-off at $14.5bn, short of the $20bn put forward by the publication.

He, too, linked his observations to the Kellogg demerger. “Bankers and board members of the food industry certainly have noticed the value capture of the 2023 Kellogg split up. After accounting for the Mars and Ferrero acquisitions of the two parts, investors will have realised 41% since the spin, while consumer staples stocks (by our math) fell 6% and fundamentals deteriorated due to changes in consumer preferences and external factors like GLP-1s,” Moskow wrote in a research note.

The TD Cowen analyst also speculated a buyer might step in – whether that’s Kraft Heinz’s intention or not – to snap up the offload, naming McCormick as a potential suitor.

“Our sum-of-the-parts analysis indicates 11% upside to KHC’s current enterprise value based on eight times EV/EBITDA for grocery and 10.5x EV/EBITDA for sauces, condiments and spreads,” Moskow suggested.

“However, we could see another 20% upside if a strategic acquirer steps up to buy the sauces and condiments business (about 44% of KHC sales), which will look a lot like the original pre-merger Heinz business of 2013. For example, we see a good strategic fit with McCormick, which has been expanding into the condiments space for several years through tack-on deals, and a high degree of EPS accretion.”

Moskow added to his thesis by explaining that “mega-mergers in food have low success rates and that ‘depth’ tends to beat ‘breadth’”.

He continued: “The skill set and investment requirements to succeed in disparate parts of the grocery store (e.g. refrigerated, frozen, shelf-stable, and snacks) tend to differ.

“We believe that food companies with focused portfolios and category leadership (e.g. Hershey) have a better chance of long-term success than diversified companies trying to leverage operating and marketing capabilities across a wide range of categories.”

Back to 2015

A common theme emanating from food-industry analysts is the throw back to the pre-2015 merger, what AllianceBernstein’s Alexia Howard deemed as a “reversal”.

“When we looked into the relative growth rates of the legacy Heinz company since the companies were merged in 2015, it looks as though the legacy Heinz business has grown retail sales at a 5.3% CAGR over the past decade, while the legacy Kraft brands have grown at only 2%,” Howard wrote in a research note.

“Looking at how the company could break up might mean that the remaining faster-growing company comprises the 25% of companywide sales in international markets plus another 30% of the 75% of the US sales for a total of around 47.5% of companywide sales.”

Howard explained further: “Looking at how the sales could break down, it seems that the faster-growing remaining company could represent around 47.5% of company-wide sales. Clearly, the margins in the international markets are significantly lower than in North America, which could mean that 38.2% of the total company’s adjusted EBITDA of $6.36bn in 2024 potentially sits with the faster-growing remaining company, while the remaining 61.8% sits with the spin-off.”

The Stifel analysts added: “The hypothetical slower growth ‘Spin Co’ would incorporate the retail protect platform featuring a projected low-single digit, ten-year, industry CAGR, high gross margins and low private-label penetration, as well as the retail balance commoditised business platform featuring a flat projected ten-year industry CAGR, low gross margins, and high private-label penetration.

“We view a potential spin of the lower growth and lower-margin retail businesses as a way to unlock value within the higher growth and higher-margin remaining businesses.”",https://live-b2b-gdm-figaro1.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/shutterstock_2501948921-heinz-edited.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 10:05:32.391146

Developed by the Red Sea Wind Energy consortium, the project brings together ENGIE (35%), Orascom Construction PLC (25%), Toyota Tsusho Corporation (20%), and Eurus Energy Holdings (20%).
Since 2015, the country’s renewable output has increased by over 340%, with wind energy playing an increasingly central role.
François Xavier Boul, ENGIE’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, emphasised the project’s economic and environmental value: “This renewable energy is cheaper than burning gas.
Looking ahead, the Red Sea Wind Energy consortium is already planning a follow-up project expected to exceed 900 MW, further consolidating Egypt’s role as a renewable energy leader on the African continent.","ENGIE has successfully commissioned the 650-megawatt Red Sea Wind Energy project, making it the largest operational wind farm in both the Middle East and Africa. Located on Egypt’s Red Sea coast near Ras Ghareb, the onshore wind complex is now fully operational and delivering clean power to more than one million homes.

The project was delivered in phases, with the first 306 MW coming online in December 2024, followed by an additional 194 MW in April 2025. The final 150 MW segment was completed in June, bringing the project to full capacity four months ahead of schedule. This early completion highlights both the efficiency of the project team and the strength of collaboration between international and regional partners.

Developed by the Red Sea Wind Energy consortium, the project brings together ENGIE (35%), Orascom Construction PLC (25%), Toyota Tsusho Corporation (20%), and Eurus Energy Holdings (20%). Together, these partners have built a landmark facility that will cut around 1.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually, while helping Egypt meet its ambitious renewable energy targets.

Safety was a top priority throughout construction. The team completed over seven million man-hours without a single lost-time incident, reflecting a strong safety culture and project discipline. This is particularly notable for a development of this scale and complexity.

The wind farm operates under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC), ensuring long-term economic and grid stability. The project’s financing was secured through a consortium of international institutions including Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Norinchukin, Société Générale, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), with additional support from NEXI.

This milestone boosts ENGIE’s renewable footprint in Egypt to nearly 1 gigawatt, reinforcing its strategic position in the region. Egypt, meanwhile, is making major strides in expanding its renewable capacity—aiming for 42% of its electricity mix to come from renewable sources by 2030. Since 2015, the country’s renewable output has increased by over 340%, with wind energy playing an increasingly central role.

François Xavier Boul, ENGIE’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, emphasised the project’s economic and environmental value: “This renewable energy is cheaper than burning gas. It clearly allows for burning less gas and for the country to either import less or export more.”

ENGIE’s broader ambition is to expand rapidly across the MENA region, where faster permitting and shorter development timelines offer an edge over markets in Europe and North America. The company is targeting 95 GW of installed renewable capacity by 2030, up from about 51 GW today.

Looking ahead, the Red Sea Wind Energy consortium is already planning a follow-up project expected to exceed 900 MW, further consolidating Egypt’s role as a renewable energy leader on the African continent. With this flagship development, Egypt not only strengthens its energy independence but also sets a replicable model for other nations in the region aiming to accelerate their energy transition.",https://www.energyconnects.com/media/hqahcvem/wind-energy-desert.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=132741752282930000,N,,2025-07-14 10:06:14.403716

Consumer spending continues to benefit from a resilient labor market, though momentum has begun to moderate. The resumption of student loan payments in the U.S. has added financial pressure on households, compounding concerns over rising tariffs. Earlier this year, anticipation of new tariffs prompted a pull-forward in spending, particularly on big-ticket items like motor vehicles. All the heightened discussion around tariffs has not only impacted business strategies but also weighed on consumer sentiment. The constant media coverage and policy uncertainty have made consumers increasingly anxious about potential price hikes and economic instability, further dampening their willingness to spend. Moreover, it has led many retailers to revise their earnings outlook downward for the remainder of the year.

Accordingly, the Q1 2025 LSEG Retail/Restaurant Index 7.5% earnings growth rate is expected to decline to -1.7% in Q2 2025, its first negative showing since the pandemic, underscoring a slowdown in consumer spending (Exhibit 2). The index is also estimated to remain in the low single digits for the second half of the year. Similarly, the blended revenue growth estimate for the 197 companies in this index is 2.0% for Q2 2025 (Exhibit 2). This is also the weakest showing since the pandemic and is also expected to remain below 3.0% for the second half of the year. Looking ahead, retailers are bracing for a challenging and volatile environment. They report that consumers are increasingly value-conscious, navigating a landscape shaped by persistent inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, regulatory uncertainty, and tariff-related disruptions.

A closer look at the data reveals that this year’s slowdown is concentrated around three main consumer sectors. The Leisure Products sector is expected to post the weakest Q2 2025 performance, with profits projected to decline by 44.7% (Exhibit 3). The Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods sector follows, with a -44.4% growth estimate that reflects underlying softness in earnings momentum. Both sectors are also forecast to deliver the weakest earnings growth in the second half of the year. Additionally, the Household Durables sector is on track to report negative earnings growth for 2025, further highlighting the pressure facing consumer discretionary categories.

This is in line with the LSEG/Ipsos Primary Consumer Sentiment Index, which finds that overall American consumer sentiment has declined for three consecutive months. The latest drop in consumer sentiment is driven by a sharp decline in purchasing comfort and the continued decline in current views of the job market. Previously, much of the unease shown by consumers was rooted in fears about the future of the economy. However, consumers are now more pessimistic about their current situation. American consumer confidence continues to demonstrate the broader economic uncertainty the public feels today.

Despite broader sector challenges, there are pockets of optimism. Looking ahead to Q2 earnings, analysts surveyed by LSEG are already bullish on MGM Resorts International. The consensus estimate for MGM’s Q2 2025 EPS stands at $0.52. Notably, a highly rated five-star analyst with a very accurate rating has issued a Bold Estimate of $0.83, significantly above the consensus. This divergence suggests a potential earnings beat and the possibility of a positive surprise when MGM reports.

The StarMine SmartEstimate is a weighted average of analyst estimates, with more weight given to more recent estimates and more accurate analysts. Our studies have shown that when the SmartEstimate differs from the consensus (I/B/E/S mean) by more than 2%, the company is likely to post subsequent earnings surprises directionally correct 70% of the time. This percentage difference is referred to as the Predicted Surprise (PS%) (Exhibit 4).

Similarly, the companies listed below have a Predicted Surprise exceeding 2.0% for Q2 2025, Q3 2025, and the current fiscal year. This indicates a strong likelihood of outperforming earnings expectations and delivering positive surprises.

Conversely, the companies listed below have a negative Predicted Surprise of less than -2.0% for Q2 2025, Q3 2025, and the current fiscal year; indicating they are likely to miss earnings expectations and deliver negative surprises.

Pricing pressures

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.1% month-over-month from April to May 2025, and 2.4% year-over-year. Retailers continue to face headwinds from weak consumer sentiment and a value-conscious shopper grappling with elevated living expenses. The CPI data highlights that consumers are contending with higher costs for essentials such as food, electricity, medical care, and transportation compared to a year ago.

However, apparel prices have bucked the broader inflation trend, declining 0.4% month-over-month and 0.9% year-over-year. This trend is consistent with LSEG data, which shows widespread apparel price reductions. In collaboration with Centric Market Intelligence, we are tracking weekly average original prices across selected categories in U.S. mall stores. Since December 2024, average prices have been monitored weekly through June 2025. Among the categories tracked, Men’s Apparel has experienced the steepest decline, with prices falling 3.0%, followed by Women’s Apparel falling 2.2% (Exhibit 7).

Discount levels – U.S. online retailers

Despite declining apparel prices, retailers are offering fewer promotions. The discount penetration, defined as the percentage of merchandise on sale, has fallen below the historical range of 34% to 42% observed over the past decade (Exhibit 8). Year-to-date in 2025, the average discount penetration stands at just 26%, down from 34% last year and below pre-pandemic levels. This shift comes at a time when retailers are contending with increasingly value-conscious consumers, highlighting a strategic shift in promotional activity amid evolving demand dynamics.

However, the average percent discount has remained relatively stable at 35%, just below last year’s average of 36%.

E-commerce sales

According to the latest e-commerce report from the U.S. Census Bureau, online sales reached $300 billion in Q1 2025, representing a 6.1% year-over-year increase. However, this marks a slowdown from the 7.6% growth observed over the past year (Exhibit 14). LSEG data suggests that total consumer spending online in 2025 is likely to remain below 2024 levels.

E-commerce currently accounts for just 16.2% of total U.S. retail sales, indicating that the majority of consumers still prefer shopping in brick-and-mortar stores. A significant portion of the retail market remains underpenetrated by major online players like Amazon.

Shifting consumer behavior

Retailers have just concluded reporting Q1 2025 earnings, with 88% referencing tariffs during their earnings calls, underscoring the growing influence of trade policy on the sector. New and expanded tariffs on imports from key trade partners, including China, are reshaping cost structures and altering supply chain dynamics. While large retailers such as Walmart have the scale, capital, and pricing power to absorb or strategically offset these pressures, smaller players remain significantly more vulnerable, with limited flexibility to manage rising costs and operational disruptions.

Despite elevated import costs, many retailers are choosing to absorb part of the burden rather than risk losing demand from increasingly price-sensitive consumers. Preserving market share has become a top priority, prompting companies to implement mitigation strategies such as diversifying supply chains, renegotiating supplier terms, and optimizing inventory management. Still, some are selectively raising prices or absorbing costs to remain competitive in a challenging environment.

The recent decline in consumer sentiment reflects a sharp drop in purchasing confidence, driven largely by rising prices, and a continued deterioration in perceptions of the labor market. While earlier concerns were centered on long-term economic uncertainty, consumers are now increasingly focused on immediate financial pressures.

Although gasoline prices have eased over the past four months, renewed tensions in the Middle East have reignited concerns about a potential rebound. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that, as a rule of thumb, every $10 increase in oil prices can add approximately 0.2 percentage points to the inflation rate. He also emphasized that the Fed is in no rush to cut interest rates, preferring to wait for more data to assess the broader economic impact of tariffs and inflationary pressures.

Amid rising costs for essentials such as food, housing, and energy, apparel stands out as one of the few categories experiencing outright price declines. This deflationary trend may signal a broader consumer pullback. According to LSEG Retail Index data, the apparel sector is on track to post the weakest earnings growth in 2025. Brands caught between rising production costs and softening demand are increasingly turning to discounting strategies, an approach that risks eroding both margins and brand equity.

Despite inflation across most sectors, falling apparel prices, driven by subdued demand, excess inventory, and retailers’ reluctance to pass on cost increases, highlight the strain on consumer spending. This underscores the delicate balance retailers must strike between maintaining competitiveness and protecting profitability in today’s volatile economic landscape.",https://lipperalpha.refinitiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RTXZZ44.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 10:06:06.278659

A company spokesperson said to Bloomberg: “As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value.”

Kraft Heinz currently has an estimated market value of around $32 billion, with shares rising by 2.5% following the announcement.

Consumers are leaning towards healthier food options, and the rising inflation is also squeezing in on consumer spending, which has led to a slowdown in sales for the food manufacturing company.

Despite Kraft Heinz’s attempts to cater to the current consumer trends of healthier food by launching a zero-salt-and-sugar ketchup, the food brand is struggling to stay afloat amid rising competition.

The FMCG giant has reported a mixed financial performance in its most recent results, with its revenue going down for two years consecutively and lowering its future outlook.

Last week Kraft Heinz offloaded its Italian baby food business branch to New Princes in an acquisition worth €120m.

Willem Brandt, Kraft Heinz president of Europe and Pacific Developed Markets, said that the decision was due to the FMCG brand’s strategy to “fuel investment and growth in our core areas” while investing in growth of long-term value.

Kraft Heinz is allegedly planning to separate into two different companies, as the US-based food manufacturer is seeking ways to deal with changing consumer shopping habits.

(Nasdaq: KHC) is exploring the breakup of its business operations, considering spinning off grocery brands into a separate company worth as much as $20 billion, the Wall Street Journal said Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The plan would separate many traditional Kraft-branded products into a new public company. This would allow Kraft Heinz to focus on faster-growing segments like sauces and condiments, including its flagship Heinz ketchup, as the food giant seeks to reverse years of declining sales.

Shares rose 2.5% Friday, giving the company a market value of about $31 billion. However, the stock has lost nearly two-thirds of its value since the 2015 merger that created Kraft Heinz.

“As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value,” a company spokesperson said. The structure could change, and there’s no guarantee the company will proceed with any deal, the people said.

The potential breakup follows struggles with shifting consumer preferences toward fresher, less processed foods and mounting cost pressures. Net sales dropped 6.4% in the first quarter of 2025, while full-year 2024 sales declined 3%.

CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera has acknowledged being “acutely aware of the building pressures across food,” including inflation and consumer anxiety affecting demand for the company’s packaged products.

The company recently announced it would eliminate artificial food coloring from US products by 2027, responding to health officials’ concerns about synthetic dyes.

Brands can engage Costco members across instore displays, Costco.com and offsite digital channels, creating a seamless advertising experience.","Costco, the third largest retailer in the US with $250bn in global sales in 2024, is rapidly developing a retail media network built on its unique membership model and robust first-party data.

Costco is a membership warehouse club, dedicated to bringing members the best possible prices on quality brand-name merchandise. With more than 900 locations worldwide, it provides a wide selection of merchandise, plus the convenience of specialty departments and exclusive member services, all at a bargain price.

With this captive and data rich audience, Costco has started to embrace what it can do with retail media, specifically instore as that is where the bulk of all its sales still take place.

Unlike many competitors, Costco’s approach to retail media is rooted in its core value proposition: enhancing member experience and loyalty, rather than simply maximising ad revenue. This network is still in its early stages – still beta testing in late 2024 – but is poised to become a formidable player in the retail media landscape, leveraging both instore and digital touchpoints.

Costco’s greatest asset is its 80 million US cardholders, all of whom must use their membership cards for purchases. This creates a closed-loop environment, enabling Costco to link every transaction to a specific household and build detailed shopper profiles. Advertisers can then target audiences such as “Frequent Shoppers”, “Tenured Shoppers” and “Category Shoppers” using behavioural and purchase data to deliver highly relevant campaigns.

Already, Costco is expanding both instore and offsite media capabilities. Instore, advertisers can expect targeted signage, sampling events and digital displays, all informed by member data. Offsite, Costco has begun running campaigns with CPG partners on third-party media channels, achieving two to three times the typical return on ad spend in early tests.

It has also signed a deal with Yahoo DSP, allowing Yahoo’s customers to target Costco’s members across the the open web. Through partnerships like this, Costco’s retail media network extends beyond physical stores to digital environments. Brands can engage Costco members across instore displays, Costco.com and offsite digital channels, creating a seamless advertising experience. The Yahoo partnership also enables integration with Yahoo ConnectID, allowing for future-proof identity solutions and advanced measurement infrastructure.

Advertisers receive robust analytics and closed-loop measurement across this whole omnichannel portfolio of retail media, tracking campaign performance and sales impact within Costco’s audience segments. This transparency is a major draw for brands seeking to connect media spend to actual purchase behaviour.

With its membership driven data – which gives a uniquely rich dataset for ad targeting – Costco has been a late arrival in retail media, however this ‘last to market’ approach is also an advantage. The company is focused on building out infrastructure and capabilities over a multi-year roadmap, prioritizing data foundations and merchandising collaboration. It has also watched and learned from its competitors and, despite not actively pitching to agencies, Costco sees strong inbound interest from suppliers and brands. However, its limited product range compared to mass retailers may constrain the number of advertisers, ensuring campaigns remain highly relevant to members.",https://internetretailing.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Costco-Mike-Mozart-15410820046_7323e12d40_k.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:19:58.596618

Between texts, Chesky continued his pitch for the Airbnb redesign.
Naturally, the discussion turned to how much the building might rent for on Airbnb.
It wasn’t a serious idea, but it also wasn’t a radical one—Airbnb once offered an overnight stay at the Louvre, and another at the Musée d’Orsay.","You are an entrepreneur who has achieved the impossible. You have disrupted an entire sector of the economy and practically invented a new one. Most startups fail, but you have built yours into a billion-dollar company—a genus so scarce that it’s called a unicorn. Your brand has become a transitive verb. What do you do now? Stop growing? Stop disrupting? Of course not. Winners don’t quit. They find new ways to win.

Brian Chesky, the co-founder and C.E.O. of Airbnb, was in SoHo the other day, standing near the cash register at the Housing Works Bookstore. In addition to being a forty-three-year-old multibillionaire, he is among the swolest of the swole C.E.O.s, with a swoop of dark curly hair and lats that make Jeff Bezos look like a featherweight. There was a steady rain, but Chesky walked outside in pleated slacks and a form-fitting T-shirt, risking his suède Celine sneakers. “Unlike a lot of tech companies, our business exists in the real world,” he said. “To launch something the right way, you need to get out into the community.”

He was starting what he called “the next chapter of the company, an evolution I’ve been thinking about for a long time.” (Wired: “Airbnb Is in Midlife Crisis Mode.”) Since 2007, travellers have been able to Airbnb a place to stay; now they can also Airbnb a Service (haircut, massage) or an Experience (cooking class, Jet Ski outing). Chesky was in SoHo to have an Experience.

He had just arrived from California, where he lives alone (when he’s not renting out his guest room on the app). Next, he was on his way to Paris, Berlin, Milan, Rome, Seoul, and Tokyo, sampling new wares along the way. The Experiences section of the Airbnb app was still in beta mode, and the New York selection was slim (“Make beats with a New York DJ”; “Catacombs by Candlelight”). Chesky was going on a walking tour of SoHo, focussed on architectural photography.

“I’m out in these streets in all kinds of weather,” the photographer Ethan Barber, who was leading the tour, said. “The only compromise I’ll be making today, because of the rain, is I’ll be shooting iPhone-only.” Walking backward, his glasses fogging, Barber headed to the first destination, a cast-iron building on the corner of Prince and Greene. He was used to leading groups, but this one was a private demo for Chesky. Chesky, however, travels with an entourage: press attachés, a couple of executives, and a guy named Chase, whose job is to fill Chesky’s social-media accounts with humanizing photos of the boss. A black S.U.V.—driver, plus private security—kept pace with the group.

Someone handed Chesky an umbrella; he waved it off, walked half a block, then changed his mind and took it. At the first stop, Barber pointed to the building—a French Renaissance landmark from 1883, now a Ralph Lauren store—and located his favorite spot to shoot from, marked by a wad of chewing gum ground into the sidewalk. Chesky stood next to the gum, finished tapping out a text, then held his iPhone in landscape mode and took a few snaps of the building while Chase took snaps of him.

“This could be cool,” Chase said, reviewing a moody black-and-white shot of Chesky. “Not for grid, but for Stories, maybe.”

Chesky went back to texting, and Barber moved along—to an Isabel Marant store on Broome and then to a former Isaac Mizrahi warehouse at 102 Wooster. Between texts, Chesky continued his pitch for the Airbnb redesign. “Most apps want you down here, in the phone,” he said, bending his neck down. “Our purpose”—head up, shoulders back—“is to get you out and about, making memories.”

The final stop was a walk-through of an artist’s foundation. Two women guiding the tour asked the guests to refrain from indoor photography. Everyone complied, except Chesky, who may or may not have heard the instruction. “I’m redoing my house, and I would be so into a wood floor like this,” he said, taking a video and sending it to his designer. “I want it to have that artist feel.”

Throughout the space, there were places for the artist to rest—a daybed, an East African headrest, a wooden platform holding two mattresses and a sculpture. Naturally, the discussion turned to how much the building might rent for on Airbnb. It wasn’t a serious idea, but it also wasn’t a radical one—Airbnb once offered an overnight stay at the Louvre, and another at the Musée d’Orsay. This building could be similarly enticing, the group mused, if not even more so. One of the curators said, with a tight smile, “Thanks, but it’s not available.” ♦

Supply of labour expands at steepest rate since November 2020

Permanent placements drop at fastest pace in 22 months

Pay growth weakens for perm and temp staff

Data collected 12-24 June

Summary

Uncertainty over the business outlook and budget constraints led companies to reduce their hiring activity again in June, according to the latest KPMG and REC UK Report on Jobs survey, compiled by S&P Global. Permanent staff appointments fell at the steepest rate for nearly two years, while the downturn in temp billings also gathered pace. At the same time, overall vacancies continued to fall, particularly for permanent positions.

Recruiters also signalled a rapid upturn in overall candidate availability, which increased at the sharpest pace since November 2020, amid reports of redundancies and reduced appetite for staff. Improved labour supply, tighter budgets and lower demand for workers dampened pay growth in June, with starting salaries and temp wages increasing only modestly overall.

The report is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to a panel of around 400 UK recruitment and employment consultancies.

Steeper reduction in recruitment activity in June

The latest survey of recruitment consultancies signalled an accelerated decline in hiring activity across the UK at the end of the second quarter. Permanent staff appointments fell at a substantial pace that was the quickest in nearly two years, while temp billings decreased at the fastest rate since February. There were widespread reports that companies had pulled back on hiring due to reduced confidence around the outlook and worries over costs.

Candidate supply expands at fastest pace since late 2020

The overall availability of staff increased rapidly in June amid reports of redundancies and weaker demand for workers. While the supply of permanent labour expanded at a slightly faster rate than that seen for temporary candidates, in each case the rate of growth was the sharpest recorded since November 2020.

Steeper decline in overall vacancies signalled

Total demand for workers continued to decline during June, and at a quicker pace than in May. Underlying data indicated that this reflected a steeper reduction in permanent vacancies, as demand for short-term staff fell at the softest rate in ten months.

Slower growth in starting salaries and temp wages

Lower demand for workers, tighter client budgets and improvements in candidate supply dampened pay growth in June. Starting salaries and temp wages both increased modestly overall, with rates of inflation notably weaker than their historical trends.

Regional and Sector Variations

Permanent placements fell markedly across all four monitored English regions in June, with the steepest decline seen in the South of England.

Apart from a fractional rise in the Midlands, the decline in temp billings was broad-based and led by the South of England.

Retail saw by far the steepest reduction in demand for permanent staff across the eight job categories that posted a decline. The only sectors to record an increase in permanent vacancies were Construction and Engineering, though upturns were only mild overall.

Six of the ten broad job sectors monitored by the survey registered lower demand for temporary workers in June. The sharpest drops were signalled for Retail and Secretarial/Clerical roles. Construction recorded the strongest growth, experiencing a renewed and solid increase in vacancies.

Commenting on the latest survey results, Jon Holt, Group Chief Executive and UK Senior Partner KPMG, said:

“Ongoing geopolitical turbulence and the threat of rising costs, alongside the promise of technology efficiencies, mean companies continue to wait and see with their hiring. But where there have been recent Government commitments, such as in housebuilding and infrastructure, we are seeing a small increase in permanent vacancies in related sectors – construction and engineering - which is encouraging.

“As we head into the second half of the year, global headwinds will continue to impact the overall economic outlook, but clear priorities set out in the Industrial and Trade Strategies and growth in the services sector should provide some of that confidence business leaders need to start planning future investments and to consider their hiring activities.”

Commenting, Neil Carberry, REC Chief Executive, said:

“There is more volatility month by month in the jobs market right now, as employers assess a complex picture and hire when they need to, but not yet at the rate they might want to. Much of that hesitation stems from the scar tissue left by the Spring tax hikes and fear of further business tax rises. But underlying this, there are some signs of improving demand. Temporary vacancies, especially in the private sector, are resilient. And we are seeing more sectors adding vacancies in construction, logistics, engineering and healthcare. There is potential out there – if businesses are given a clear run at doing what they do best.

“Clarity and transparency from government is vital to build trust with business and drive recovery. The new roadmap for the Employment Rights Bill allows for full and frank consultation on how the new rules will be shaped and gives breathing space to embattled businesses. Updating workplace protections is important, but striking the right balance with the business growth ambitions is the crucial part.”",,N,,2025-07-14 13:35:22.468302

It took Welch's Fruit Snacks 10 years,Mark Wilson,,,,,https://www.fastcompany.com/91367059/how-hard-is-it-to-remove-artificial-dye-from-food-it-took-welchs-fruit-snacks-10-years,"Today, the company is announcing that it’s removed all artificial dyes from its “mixed fruit” Welch’s Fruit Snacks, with the remainder of its portfolio transitioning next year.
As of today, a simple Welch’s Fruit Snack is a portrait of our complex global industrial supply chain.
The other unique challenge facing Welch’s is that this fruit creates acidity, and acids, too, will break down natural colors.
The tests involved dozens of different natural dyes to find those that worked best.
“Scientifically there will never be complete parity between artificial and natural colors,” Ramani concedes.","American food is about to look a little bit duller, but that’s probably for the best.

Since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. introduced a ban targeting eight synthetic dyes in processed food, Kraft Heinz and General Mills have both committed to removing them across all their product lines by the end of 2027 in what will be the most significant ingredient shift in the processed food industry since the ban of trans fats in 2018.

But PIM Brands—makers of Welch’s Fruit Snacks, the top seller in its category worldwide—posits that this transition may be harder than it looks, at least if companies want to protect the bright color experience of their products.

“It would be darn impossible, in my opinion, to just snap your fingers and say, ‘Okay, we’re gonna make everything better in the next year or two,” says Michael Rosenberg, president & CEO of PIM Brands. “I think Americans are just a little bit more aggressive and punchy and just want to visually enjoy their products.”

It’s a challenge of both consumer expectations around product consistency, but also, in terms of human perception: Bright colors can actually make things taste sweeter or skew our tastebuds in other ways.

Today, the company is announcing that it’s removed all artificial dyes from its “mixed fruit” Welch’s Fruit Snacks, with the remainder of its portfolio transitioning next year. But the road to get here was anything but quick or easy for the company—despite having its own food science team in-house.

Instead, it’s been a 10-year process, the company says, adding that it couldn’t have possibly reacted rapidly to the demands of the new administration.

“It happens that all this coalesced just as the MAGA movement was really intensifying, but that’s just pure coincidence,” says Rosenberg. “Because we started working on this before any of this ever was even on anybody’s radar screen.”

The challenge of natural dyes

The big truth about dyes is that they make up very little of the food we eat—maybe 0.5% of a Welch’s Fruit Snack is added color by volume, according to Bhavna Ramani, chief R&D and production officer of PIM Brands. But their use has still prompted legitimate health concerns from researchers. The synthetic dyes used in the U.S. aren’t actually banned in Europe, but since 2010 manufacturers have had to place a warning label on foods in the region using them. Manufacturers have tried to avoid using these warnings, so their versions of products like Fruit Loops often eliminate artificial dyes and appear duller as a result.

The Welch’s team tracked these concerns a decade ago, and began a plan to transition its product. Its challenges ranged from feasibility (how do you source a color as rare as blue?) to its own scale—the company’s own color suppliers couldn’t meet their demand.

As of today, a simple Welch’s Fruit Snack is a portrait of our complex global industrial supply chain. The majority of its ingredients are a real fruit puree that match the flavor they’re advertising. That means for a strawberry snack, the company uses strawberries rather than defaulting to cheaper ingredients like apples and pears and supplementing flavor with extracts. But these fruits generally don’t supply the amount of color to which artificial dyes have accustomed us: peach, for instance, would be but the faintest shade of orange without dye.

Welch’s approach means that it already sources 30 different fruits from countries around the globe, tracking seasonal produce worldwide so that it can constantly produce all of its flavors of fruit snack. “When it’s hot in one place, it’s cold in another,” says Rosenberg. “So we’re really traversing the globe for our raw materials.”

Shifting to natural dyes meant shifting from a synthetic supply chain, derived from abundant petroleum, to a complex global footprint with similar problems to Welch’s primary fruit sourcing.

Imagine that you need a certain fruit to source a certain color. If it’s grown in China instead of India, it will be different due to the climate and terroir. Each fruit’s hue could shift alongside ensuing chemical differences. That means fruits sourced from two different parts of the globe for color need to be constantly rebalanced and mixed appropriately to control each shade. Furthermore, those natural ingredients come with added concerns around contamination and food safety that don’t accompany their sterile synthetic counterparts.

Any color but brown

Making matters tricker is that processed foods add dyes in part because they oxidize, turning food brown over time. That’s specifically a concern for Welch’s, which are mostly oxidation-prone fruit that’s been stabilized in gelatine (which is less color-dependable than drier processed foods due to its water content). The team clarifies that not all products are as tricky to update with natural dyes as their own product—Ramani notes that hard candies, for instance, should be much easier, as desiccant sugars and corn syrup keeps colors more stable. The other unique challenge facing Welch’s is that this fruit creates acidity, and acids, too, will break down natural colors.

Each different color—like the yellows in its orange snacks, and the reds in its strawberry—had to be developed on its own. The company also created a new, proprietary process to add its natural dyes to its puree on the assembly line at a precise moment, using just the right method—and it updated its own packaging to tweak the exchange of oxygen.

Even still, to validate each color, they didn’t want to simply simulate the effects of heat or humidity. So they created the snacks and let them sit on the shelf, analyzing them each month for 18 months to see if the color shifted. The tests involved dozens of different natural dyes to find those that worked best.

“There were times where we’re at, you know, six months, seven months, and we didn’t like the way the color had held up,” says Ramani. “And so then we got to start over again, right back at one month.”

Yellow was the first color Welch’s solved—in 2015, concerns of yellow dyes spiked with research linking them to cancer triggers—and in what the team deemed to be relatively easy fix, it replaced its synthetic yellow with turmeric and annatto (both popular natural yellow dyes Kraft used to update their macaroni and cheese around the same time).

Its other colors are only coming to market now and over the next several months. The new red is made from purple carrot, red grape, and anthocyanins. Of all of the colors, its most difficult update was blue. Despite it filling our oceans and sky, blue is actually one of the world’s rarest colors. The company found its solution in South America’s huito fruit, which looks something like jackfruit crossed with a lime, but develops blue tones when exposed to air. Alongside a little spirulina, it created just the right color.

Trying the new version

After hearing so much about Welch’s commitment to a perfect color switch, as I open two packs of Welch’s Fruit Snacks side-by-side—one with artificial dyes and one with natural—I am surprised that I can definitely see a difference, as can my kids (who do both partake in Welch’s now and again). The naturally dyed snacks are undeniably less saturated, with slightly less rich reds and oranges.

“Scientifically there will never be complete parity between artificial and natural colors,” Ramani concedes. “We conducted side-by-side visual and sensory panels internally and externally . . . most consumers either couldn’t tell the difference, or preferred the new colors knowing they came from natural sources.”

If I weren’t looking at them side-by-side, I’d never know myself. But I do swear the new snacks taste a little less sweet. It’s something my son notes, too, unprompted and unaware of research pointing out just this phenomenon. If we were blindfolded or in a dark movie theater, would we have noticed? We’d need to set up a larger blind taste test to know.

That said, there is no shortage of sweet treats on the market if your only concern is a sugar blast. And as a consumer who has loathed unnecessary artificial dyes for years—perhaps the one health topic on which RFK Jr and scientifically minded liberals agree—I’m only more likely to buy Welch’s now. And watching my kids eagerly nosh on my remaining press samples, it doesn’t seem they’re sweating the changes, either.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/p-1-91367059-welchs-natural-colors.jpg",N,,2025-07-14 08:09:17.431266

Nike is said to be focusing on different sports categories across its various brands, including Nike, Jordan, and Converse.

The brand has been grappling with slower sales growth and increasing competition within the global market recently.

In its fourth-quarter revenues of fiscal 2025, Converse recorded a 26% decrease in sales, amounting to $357m on both reported and currency-neutral bases. The brand also saw a 19% drop in annual revenue to $1.7bn, with an 18% decline on a currency-neutral basis.

Revenues at Nike fell 10% to $46.31bn in FY25.

These challenges have led to cost-cutting initiatives and a strategic shift towards performance-oriented sports products.

Carver’s tenure at Converse spanned 15 years and included key leadership positions in North America and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).

Cain, who has been with Nike for over two decades and currently serves as vice president and general manager of Nike Global Men’s, is set to assume his new responsibilities after a transition period concluding at the end of July.

Cain’s appointment follows a broader series of executive reshuffles at Nike.

In May this year, the company promoted Amy Montagne, Global Women’s VP/GM to president at Nike.

Phil McCartney, formerly VP of Footwear advanced to EVP, chief innovation, design and product officer.

Chief marketing officer Nicole Graham was also promoted to EVP, chief marketing officer to lead Nike, Jordan and Converse.

While the Kraft Heinz combination appeared to go well briefly, sales and profits began flagging within a couple of years.
On July 10, a day before the Journal’s article, Kraft Heinz shares closed at $26.47, down 58% from the May 2017 adjusted close.
Kraft grocery brands include Mac & Cheese, Ore-Ida, Philadelphia cream cheese, Oscar Mayer, Capri Sun, Velveeta, Lunchables and Jell-O.","CHICAGO ­— In what would mark the end of a notoriously unsuccessful business combination, The Kraft Heinz Co. is considering spinning off a large part of the grocery foods business acquired a decade ago with the merger of The H.J. Heinz Co. and Kraft Foods. News of the potentially impeding breakup was reported July 11 by The Wall Street Journal.

Under the plan, several Kraft products would be spun off into a new entity, and the remaining company would produce and market a portfolio focused on condiments and sauces, including the Heinz brand, the Journal said.

In response to an inquiry from the publication, a Kraft Heinz spokesperson said, “As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value.”

The May remarks by Carlos Abrams-Rivera, chief executive officer, prompted speculation Kraft Heinz would shed businesses. Robert Moskow, an analyst with TD Cowen, wrote at the time the announcement meant some businesses would be divested, adding, “We, too, believe KHC should slim down its portfolio.”

In November 2021, the company sold portions of its cheese business to the Lactalis Group and Emmit Roth USA Inc.

The July 2015 merger of Heinz and Kraft was accompanied by considerable investor enthusiasm. Heinz had been acquired two years earlier by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway in a $28 billion deal, a transaction that appeared highly successful before the Kraft merger. Meanwhile, the Kraft grocery business had been separated in 2012 from its snack foods brands (mostly Nabisco), a business that was renamed Mondelez International.

While the Kraft Heinz combination appeared to go well briefly, sales and profits began flagging within a couple of years. Numerous efforts since then have failed to reignite growth. The company’s share price (adjusted for subsequent dividends) recorded its highest monthly close in May 2017 at $63.44 and has not returned to that level since. On July 10, a day before the Journal’s article, Kraft Heinz shares closed at $26.47, down 58% from the May 2017 adjusted close. Shares closed July 11 at $27.14, up 67¢, or 2.5%, for the day.

ArcelorMittal South Africa will release its half-year financial results on July 31.","(Reuters) -Talks with the South African government have so far yielded little progress to avert the closure of loss-making long steel operations at ArcelorMittal South Africa, the company said on Monday.

The South African unit of world number two steelmaker ArcelorMittal SA initially said in November 2023 it planned to close the two plants, citing weak domestic demand, high electricity tariffs, poor freight logistics and competition from local scrap metal recycling mini-mills and imports from China.

""Regrettably, limited progress has been made to date in redressing the major structural impediments,"" ArcelorMittal South Africa said in a trading update. It said the closure could no longer be postponed beyond September 30 unless a solution is found soon.

South Africa's trade and industry minister Parks Tau told lawmakers on July 4 that the government was in ""firefighting mode"" as it tries to avoid the closure of ArcelorMittal's operations in KwaZulu Natal and near Johannesburg.

The closure of the plants, which supply rail, roads and bars to the construction, mining and manufacturing sectors as well as components for the automotive industry, has been deferred twice as the company and the government sought to save the 3,500 jobs directly under threat.

In March, the steel company postponed the closures to September 30 after the state-owned Industrial Development Corporation injected 1.683 billion rand ($94.22 million) in cash.

Imports have flooded the domestic market, taking up more than 35% of local steel demand, while freight rail service ""deteriorated to its lowest levels ever, resulting in significantly elevated operating risk,"" the steelmaker's statement said.

ArcelorMittal South Africa expects to report a headline loss per share between 0.89 rand and 0.99 rand ($0.0498-$0.0554) for the six months to June 30, narrowing its loss from 1 rand per share during the same period last year.

Sales volumes declined by about 10% in the first half of 2025 compared to last year, the company said.

ID35,S&P Global,2025-07-14 10:37:33+00:00,Dublin City Council,New Business in Dublin Contracts in Q2,www.facebook.com,,,,,https://www.dublincity.ie/news/new-business-dublin-contracts-q2,"At 52.6 output across the rest of Ireland increased in line with that in Dublin.
This ended a five-quarter sequence of expansion in new business and is most likely a reflection of the uncertainty that changing US trade policy is causing.
On a more positive note, all three sectors that make up business activity, were in expansion mode in Dublin in Q2 2025.
The rise in staffing levels in Dublin was softer than in the Rest of Ireland (52.2).
The Overall PMI is based on the output/business activity question from each survey.","The latest PMI survey from S&P Global, shows that business activity in Dublin’s private sector increased in the second quarter of 2025, albeit at the softest rate of expansion since late 2023.

The headline rate stood at 52.2, broadly in line with the 52.6 seen in the previous quarter. Crucially this remains above the 50-point mark that denotes expansion. At 52.6 output across the rest of Ireland increased in line with that in Dublin.

The Capital’s New Orders component contracted for the first time since Q4 2023. It dropped 2.1 pp from the first quarter of the year to 49.9 indicating a marginal contraction. This ended a five-quarter sequence of expansion in new business and is most likely a reflection of the uncertainty that changing US trade policy is causing. In contrast, new orders across the Rest of Ireland expanded to 53.0, up from 52.7 last quarter.

On a more positive note, all three sectors that make up business activity, were in expansion mode in Dublin in Q2 2025. The Manufacturing sector (54.2) showed the strongest rate of growth which was particularly notable as it bounced back from a contraction of 48.9 last quarter. Both the Construction (55.8) and Service (50.3) sectors posted increases in activity but at slower rates than seen in Q1 when they were at 57.8 and 53.4 respectively. Similarly, the Rest of Ireland saw increases in activity in all sectors; Manufacturing (53.4), Service (53.0) and Construction (50.4).

Continuing the trend seen since the opening quarter of 2021, employment increased in the latest three-month period. The modest pace of job creation (51.3) was fractionally quicker than in the opening quarter of 2025 (51.2). The rise in staffing levels in Dublin was softer than in the Rest of Ireland (52.2).

Commenting on the PMI, Andrew Harker, Economics Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence said:

“It was good to see a return to growth in manufacturing production in Dublin, which meant that all three monitored sectors contributed to the overall expansion in business activity seen in the second quarter of the year. Overall, however, the picture was quite subdued, with little movement in new orders during the quarter meaning that firms increased their output and employment only modestly. With US trade policy potentially becoming clearer soon, the Dublin private sector is at something of a crossroads as we enter the second half of the year. We will hopefully see a demand environment more conducive to growth in Q3.”

The legislation introduces stricter work verification requirements for Medicaid recipients in states that expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act, requiring proof of employment every six months starting in 2026 or 2027. Experts warn this will overwhelm state Medicaid departments already operating with limited staff and resources.

The bill’s changes may lead to mass disenrollments, with the Congressional Budget Office projecting 7.8 million people could lose coverage by 2034. The process is expected to begin in 2027. This poses a challenge for insurers, as the remaining enrollees are likely to be sicker, increasing healthcare costs and shrinking profit margins. States may also reduce payments to insurers due to federal funding cuts, further tightening margins.

Companies like Centene and Molina, which have significant exposure to Medicaid, could be more impacted than those with diversified portfolios like Aetna and UnitedHealthcare. Insurers may respond by exiting less profitable states, focusing on strongholds with scale, or adjusting plans to retain healthier members. Strategies may include enhanced benefits such as transportation services, social support programs, and perks to make plans more attractive.

Despite the increased administrative burden and financial pressure, some insurers may aim to retain coverage by working closely with federal and state partners. However, the industry could face a period of retrenchment, prioritizing markets where profitability is more predictable.

By partnering with Eastern Airlines, we are bringing our members a completely new 'in-air' experience,"" said Liu Wenjuan, CEO of Starbucks China.
The joint membership program also sets up a two-way incentive mechanism: Starbucks members can receive 100 Eastern Airlines miles after activation, while Eastern Airlines members can receive a Starbucks gift star.
In terms of accelerating consumption, Starbucks Diamond members can earn 1.5 times Eastern Airlines points reward when purchasing tickets through Eastern Airlines' direct channels; meanwhile, Eastern Airlines platinum, gold, and silver card members can also enjoy 1.5 times star rewards for their consumption at Starbucks.
Meanwhile, Eastern Airlines has long been deeply engaged in Yunnan, possessing extensive route coverage and targeted support experience.","On July 14, Starbucks China announced a comprehensive collaboration with China Eastern Airlines (hereinafter referred to as ""Eastern Airlines""). This partnership not only covers the integration of the joint membership system but also extends to three major areas: co-creation of Yunnan coffee, co-creation in cultural tourism, and co-creation in sustainable development, marking Starbucks China's outstanding innovation in value-based experiences.

""Creating a higher quality 'Star-style life' for our members has always been Starbucks' unwavering pursuit. By partnering with Eastern Airlines, we are bringing our members a completely new 'in-air' experience,"" said Liu Wenjuan, CEO of Starbucks China. ""In the future, whether they are in the clouds or strolling through the city, they will gain a familiar and definitive sense of value.""

Currently, competition in the Chinese coffee market is becoming increasingly intense, and consumer attention is constantly diverting. This move once again demonstrates Starbucks' confidence and determination in deepening its presence in the Chinese market: adhering to a 'long-termism' strategy that focuses on the customer and relies on value-based experiences, to create a higher quality and more valuable 'Star-style life' for Chinese consumers. A cup of coffee is no longer just a medium for functional consumption, but an emotional symbol of a continuous connection between the brand and its users.

Exploring value co-creation under the 'Coffee Journey Model'.

A cup of coffee during travel has become part of modern living. As representative companies deeply focused on user experience in their respective fields, Starbucks and Eastern Airlines have joined forces, with the core focus on building a joint membership system, integrating the Star Enjoy Club and Eastern Airlines’ Wanlihang Club’s membership systems to explore multi-dimensional value co-creation under the 'Coffee Journey Model'.

Members of different tiers from both parties can now initiate the 'Coffee Journey Model', enjoying an exclusive experience covering the full chain of ""membership binding, consumption points, and flight"". For example, on the day of flight travel, Starbucks Diamond Joint members can enjoy free in-flight Wi-Fi, while Eastern Airlines Platinum and Gold Joint members can receive a complimentary medium drink at airport stores without the need to redeem stars or points.

The joint membership program also sets up a two-way incentive mechanism: Starbucks members can receive 100 Eastern Airlines miles after activation, while Eastern Airlines members can receive a Starbucks gift star. In terms of accelerating consumption, Starbucks Diamond members can earn 1.5 times Eastern Airlines points reward when purchasing tickets through Eastern Airlines' direct channels; meanwhile, Eastern Airlines platinum, gold, and silver card members can also enjoy 1.5 times star rewards for their consumption at Starbucks. Members at other levels can receive additional star incentives by meeting spending thresholds within a limited time.

This mechanism not only bridges the membership path between the airline travel and coffee scenarios but also enhances the flexibility of point usage and the perception of the value of membership rights. Unlike traditional shallow collaborations across brands, the 'Coffee Journey Model' emphasizes multiple consumption touchpoints before, during, and after the flight, creating an integrated life chain of 'Coffee + Airline Travel' value co-creation, further enhancing the continuity and stickiness of brand interactions.

This cooperation will also extend to three key co-creation directions, reflecting both parties' innovative exploration around 'value-based experiences' and promoting the transformation of functional consumption into a value-based experiential form that carries more emotional warmth and cultural connections.

First is Yunnan coffee co-creation, where Starbucks and Eastern Airlines have natural synergy in Yunnan. Since establishing its first Asia-Pacific coffee grower support center in Pu'er in 2012, Starbucks has continuously promoted the high-quality development of Yunnan's coffee industry through open-source agronomy support, premium price procurement mechanisms, and brand empowerment. Meanwhile, Eastern Airlines has long been deeply engaged in Yunnan, possessing extensive route coverage and targeted support experience. In this cooperation, the two sides will jointly launch 'Yunnan Coffee Themed Flights' to allow travelers to deeply experience the unique Yunnan coffee culture through multiple forms such as cabin decorations, coffee tastings, film screenings, and themed gifts during the flight.

Secondly, in terms of cultural and tourism co-creation, relying on Starbucks’ network of over 7,700 'third space' stores across the country and Eastern Airlines' deep layout in 'aviation + local' cultural and tourism resources, both parties will jointly create culturally distinctive tourism products and service experiences that enrich the cultural content and emotional value during consumers' travels, thereby promoting local cultural and economic development.

In terms of sustainable development co-creation, both parties adhere to a shared environmental protection philosophy and practice, and will jointly launch a 'Green Flight' project that encourages more customers to participate in green and low-carbon actions, collectively injecting more energy into a sustainable future. Starbucks' long-term investment in eco-friendly packaging and green store operations, combined with Eastern Airlines' aviation experience in energy saving and carbon reduction, will provide solid support for this plan, collaboratively promoting the implementation of green concepts in the travel and consumption chain.

'Coffee +' empowers the membership system, enhancing emotional stickiness.

'Coffee + Airline Travel' cooperation is not only a functional commercial collaboration but also reflects the deep synergy between both parties in brand values, user needs insights, and ecological co-building capabilities. Through this cooperation, Starbucks no longer provides services solely in the 'coffee scenario' but further integrates into a broader life journey, continuously enhancing the brand's cultural connectivity and emotional penetration beyond functional value.

In fact, this innovative exploration is another key initiative for Starbucks to continuously deepen the value of its membership system. Since the launch of the Star Enjoy Club in 2011, this membership system has become an important connecting bridge between the brand and consumers. In June of last year, the Star Enjoy Club membership system underwent a comprehensive upgrade, enhancing exclusivity and participation through the addition of Diamond Star membership levels, a new star redemption mechanism, and gameplay. The upgraded system not only enhances the personalized dimension of user experiences but also becomes a key carrier for Starbucks to build 'value-oriented consumption.'

Meanwhile, Starbucks accelerates its cross-scenario ecological layout, relying on system upgrades to 'break the circle' for the first time in collaboration with Hilton Group to launch a 'Coffee + Hotel' joint membership program, integrating multiple unique benefits that connect travel and daily consumption scenarios.

Data shows that since the upgrade in 2024, the registered members of the Star Enjoy Club have grown from 0.13 billion to 0.16 billion, with a steady increase in loyal members. Among them, the number of active members within 90 days has surpassed 20 million, and the membership sales contribution rate has reached 75%. These numbers reflect not only the emotional stickiness users have towards Starbucks but also demonstrate the strategic value of its membership system in promoting long-term user engagement.

Faced with the common pressure of a 'price war' in the coffee industry, Starbucks consistently chooses 'value' and 'experience depth' as its core competitiveness, and through cross-border collaboration, scenario extension, and membership system upgrades, it continues to empower member rights, expanding the depth and density of user touchpoints, injecting new connotations into its brand moat in the battle for existing customers.

From beverage innovation to spatial resonance, continuously expanding the boundaries of the 'Star' lifestyle.

In addition to the continuous optimization of the membership system, Starbucks' deepening of user value is also reflected in its collaborative layout across three aspects: products, spaces, and cross-content, presenting a strong focus on consumer needs, experience optimization, and an emphasis on local cultural integration.

At the product level, in April of this year, Starbucks officially launched the 'True Taste Sugar-Free' innovative system. This is the result of several months of work by Starbucks China, involving 74 rounds of sensory flavor testing and more than 40 versions for development and iteration, capable of completely separating the flavors and sugars in the original flavored syrups while satisfying consumers' health and sugar reduction demands without sacrificing flavor. As a trial product of this system, the Starbucks Rose 20 and Jasmine 100 series received positive market feedback shortly after their launch in the first quarter, validating the user acceptance of the innovative path.

Customization has always been a very unique beverage customization play for Starbucks, and it has become an important way to establish interaction between the brand and its customers. Consumers can freely combine different sweetness, milk bases, tea bases, and flavor ingredients according to their personal preferences, creating 'their own cup.' This flexibility not only increases customer engagement and fun during ordering but also gives rise to 'secret menus' on Social Media, becoming a source of inspiration for product innovation. The previously popular Hongcha Yuanyang Latte and Fully Iced Americano hidden hits, for instance, are 'Star-style' plays widely communicated by customers that ultimately feed back into the permanent menu, forming a two-way co-creation mechanism between the brand and consumers.

The launch of the 'True Flavor Sugar-Free' innovation system further expands the combination space, achieving over 500 different flavor and sweetness pairing options, which undoubtedly enhances the breadth and depth of the customization dimension.

In addition to coffee Ontology, Starbucks is also accelerating the expansion of 'non-coffee' scene layouts to meet consumers' diverse beverage needs throughout the day and across multiple scenarios. In June of this year, Starbucks proposed the consumption rhythm of 'morning coffee, afternoon non-coffee' for the first time, strengthening the three flagship categories of Frappuccino, Iced Shaken Tea, and Tea Latte. In fact, these three categories have already accumulated a stable consumer base due to their unique characteristics, with significant growth potential. Among them, Frappuccino is particularly popular, serving as the 'entry choice' for many non-coffee drinkers to experience Starbucks and is also the mainstay of summer sales. In this push, Starbucks is more leveraging the launch of the 'True Flavor Sugar-Free' innovative system to create a certain price space, encouraging more customers to explore customization play.

On the basis of product innovation, Starbucks also actively responds to the current trend of 'emotional consumption' by co-creating cross-industry content, strengthening the emotional connection between the brand and consumers. This year, Starbucks China has collaborated with IPs such as Snoopy and Disney, launching a series of themed beverages, including three iced shaken teas inspired by the three main characters of 'Zootopia.' At the same time, the brand invited Mayday to serve as summer ambassadors, creating a communication bridge that aligns with the cultural interests of younger demographics. Fans of Mayday have also utilized the 'True Flavor Sugar-Free' system to independently customize the 'Bubu Frappuccino,' which has gradually become a 'beverage code' among communities, further deepening emotional identification and participation with the brand.

The rich customization options help consumers escape the monotonous consumption experience, while store space serves as an important interface for the brand to reach users, becoming a cultural field that enriches the 'Star-style life.' Starbucks has always emphasized the localized expression of the 'third space,' avoiding template replication and continues to actively promote the deep expansion of high-quality, localized stores in recent years.

From the Ningbo Dongqian Lake Taolu Street Store 'in the village' to the 'highest altitudinal' store in Yunnan's Yulong Snow Mountain, and then to cultural tourism landmark stores in Jiuzhaigou, Dunhuang, and Zhangye, Starbucks, through localized 'third space' design and site selection strategies, enhances cultural locality and the brand's presence in urban life. This 'non-standardized' spatial layout not only boosts social attributes but also constructs a deeper cultural resonance between the brand and consumers.

Essentially, Starbucks is no longer just a coffee brand in the Chinese market, but is building the ""Star-style"" lifestyle it advocates—a framework of experiences that can be extended, iterated, and embedded into consumers' daily life scenarios. From drink flavors to service scenarios, from the memberships system to cross-border collaborations, Starbucks revolves around ""people"" in its business logic, emphasizing a sense of ""value"" rather than ""price"", offering long-term service that accompanies rather than a one-time Trade conversion.

In an increasingly competitive and rational market environment, the contest of brand power is no longer limited to the product itself, but rather to its ability to position itself within diverse life scenarios, shaping lasting and rich user relationships. Starbucks China is continuously validating this proposition through the ""Coffee+"" model: a cup of coffee is not just the starting point of consumption, but also the entry point that connects lifestyle, cultural identity, and even value choices.",https://pubimg.futunn.com/20220801035174077aff53868dc.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 09:08:34.551260

At ETBrandEquity's Brand World Summit 2025, marketing leaders unveiled the shift in live entertainment during an intriguing panel discussion. The statistics are nothing short of revolutionary - over 30 million Indians attended live events in 2024, a jaw-dropping three-fold increase from 2019. The live entertainment industry is set to explode, projected to surge from ₹12,000 crore to ₹23,000 crore by 2030.

This is a cultural metamorphosis reshaping how brands connect with audiences. The constellation of marketing leaders who decoded this phenomenon during the panel ""Live Events Unleashed: What CMOs Make of Concert Crazy Indians"" moderated by Anirban Chowdhury, senior assistant editor,The Economic Times revealed insights that are transforming the marketing landscape entirely.

Chandrika Jain, CMO, Lenovo India who sees technology as the heartbeat of culture. ""Technology isn't just a tool; it's the very DNA of modern culture,"" she proclaimed during the discussion. Her 'Brave New Art' initiative has already captured 10 million organic views, proving that creativity knows no boundaries. Her most profound insight resonates throughout the industry: brands must breathe the culture they want to inhabit rather than merely observe it from the outside.

The approach taken by Shantanu Gangane, senior director- integrated marketing experience, Coca-Cola India and Southwest Asia, demonstrates how brands can become cultural anthropologists. ""We don't just support events; we create cultural moments that become generational memories,"" he explained to the assembled marketing leaders. Coca-Cola's Coke Studio isn't just a music platform - it's evolved into a cultural institution that has fundamentally redefined musical collaboration in India, bridging generations and musical traditions.

Vineet Sharma, VP marketing , AB InBev, views live events through an entirely different lens - one that places fans at the absolute centre. ""We're not selling a product; we're crafting experiences that become lifelong memories,"" he shared with the audience. Budweiser's strategy transcends traditional beer marketing; instead, the brand creates immersive narratives that resonate deeply with young India, from NBA collaborations to music festivals that become cultural touchstones.

Fashion intersects with this live entertainment revolution in fascinating ways, as Amit Kothari, head of marketing, H&M eloquently demonstrated. ""Fashion is a language of self-expression,"" he noted during the panel discussion. For H&M, a concert isn't merely an event - it transforms into a runway of personal storytelling where brands become enablers of individual creativity, allowing people to express themselves with joy, positivity, and confidence.

Advt

Understanding Generation Z proves crucial to this transformation, as Akanksha Dalal, marketing director, Mountain Dew, PepsiCo, clearly articulated. ""This generation doesn't just consume content; they want to be part of the narrative,"" she observed. This insight reveals why brands that don't evolve risk becoming cultural footnotes, as Gen Z demands authentic, immersive experiences rather than passive consumption.

What truly transforms these events from mere concerts to cultural phenomena is the alchemy of music, fashion, technology, and genuine human connection. Brands are no longer passive observers but active creators of experiences that resonate on multiple levels. These events have become platforms for self-expression, cultural exchange, and brand storytelling, where concerts serve as canvases for brands to paint their narratives.

Infrastructure remains a significant challenge as these experiences aim to go mainstream. The journey from niche to mass market requires breaking down multiple barriers, with accessibility becoming paramount for widespread adoption. However, the ROI paradigm has shifted fundamentally - success isn't measured in sales alone anymore but calculated in cultural capital, social media engagement, and brand perception. Metrics have become more nuanced, more human.

As India's live entertainment industry strikes its crescendo, brands are discovering that the sweetest melodies emerge when they become part of the symphony rather than merely conducting from the sidelines.

The big picture: This initiative draws a direct line from social media to the Starbucks app — a strategy familiar to Niccol and Tressie Lieberman, Starbucks' global chief brand officer, from their days at Chipotle.

In 2023, the fast-casual chain introduced three menu items based on TikTok users' personalized orders.

Starbucks secret menu drinks now available

How it works: Starting Monday, Starbucks Rewards members can browse a selection of custom drink creations inspired by customer hacks and social media trends in the app's ""Offers"" tab.

With one tap, a pre-built custom drink is added to the cart with all modifications preloaded, which simplifies ordering, the company said.

Zoom in: The first four customizations featured are:

Cookies on top: A Cold Brew with vanilla syrup, Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Foam and cookie crumble topping.

Dragonfruit glow-up: A Mango Dragonfruit Lemonade Refresher blended with peach juice and topped with Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Foam.

Lemon, tea & pearls: Black tea and lemonade plus raspberry-flavored popping pearls.

Just add white mocha: Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shaken Espresso with White Chocolate Mocha Sauce and Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Foam.

What's next: More customizations will be featured in the future on the app's offer tab, Starbucks said.

Starbucks Secret Menu Contest

State of play: Starbucks is also running the ""Secret Menu Contest"" Monday through July 20. Customers and employees can submit their drink customizations at secretmenucontest.starbucks.com.

The entries will be narrowed down to four final beverage customizations, and public voting will be held on Starbucks Instagram Aug. 18-20.

The finalists' creations will be featured on the app from Aug. 18-25.

Each finalist wins $5,000, and the fan-voted grand prize winner gets an additional $25,000.

However, the structure of the deal could change and there is no guarantee Kraft Heinz would move forward with any such deal, the source said.

News of the potential move is the second effort this week by a storied US company looking to shore up shareholder value as shoppers ditch their pricey products in an uncertain economy.

Earlier this week, cereal maker WK Kellogg agreed to a $3.1 billion buyout deal from Italy’s Ferrero.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the development earlier in the day.

According to the report, a split, which would leave the company with products such as its namesake Heinz ketchup and Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon, could be finalised in the coming weeks.

A company spokesperson said, “As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value.”

Its shares closed up 2.5%.

The company currently has a market value of $31.33 billion.

‘Echoes The Kelloggs Spinoff’

Kraft Heinz was formed in 2015 after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with HJ Heinz, which they bought in 2013.

But it has been a challenging investment for Berkshire.

Inflationary pressures and a shift in focus toward fresher, less processed food have hurt demand for Kraft Heinz’s lunch combos and other products.

It lowered annual forecasts and reported a dour quarter in April, hurt by muted consumer spending.

Kraft Heinz also said last month it would stop the launch of new products with artificial colours in the US after health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. outlined plans to remove synthetic food dyes from the US food supply to address chronic diseases and conditions.

Analyst at Consumer Edge Conor Rattigan said, “KHC spinning off its grocery business echoes the 2023 Kelloggs spinoff in which the company spun off its cereal business, which had been in volumetric decline for some time.

“As CPGs (consumer packaged goods makers) contend with both changing consumer preferences and a challenging consumer environment, other CPGs may look to M&A and/or similar corporate actions to improve their category exposures and improve their top-line trajectory.”",https://img.resized.co/checkout/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLm1hZGlzb25wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMuZXVcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDIxXFxcLzA1XFxcLzE3MTYzNjAxXFxcL0hlaW56XzM2Mjg1NzI3X20uanBnXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjEyMDAsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjo2MjcsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5jaGVja291dC5pZVxcXC9pXFxcL25vaW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjFlMzIxMDc5N2MxODk3NDExYmQwYzYxMzUyYmU4YTk4YjNhNjk5NmQifQ==/kraft-heinz-explores-grocery-business-spinoff-worth-up-to-20bn-checkout.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 09:07:54.623776

A Checklist for Supply Chain Leaders To avoid being caught off guard during peak season, supply chain leaders must act now.","As summer heats up, supply chain leaders are already bracing for the year’s holiday season. From warehousing and logistics to production and fulfillment, every link in the chain must operate at peak performance. But amid the rush to secure seasonal labor and optimize operations, one critical question often goes overlooked:

Do you have the right supervisors in place to lead your teams through the busiest time of the year?

The Hidden Weak Link in the Supply Chain

Research from Express Employment Professionals and The Harris Poll reveals a growing crisis in middle management that’s already straining supply chain performance. Supervisors, the essential bridge between frontline workers and upper management, are burning out, stepping down, or opting out of leadership roles altogether.

55% of supervisors have quit or plan to quit due to a lack of fulfillment or advancement.

33% cite mental health challenges as a reason for leaving.

Younger workers are increasingly rejecting management roles, citing high stress and low reward.

In supply chain environments, where precision, speed, and coordination are non-negotiable, the absence of experienced supervisors can lead to costly disruptions, including missed deadlines, safety incidents, increased turnover, and reduced throughput.

Training Gaps Are Fueling the Fire

Many companies assume they’re preparing supervisors for success, but the data tells a different story. While 86% of hiring managers believe their supervisors have the tools they need, only a fraction offer training in the areas that matter most, such as conflict resolution, emotional intelligence, and providing constructive feedback.

This disconnect is particularly hazardous in supply chain settings, where supervisors must manage diverse teams, resolve real-time issues, and maintain morale under intense pressure. Without proper training and support, even the most capable supervisors can quickly become overwhelmed, leading to burnout, disengagement, and operational breakdowns.

The Cost of Turnover in Supply Chain Roles

When a supervisor leaves, the impact ripples across the entire operation. Productivity drops. Safety risks increase. And the cost of replacing that leader, often 50% to 200% of their annual salary, can be staggering.

In fact, one in five hiring managers say turnover costs their company up to $100,000 per year. In logistics, manufacturing, and distribution, where margins are tight and timelines are critical, such disruptions can derail an entire season.

A Checklist for Supply Chain Leaders

To avoid being caught off guard during peak season, supply chain leaders must act now.

Based on insights from Express franchise owners nationwide, here’s what companies should prioritize to prevent supervisor burnout and turnover:

Set Clear, Reasonable Expectations—Define realistic goals and workloads.

Enforce Time Off—Encourage supervisors to take real breaks to avoid burnout.

Use Contract Workers—Bring in temporary help to manage seasonal spikes.

Train for Real-World Leadership—Focus on conflict resolution, communication, and team management.

Build Peer and Mentorship Networks—Create support systems for supervisors.

Recognize Effort, Not Just Outcomes—Celebrate leadership behaviors, not just KPIs.

Give Supervisors More Autonomy—Empower decision-making on the floor.

Invest in Mental Health Resources—Offer counseling and stress management tools.

Cross-Train Teams—Share responsibilities to reduce pressure on any one role.

Simplify Admin Work—Cut back on busywork that distracts from leadership.

Sources familiar with the company's situation indicate that this new entity could be valued at as much as $20 billion. However, the exact structure of the deal remains uncertain, and there is no guarantee that it will be finalised.

The potential spin-off comes as Kraft Heinz seeks to address persistent challenges in its grocery segment, which has struggled to keep pace with evolving consumer preferences.

The company has been under pressure from shareholders to enhance value, particularly as economic conditions prompt consumers to seek more affordable options and healthier alternatives.

This exploration follows a similar move by WK Kellogg, which recently agreed to a $3.1 billion acquisition by Ferrero, indicating a trend of consolidation in the food sector.

Reports suggest that the spin-off would allow Kraft Heinz to retain its core brands, such as Heinz ketchup, Grey Poupon mustard and a range of sauces, while divesting traditional grocery items like boxed dinners and processed cheese.

Such a separation could potentially position the remaining business for faster growth, capitalising on the increasing consumer demand for condiments and sauces over processed meal solutions.

As of now, Kraft Heinz's market capitalisation stands at approximately $31.33 billion, and the company's shares closed up 2.5% following the news of the potential spin-off.

The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace.
Over 261,000 people in Virginia have Aetna healthcare, according to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services.
Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May.
“As uninsured rates climb, so too will health care costs for everyone,” said U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.","Starting next year, Aetna clients in Virginia and other states will no longer be able to purchase individual or family health insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace. Congress also created associated tax credits that have helped some offset those costs even further. Over 261,000 people in Virginia have Aetna healthcare, according to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services.

Aetna is under the CVS umbrella and has participated in the ACA marketplace. Recipients have received emails this summer alerting them of the forthcoming change and the company website outlines it as well.

“As we considered plan options for the future, it became clear we would not be able to provide the same level of value we’ve offered in prior years,” the health insurer’s website stated.

Both the online statement and a request for comment from CVS Health did not clarify what made it “clear” the company felt the need to withdraw, but the shifting federal health care policy landscape could be part of the equation.

Congress has yet to renew ACA tax credits that further help people lower their premium payments and the recently-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not extend the credits either.

As partisan disputes boil, it’s still unclear how new federal law will impact Medicaid in Virginia

Relatedly, the OBBB includes forthcoming changes to hospital funding and Medicaid (another provision of ACA that helps insure pregnant people, children, those with disabilities and lower-income earners).

The Republican-led megabill fielded opposition from Democratic and some Republican federal lawmakers but ultimately passed and was signed by President Donald Trump on July 4. Republican dominance in Congress also threatens the renewal of the ACA tax credits that help people purchase insurance in state marketplaces, which Democrats have championed.

An Aetna spokeswoman did not directly respond when asked if Congress’ pending renewal or failure to renew ACA tax credits had anything to do with the decision. She did reiterate the same statement from the website that CVS remains “committed to helping members make the most of their benefits in 2025.”

An email forwarded to The Mercury by a reader with Aetna insurance outlines how clients will need to shop for a new insurer when the 2026 enrollment period opens in the fall.

“You will get more information and helpful guidance as open enrollment approaches,” the Aetna letter reads.

Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May. Since then, as Congress debated the OBBB, lawmakers and hospital professionals around the nation and in Virginia have expressed concerns about what shrinking health care coverage options might mean across all income brackets.

Last year, the company introduced a DCS Card that lets users instantly convert stablecoins into Singapore dollars.
“Consumers can expect better transaction speed and more optimal cost.” But as digital payments grow, strong regulations are needed.
With users wanting fast, borderless payments, Leng believes digital and decentralised tools will keep changing how money moves.
With users demanding real-time, borderless payments, Leng thinks digital and decentralised solutions will continue to reshape the way money moves.","A stablecoin conversion card offers a bridge between crypto and cash.

DCS Card Centre Pte. Ltd is embracing digital asset innovation as superapps, fintechs, and blockchain technology transform the payment landscape.

“The broader payment ecosystem is undergoing a rapid shift in standards, and that is very much propelled by the rise of digital banks and fintechs,” Dayna Leng, chief marketing officer at DCS Card Centre, told Asian Banking & Finance.

Leng noted that the shift isn’t limited to traditional financial institutions.

“They're all coming up with super apps—proprietary wallets like ShopBack Pay, Shopee Pay, GrabPay, and BNPL (buy now, pay later) options even in nonfinance apps,” she said via video teleconference. “All of this is moving towards creating this new level of standard for financial institutions.”

DCS, formerly Diners Club Singapore, has expanded beyond issuing credit and charge cards to include broader payment solutions and, more recently, Web3 services.

Last year, the company introduced a DCS Card that lets users instantly convert stablecoins into Singapore dollars. This means customers can spend their digital assets directly, while merchants still receive payment in fiat currency.

“For Web3 community [members] who really want to have cash on hand from the stablecoins that they owned, they can do that through a physical card,” Leng said. “They can withdraw from the ATM.”

She said the payment space is now more fluid than ever, as digital tools blur the lines between traditional finance and decentralised systems.

“We have gone from debit to credit to mobile to digital, from operating within the traditional finance ecosystem to dual real payments across both [traditional finance] and Web3 economies,” Leng said.

This shift includes programmable tokens—smart contracts that make payments automatically when certain conditions are met. Banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and DBS Bank Ltd. are exploring this, and Leng sees it as a step toward better system integration.

“All in all, the interoperability between economies will continue to grow,” she said. “Consumers can expect better transaction speed and more optimal cost.”

But as digital payments grow, strong regulations are needed.

“Everything needs to be regulated first,” Leng said, She added that the digital payment landscape will evolve, but institutions should ensure it stays responsible.

DCS is entering Web3 to stay relevant as the payment landscape rapidly changes. With users wanting fast, borderless payments, Leng believes digital and decentralised tools will keep changing how money moves.

CityFibre, the UK’s largest independent full fibre platform, has reached agreement with its shareholders and existing lenders on a major £2.3bn financing round, accelerating its next phase of growth.

The financing includes £500m in new equity secured from CityFibre shareholders, Infrastructure at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, Antin Infrastructure Partners, Mubadala Investment Company and Interogo Holding, underscoring their continued commitment to CityFibre’s long term strategy and the company’s role in providing critical digital infrastructure across the UK.

The facility will support CityFibre’s continued network investment and enable it to rapidly connect hundreds of thousands of new customers across its nationwide network.

An accordion facility of £800m is also being made available to help drive CityFibre’s continued expansion through the acquisition of full fibre network assets. This facility will be used to finance the company’s M&A pipeline and cement its position as the sector consolidator.

Greg Mesch, CEO of CityFibre, said: “This round of financing will supercharge CityFibre’s next phase of growth, as we consolidate the altnet sector, accelerate the pace of customer connections and unleash the full power of our market-leading 10Gb XGS-PON network, for the benefit of all our partners, their customers and for the UK economy.

“There is huge opportunity ahead for CityFibre and it is testament to the success of the company that we have such strong backing from our lenders and shareholders. This multi-billion-pound investment into critical digital infrastructure will deliver significant benefits across the UK, helping to realise potential and unlocking economic growth.”

This investment marks a significant moment in upgrading the UK’s digital infrastructure. It will deliver world-class infrastructure and services to millions of consumers and businesses and provide the digital foundations for the UK’s economic growth for decades to come.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said: “Today’s announcement shows Britain is attracting billions of pounds of investment, including through the National Wealth Fund, driving growth across British businesses.

“Investing in our digital infrastructure is key to ensuring our economy is fit for the future. Through our Plan for Change we’re growing the economy by boosting investment in Britain and working hand in hand with businesses to create jobs, to put more money in working people’s pockets.”

Secretary of State for Technology, Peter Kyle said: ""This investment in CityFibre is welcome news. It's proof our telecoms industry is driving investment into the UK, as well as building the digital foundations that will serve generations to come.

“The success of the UK's network providers will help accelerate the rollout of gigabit-capable broadband to millions of homes and businesses across the country. I hope to see even more success stories like this one, because this sector is critical not just to improving internet speeds, but to transforming quality of life for communities and creating opportunities in every part of the country as part of our Plan for Change.""

Over the past 12 months, CityFibre has announced its first full year of profitability1, launched Sky’s full fibre and Gigafast+ services across CityFibre’s nationwide network, completed the integration of Lit Fibre, announced the acquisition of Connexin’s full fibre infrastructure2 and reached more than 4.5 million premises with its full fibre network, over half way to CityFibre’s milestone of 8 million premises.

However, the structure of the deal could change and there is no guarantee Kraft Heinz would move forward with any such deal, the source said.

News of the potential move is the second effort this week by a storied US company looking to shore up shareholder value as shoppers ditch their pricey products in an uncertain economy.

Earlier this week, cereal maker WK Kellogg agreed to a $3.1 billion (€2.7 billion) buyout deal from Italy's Ferrero.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the development earlier in the day. According to the report, a split, which would leave the company with products such as its namesake Heinz ketchup and Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon, could be finalised in the coming weeks.

""As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value,"" a company spokesperson said.

Its shares closed up 2.5%. The company currently has a market value of $31.33 billion (€26.82 billion).

A Challenging Investment

Kraft Heinz was formed in 2015 after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz, which they bought in 2013. But it has been a challenging investment for Berkshire.

Inflationary pressures and a shift in focus toward fresher, less processed food have hurt demand for Kraft Heinz's lunch combos and other products. It lowered annual forecasts and reported a dour quarter in April, hurt by muted consumer spending.

Kraft Heinz also said last month it would stop the launch of new products with artificial colours in the US after Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. outlined plans to remove synthetic food dyes from the US food supply to address chronic diseases and conditions.

""KHC spinning off its grocery business echoes the 2023 Kellogg spinoff in which the company spun off its cereal business, which had been in volumetric decline for some time,"" said Connor Rattigan, analyst at Consumer Edge.

In commemoration of their annual social responsibility week, AXA Week for Good, hundreds of the company’s employees visited various schools across Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt, educating students and teachers on the identification, prevention, and reporting of sexual and domestic violence.

AXA Week for Good is the flagship volunteering programme of AXA Hearts In Action (AHIA), a programme through which AXA encourages its employees to contribute to positive societal and environmental impacts through volunteering, expertise, related financial support, and in-kind donations.

Through the AHIA, our employees do not just give time to great causes; we work together for a better future. We share our knowledge and expertise as a people with a shared purpose of acting for human progress by protecting what matters by helping vulnerable communities and people around us, said Rashidat Adebisi, Chief Client Officer, AXA Mansard.

Under the theme “Being a Girl Shouldn’t Be A Risk,” AXA Mansard employees participated in awareness walks to sensitize the public about the danger of domestic and sexual violence on children and the nation’s future.

According to Adebisi, this theme presents the organization with an opportunity to demonstrate the social, economic, and ethical benefits of protecting the girl child. She said Nigeria’s 105 million children and adolescents aged 0–17 years represent about half of the country’s population.

For a country betting its economic growth on the strength and human capital of its young population, the alarming rate and spate of Violence Against Children (VAC) threaten the future not just of our country, but of the African continent.

She noted that the staggering reality that 60% of Nigerian children experience one or forms of violence before age 18 is a call to action for everyone, and our employees are responding to this clarion call so that the thousand of Nigerian girls who go through physical, emotional, sexual and psychological violence can find safe places to get help; but most important, we can rid our society of perpetrators, she furthered.

Sorrell quipped: “I’m sure John Wren [the CEO of Omnicom], with 20:20 hindsight, would have preferred to acquire WPP rather than IPG.
Analysts at Barclays and Morgan Stanley reacted positively to Rose's appointment after WPP announced the news on July 10.
We have and continue to build market-leading AI capabilities, alongside an unrivalled reputation for creative excellence and a pre-eminent client list.
WPP has the most brilliant, talented, creative people, and I can't wait to write the company's next chapter together.”","Martin Sorrell, founder and executive chairman of S4 Capital, has said that WPP may be “too far gone” for incoming chief executive Cindy Rose to have the effect needed to turn around the business.

The founder and former CEO of WPP, who has previously advocated for the sale of the holding company’s media arm WPP Media (then known as Group M), again raised the question of whether or not WPP may be “better off” breaking down its units to sell them off, criticising outgoing CEO Mark Read’s leadership over the past seven years.

Speaking to Campaign, he said: “Cindy Rose’s operating experience at Disney, Vodafone and Microsoft may be stellar and she may be very talented, but the question is whether the business is too far gone as a result of the approach of the last seven years and would be better off being dismembered into its still standing constituent parts or consolidated elsewhere.”

The market cap of rival Publicis is now four times the size of WPP and WPP issued a profit warning for Q2, revising its full year revenue forecast to a decline of between 3% and 5%.

Sorrell quipped: “I’m sure John Wren [the CEO of Omnicom], with 20:20 hindsight, would have preferred to acquire WPP rather than IPG. In any event, the jury is out.”

Primarily, Sorrell added, WPP “needs leadership, a new strategy and a clear structure” to rival the “clear strategy around digital, data and media and a country-led structure”, which, according to him, Publicis has.

Rose, he continued, fits the criteria sought by WPP chairman Philip Jansen, but, he noted, she will have to “be located in, and 24/7 laser-focused on, the US, undoubtedly the centre of the client world and where WPP people are probably most demoralised”.

The US was among the first of WPP’s markets to face job cuts as part of the restructure of Group M and employees were disgruntled earlier this year by Read’s return-to-office mandate.

Sorrell expressed scepticism over agencies’ ability to build software-as-a-service type businesses, as WPP is attempting to do with Open, in competition with companies like Adobe, which are already dedicated to such a set-up.

He also pointed to client and talent losses as the result of the ""collapse"" of brands, including Wunderman, J Walter Thompson and Young & Rubicam, as a cause for concern.

He said: “WPP has spent over £1.5bn over the last five years below the headline operating profit line on mostly cash restructuring charges and built up multiple levels of overhead at group, sub-group and company levels.

“Under the guise of simplification, the leadership has collapsed storied brands such as J Walter Thompson, Young & Rubicam, Wunderman, Grey, Hill&Knowlton, losing not only many talented leaders, but clients as a result too.”

WPP has been approached for comment.

Analysts at Barclays and Morgan Stanley reacted positively to Rose's appointment after WPP announced the news on July 10. However, they flagged up her lack of experience in capital markets and within ad agencies.

Jansen praised Read for his “tireless commitment” and “progress he has made to modernise, simplify and transform the company over the last seven years as CEO” in the statement to the stock market about Rose’s appointment.

She was also optimistic about the agency group's future: “WPP is a company I know and love — not only from my six years on the board [as a WPP non-executive director] but as a client and partner for many years before that — and I couldn't be happier or more excited to be appointed as CEO.”

Rose added, “There are so many opportunities ahead for WPP. We have and continue to build market-leading AI capabilities, alongside an unrivalled reputation for creative excellence and a pre-eminent client list. WPP has the most brilliant, talented, creative people, and I can't wait to write the company's next chapter together.”",https://cdn.i.haymarketmedia.asia/?n=campaign-asia%2fcontent%2f20250714015938_Untitled+design+(2).png&h=630&w=1200&q=75&v=20250320&c=1,N,,2025-07-14 05:04:10.635547

European trade ministers are meeting in Brussels. This follows US President Donald Trump's tariff announcement on the European Union. The EU is a major trade partner for the US. The EU is delaying retaliatory tariffs. They hope to reach a trade deal with the US. Negotiations will continue. The EU is also exploring new markets.

European trade ministers are meeting in Brussels on Monday, following U.S. President Donald Trump's surprise announcement of 30% tariffs on the European Union.

The EU is America's biggest business partner and the world's largest trading bloc. The U.S. decision will have repercussions for governments, companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.

""We shouldn't impose countermeasures at this stage, but we should prepare to be ready to use all the tools in the toolbox,"" said Denmark's foreign minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, told reporters ahead of the meeting. ""So we want a deal, but there's an old saying: 'If you want peace, you have to prepare for war.'""

The tariffs, also imposed on Mexico, are set to start on Aug. 1 and could make everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals more expensive in the U.S., and destabilize economies from Portugal to Norway.

Meanwhile, Brussels decided to suspend retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods scheduled to take effect Monday in hopes of reaching a trade deal with the Trump administration by the end of the month.

Live Events

The ""countermeasures"" by the EU, which negotiates trade deals on behalf of its 27 member countries, will be delayed until Aug. 1.

Trump's letter shows ""that we have until the first of August"" to negotiate, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels on Sunday.

MaroS Šefčovič, the EU's trade representative in its talks with the U.S., said negotiations would continue

""I'm absolutely 100% sure that a negotiated solution is much better than the tension which we might have after the 1st of August,"" he told reporters in Brussels on Monday.

""I cannot imagine walking away without genuine effort. Having said that, the current uncertainty caused by unjustified tariffs cannot persist indefinitely and therefore we must prepare for all outcomes, including, if necessary, well-considered proportionate countermeasures to restore the balance in our transit static relationship.""

The letters to the EU and Mexico come in the midst of an on-and-off Trump threat to impose tariffs on countries and right an imbalance in trade.

Trump imposed tariffs in April on dozens of countries, before pausing them for 90 days to negotiate individual deals. As the three-month grace period ended this week, he began sending tariff letters to leaders, but again has pushed back the implementation day for what he says will be just a few more weeks.

If he moves forward with the tariffs, it could have ramifications for nearly every aspect of the global economy.

In the wake of the new tariffs, European leaders largely closed ranks, calling for unity but also a steady hand to not provoke further acrimony.

Just last week, Europe was cautiously optimistic.

Officials told reporters on Friday they weren't expecting a letter like the one sent Saturday and that a trade deal was to be inked in ""the coming days."" For months, the EU has broadcast that it has strong retaliatory measures ready if talks fail.

Reeling from successive rebukes from Washington, Šefčovič said Monday the EU is ""doubling down on efforts to open new markets"" and pointed to a new economic agreement with Indonesia as one.

The EU top brass will visit Beijing for a summit later this month while courting other Pacific nations like South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Singapore, the Philippines, and Indonesia, whose prime minister visited Brussels over the weekend to sign a new economic partnership with the EU. It also has mega-deals in the works with Mexico and a trading bloc of South American nations known as Mercosur.

While meeting with Indonesia's president on Sunday, Von der Leyen said that ""when economic uncertainty meets geopolitical volatility, partners like us must come closer together.""

Credo Beauty, a founding member of Pact, then used that resin, called NewMatter, to create recyclable pumps for its moisturizer bottles.
The making of the NewMatter pump “We used NewMatter resin for the pump because we wanted to show that beauty packaging can be made from beauty waste,” said Ross of Credo.
“This is a really high value source of plastic.” One pound of plastic waste stays out of landfills or oceans for every 38 pumps that Credo makes, according to Pact.
Next steps Beyond the pump, Pact also turned recycled high-density polyethylene into soap dishes with Terrazzo-like flecks in them.","Less than 10 percent of single-use plastic is recycled, most of it bottles and jugs. That rate is far lower — close to zero, in fact — for smaller bits and pieces of packaging such as bottle caps, straws and coffee pods.

In the cosmetics industry, for example, few of the 120 billion units of lotion pumps, mascara wands and other components made each year are recycled, according to the Pact Collective.

The San Francisco nonprofit has gathered 140 cosmetics makers and retailers — including Sephora, Ulta Beauty and L’Oréal — to attack small-format plastic waste. Pact maintains more than 3,300 bins for spent makeup jars, lids and applicators at North American stores including Nordstrom Rack and Saks Fifth Avenue.

To further its mission, the collective created something new from nearly 232 tons of detritus it has collected since 2022. Last year, as its collection volumes tripled, the organization transformed piles of plastics into a novel resin.

Credo Beauty, a founding member of Pact, then used that resin, called NewMatter, to create recyclable pumps for its moisturizer bottles. Those pumps usually blend several types of plastic with a metal coil, which prevents its recycling. Credo, however, used a single material — polypropylene — to make it easier to recycle later. Now that it has cracked this challenge, Pact seeks to encourage investors and infrastructure builders to support systems to collect, sort and recycle more small-format plastics.

“As the first beauty retailer to co-create a recycled resin from hard-to-recycle empties, we saw an opportunity to show circularity at work,” said Christina Ross, head of science and impact at Credo Beauty, a founding member of the Pact Collective. “This pump became a proof point and we can’t wait to see what brands do with the material next.”

Banding together

As international negotiations continue on a global plastics treaty, Pact isn’t the only corporate collaboration trying to keep packaging components out of landfills and incinerators. In February, the Consortium for Small Formats launched with backing from L’Oréal Groupe, Kraft Heinz and P&G. Individual brands’ efforts at circular packaging include refill programs from the likes of Kiehl’s and customer collection programs run by nonprofit Terracycle for Sephora and MAC.

Members of the U.S. Plastics Pact, meanwhile, have focused on sweeping benchmarks for reducing the proliferation of petroleum-based plastics, but their 2025 and 2030 deadlines are slipping out of reach.

“We are taking a different angle,” said Pact Collective Executive Director Carly Snider. “We’re collecting this material and then proving that it has value.” The initial heavy lift shows that certain cosmetics plastics can be integrated into municipal recycling systems, she added. “I’m hopeful that we can have this case study to show that this material has value, and therefore it’s worth the investment to your infrastructure for us to collect this material curbside.”

Pact’s June 26 impact report described how Credo’s custom pump, announced in September, fit into a busy year of scaling up recycling. Ninety-eight percent of the paper, glass and metal collected by Pact has been recycled. So has 70 percent of sorted, clean plastics.

Retail collection bins are core to Pact’s mission to grow as a household name for consumers, three-quarters of whom care about sustainable packaging, according to the nonprofit. Pact also collected 88,959 pounds of industrial waste of returns and expired or damaged goods last year.

The making of the NewMatter pump

“We used NewMatter resin for the pump because we wanted to show that beauty packaging can be made from beauty waste,” said Ross of Credo. “No one had ever made a high-functioning component from post-consumer beauty packaging before, so we knew the road wouldn’t be easy but also that it mattered.”

The journey to make the recycled pump started as Pact’s consumer-and-industrial packaging streams shipped to a plant in Lake Zurich, Illinois. After being sorted into 14 categories, the would-be trash was sent to mechanical recycling partners.

Next, the plastic recycler shredded and turned the waste into pellets.

The recycler required some 40,000 pounds of incoming material, which Pact’s collections alone did not reach. Therefore, Credo’s fully polypropylene pump blended 84 percent of material from Pact’s collection bins with 16 percent ocean-bound plastic gathered by hand in Malaysia. “It took a lot of work with them to figure out ways that we can get this material in there,” Snider said. “This is a really high value source of plastic.”

One pound of plastic waste stays out of landfills or oceans for every 38 pumps that Credo makes, according to Pact.

Next steps

Beyond the pump, Pact also turned recycled high-density polyethylene into soap dishes with Terrazzo-like flecks in them. “It’s really creating a way that customers can hold circularity in their hands,” Snider said. “It’s not this abstract thing.”

Credo is exploring where else it can use NewMatter resin, such as closures and other components that tend to be hard to recycle.

“Now that the infrastructure is set up to use take-backs on a more circular level, we need to continue to create a demand for post-consumer beauty-grade materials,” Ross said. That includes exploring how extended producer responsibility regulations cropping up in multiple states can help brands to advance innovative packaging, she added.

“You’re missing a huge piece of the puzzle here by just sending this to the landfill and not being able to sell it again,” Snider, of Pact, said.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/trellis_editorial_credo_beauty_1470x894.png,N,,2025-07-14 05:03:25.836721

According to the CEO, Rico Andersen, Ageras plans to continue expanding through further acquisitions to grow its presence in the European market.","Copenhagen-based Ageras, a software platform for accounting, administration, and banking for small businesses, has acquired Amsterdam’s Employes, a payroll software company.

This is Ageras’s second acquisition in 2025 and its eighth overall. The company has expanded its operations in several European markets, including through the 2024 acquisition of Shine from Société Générale. With the acquisition of Employes, Ageras adds payroll software to its services in the Netherlands.

Rico Andersen, CEO and co-founder of Ageras, completed the acquisition of Danish payment reconciliation software company Storebuddy in 2025.

With the latest acquisition, Andersen says, “Employes is a perfect match for Ageras as they too believe in putting business owners first, and building a product that radically simplifies their administration.”

“The acquisition doesn’t just make our Dutch offering much stronger, but also gives us a proven, scalable platform to do even more with payroll – ultimately changing the way small businesses pay their wages and take the pain out of payroll. No doubt, this is our most significant acquisition since Shine joined us last year.”

Payroll administration, simplified

Founded in 2018 by Rob Kroezen and Marius van den Oever, Employes provides a platform that allows businesses in the Netherlands to manage payroll independently within the country’s regulatory framework.

Currently, the company serves over 6,000 businesses and is used or recommended by more than 300 bookkeeping firms.

Co-founder Rob Kroezen, who will stay on the combined journey with Ageras, says, “We started Employes because we were frustrated with how difficult payroll management was for small business owners. Joining Ageras gives us the scale, reach, and resources to bring our product to even more entrepreneurs, and we’re therefore very excited for what’s ahead.”

Ageras has acquired Employes as part of its expansion. Employes’ teams in Amsterdam and Zwolle will now join Ageras’ workforce of approximately 450 people, a number that increased during 2024.

Ageras aims for more acquisitions

Founded in 2012 by Rico Andersen and Martin Hegelund, Ageras operates a software platform that serves over 400,000 small businesses across Europe. With more than 30 years of combined experience in building internet companies, the founders created Ageras to simplify administration for small businesses.

The platform integrates invoicing, accounting, payroll, banking, and financing into one system, enabling business owners to manage their operations more efficiently. Ageras is backed by investors including Investcorp, Coller Capital, Lazard, Rabo Frontier Ventures (Rabobank), and Folketrygdfondet.

In its 2024 annual results, Ageras reported an EBITDA of €8.7M and revenue of €55.5M, reflecting a 114 per cent increase. According to the CEO, Rico Andersen, Ageras plans to continue expanding through further acquisitions to grow its presence in the European market.

Andersen says, “Small businesses across Europe are increasingly looking for all-in-one platforms to run their businesses. Payroll is a crucial piece of that puzzle, however, it does not conclude our vision to empower businesses everywhere to spend less time on admin and more time on what matters. Therefore, we will still be scouting the market for the right opportunities to arise in Europe.”",https://siliconcanals.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Employes-co-founders-Marius-van-den-Oever-and-Rob-Kroezen-Image-credit-Employes.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 04:01:07.601062

“From a regional perspective, North America PC shipments declined 0.5% in the second quarter of 2025, compared to the same time last year,” said Padhi.
“The total PC market in APAC remained flat year-over-year, which is a slight improvement after consecutive quarters of decline.
Meanwhile, the EMEA PC market grew 5.3% year-over-year.
Lenovo saw the strongest growth in global PC shipments among the top five vendors at 13.9% year-over-year.","Worldwide PC shipments totaled more than 63 million units in the second quarter of 2025, a 4.4% increase from the second quarter of 2024, according to preliminary results by Gartner, Inc.

Expert Take:

“In the second quarter of 2025, enterprise demand outpaced consumer demand, underpinned by Windows 11 migrations and pandemic-era desktop renewals, while consumer refreshes slowed as buyers deferred purchases,” said Rishi Padhi, Research Principal at Gartner. “PC shipments are forecast to rise 2.4% in 2025, propelled by a tariff-driven front-loaded inventory surge in the first half of 2025 in the U.S., and ongoing Windows 11 replacement cycles in the rest of the world. In the second half of 2025, shipment growth is expected to plateau as vendors draw down stock in response to demand, potentially creating excess inventory by year-end.

“From a regional perspective, North America PC shipments declined 0.5% in the second quarter of 2025, compared to the same time last year,” said Padhi. “The total PC market in APAC remained flat year-over-year, which is a slight improvement after consecutive quarters of decline. Meanwhile, the EMEA PC market grew 5.3% year-over-year. This illustrates signs of a modest recovery and stronger-than-usual seasonal demand. The Windows 11 refresh cycle remains a key driver, particularly for desktop replacements. However, the expected surge in new device purchases has been subdued, as many organizations opt to update existing PCs to Windows 11 rather than invest in new hardware.”

There were no major changes in the top five vendor rankings worldwide in the second quarter of 2025 (see Table 1). Lenovo saw the strongest growth in global PC shipments among the top five vendors at 13.9% year-over-year.

The round includes £500m in new equity from shareholders, Infrastructure at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, Antin Infrastructure Partners, Mubadala Investment Company and Interogo Holding.

CityFibre has also agreed a committed £960m expansion of its existing debt facilities, supported by lenders including ABN AMRO, BBVA, Crédit Agricole CIB, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo IMI CIB, Lloyds, the National Wealth Fund, NatWest, SEB and Société Générale.

Rounding out the £2.3bn is a further £800m accordion facility to fund future acquisitions.

Greg Mesch, chief executive of CityFibre, said: ""This round of financing will supercharge CityFibre's next phase of growth as we consolidate the altnet sector, accelerate the pace of customer connections and unleash the full power of our market-leading 10Gb XGS-PON network for the benefit of all our partners, their customers and for the UK economy.

The tariffs could make everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals more expensive in the US. Trump has also imposed a 30% tariff on goods from Mexico, according to a post from his Truth Social account.

Meanwhile the EU’s retaliatory tariffs on US exports have been delayed again, reports the BBC. The countermeasures, which were due to start on Tuesday, came in response to US President Donald Trump’s initial import taxes on steel and aluminium. The EU’s retaliation, which would have hit € 21bn worth of US goods, was first suspended in March. This break has been extended until early August, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a press conference on Sunday.

Morrisons has told ‘idling’ shop floor staff they will no longer be allowed access to stockrooms as the supermarket races to boost customer service ratings, the Telegraph reports. The supermarket has written to staff saying that new restrictions will mandate which of them are allowed in backrooms, to ensure it had “the right colleagues in the right place to deliver the best service to customers at all times”. Only authorised managers and staff will be allowed to enter stores’ warehouse areas from August.

The Bank of England is ready to make larger cuts to interest rates if the jobs market shows signs of a pronounced slowdown, The Times reports. The governor of the bank, Andrew Bailey, told the newspaper there was “consistent” evidence of businesses “adjusting employment” after Rachel Reeves increased employers’ national insurance contributions (NICs). He said Britain’s economy was growing behind its potential, opening up “slack” that would help to bring down ­inflation, which is expected to rise above 3.4% when official figures for June are published this week.

Louis Vuitton has said the data of some UK customers has been stolen, as it became the latest retailer targeted by cyberattackers, reports The Guardian. The retailer said an unauthorised third party had accessed its UK operation’s systems and obtained information such as names, contact details and purchase history. The brand, which last week said its Korean operation had suffered a similar cyber-attack, told customers that no financial data such as bank details had been compromised.

The company behind brands including McVitie’s biscuits and Jacob’s crackers is to pump millions of pounds into its UK operations in an effort to “supercharge” growth, according to The Times. Pladis has revealed it will plough £68 million into its British business, with the bulk to be spent on its manufacturing sites in the northwest, including Stockport, Carlisle and Aintree. Pladis, which owns United Biscuits, said the cash would be used to increase capacity, capability and productivity by modernising infrastructure in its factories and launching more automated production lines.

Kraft Heinz, the US food group, is preparing to break itself up, spinning off a large part of its groceries business into a new entity that could be valued at as much as $20 billion, according to The Times. The remaining company would focus on its faster-growing sauces and condiments brands including Heinz Tomato Ketchup and the Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon.

The decision comes after the company in May said it was considering several options to reverse its persistent underperformance, reports the Financial Times. One of the plans being considered includes spinning off much of its traditional grocery portfolio.

Talks to rescue Britain’s biggest bioethanol plant are on a knife-edge after the government offered only a partial bailout focusing on the production of carbon dioxide used in fizzy drinks and to preserve food, The Times reports. Vivergo, which is owned by FTSE 100 company Associated British Foods (ABF), is set to close in two months unless a taxpayer rescue can be agreed.

More small businesses expect to downsize or shut up shop than grow over the next 12 months, reports The Times, citing a survey by one of the UK’s most influential trade bodies. Of those surveyed, 27% of owners expect their businesses to either close, shrink or be sold in the coming year, according to the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). Only 25 per cent believed their businesses would expand.

Britain’s heatwave is ‘burning the economy’, says a piece in The Telegraph, which begins by focusing on Rob Davies’ dairy and arable farm in Herefordshire. “Grass is a very important crop for us, and our grass yields currently are down by about 50pc,” says Davies. “Maize is also looking to be around 50% down.” His struggles are only one example of the many ways hotter temperatures are affecting Britain’s economy, with visits to shops down 1.8% last month.

Shareholders in the owner of Boots have voted overwhelmingly in favour of being taken over by an American private equity firm, creating uncertainty over the future of the high street pharmacy chain, according to The Times. About 96% of votes cast by shareholders approved the takeover of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) by Sycamore Partners in a $10 billion deal, a fraction of the $100 billion the US pharmacy chain was worth a decade ago.

A fried chicken war broke out in the UK after two American restaurant chains hired private detectives and lawyers to fight over Britain’s fast food future, according to the Telegraph. Legal papers seen by the newspaper reveal a bizarre battle in which lawyers grappled with the popularity of “Southern comfort food” and even asked whether “James Bond could become obsessed with Nashville hot chicken”. The dispute was triggered by a “cult” American fast food chain’s recent expansion into the UK to meet the nation’s growing appetite for fatty foods.

The boss of the pub chain Greene King has called for changes to business rates to remedy “unfairness” that he said added to financial pressures on the struggling pubs industry, according to The Guardian. Nick Mackenzie, Greene King’s chief executive, said the business rates system of property taxes should be changed to a tax on profits. The trade body the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) said last week it expected pub closures at a rate of more than one a day during 2025.

Pubs are struggling to turn a profit despite the sunny weather as Labour drags its heels on tax reform, reports the Daily Mail. Drinkers are flocking to beer gardens for a pint but industry leaders say business rates mean takings are being drained away – despite pledges by Labour to change the system. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has piled on further pain with a rise in employer national insurance contributions that took effect in April.

Manufacturing output across all UK regions is back above pre-pandemic levels for the first time. The Times cites a report published on Monday from the manufacturing lobby group Make UK and accountants BDO which underlines the bounce-back from Covid, when grounded airlines, a lack of demand and supply chain disruption brought some factories.

The boss of coffee giant Lavazza has said hedge funds are to blame for pushing up the price of a morning brew, according to the Daily Mail. Giuseppe Lavazza said speculation by the big financial firms was responsible for the vast majority of the surge in prices on wholesale coffee bean markets. He said: ‘Hedge funds are really big players and they make a lot of difference, especially in the volatility of the market and the uncertainty of the market.’

The Bank of England will monitor the use of cash payments amid fears that vulnerable groups risk being excluded, the Telegraph reports. Threadneedle Street officials are set to intervene after MPs warned more checks were needed to ensure people can still pay with cash in public places, such as coffee shops, leisure centres and on public transport. There are currently no legal requirements in the UK for businesses or organisations to accept cash.

Wimbledon has experimented with creating a mocktail in the style of Pimm’s, in response to growing demand for alcohol-free options at the championships, according to The Guardian.

One option on the table for the group is a separation of the groceries part of its portfolio, containing the ready meals and processes cheese products, from the more lucrative sauces and condiments operation, including the Heinz brand.

The potential move comes a decade after Warren Buffett and 3G Capital merged Heinz and Kraft, and it follows an announcement in May that the group was considering a number of options to turn around its performance.

Executives at Kraft Heinz expect splitting the group up will create two companies worth more than the current group market value of $31bn, according to reports in The Wall Street Journal, which first covered the story.

A split could be finalised within the coming weeks but the board has yet to make a final decision, according to people involved in the discussions. There is a still a possibility assets will be sold off instead, with the group remaining as one entity.

“As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value,” the company told The Financial Times. “Beyond that, we do not comment on rumours or speculation.”

Kraft Heinz’s history as a combined group has been rocky since the 2015 mega-merger, with a hostile $143bn takeover attempt fought off by Unilever in 2017.

India is believed to have doubled crude liftings, partly as a signal to US policymakers amid trade pressures.","New data from S&P Global Commodity Insights cited quoted by Indian media outlets, India has sharply increased its crude oil imports from the United States and Brazil in the first half of 2025.

US crude shipments to India rose 51% year-on-year to 271,000 barrels per day between January and June, up from 180,000 bpd a year earlier, while imports from Brazil surged 80% to 73,000 bpd, compared to 41,000 bpd during the same period in 2024. These were the highest growth rates across India’s import portfolio, underscoring a decisive pivot toward Western Hemisphere barrels.

The increase follows multiple converging developments. India’s state-run refiners have sought to insulate procurement from OPEC+ volatility and disruptions in the Middle East. Reduced Chinese liftings of US crude opened spot-market opportunities, while freight rates from the Atlantic Basin fell, improving arbitrage economics.

Diplomatic engagement also played a role. Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri met with Brazilian energy officials earlier this year, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Washington visit in April included energy cooperation as a key agenda item.

Russia retained its top position with 1.67 million bpd in H1 2025, though growth plateaued. Iraqi and Saudi volumes declined marginally, while Nigerian shipments rose 26% to 158,000 bpd.

India is believed to have doubled crude liftings, partly as a signal to US policymakers amid trade pressures. Broader tariff negotiations are still underway.

Gerard Dwyer, National Secretary of the SDA, said the nationwide application is the ""logical next step"" after the success of the SA case.
Willox warned that the application to cover all McDonald's restaurants will impact hundreds of franchisees who are separate employers.
""Bargaining across such a broad range of businesses will undoubtedly be very complex and costly if authorised by the Fair Work Commission,"" he said.","The Shop, Distributive, and Allied Employees Association (SDA) has lodged an application to extend the bargaining orders to McDonald's franchisees nationwide after a landmark win in South Australia.

Gerard Dwyer, National Secretary of the SDA, said the nationwide application is the ""logical next step"" after the success of the SA case.

""That ruling by the Fair Work Commission confirmed what was always obvious: that McDonald's stores, whether franchisees or corporate – share common interests and that workers should be able to bargain together,"" Dwyer said in a statement.

Dwyer added that it is clear that workers should be able to bargain for improved wages and conditions.

""In short, these young, low-paid workers – many in their first jobs – should be able to say: 'I'll have bargaining with that,'"" he stated.

'Sadly inevitable escalation'

The Australian Industry Group (Ai Group) said the union's win in SA ""emboldened"" it to bargain for a multi-employer agreement across all McDonald's restaurants nationwide.

""The SDA application represents a dramatic and sadly inevitable escalation of the Government's multi-bargaining laws across the economy, well beyond what the Government suggested would occur when it pushed through the laws in late 2022,"" said Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox in a statement.

Willox warned that the application to cover all McDonald's restaurants will impact hundreds of franchisees who are separate employers.

According to Willox, the development could expose other employers across the fast-food, retail, hospitality, and numerous other sectors to the risk of being drawn into multi-employer bargaining.

""Bargaining across such a broad range of businesses will undoubtedly be very complex and costly if authorised by the Fair Work Commission,"" he said.

""Australian Industry Group urges the Federal Government to introduce urgent amendments to the Fair Work Act to tighten up the scope of the supported bargaining stream, and to address the unintended consequences reflected in the FWC's decision.""

""The company has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to realize shareholder value,"" a Kraft Heinz spokesperson said. Kraft Heinz has a market capitalization of about 32 billion dollars (about 44 trillion won). The new corporation is expected to be recognized for its corporate value of up to $20 billion.

Kraft Heinz has suffered a recent underperformance. Sales have fallen for the past two consecutive fiscal years, and operating margin, a measure of profitability, has also fallen. In April, it cut its full-year sales and profit forecasts, citing worsening consumer sentiment.

Kraft Heinz has been hit by inflationary pressures and changes in consumption looking for fresher, less processed foods, Reuters noted. ""It's similar to Kellogg's shedding of its cereal business, which had been on the decline for a while in 2023,"" said Conor Ratigan, an analyst at Consumer Edge.

Kellogg spun off its snack business as a separate corporation in 2023, split into two companies: cereal maker WK Kellogg and snack maker Kellanova. WK Kellogg recently agreed to sell the company to Italian chocolate maker Ferrero. Regarding Ferrero's acquisition of WK Kellogg, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) said, ""Consumers' eating habits are changing due to rising food prices and the trend of pursuing health,"" adding, ""Companies have to adapt.""",https://wimg.mk.co.kr/news/cms/202507/14/news-p.v1.20250714.054a69fbfb754105bf1275d7ad4ec5b7_P1.jpeg,N,,2025-07-14 05:03:46.516814

The new ""Strato"" from Starbucks aims to stand out with a layer of cold foam with flavors, according to The Street.
For many consumers, Starbucks becomes the easiest and most reliable option.
With its new Strato Frappuccinos already in stores, Starbucks seeks to attract its most loyal audience again.
The brand is betting on strengthening its leadership in the competitive market for cold and sweet drinks in the United States.","In many cities across the United States, it's easy to notice the dominance of large chains. Small family businesses have closed or have been absorbed by giants. The pandemic accelerated this process and completely changed the commercial landscape up to the present day.

Now, Starbucks announces a move to further consolidate its position. The coffee chain is launching a special line of drinks for the summer, following the strategy of its competitors. On July 8, three new Frappuccinos arrived with a layer of flavored cold foam called ""Strato,"" available only for a limited time.

Starbucks bets on strengthening its presence

The company isn't unfamiliar with the tough competition in the sector. Although it has more than 200 locations just in Manhattan, where millions of tourists and workers pass through each year, it can't rest on its laurels. Starbucks has seen how brands like Chick-fil-A and Wendy's take advantage of the summer to attract customers with sweet and eye-catching new products.

Chick-fil-A, for example, has bet on peach drinks for the season. Wendy's isn't far behind and has launched the new Frosty Swirls with sweet syrups. Faced with this competition, Starbucks is strengthening its offerings to keep its image as the reliable and approachable brand that its customers know.

The new ""Strato"" from Starbucks aims to stand out with a layer of cold foam with flavors, according to The Street. Consumers will be able to choose between Salted Caramel Mocha, Strawberry Matcha, or Brown Sugar. The idea is to replace the classic whipped cream and give an innovative twist to the popular Frappuccinos.

An efficient business model

The success of Starbucks is based on convenience and customer trust. In its locations, consumers know what to expect. Its massive expansion strategy may seem costly or redundant, but it proves effective by ensuring a presence in almost every part of the city.

If one location is full, it's likely to find another just a few blocks away. This model ensures capturing the extra demand that would arise in other smaller coffee shops. For many consumers, Starbucks becomes the easiest and most reliable option.

However, the chain has had to face certain challenges after the pandemic. The return of customers to offices caused unexpected demand. At the same time, there were issues with staff turnover. To solve this, Starbucks has invested in its Siren system, which speeds up the preparation of complicated drinks, although these changes take time to implement.

With its new Strato Frappuccinos already in stores, Starbucks seeks to attract its most loyal audience again. It also wants to win over those looking for something different for the summer.

The facility will support their “continued network investment and enable it to rapidly connect hundreds of thousands of new customers“.
CityFibre’s strategy around this thus remains somewhat unproven, and any new funding deal they strike now will be subject to less favourable conditions than they had before (e.g.
Put another way, this may not be the last funding deal they’ll need, which means that some of the same underlying funding challenges could still resurface again in the future.","Digital infrastructure builder CityFibre has today announced that they’ve reached a crucial UK funding agreement worth £2.3bn (mix of debt and equity). The deal will support the ongoing deployment of their new 10Gbps capable Fibre-to-the-Premises (FTTP) broadband network and also drive a new wave of consolidation.

Just to recap. CityFibre has already deployed their full fibre network to cover around 4.5 million premises (inc. 550k customers) and they’ve long aspired to reach up to 8 million UK premises – representing c.30% of the UK. But their original target of hitting that by the end of 2025 will be missed, and they’ve also been facing some of the same pressures as many other networks (e.g. high interest rates, rising build costs and competition).

NOTE: CityFibre is owned by Antin Infrastructure Partners, Goldman Sachs, Mubadala Investment Company, Interogo Holding etc. The network is supported by UK ISPs such as Vodafone, TalkTalk, Zen Internet, Sky Broadband and more, but they aren’t all live or available in every location yet.

In response, the operator has already made some redundancies and shifted their strategy, which sees them focus less on new network builds and more on growth via mergers and acquisitions (M&A), as reflected by the deals to acquire Connexin (here) and Lit Fibre (here). Not to mention putting more effort into commercialisation in order to encourage take-up by consumers, which is where the recent deal with Sky Broadband may help (here).

According to industry analyst James Ratzer – in 2025 and beyond, it’s expected that CityFibre will likely only build FTTP out to c.300k homes per annum organically, largely to meet their state aid backed Project Gigabit contracts. But the operator still aspires to add around 1 million premises each year, which suggests c.700,000 will be coming from the acquisition of other networks; something they’ve been very vocal about (here).

However, the operator’s existing funding had nearly run out, and they needed more in order to deliver on both their existing network expansion and their new consolidation strategy. Suffice to say that today’s agreement is aimed at tackling both of those issues.

What’s in the funding deal

The new financing includes £500m in new equity secured from CityFibre shareholders – Infrastructure at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, Antin Infrastructure Partners, Mubadala Investment Company and Interogo Holding.

On top of that, CityFibre has also agreed a committed £960m expansion of its existing debt facilities, supported by lenders including ABN AMRO, BBVA, Crédit Agricole CIB, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo IMI CIB, Lloyds, the National Wealth Fund, NatWest, SEB and Société Générale. The facility will support their “continued network investment and enable it to rapidly connect hundreds of thousands of new customers“.

Finally, an accordion facility of £800m is also being made available to help drive CityFibre’s continued expansion through the acquisition of full fibre network assets. “This facility will be used to finance the company’s M&A pipeline and cement its position as the sector consolidator,” confirmed the announcement. This is a feature of loan agreements that allows them to increase, as required, the total amount of debt available under an existing facility.

Greg Mesch, CEO of CityFibre, said:

“This round of financing will supercharge CityFibre’s next phase of growth, as we consolidate the altnet sector, accelerate the pace of customer connections and unleash the full power of our market-leading 10Gb XGS-PON network, for the benefit of all our partners, their customers and for the UK economy.

There is huge opportunity ahead for CityFibre and it is testament to the success of the company that we have such strong backing from our lenders and shareholders. This multi-billion-pound investment into critical digital infrastructure will deliver significant benefits across the UK, helping to realise potential and unlocking economic growth.”

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said:

“Today’s announcement shows Britain is attracting billions of pounds of investment, including through the National Wealth Fund, driving growth across British businesses.

Investing in our digital infrastructure is key to ensuring our economy is fit for the future. Through our Plan for Change we’re growing the economy by boosting investment in Britain and working hand in hand with businesses to create jobs, to put more money in working people’s pockets.”

The risk in all this is that consolidating alternative networks tends to be a slow, complex and costly process – particularly with many altnets still holding an inflated idea of their own asset values. CityFibre’s strategy around this thus remains somewhat unproven, and any new funding deal they strike now will be subject to less favourable conditions than they had before (e.g. interest payments will be higher).

Put another way, this may not be the last funding deal they’ll need, which means that some of the same underlying funding challenges could still resurface again in the future. The operator also faces other challenges, such as from the recent instability at one of their largest ISP partners, TalkTalk, which currently accounts for c.150k customers via CityFibre and is struggling in ways that could risk wider harm in the future (here).",https://www.ispreview.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/nggallery_import/CityFibre-2025-van-on-suburban-road.webp,N,,2025-07-14 04:01:15.687816

Beyond a mere pivot from brick-and-mortar to online, this represents a wholesale rewiring of consumer behavior, supply chains, retail models, and global trade dynamics.

The world's biggest consumer market and its largest manufacturer aren't just linked - they're fused in a complex, interdependent relationship.","Illustration: Chen Xia/GT

The dust has settled on the 2025 Summer Black Friday, and the numbers are staggering: In just four days, US online spending hit $24.1 billion. Retailers recorded online sales growth of 30.3 percent. Reuters reported that 53.2 percent of orders came from mobile devices, with discounts averaging over 20 percent.

What's clear is this: America's consumer market is in the throes of a seismic shift. The e-commerce surge isn't just a symptom - it's the engine driving this transformation.

Beyond a mere pivot from brick-and-mortar to online, this represents a wholesale rewiring of consumer behavior, supply chains, retail models, and global trade dynamics. And at the heart of it? An ever-deepening connection with Chinese manufacturing.

Dig into the data, and ""Made in China"" emerges as the backbone of this boom. On Amazon, 70 percent of goods are Chinese-made. Walmart clocks in at 60 percent, while Target and Best Buy hover around 30 percent and 30-35 percent, respectively. From electronics to apparel to kitchen gadgets, the low-cost, high-quality output of Chinese factories is the linchpin of US retail giants' supply chains.

This isn't just about numbers - it's about an intricate web of interdependence. Despite corporate buzzwords like ""diversification,"" the reality is stark: China's role on critical product categories is unshakable. High-value, high-volume SKUs - think consumer electronics, clothing, and small appliances - are built on China's unmatched cost efficiency and production flexibility. Alternatives like US or Mexican manufacturing can't match the scale, speed, or price.

The consumer side tells the same story. America's trillion-dollar retail market, supercharged by post-pandemic online adoption, leans heavily on China's ability to churn out goods at breakneck speed to meet the demands of high-stakes sales events. Without China's manufacturing capability, retailers would buckle under the pressure of surging orders, competitive pricing, and tight logistics.

The US faces a stark choice: double down on a lose-lose trade war or preserve a mutually beneficial partnership, thereby advancing the transformation of American consumption. The time for decision is now, and the consequences of inaction could be dire.

If Trump-era tariffs make a comeback, the fallout will be brutal. First, inflation - already a sore spot - will spike, hammering a consumer market mid-transformation and dragging down the broader economy. Second, supply chains will fracture. Retailers have dabbled in sourcing from third countries, but the data doesn't lie: New products and restocks still hinge on Chinese factories, ports, and logistics networks. Shifting to other countries or domestic production isn't a quick fix - it's a three-to-five-year slog, at minimum. Third, as observers noted, tariffs will erode industry revenue and choke investment.

July's e-commerce explosion underscores a simple truth: The US and China are locked in a symbiotic dance. The world's biggest consumer market and its largest manufacturer aren't just linked - they're fused in a complex, interdependent relationship. Tariffs won't ""decouple"" this dynamic - they'll just unleash chaos in the short term and significant losses in the long term. The potential economic fallout is not to be underestimated.

History has shown that tariff wars are reckless, unpopular, and unsustainable. China's position is clear and firm: We do not want a trade war, but we are not afraid of one. Rational negotiation and a commitment to mutual gain are the only path forward. Washington should continue its efforts to translate the high-level agreement into concrete policies that sustain this e-commerce miracle. The importance of these negotiations and the achievement of win-win outcomes through them cannot be overemphasized.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2025/2025-07-13/c77d6e6c-7c83-4ca4-b1a8-621dae54e1d3.jpeg,N,,2025-07-14 07:08:52.813710

Why business transformation is crucial In Lin-Baden’s view, creative business transformation has never been more essential.
“From the shortlist of Creative Business Transformation Lions contenders, there were only a few works that used AI,” she observed.","PARTNER CONTENT

As Jury President for the Creative Business Transformation Lions category at this year’s Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, Jane Lin-Baden, CEO Asia Pacific of Publicis Groupe, had a front-row seat to some of the world’s most compelling work. Leading a globally diverse jury of strategists, clients, and business and creative leaders, Lin-Baden oversaw entries that went far beyond traditional advertising to demonstrate how creativity is now central to how businesses operate, adapt, and grow.

“The Creative Business Transformation Lions category recognises the powerful impact of creativity on our clients' businesses,” Lin-Baden explained. “We looked for brilliant creative ideas that are core to business operations, where transformation not only delivers proven results but also shows the potential to scale in future.”

Creativity at the Core of Change

Under her leadership, the jury identified three overarching themes that characterised this year’s strongest entries.

The first was the evolution of purpose. While some brands still use purpose as an add-on to raise awareness for a cause, the most impressive work showcased purpose embedded into the operations of a company, driving both commercial and social value in a sustained way.

Second, there was a clear migration from ads to ecosystems. Lin-Baden noted that today’s most transformative creative ideas are no longer confined to marketing. “They impact everything from commercial models to supply chains, legal contracts, suppliers, patents, and stakeholders,” she said. “In other words, the entire ecosystem that supports products and services.”

Third, truly transformative brands are leading category reinvention. The most impactful ideas didn’t just help brands grow; they fundamentally redefined the playing field. By changing the rules, these brands reshaped entire categories and claimed leadership in doing so.

The work that particularly stood out from this year’s awards was the Grand Prix-winning campaign by AXA: ""Three Words"". The campaign added just three words to a home insurance policy, broadening the definition of household protection to include fire, flood, and even domestic violence. “By redefining the category, AXA now owns ‘household insurance’ , creating business and societal value,” said Lin-Baden.

But what truly impressed the jury was the campaign’s scale. The change was retroactively applied to 2.5 million existing contracts, involving legal, commercial, and operational shifts across AXA’s business. “It is a complete system overhaul that sets the benchmark for organisational change,” Lin-Baden said, noting the campaign’s direct contribution to sales growth and brand impact.

Another strong entry, Heineken’s “Backing the Bars”, demonstrated ecosystem-level thinking. The campaign supported bar owners and distributors - the stakeholders most essential to Heineken’s business. “The Jury appreciated the longevity of Heineken's support for its beer ecosystem,” said Lin-Baden. “Building bars is building Heineken.”

Suncorp’s “Building a More Resilient Australia” also left an indelible mark. Rooted in the brand’s purpose of helping customers prevent household damage from extreme weather, the campaign went beyond insurance to deliver real utility and resilience tools. “It brings value back to the business through increased market share, consideration uplifts, and customer lifetime value,” she noted. The jury was particularly impressed by the brand’s five-year commitment to these resilience initiatives.

While all Cannes Lions categories celebrate creativity, the Creative Business Transformation Lions category requires a higher bar: evidence of enduring business impact.

“Our jury asked whether we should reward proven results, or future potential or both,” Lin-Baden said. “The brands that achieve both deserve higher recognition.”

She also noted that not all longstanding brand platforms made the cut. “We saw some textbook examples that had long-term impact but hadn’t evolved with today’s social and political climate,” she explained. One successful example of evolution came from Cheetos, whose long-running “It’s a Cheetos Thing” platform continues to stay fresh and funny, embracing creativity and humour to remain culturally relevant.

Why business transformation is crucial

In Lin-Baden’s view, creative business transformation has never been more essential. “Agencies are playing a pivotal role in helping brands reshape how their business operates, engage customers and deliver business value,” she said. The days of one-off campaigns are fading. “The most impactful agencies are mobilising entire business ecosystems that are affecting everything from supply chains and legal contracts to company culture and stakeholders.”

She believes this shift reflects broader economic and social realities. “This year’s Cannes winners showed the expanding role of creativity in navigating change and solving business problems in a time of uncertainty.”

At Publicis Groupe, this belief in transformation is not theoretical, it is backed by significant investment. “We’ve invested hundreds of millions of euros into a suite of AI applications and agents, built specifically for marketing intelligence and transformation,” Lin-Baden shared.

At the heart of this ecosystem is CoreAI, a proprietary system that unifies Publicis’ consumer and business data. CoreAI allows trillions of data points to be shared across the Groupe and integrated directly into clients’ own business environments. “It brings our creative solutions even closer to their business outcomes,” she said.

Cultivating a culture of change

“Winning requires bravery,” says Lin-Baden. “I believe there is a creative solution for every universal problem we face today.”

For brands and agencies still hesitant to embrace transformation, her message is direct: “Staying still is no longer an option.”

She believes success comes to those willing to experiment on the road to meaningful change. “Clients are seeking insights, intelligence and creativity to make informed decisions in an increasingly shifting landscape. Agencies must innovate and commit to their clients' success.”

Publicis has continuously innovated though its Power of One model - a unified structure that removes silos across disciplines. “Media and creative capabilities are integrated with data and tech, social, CRM, influence, commerce and performance,” she said. This connected culture ensures a seamless, cross-functional approach to solving complex client problems.

She also highlighted the company’s investment in high-growth areas like influencer marketing, commerce, and social media. “These accelerators allow our teams to leverage data to drive transformation,” she explained.

But above all, Lin-Baden points to people as the true engine of transformation. “When we create a connected ecosystem for our people, they’re equipped with the mindset to grow all aspects of our clients' business.”

Looking ahead: creativity in an AI-induced world

As the industry embraces AI and automation, Lin-Baden is clear-eyed about its role: a powerful enabler and not a replacement.

“From the shortlist of Creative Business Transformation Lions contenders, there were only a few works that used AI,” she observed. “But we saw that AI can change how we evolve from ideas to implementation. The right AI prompt is a form of creativity in itself.”

She believes the ability to ask the right questions is becoming one of the most critical skills in marketing. “AI can enhance solutions with deeper analysis, but it cannot replace the creativity and collaboration between clients and agencies.”

As brands navigate a world of increasing complexity, creativity is no longer a ‘nice to have’, instead, it is the engine that powers business reinvention. This year’s Cannes Lions entries show that the most enduring brands are those that turn creativity from a message into a mechanism, one that rewires their systems, empowers their people, and engages their ecosystems. For Lin-Baden, this isn’t just the future of advertising. It’s the future of business.",https://cdn.i.haymarketmedia.asia/?n=campaign-asia%2fcontent%2fIMG_Opt1.JPG&h=630&w=1200&q=75&v=20250320&c=1,N,,2025-07-14 03:01:37.532979

Most are said to be seeking a controlling stake in the coffee giant’s second-largest market, intensifying scrutiny over the future of Starbucks’ premium playbook in China.

While the Seattle-based chain has denied rumours of a full exit, it has confirmed it’s evaluating strategic options to Campaign Asia-Pacific.

“We see significant long-term potential in China and are evaluating the best ways to capture the future growth opportunities. We are looking for a strategic partner with like-minded values who shares our vision to provide a premium coffeehouse experience,” a spokesperson told Campaign Asia-Pacific. “We remain committed to China and want to retain a meaningful stake in the business. Any deal must make sense for Starbucks' business and partners.”

According to Chinese business outlet The 21st Century Business Herald, Starbucks may retain around 30% of its China unit, with the remainder potentially split among several investors to ensure that no single buyer holds a dominant share. The business is reportedly valued at around US$10 billion, according to a report in CNBC, with nearly 30 private equity firms expressing interest.

Centurium Capital’s name in the mix has raised eyebrows. The private equity firm, which now chairs Luckin Coffee under founder and CEO David Li, is reportedly among those submitting bids for the Starbucks China stake. If successful, it could mark an extraordinary twist in China’s coffee wars, where a backer of Starbucks’ fiercest competitor gains influence over the legacy brand’s local playbook.

Starbucks' struggles to keep pace with fast-growing, budget-friendly local competitors like Luckin are not new. After four consecutive quarters of sales decline in China, the Seattle-based coffee major saw flat growth in its latest quarter, prompting price cuts, menu localisation, and marketing refreshes, including tie-ins with pop culture brands. But the discounting move, a rare deviation from Starbucks’ premium playbook, sparked backlash on Chinese social media, with netizens criticising the cuts as too shallow to make an impact. The lowest-priced item on the menu now sits at RMB 23 yuan (US$3.20), still higher than most rivals.

Starbucks APAC CMO Samuel Fung stepped down earlier this year in February after a 12-year tenure with the coffee giant. Following this, China CMO Erin Silvoy left the region for a position in Seattle in April.

Starbucks entered China in 1999 and has since expanded to 7,685 stores in the market, according to its Q1 FY2025 results. Globally, the chain operates 40,576 outlets.

But its largest local rival, Luckin Coffee, is outpacing the American brand at breakneck speed. As of Q1, Luckin reported 24,032 stores across China and 65 globally, including new outlets in Singapore, Malaysia and most recently the US, where it opened two stores in New York City this July. The company’s high-volume, low-price strategy has proven effective in luring younger, value-conscious Chinese consumers.

While the deal process is still in early stages, shortlisted bidders are expected to gain access to internal financials as Starbucks weighs its next move. For now, the company insists any transaction must align with its long-term vision and values.",https://cdn.i.haymarketmedia.asia/?n=campaign-asia%2fcontent%2f20250714043707_Untitled+design+(13).jpg&h=630&w=1200&q=75&v=20250320&c=1,N,,2025-07-14 03:02:00.800584

“A further loss of confidence was observed among Chinese firms at the end of the first half of 2025.
“Overall, growth is still expected in the year ahead among Chinese firms as supportive policies and investment into new product launches are forecasted to drive sales.","Chinese firms grew less optimistic regarding future output in June. This was as expectations around profitability deteriorated for the first time since last June, according to S&P Global. Firms expect to raise charges only modestly amid rising competition while managing their costs, including via further reductions in headcounts. That said, R&D spending was projected to continue rising to support sales, albeit at a reduced pace.

The net balance of Chinese firms that expect business activity to expand over the next year fell from 17 per cent in February to 11 per cent in June. This marked the lowest degree of confidence since June 2024 and was among the lowest on record. Additionally, optimism in China was below the global average of 24 per cent and the weakest of the BRICS nations, S&P Global said in its latest China Business Outlook survey.

Chinese business confidence weakened in June 2025, with the net balance for future output falling to 11 per cent—its lowest since June 2024. Firms expect modest price hikes amid rising competition and cost control through staff cuts. Profit outlook turned negative, and capex and R&D projections hit record lows. Despite challenges, growth is still expected, supported by government policies.

Business confidence among Chinese companies has weakened in June 2025, with both manufacturing and services sectors reporting a broad-based easing in positive sentiment. The manufacturing sector posted a net balance of 7 per cent, while services stood at 15 per cent, signalling moderation in expectations for future activity.

Key concerns include global trade policy uncertainty and a subdued economic environment, which companies believe will generate weak demand in the year ahead. Firms also cited intense market competition and rising input costs as major headwinds to growth. Despite this, businesses expect government support and improved financial conditions to aid performance, along with enhanced R&D efforts and a potential recovery in domestic demand.

Employment outlook has deteriorated significantly, with the net balance falling from −1 per cent in February to −3 per cent in June—marking the lowest level since February 2020. Both manufacturers (−3 per cent) and service providers (+3 per cent) expect staff reductions, indicating the first broad-based job shedding forecast in over five years.

Capital expenditure and R&D projections have also hit record lows. The net balance for anticipated capex fell to +2 per cent from +7 per cent in February, the lowest since comparable data began in October 2009. R&D intentions dropped to +5 per cent, the weakest since tracking started in February 2019, added the survey.

Cost pressures, however, are forecast to ease. Input and output prices are still expected to rise, but at slower rates. The net balance of firms expecting higher staffing costs stood at +5 per cent—its lowest since records began in 2019—while non-staff cost expectations fell to a nine-year low of +5 per cent. Selling price expectations have softened considerably, with only a net balance of +1 per cent planning price hikes, the lowest since February 2024.

Profit outlook has turned negative. With limited room to raise selling prices, the net balance for profitability dropped to −1 per cent in June from 5 per cent in February, the weakest reading since June 2024 and well below the global average of 8 per cent.

“A further loss of confidence was observed among Chinese firms at the end of the first half of 2025. Optimism regarding future output slipped to the lowest level since last June, with sentiment among manufacturers at a more subdued level compared to their services counterparts,” said Jingyi Pan, economics associate director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

“Despite expectations for slower cost increases, including via the management of salary outlays by reducing headcounts, Chinese businesses turned pessimistic regarding profitability in the year ahead. This reflected the challenges that companies anticipate regarding global trade and the ensuing impact on demand,” added Pan. “Overall, growth is still expected in the year ahead among Chinese firms as supportive policies and investment into new product launches are forecasted to drive sales. Even as firms planned to lower staffing levels, capital expenditure and R&D spending are reportedly set to continue growing, the latter at a rate that that remains above the global average.”

Stone is the third location in Staffordshire to have its own banking hub and the 178th in the country.

The former Betfred site now offers face-to-face staffing to customers of NatWest, Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC and Santander.

“I think it’s absolutely brilliant,” beamed Barclays customer Elizabeth Evans.

“We haven’t had a branch in Stone for quite a long time now, so we usually have to go to Stafford.

""This is just so nice in the high street, wonderful. I was given a seat because there was a queue to see the Barclays representative and even offered water and it was wonderful.""

The last branch of a high street bank in Stone closed in 2024.

The canal town has had a temporary banking facility at the Frank Jordan Centre for the past twelve months but numerous customers said they were delighted with the new location.

Julie Johnson was there to bank money collected by the Parent Teacher Association at a local school.

“We thought we had nothing and now we’ve got somewhere where we can do everything,” she said.

“People want to see face-to-face interactions and still people want to see bankers from the different banks,” said banking hub operator Vik Puri.

He said it took a year to get the hub ready to open.

“Connected identity is kind of the two-word phrase that we use both internally at Publicis and Epsilon, but also externally with our clients,” Ng said.
“It’s the identity and knowing when and where and how to address the consumer at the right place.” Predictive AI, not just generative AI While much of the marketing world focuses on flashy generative AI tools, Epsilon’s strength lies in predictive AI capabilities.
“We’re not really in the generative AI space, but we are in the predictive AI space,” Ng said.

Speaking with Jon Watts, managing director of the Coalition for Innovation in Media Measurement, at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, Ng described how identity, data, and AI are reshaping modern marketing.

“Something that Epsilon has done pretty well over the past five-plus years is really our truth set, our identity set from a U.S. perspective,” Ng said. “The reason why Lotame was so critical for us was it was our ability to bring our version of identity to the rest of the world.”

Epsilon recently acquired Lotame, a global data solutions provider, to accelerate its ability to unify identity data across markets like EMEA, APAC and Latin America.

“It’s not just a one-size-fits-all,” Ng said. “We make sure that we kind of evaluate the data set. That was part of the due diligence, part of the M&A process evaluating how identity is done by various companies, not just Lotame.”

Power of connected identity

For Epsilon, identity is the common thread that connects paid, owned, and earned marketing, and it is central to Publicis Groupe’s broader growth strategy.

“Connected identity is kind of the two-word phrase that we use both internally at Publicis and Epsilon, but also externally with our clients,” Ng said. “It’s really the thread that you pull between all forms of marketing.”

Ng explained that understanding consumers at the individual level enables brands to engage more effectively, whether through search, programmatic display, loyalty programs, or email campaigns.

“It’s really how do you know that individual horizontally as well,” he said.

Measurement, Ng emphasized, is what sets Epsilon apart.

“For us, having that measurability at that individual level, we do think differentiates us,” he said. “We do talk about the front and the back end as well.”

One view, one vision, one voice

Epsilon’s approach centers on providing marketers with a holistic understanding of their customers and orchestrating relevant messaging across channels.

“If you’re a financial services client, you might know a very, very deep depth of what your customers spend within that sector,” Ng explained. “But you may not know all the time demographic, zip code. You also may not know what CPG items you’re buying at the supermarket.”

That broader perspective, Ng said, is critical for delivering personalized marketing based on real consumer behavior and life stage. As an example, he shared his own experience shopping for a new television.

“The minute I buy the TV, I’m not looking to buy another TV right away. My wife would kill me,” Ng said. “But I might look at loyalty, I might look at a speaker system, I might look at a warranty.”

For Ng, true marketing harmony comes when brands stitch together the customer view, their purchase journey and real-time media activation.

“Stitching that all together is really where the magic happens,” he said. “It’s the identity and knowing when and where and how to address the consumer at the right place.”

Predictive AI, not just generative AI

While much of the marketing world focuses on flashy generative AI tools, Epsilon’s strength lies in predictive AI capabilities.

“We’re not really in the generative AI space, but we are in the predictive AI space,” Ng said. “It’s really around how do you find and predict the right individual, again around identity, and the right message, and the right context of when to find that person.”

Within Publicis Groupe, generative AI may play a role in creative development, but Ng emphasized that Epsilon complements that by applying predictive AI to improve targeting and message delivery.

“We marry that up on the predictive piece to then serve that and deliver that,” he said.

AI as democratizing force

Ng argued that AI has the potential to empower small and medium-sized businesses, not just large enterprises.

“I’m a big fan of how it democratizes it,” he said, pointing to AI’s role in making identity solutions more accessible. “It’s still first-party data that they own and they operate. How do you then utilize AI? It’s really the ideas that make the most difference.”

He predicted a shift in industry dynamics where creativity becomes an even greater differentiator.

“In the next 10 years, 20 years with AI, the ideas people might actually rise because AI is helping us build things faster,” Ng said. “We may, for the first time in the industry, have a shortage of ideas, not engineers.”

Retail media and the future of the market

Looking ahead to 2030, Ng expects retail media and commerce media to continue their rapid ascent, helping marketers diversify beyond dominant walled gardens.

“It’s almost what’s old is new, just like 90s fashion,” Ng said. “Audience, media identity, data monetization, these are things that happened in the 2000s, 2010s, 2020s went out of vogue, they’re now back in vogue with a different moniker.”

Retail media, Ng believes, represents an opportunity to democratize access to high-quality data and advertising solutions.

“I do hope that retail media kind of democratizes even the ability for more people to kind of fragment or shift budgets away, where it’s not so concentrated to some of the few walled gardens,” he said.

Ng closed the discussion with practical advice for marketers navigating complex technology ecosystems.

“There’s so much Frankensteining, there’s so much identity definition that’s different,” he said, warning against fragmented tech stacks that hinder interoperability. “The future next five years is interoperability of any partner that marketer would look at, because that’s how you actually measure the efficacy better.”

Otherwise, Ng cautioned, marketers risk getting lost in a sea of disconnected data points.

“There’s no unification there,” he said.",https://www.beet.tv/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/98069-thumbnail-2-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 04:00:58.031195

The bills would require third-party companies like Instacart and Shipt pay food delivery workers a minimum wage of $21.44 an hour or higher. That's the same rate restaurant delivery workers for apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash are currently paid.

The legislative package also includes making sure delivery workers get paid within seven days of the pay period ending, making sure customers have an opportunity to tip at least 10% before placing the order, and requiring companies pay workers when they log on, even if they aren't making deliveries.

Reactions mixed to grocery delivery worker bills

An Instacart delivery worker named Tommy M. said the bills are a start.

""It's still not enough, but I mean, it gives us hope,"" he said. ""It will be a pay increase, but it's not outrageous.""

Some shoppers outside a Key Food in Park Slope are in support of the bills.

""I think one of the things that's holding everything down is inequality, and so I would be all for it. I would be all for raising the minimum wage,"" shopper David Reed said.

Others worry increasing the minimum wage will increase grocery prices.

""I know it's going to. It's doing it already. Oh, definitely,"" shopper Susan Levy said.

Food delivery companies slam bills

Instacart and Shipt are both opposed to the bill.

An Instacart spokesperson said in a statement:

""It's simply unconscionable that the City Council is considering a bill that would jeopardize a lifeline thousands of New Yorkers rely on — particularly those facing health, mobility, or transportation challenges. The city's own data shows that this bill could drive grocery delivery costs up by a staggering 46%, cut off access to work for thousands of NYC delivery workers, and increase fees on local grocers.""

A spokesperson for Shipt said in a statement:

""We urge the Council to reconsider these bills before moving forward. These bills were developed without input from grocery delivery workers about their desire for flexibility and without acknowledgment of their distinct experiences working with platforms like Shipt. Passing these bills as drafted could lead to unintended consequences that hurt both the very workers they aim to protect and families that depend on grocery delivery.""

This can be seen from the performance in the first quarter of 2025, where the TPT industrial sector recorded positive growth of 4.64 percent.
Currently, the TPT sector absorbs more than 3.76 million workers or about 19.18 percent of the total workforce in the national manufacturing sector.

The company plans to build a textile factory and textile product (TPT) on an area of 8 hectares and is projected to absorb up to 8,000 workers.

The Ministry of Industry (Kemenperin) assesses that the investment in the TPT sector is a strategic step that will strengthen competitiveness in the midst of uncertain global economic conditions.

Moreover, the TPT industry is one of the priority sectors in the roadmap for national industrial development. This sector is also the key to spurring Indonesia's economic growth. This can be seen from the performance in the first quarter of 2025, where the TPT industrial sector recorded positive growth of 4.64 percent.

Meanwhile, from the export side, for the period January to April 2025, the TPT industry recorded a value of 3.38 billion US dollars, an increase of 3.57 percent compared to the same period the previous year.

Currently, the TPT sector absorbs more than 3.76 million workers or about 19.18 percent of the total workforce in the national manufacturing sector.

""The production plan is scheduled to start in July 2026. It is hoped that it will make a major contribution to job creation, increase local economic activity and support industrial transformation towards sustainability,"" said Faisol.

""Moreover, this factory is designed to use solar panels and wastewater treatment according to industry green standards,"" he added.

Meanwhile, Director of PT Xinhai Knitting Indonesia Huang Lu Yu said, choosing Indonesia as an investment location because he saw the great potential offered.

""As a global textile and clothing investor, our group has a large-scale sales clothing production base in Nantong, China, and Yangon, Myanmar, and has long provided high-quality services for international brands, such as H&M, our business partners,"" he said.",https://imgsrv2.voi.id/W-PcrjOMYTkyxEn8N2V8OBef8edzW5brWalXUZxL8H4/rs:fill/w:800/h:450/g:sm/wm:1:nowe:0:0:1/bG9jYWw6Ly8vcHVibGlzaGVycy80OTQ5MDEvMjAyNTA3MTQxMDIwLW1haW4uY3JvcHBlZF8xNzUyNDYzMjM1LmpwZWc.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 03:01:17.989501

According to the city’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, there are an estimated 60,000 restaurant delivery workers in the city.
Dr James Parrott, a senior fellow at the Centre for New York City Affairs at the New School, who consulted with the city on the delivery workers’ pay, said there needed to be more improvement in minimum pay standards.
Council member Sandy Nurse, a Democrat who sponsored the grocery delivery workers Bill, said she had watched delivery companies evolve over the years at the expense of the workers.
The suit was settled in 2025 after the City Council made adjustments to the law that created some exceptions to the cap.","– The New York City Council is expected to pass a package of Bills on July 14 expanding legislation that improved working conditions for food delivery workers to include nearly 20,000 grocery delivery workers.

A ground-breaking package of Bills passed in 2021 had set a minimum pay and addressed difficult working conditions for app-based food delivery workers, but only for those who delivered food from restaurants through apps such as Grubhub, DoorDash and Uber Eats. The minimum rate was fully implemented from April 1, 2025.

The new legislation will require third-party app companies such as Instacart and Shipt to pay grocery delivery workers a minimum of US$21.44 (S$27.46) an hour to match the increase the food delivery workers received in April.

The Bills, five in total, will also mandate that the companies provide an option in their apps to give at least a 10 per cent tip, before or at the same time an order is placed, and that the companies must pay workers within seven days of the end of a pay period.

The delivery industry, which boomed during the Covid-19 pandemic, has continued to grow in New York City, with more than 100 million deliveries arranged through third-party apps. According to the city’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, there are an estimated 60,000 restaurant delivery workers in the city.

“It’s a huge milestone to make app delivery work more dignified, better paid and safer in our streets,” said Ms Ligia Guallpa, a co-founder of the Worker’s Justice Project, a worker centre that organises low-wage, immigrant workers.

Her group organises Los Deliveristas Unidos, an advocacy group for delivery workers.

Dr James Parrott, a senior fellow at the Centre for New York City Affairs at the New School, who consulted with the city on the delivery workers’ pay, said there needed to be more improvement in minimum pay standards.

But, he added, “we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that these pay standards for delivery workers in New York City are the best pay standards that exist in the United States”.

Mr Juan Felipe, 30, a grocery delivery worker, said he had cut back working for Instacart because he was making only about US$2 to US$7 an hour, and he did not plan on rushing back any time soon even if the legislation was passed.

“If we get that rate, that would be amazing,” he said. “But we’ll have to see what it’s going to be like.”

Mr Felipe said he often parks outside big-box retail store Costco in Queens, one of dozens of gig workers waiting for possible jobs to appear in their apps.

Council member Sandy Nurse, a Democrat who sponsored the grocery delivery workers Bill, said she had watched delivery companies evolve over the years at the expense of the workers.

“The apps are creating an environment that is unregulated, that doesn’t have a lot of worker protections,” Ms Nurse said. “Because a lot of these workers are immigrant workers, there’s just a lot of opportunity for exploitation.”

On July 12, Grubhub said in a statement that it was working with advocacy groups and the City Council “to make sure New York’s delivery workforce is protected without sacrificing the flexibility customers expect”.

Instacart said in a statement: “At a time when millions across the city are already struggling with rising costs for food and daily essentials, we urge the City Council to consider the real-world consequences this Bill could have on the families and communities that depend on grocery delivery the most.”

Uber and DoorDash did not reply to a request for comment.

In 2023, Grubhub, along with DoorDash and Uber Eats, filed requests for a temporary restraining order just days before an initial increase of the minimum wage for food delivery workers, to US$17.96 per hour, was to take effect. The requests contended that regulators used inaccurate data to calculate compensation.

A judge ruled against the three food delivery companies, allowing the city to raise the workers’ minimum wage to nearly US$18, and increase it further to US$20 or more in 2025.

The three companies had also filed a lawsuit in 2021, arguing that the city’s 15 per cent cap on fees charged to restaurants for online orders and 5 per cent cap for other fees was unconstitutional and prevented them from negotiating their own prices with restaurants.

The suit was settled in 2025 after the City Council made adjustments to the law that created some exceptions to the cap.

Although legislation would signify a victory for delivery workers, Council member Shaun Abreu, a Democrat and a sponsor of three Bills in the new package, said he had noticed forms of “retaliation” from third-party apps, like randomly deactivating workers’ accounts and removing the tipping option at checkout.

Mr Abreu said he planned to introduce legislation to prohibit the abrupt deactivation of delivery workers’ accounts by major third-party apps.

Mr William Medina, 37, who delivers for Uber Eats and is a member of Los Deliveristas Unidos, said he was very concerned about the “thousands” of delivery workers whose accounts had recently been deactivated.

“This is a very critical issue,” Mr Medina said. “We just need somebody, a real person who can mediate between the company and the worker on the deactivation process.” NYTIMES",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/554c2a35204da37279e95df54491658a20f554b21226cfe769924874d5514430,N,,2025-07-14 00:58:38.749266

Louisville saw its first Publix store open in 2024, and already, that store is drawing shoppers from 15 of Kroger’s 25 Louisville locations, based on the firm’s shopper data.","Meanwhile, other grocers have announced growth plans on a national scale. Aldi plans to open 225 stores this year, a record for the chain, as part of a five-year strategy. Sprouts has plans for at least 35 new stores this year. Walmart opened its first new Neighborhood Market grocery store in three years in 2024 and its first Supercenter in four years in 2025.

All of this is putting further pressure on Kroger, the largest traditional supermarket operator in the U.S. by revenue — not including Walmart or Costco — according to Deloitte. The company currently lacks the direction of permanent leadership after its longtime CEO Rodney McMullen resigned in March after an investigation of personal conduct. The company is also working to cut costs, closing 60 underperforming stores, after spending more than $1 billion on its failed pursuit of competitor Albertsons. A Kroger spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

Additionally, these retailers also beat Kroger in revenue growth, according to the NRF and Kantar’s annual list of the top 100 U.S. retailers by sales. Aldi grew 14% from 2023 to 2024, Sprouts grew 13%, H-E-B grew 7%, and Publix grew 5%, while Kroger grew 2%, per the report.

Erich Kahner, director of strategy and insights in the Americas for Dunnhumby, told Modern Retail that, because of improvements in the consumer and economic environment since the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, grocers now may be more willing to make longer-term bets on expanding their private labels, growing their store count or making acquisitions.

“Compared to the last five years, the past 12 months have been relatively unique in the sense that customers haven’t faced a ton of disruption in their monthly budgets, unemployment has been pretty steady, interest rates have been creeping back down and inflation has been relatively normal,” Kahner said.

‘A key battleground’ for Kroger

A Dunnhumby study measuring both customer perception and financial data found H-E-B to be the No. 1 grocery store in the U.S. in 2024, the fourth time within eight years. Kroger ranked No. 17.

“Given the strength of H-E-B in Texas, I think that’s a key battleground for Kroger that represents the challenge they face in a lot of their frontier markets,” being markets outside of its home region of the Midwest, Kahner said.

He added that the further away grocers get from their home markets, the share of customer grocery budgets they are able to capture erodes. The average Kroger customer in Cincinnati gives about 50% of their grocery budget to Kroger, according to Kahner, based on his firm’s data (which is based on the consumer perception study as well as Placer.ai foot traffic data from cell phones), and in Dallas, it’s 30% of their grocery budget. In Louisville, Publix gets about 20% of the average shopper’s grocery budget, but 40% in Orlando.

Kroger has been in Texas since the ’50s, but Kahner believes its market share is at risk, given H-E-B’s strong perception throughout Texas.

“Each Kroger location only has one or two H-E-Bs [in the Dallas area] to go up against, but we would expect H-E-B to continue to densify in Dallas until that number is more like four or five locations that each Kroger is going up against,” he said.

Kroger versus Publix

On the Publix front, Kahner pointed to Louisville as a model of what could happen in Cincinnati. Louisville saw its first Publix store open in 2024, and already, that store is drawing shoppers from 15 of Kroger’s 25 Louisville locations, based on the firm’s shopper data. “That Publix is definitely a threat to Kroger – just that single Publix alone.”

Dunnhumby found Kroger’s strength lies in its loyalty and personalization capabilities digitally, while H-E-B has the upper hand on private brand quality and its local community connection and, Publix wins on assortment and store experience. Kroger has still improved over the past four or five years, Kahner said.

“Kroger has actually been on an upward journey in the strength of its overall brand equity with customers,” Kahner said. “They haven’t always been in our top quartile; they’ve snuck in the top quartile the last couple of years.”

Ross Cloyd, grocery analyst for Kantar, said he has personally seen changes in Kroger’s merchandising, assortment and store experience from market to market, based on which competitors are nearby. He said he noticed in Georgia that Kroger would have signs in its stores detailing at which local farms and farmers the produce came from, similar to messaging created by Publix. Additionally, in Texas he noticed “Texas proud” signage and dedicated local sections that would remind him of H-E-B — neither of which he would see in his home state of Indiana.",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/07/20231024_HEBManvelVIPOpen033.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 06:06:09.807671

A Capgemini Research Institute report, Future encrypted: Why post-quantum cryptography tops the new cybersecurity agenda, highlights that rapid progress of quantum computing threatens to render current encryption algorithms obsolete. ‘Harvest-now, decrypt-later’³ attacks, together with tightening regulations and the evolving technology landscape, have elevated the importance of quantum safety.

However, despite increasing awareness within the industry, many organizations still underestimate the risks surrounding quantum computing, which could lead to future data breaches and regulatory penalties.

According to the report, around two-thirds (65%) of organizations are concerned about the rise of ‘harvest-now, decrypt-later’ attacks. One in six early adopters believe that ‘Q-day’ will be within five years, while around six in ten believe it will arrive within a decade.

Marco Pereira, Global Head of Cybersecurity, Cloud Infrastructure Services at Capgemini, said, “Quantum readiness isn’t about predicting a date–it’s about managing irreversible risk. Every encrypted asset today could become tomorrow’s breach if organizations delay adopting post-quantum protections. Transitioning early ensures business continuity, regulatory alignment, and long-term trust.

“Quantum safety is not a discretionary spend but a strategic investment, which can turn a looming risk into a competitive advantage. The organizations that recognize this fact early will best insulate themselves against future cyber-attacks,” Pereira said.

While current quantum computers cannot break widely used encryption yet, high-risk industries such as defense and banking are leading the adoption of quantum-safe solutions. In contrast, consumer-focused sectors like consumer products and retail sectors are showing less urgency.

Post-quantum cryptography migration preferred over other quantum-security solutions

Most organizations surveyed (70%) are protecting their systems against emerging quantum threats by adopting the appropriate mix of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms.

They view PQC as the best option to address near-term quantum security risks because it provides a comprehensive approach to securing data. Nearly half of early adopters are already exploring, assessing feasibility, or piloting PQC solutions. For 70% of organizations, regulatory mandates are a key driver behind the shift to PQC.

While the early adopters are working towards quantum safety, a few organizations (30%) are still ignoring the quantum threat. They are struggling to allocate sufficient budget and personnel to cryptographic transition.

Report Methodology: The Capgemini Research Institute conducted a survey of 1,000 organizations with annual revenue of at least $1 billion across 13 sectors and 13 countries in Asia–Pacific, Europe, and North America. The global survey was carried out in April–May 2025. Around 70% of the sample in this report are referred to as ‘early adopters’. This segment is either working on or planning to work on quantum-safe solutions in the next five years. The survey findings were supplemented through in-depth interviews with sixteen industry executives.

[1] “Early adopters,” who make up 70% of our survey respondents, are organizations that are either currently working on or planning to implement quantum-safe solutions within the next five years.

[2] ‘Q-Day’ is the hypothetical future date when quantum computers will become powerful enough to break the crypto-graphic algorithms that currently secure most of the world’s digital data and communications.

Toni Belloni: The group has six Italian houses ( , , Pucci, Loro Piana, and Cova cafés, editor's note). It has 280 boutiques and 66 production workshops, employing more than 18,000 people in the country, while employing nearly 100,000 others through its network of more than 4,000 suppliers and subcontractors. The Italian ecosystem offers a particularly favorable context for the development of luxury brands.

FNW: LVMH invested heavily in Italy last year. Will it continue to do so?

TB: In 2024, we invested around 500 million euros in Italy, as a large number of projects came to fruition over the same period. Previously, we were investing more like 100 million euros, so I don't think we'll be deploying that kind of money again. But it does testify to the fact that the Group is continuing to commit to new, and even major, investments.

FNW: What are LVMH's current projects in Italy?

TB: For 2026, a new workshop dedicated to accessories will be built ex novo in Pontassieve, Tuscany. There's also Loro Piana's major project at Ghemme, in the cashmere district near Novara in Piedmont, which will set up an industrial complex around a historic building, bringing together under one roof its various workshops currently scattered around the valley, as well as other activities.

FNW: In view of the economic situation, have you reviewed certain investments?

TB: Investment projects are medium-term, and cannot be stopped or restarted from one day to the next. At the very least, we can delay the opening of a store for a few months, or postpone certain investments for the long term, but I think that the strategic commitment is to invest. First of all, on the store front. This year, we plan to open at least five of the six major stores I mentioned in Milan. But also in the supply chain, which I think still needs to be strengthened culturally in terms of training, but also from an infrastructure point of view.

FNW: Have any of the planned investments been postponed?

TB: Our strategic horizon, whether in the retail or industrial sectors, is three to five years. So we have to realize that we're betting on a market that will continue to grow in the medium to long term, while we're more cautious about the next six or even nine months. Clearly, we're not in a glorious market phase.

""Consistent with the above comments of the Review Panel, now that the FWC has issued its decision in the SDA v McDonald's case, the scope of the supported bargaining laws needs to be reconsidered.
""We always warned from the time leading up to the September 2022 Jobs and Skills Summit that the implementation of radical changes to bargaining laws would be a 'slow burn'.
""The bargaining claim comes on the back of a separate SDA proposal to curtail the capacity of retail and fast food businesses to engage junior employees on discounted rates.
""Employers in the fast food industry, such as McDonald's, are proud to offer thousands of young workers their first employment opportunity but they aren't a magic pudding that can accommodate dramatic cost increases.","""The Fair Work Commission's recent controversial decision to issue a supported bargaining authorisation requiring McDonald's franchisees in South Australia to enter into multi-party bargaining arrangements has undoubtedly emboldened the SDA to bargain for a multi-employer agreement across all McDonald's restaurants,"" said Innes Willox, Chief Executive of the national employer association Australian Industry Group.

""The SDA application represents a dramatic and sadly inevitable escalation of the Government's multi-bargaining laws across the economy, well beyond what the Government suggested would occur when it pushed through the laws in late 2022. Employer warnings at the time of economy-wide implications of the laws on jobs, costs, business confidence and investment are now unfortunately coming to pass.

""An application seeking to cover all McDonald's restaurants will impact hundreds of franchisees who are separate employers. Bargaining across such a broad range of businesses will undoubtedly be very complex and costly if authorised by the Fair Work Commission.

""As we have previously warned, there is now a clear risk that thousands of employers in the fast food, retail, hospitality and many other sectors, will be dragged into multi-employer bargaining by unions against their will and without the support of the majority of their employees. This includes many small businesses that are struggling to survive in the current difficult trading environment.

""The union-friendly supported bargaining stream was intended to operate in sectors where the employers and employees need a lot of support to bargain, typically because of the Government-funded nature of those sectors.

""There is a real risk that this stream now operates as an unfair mechanism for unions to seek to evade safeguards in the existing bargaining stream that generally require unions to demonstrate that a workforce wants them to bargain with their employers before a business can be forced into bargaining with them.

""Many hundreds of enterprise agreements have been made in the fast food industry and there is no reason why the main enterprise bargaining laws should not apply, including the requirement for a union to establish that the majority of employees support the negotiation of an enterprise agreement.

""In the context of McDonald's there are also real questions about whether the SDA actually represents many employees working in the chain of restaurants, let alone whether the majority of workers who will be impacted by the union bargaining claims support their application.

""Australian Industry Group urges the Federal Government to introduce urgent amendments to the Fair Work Act to tighten up the scope of the supported bargaining stream, and to address the unintended consequences reflected in the FWC's decision.

""The recent Draft Report of the Review Panel that considered whether the bargaining laws were operating as intended, contains the following relevant comments:

'The Review Panel acknowledges that the ongoing matter in relation to McDonald's franchises in South Australia may, in future, require further consideration about the intended scope of the supported bargaining stream. However, until such time as the FWC has considered the evidence in that matter, it is premature to consider further changes.'

""Consistent with the above comments of the Review Panel, now that the FWC has issued its decision in the SDA v McDonald's case, the scope of the supported bargaining laws needs to be reconsidered.

""We always warned from the time leading up to the September 2022 Jobs and Skills Summit that the implementation of radical changes to bargaining laws would be a 'slow burn'. The implications and risk of the amendments are now clearly being demonstrated.

""The bargaining claim comes on the back of a separate SDA proposal to curtail the capacity of retail and fast food businesses to engage junior employees on discounted rates.

""Ultimately, there is a very real risk that unsustainable unions claims, pushed by the SDA through either bargaining or their award case, will undermine the viability of employers in the fast food industry continuing their model of offering employment opportunities to young workers.

""Employers in the fast food industry, such as McDonald's, are proud to offer thousands of young workers their first employment opportunity but they aren't a magic pudding that can accommodate dramatic cost increases. They operate in a highly competitive and cost-sensitive environment.

""Expert evidence advanced in the Award case by Australian Industry Group shows that the SDA's wage claim in the proceedings will cause thousands of young workers to lose their jobs. Efforts to achieve the same increases through bargaining would have similar impacts.

""The SDA seems determined to attack employment opportunities for young people in the fast food and retail sectors, despite there being few other sectors that offer a pathway into employment for these workers. It is a sad day when it is obvious that union claims will potentially deny employment opportunities to thousands of young Australians wanting to get their foot on the job ladder,"" Mr Willox said.",https://www.aigroup.com.au/globalassets/images/aigroup-og-standard.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 02:03:31.760078

Hybrid work could potentially improve productivity, reduce employee turnover, and lower business costs like real estate for as much as 55% according to a survey by the International Workplace Group (IWG) and global engineering consultancy Arup.

Citing a US-modelled survey, the study revealed that hybrid working could generate $282b in Gross Value Added (GVA) annually by 2030 and $729b by 2045, through increased productivity, reduced turnover, lower replacement costs, and portfolio savings.

Productivity could also improve by 11% driven by lower commutes, with employees benefiting from increased focus time and fewer distractions, ultimately spending up to 40% of time saved from travelling on additional work. In fact, the rate of employees reporting their productivity levels as ‘excellent’ in flexible workspaces is 67% higher than those working from home.

The report estimates that this could unlock $54.4b in annual GVA within five years, rising to $140.3b by 2045.

In a previous IWG study, 77% of Gen Z workers in Singapore reported higher job satisfaction under a hybrid model, with 34% saying their work-life balance improved.

IWG estimates that employees working closer to home can save up to $39,400 annually by avoiding daily commutes. Businesses that shift to local hubs or coworking memberships can cut real estate costs by up to 55%.

Dr Issac Lim, Social Scientist and Founder of Anthro Insights, said that Singapore is particularly progressive when it comes to hybrid work transformation.

Singaporean consumers are looking beyond transactional perks and demanding emotionally rich, experience-driven engagement from brands, according to the newly released Collinson 2025 Asia-Pacific Consumer Happiness Report.

81% of Singaporeans rely on brands for rewards and benefits to access unique or exclusive experiences.

This trend is particularly strong amongst younger demographics in APAC, with 89% of Millennials and 86% of Gen Z preferring experiential benefits over transactional ones.

Despite this appetite for deeper brand engagement, satisfaction levels with current offerings are only moderate. Sixty-five percent of Singaporeans say they’re happy with brand rewards, higher than the APAC average of 53%, and above markets like Japan (36%) and Australia (54%), but still below top performers like Indonesia (86%) and India (80%).

The report also highlighted emotional value is increasingly becoming the new standard for consumer happiness, with 60% of APAC respondents saying they prioritise rewards that strengthen their relationships with family and friends, as opposed to self-focused or material perks.

Why Cindy Rose?
All the information about Cindy Rose can actually be summarized in one sentence - she is a new leader with rich ""transformation"" and ""technology"" backgrounds.
In 2023, after Cindy Rose took office as the chief operating officer, she began to further promote the organizational structure reform of Microsoft.
This is why we say that Cindy Rose is a new leader with rich ""transformation"" and ""technology"" backgrounds.","On Thursday this week, British advertising giant WPP announced that it will appoint board member Cindy Rose as the new Chief Executive Officer. According to the relevant announcement, the new CEO will officially take office on September 1st, which means that Mark Read, the current CEO of WPP, will leave his position four months earlier than originally planned.

Notably, one day before the announcement, WPP released an unscheduled financial report update, significantly lowering its full - year performance forecast, which caused the stock price to plummet by 18.09% in a single day, the largest single - day decline since 2020. This is likely to make people have some associations - Mark Read is most likely to be held accountable for WPP's declining performance.

After all, 2025 can almost be said to be a year when WPP's performance suffered an unprecedented setback. First, in March this year, WPP lost Coca - Cola's North American media business. Subsequently, Paramount also announced the end of its 20 - year partnership with WPP. In June this year, Mars, the fast - moving consumer goods giant, also chose to transfer its $1.7 billion advertising business covering more than 70 different markets around the world to Publicis Groupe.

This means that in just one year, WPP has lost several long - term giant clients. This is obviously not a good sign. After all, most brands do not change their agents frequently, which means that WPP may not be able to regain these lost orders for at least the next 3 - 5 years.

In addition to the lost clients, the competitive pressure WPP faces is also increasing. Even if we don't mention the digital advertising sector that has been continuously squeezed by various Internet companies, in the traditional agency field, with the completion of the merger of Omnicom and IPG, WPP will obviously face more challenges in the second half of the year.

At this time, the only good news may be that with WPP's announcement of a leadership change, WPP's stock price immediately rebounded in the short term, rising 3.58% to $30.39 in pre - market trading. This relatively positive signal seems to indicate that the market views this appointment as a relatively positive sign. Of course, from a pessimistic perspective, it may also be that the market believes that WPP's current dilemma has reached its limit, and as long as there is a change, it may be a good thing.

So, who exactly is WPP's new CEO? Why does WPP's board of directors believe that Cindy Rose will be the key leader to pull WPP out of the mire?

Why Cindy Rose?

All the information about Cindy Rose can actually be summarized in one sentence - she is a new leader with rich ""transformation"" and ""technology"" backgrounds.

In fact, looking at Cindy Rose's entire work experience, we will find that her career path is very different from that of the current CEOs of other 4A groups. Whether it is Arthur Sadoun, the CEO of Publicis Groupe, or John Wren, the CEO of Omnicom Group, they almost all worked in advertising companies before joining their respective groups. Hiroshi Igarashi, the current CEO of Dentsu, has been working at Dentsu since graduation and took over as CEO in 2017.

In contrast, Cindy Rose's work experience is almost entirely cross - industry. After joining Disney in 1995, she spent 15 years working her way up to the senior vice - president of the Interactive Media Group in the EMEA region (a combination of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa). In 2010, she joined Virgin Media in the UK and promoted the innovative model of bundling broadband and TV services. Then in 2014, she joined Vodafone, an old rival of Virgin and one of the world's largest mobile communication companies, to be responsible for the transformation of its mobile communication business. In 2016, she joined Microsoft as the president of Western Europe and the CEO of the UK, and in 2023, she became the chief operating officer of its global enterprise business, leading the digital transformation strategy in the European market.

If we analyze further, we will find that whether it is Disney, Vodafone, or Microsoft, these companies seem to be ""digital industrial companies"" in their respective fields. Disney can be said to be the first traditional film and television company to accept and try the streaming media business. Vodafone has the world's most complete enterprise information management system and customer service system. In fact, many people believe that this is the key for Vodafone to maintain its strong competitiveness.

Microsoft is even more of Cindy Rose's career peak. If we organize the relevant information, we will find that from 2020 to 2023, in just three years, Cindy Rose promoted the implementation of the ""cloud - first"" strategy in 17 Western European countries at the strategic level, increasing the market share of Azure cloud services in this region by 8 percentage points in three years. She also established Microsoft's first industrial AI R & D center in Munich.

In 2023, after Cindy Rose took office as the chief operating officer, she began to further promote the organizational structure reform of Microsoft. On the one hand, she designed a new operating model called ""Customer Success Units"", restructured the global enterprise customer service team into 12 industry vertical units, and promoted the in - depth integration of the sales and technology teams, shortening the solution delivery cycle by 30%. She also participated in optimizing the product roadmap of Azure Stack HCI and designing the architecture of the multi - cloud management solution.

As Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said when evaluating her - ""Cindy Rose successfully brought Microsoft's global enterprise business into a new AI - driven stage.""

This is why we say that Cindy Rose is a new leader with rich ""transformation"" and ""technology"" backgrounds. So, is this new CEO really suitable for WPP at present? Or why has she become the ""savior"" in the eyes of WPP's board of directors, and why are they so eager to have her become the new captain of WPP, this advertising giant?

Is WPP in a Mess?

Obviously, WPP's current dilemma is exactly the type that Cindy Rose is good at. But to explain this in detail, we need to go back to an earlier time.

In 2018, Martin Sorrell, the founder of WPP, left the advertising empire he built. Mark Read became the second captain of WPP. However, the advertising group he faced at that time was not an aggressive and united one. On the contrary, due to Sorrell's radical merger and expansion strategy in his era, WPP at that time was a huge organization formed through capital integration and mergers, with more than 400 agencies covering multiple marketing fields such as advertising creativity, media placement, public relations, and market research, in different regions and sub - fields.

This made the recognition of the group brand even lower than that of its well - known agencies in many cases. A current executive of WPP once told the American financial media ""Business Insider"": ""WPP has long been regarded as an investment tool aimed at acquiring agencies and rewarding shareholders. To put it bluntly, it has a rather 'dispersed and chaotic' atmosphere.""

Of course, in Sorrell's era, this chaos did not really affect the company's performance. After all, at that time, the clients were also in a state of disunity. Different clients in different industries and fields had almost completely different ideas, which meant that for WPP at that time, even if it could integrate different agencies into a perfect whole, it was still difficult to form effective synergy.

However, with the increasing popularity of digital marketing, especially the rapid maturity of discriminative AI, data - driven digital marketing has gradually become the most important channel in the marketing industry. At this stage, as Internet companies began to build their own walled gardens through data, WPP's traditional decentralized model made it difficult for the group to fully integrate the data and technical capabilities of different agencies. Not to mention the low efficiency in communication and collaboration caused by this traditional decentralized structure.

As the global CMO of Procter & Gamble, the world's largest advertiser, once complained at the American Advertisers Conference:

""Too much management, high rent, and indirect costs of many advertising groups make advertisers feel overwhelmed. The business of agencies has become more complex, with layers of account managers to convey information, resulting in advertising companies no longer focusing on creativity, and spending too much time on phone conferences, off - site activities, business trips, and PPT presentations.""

And this was exactly when Mark Read officially took the helm of WPP in 2018. Perhaps Sorrell realized that he could no longer drive WPP, the world's largest advertising group at that time, into deeper waters with old methods in the new era, so Read became the new captain.

From today's perspective, the strategic approach Read formulated at that time did conform to the direction of market evolution. On the one hand, he promoted in - depth integration within the company, proposing ""One Company, Not a Group"", and merged many well - known agencies except Ogilvy to some extent. He even sold the equity of some agencies and non - core businesses.

In 2025, he restructured the media agency brand GroupM into a unified entity called ""WPP Media"", laid off up to 40% - 45% of the staff, and brought media subsidiaries such as Mindshare and Wavemaker under unified management. At the same time, he began to acquire a large number of technology companies and made heavy investments in the AI field, investing nearly £300 million per day. He built a self - developed intelligent marketing operating system called WPP Open, which integrates the full - link capabilities of creative production, media placement, and data analysis and embeds generative AI tools.

As for the final effect, opinions vary. Many current and former employees of WPP have complained about Read's decision to discontinue many well - known creative brands. For example, in November 2018, Wunderman and JWT (J. Walter Thompson) merged, and the JWT brand became history.

A former employee of Ogilvy told Morketing: ""This move is as ridiculous as deleting Lincoln from American history.""

However, there are also positive aspects. As the most heavily invested intelligent marketing operating system in WPP's history, by March 2025, WPP Open could cover 48,000 employees (60% of the customer service team), generate 130,000 personalized advertisements for Cadbury's Indian market, reach 94 million people, and reduce costs by 90%.

However, Read still failed to solve the old problems of organizational bloating and cumbersome processes caused by WPP's years of mergers. But the era has once again reached a new crossroads. The era of artificial intelligence is just around the corner, and the confrontation between technology giants and advertising groups has reached a critical moment. As a person with rich experience in technology giants and corporate transformation, Cindy Rose, just like Mark Read when he took over the helm from Martin Sorrell in 2018, has become the new helmsman of this huge ship.

And the problems WPP is facing now are exactly what she is good at, just like the work she did during her tenure as the chief operating officer at Microsoft - through organizational structure reform, deeply integrating the sales, technology (and now creativity) teams, and shortening the entire advertising production and delivery cycle. At the same time, truly commercializing AI and integrating it into the group's processes.

Her experience is a key asset that WPP Group urgently needs to cope with industry changes.",https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20250712/v2_50cee8dd35674dea8d0f4e7585adb984@000000@ai_oswg387546oswg1536oswg722_img_000~tplv-1marlgjv7f-ai-v3:600:400:600:400:q70.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 00:00:53.082222

This would leave the company with products such as its namesake Heinz ketchup and Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
“As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value,” a company spokesperson said.
Kraft Heinz was formed in 2015 after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with H.J.
“Kraft Heinz spinning off its grocery business echoes the 2023 Kellogg spin-off in which the company spun off its cereal business, which had been in volumetric decline for some time,” said Connor Rattigan, analyst at Consumer Edge.","New York: Kraft Heinz Co is looking to spin off a large chunk of its grocery business, including many Kraft products, into a new entity that could be valued at as much as US$20bil on its own, the Wall Street Journal reports.

This would leave the company with products such as its namesake Heinz ketchup and Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

News of the potential move was the second effort last week by a storied US company looking to shore up shareholder value as shoppers ditch their pricey products in an uncertain economy.

Earlier last week, cereal maker WK Kellogg agreed to a US$3.1bil buyout deal from Italy’s Ferrero.

“As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value,” a company spokesperson said.

The company’s shares closed up 2.5%. It currently has a market value of US$31.33bil.

Kraft Heinz was formed in 2015 after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz, which they bought in 2013. But it has been a challenging investment for Berkshire.

Inflationary pressures and a shift in focus toward fresher, less processed food have hurt demand for the company’s lunch combos and other products.

It lowered annual forecasts and reported a dour quarter in April, hurt by muted consumer spending.

Kraft Heinz also said last month it would stop the launch of new products with artificial colours in the United States after Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr outlined plans to remove synthetic food dyes from the US food supply to address chronic diseases and conditions.

According to the Wall Street Journal report last Friday, a split could be finalised in the coming weeks, but Kraft Heinz has discussed other scenarios with its advisers and its board has not signed off on a final decision.

The company is also working on which brands would be part of the spun-off entity, the report said.

“Kraft Heinz spinning off its grocery business echoes the 2023 Kellogg spin-off in which the company spun off its cereal business, which had been in volumetric decline for some time,” said Connor Rattigan, analyst at Consumer Edge.

“As consumer packaged goods makers (CPGs) contend with both changing consumer preferences and a challenging consumer environment, other CPGs may look to mergers and acquisitions and or similar corporate actions to improve their category exposures and improve their top-line trajectory,” Rattigan said. — Reuters",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/07/14/3415065.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 21:01:26.271879

NEEDHAM, Mass– PC shipments during the second quarter of 2025 grew 6.5% from the prior year, with global volumes reaching 68.4 million shipments, according to preliminary results from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Personal Computing Device Tracker.

Despite PC market growth in other geographies, the US market is starting to feel the pinch of import tariffs.

“We expected the US market to cool down this quarter given the inventory buildup to begin the year, but what we’re witnessing here might highlight US PC demand slowing down in anticipation of the import tariffs looming deadline,” said Jean Philippe Bouchard, research vice-president with IDC’s Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers. “Despite a flat US PC market, the rest of the world demonstrated an appetite for PCs, fueled by an aging installed base and by a steady transition to Windows 11.”

“We realize growth in such an indeterminate market seems odd, but many factors come into play supporting the momentum,” said Ryan Reith, group vice president with IDC’s Worldwide Device Trackers. “The supply side of the industry is doing its best to navigate the unknowns as no one wants to sit on their heels and potentially miss an opportunity, but at the same time it is very risky carrying inventory which is a possibility given the strong first half sell-in. The bigger concern is what overall demand looks like as we get late into Q3 and beyond. Price increases will likely be dispersed over time and geography depending on vendor strategy which can potentially lead to some attractive promotions as a way to clear inventory backups, which seems odd at a time when prices are expected to rise because of tariffs.”

Getting one of those coveted cards from a friend, a job, or even buying one for yourself can come in handy during a caffeine crisis. But for Starbucks, selling credit for its coffee and other offerings ahead of time is big business. We're talking billion-dollar business, because that's what customers routinely leave on their cards at any given time.

Quartr reports that, in 2023, the stored value of Starbucks cards sat at a whopping $1.6 billion. This includes both physical and digital cards, which are stored on the mobile app. So, it's safe to say that, much like the popular practice of customizing your drink order, Starbucks is a big fan of gift card purchases, because all that unspent Starbucks card money is like a loan that the company doesn't have to pay interest on.

The Starbucks Q4 2024 fiscal report put the stored card value at $1.78 billion at the end of 2024, which means that the amount of money held on Starbucks cards has continued to increase every year except for a slight dip in 2019 and 2020 (per Quartr). To put this into perspective, that's enough money on Starbucks cards to buy every single person in the U.S. an Iced Tall Cinnamon Dolce Latte, though they'd have to cover their own tax.

Much of the Starbucks stored card value is actually the balance that customers keep on the mobile card on the app. That way, even if they don't have cash or available money on a debit card, they can still get that coffee fix. The Starbucks mobile app has been around for over 15 years now, and it's seen some massive changes. When it first started, the app could tell customers about store locations, the Starbucks menu, and had a drink builder to assist with ordering. Now, it serves as a mobile Starbucks card that you can use to pay for drinks in the app or in the store. It also tracks Starbucks Rewards that are earned when making purchases.

You can add physical gift cards to the app, too, so that even if the card gets lost, the cash on it doesn't. While it's hard to say how much of Starbucks' stored card value comes from the mobile app, CNN Business reports that 70% of the coffee company's sales come through the mobile app and drive-thru. We can definitely see why using the app to order drinks and other items from Starbucks is so popular. Using the right tips and hacks can lead to more Reward points, which then leads to discounts and even free items.",https://www.tastingtable.com/img/gallery/the-incredible-amount-of-unspent-starbucks-gift-cards-people-are-hanging-on-to/l-intro-1752081002.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 21:01:44.163329

The document showcases the Group’s continued evolution of a sustainability-centered management strategy, highlighting measurable achievements across environmental, social, and governance (ESG) dimensions.

The report outlines comprehensive progress across key areas, including a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, expanded use of renewable energy, increased adoption of certified materials, enhanced product authentication through blockchain technology, and impactful initiatives in human capital and community engagement.

31% Emissions Reduction and 100% Renewable Energy in Europe and North America

On the environmental front, OTB reported a 31% reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) compared to 2023. In addition, all directly managed sites in Europe and North America—including offices and stores—achieved 100% renewable energy usage. Globally, the share of renewable energy reached 70%, and the Group’s emissions reduction targets have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a global standard for climate action in business.

Expanding the Use of Certified and Low-Impact Materials

Progress was also evident in sustainable sourcing. In 2024, 24% of all raw materials purchased by OTB were certified. Notably, preferred cotton—organic, regenerative, and recycled—accounted for 62% of total cotton use, marking a 31% increase from the previous year. This shift reflects a Group-wide commitment to circularity, transparency, and responsible design embedded across its brand portfolios.

Blockchain-Based Authentication and Anti-Counterfeiting Efforts

OTB has also advanced in its technological initiatives. As a Steering Member of the Aura Blockchain Consortium alongside LVMH, the Prada Group, and Cartier (Richemont), OTB issued over 1.8 million digital certificates of authenticity between 2022 and 2024 for products from Jil Sander, Maison Margiela, and Marni. These certificates allow customers to verify product authenticity and trace origins via smartphone.

In parallel, the Group intensified efforts to combat counterfeiting. In 2024 alone, more than 23,000 illicit pieces of content were removed from social media, and over 60,000 counterfeit listings for its brands were taken down from online marketplaces.

Diesel’s Circularity Strategy Earns International Recognition

Diesel continues to lead the charge in circular fashion. Its initiatives—including Diesel Rehab Denim and Diesel Second Hand—along with a recycling collaboration involving its supply chain and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), earned the brand the Circular Economy Award from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation during the 2024 Sustainable Fashion Awards hosted by the National Chamber for Italian Fashion.

Gender Equity, Talent Development, and Corporate Volunteering

OTB’s investment in human capital remains central to its strategy. In 2024, the share of women in managerial roles reached 54.7%, enabling the Group to renew its gender equality certification. Meanwhile, the internal training program “Scuola dei Mestieri” continued to support the next generation of Made in Italy artisans, with over 85% of participants hired by OTB companies.

The newly launched “Brave to Care” corporate volunteering program also saw participation from over 130 employees, who contributed more than 700 hours of service to eight charitable organizations across Italy. The initiative further strengthens the link between the company, its people, and the communities it serves.

Multi-Layered Social Impact through OTB Foundation

The OTB Foundation continued to serve as the cornerstone of the Group’s social responsibility agenda in 2024. Key projects included the “OTB Chiama Alice” free online mental health service for youth, the expansion of support for families in economic hardship, and refugee integration through employment-focused programs.

One standout initiative was “Brave Business in a Bus,” the first mobile incubator supporting female entrepreneurship in Afghanistan. The program enables women in Kabul to launch small businesses from home by providing comprehensive training, business tools, and practical lessons.

OTB Group’s slogan, “Be Responsible. Be Brave,” is more than just a catchphrase—it functions as a core value embedded in the company’s foundation. By driving transformation across environmental, social, and economic dimensions, OTB presents a compelling model for what the next phase of sustainability in the fashion industry can look like.

The law calls for the money to be distributed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) over five years.","(The Hill) — Hospitals are bracing for the impact of the Medicaid cuts in President Donald Trump’s sweeping spending and tax cut law.

While most of the cuts won’t happen immediately, rural facilities in particular say they likely will have to make difficult financial decisions about which services they can afford to keep and which may need to be cut.

Hospitals loudly raised alarms about the legislation, but their warnings went unheeded, and now they say they will bear the brunt of the changes.

The new law cuts about $1 trillion from Medicaid, primarily through stringent work requirements as well as reductions to how states can fund their Medicaid programs through provider taxes and state-directed payments.

Rural hospitals rely heavily on Medicaid funding because many of the patients they care for are low-income.

“Restrictions on state-directed payments and provider taxes cut off critical financial lifelines for hospitals,” Bruce Siegel, president and CEO of America’s Essential Hospitals, said in a statement.

“State-directed payments are a critical source of support for hospitals, particularly in rural areas, and provider taxes help reduce the gap between Medicaid and other payers, ensuring that physicians can take Medicaid patients and hospitals can be adequately staffed. Cutting these lifelines is not sustainable, and it will harm patients.”

More than 300 rural hospitals in the U.S. are at risk of closing down because of the bill, according to research conducted by the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center for Health Services Research and released last month by Democratic lawmakers.

Rural hospitals already operate on thin margins. The law’s Medicaid cuts will lead to more uninsured patients, meaning rural hospitals will not get paid for the services they are required by law to provide to patients, according to the report. In turn, they will face deeper financial strain.

Medicaid-dependent services — like labor and delivery units, mental health care, and emergency rooms — are some of the least profitable, yet most essential, services that hospitals provide. But experts said those will likely be cut as hospitals try to stay afloat.

In rural communities, Medicaid covers nearly half of all births and one-fifth of inpatient discharges, according to health research group KFF.

Republicans pushed back the start date for the provider tax reductions until 2028, and they won’t be fully phased in until 2031. The bill was only signed into law on July 4, so hospitals said it’s too early for them to know specifics on which services they’ll have to cut back on.

But the discussions are underway because hospitals need to start planning.

“If they see a very negative outlook in terms of Medicaid revenue reductions, increases in uncompensated care costs, I think that will tip the scales towards cutting services, cutting staff, not hiring, not expanding,” said Edwin Park, a research professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University.

Mark Nantz, president and chief executive officer of Valley Health System, oversees a network that includes six hospitals in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia and West Virginia, ranging from a 495-bed regional facility in Winchester to a 36-bed facility in Front Royal, about 70 miles outside of Washington.

Nantz said Medicaid expansion and provider taxes have allowed the system to break even when taking care of Medicaid patients. Previously, they were losing about 25 cents on every dollar.

Once the cuts are fully phased in, Nantz said Valley Health will lose about $50 million a year in revenue for Medicaid patients. The most likely casualty will be new construction and expansion plans, but he said it’s too early to know more.

“We’re not in a situation where we need to knee-jerk because we’re a pretty stable healthcare system, but it’s definitely going to change the way we look at expanding and the types of services that we offer in our six hospitals,” Nantz said.

Valley Health was able to expand the services it offers because it was not losing money on Medicaid, but that may not be able to continue. While hospitals may not close, some types of specialty care may be moved from rural facilities and centralized at the regional facility.

“We’ve got, really, two and a half to three years to make those kinds of decisions and prepare for what we will do. So we’re not threatening to cut jobs or hospitals or service locations or any of that right now,” Nantz said. “But we have to look at whether or not we can continue” offering the same types of services.

Republicans concerned about the impact of the provider tax reduction on rural hospitals inserted a $50 billion relief fund into the law. The law calls for the money to be distributed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) over five years.

The federal government will distribute half of the program’s $50 billion allotment equally among all states with an approved application over the next five years.

But experts said the money isn’t nearly enough to make up for the impact of the cuts. According to a KFF analysis, federal Medicaid spending in rural areas is estimated to decline by $155 billion over a decade.

The states and hospitals that will be hit the hardest will benefit the least, Park said.

He noted the law gives the Trump administration a lot of discretion on how they divide up the funds, so there’s potential for favoritism.

Every state has until the end of 2025 at the latest to apply for funds by submitting a “detailed rural health transformation plan” that addresses the program’s aims, according to the legislation.

But if CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz doesn’t agree with how states are using their funds, the law says he then “may withhold payments to, or reduce payments to, or recover previous payments from, the State.”

“It’s a fig leaf,” Park said. “The fund is temporary. These cuts are permanent.”",https://www.localsyr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2025/07/AP25182757035200-e1752430683233.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-13 21:01:04.870775

A grave security bug was discovered in the hiring portal McHire, revealing the sensitive information of around 64 million applicants.

The most surprising aspect of this revelation was that the exceedingly ordinary and foreseeable password '123456' was employed on this system.

Security expert Ian Carroll and Sam Curry uncovered this security flaw. They discovered that there was an option to log in as ""Paradox team members"" on the admin panel of McHire. In it he attempted the default password and username '123456' and got access not only to the test server, but also the actual admin dashboard.

The McHire platform uses an AI chatbot named Olivia, which handles candidate screening and interaction. But due to this bug, it became possible to access the chat history, name, email, phone number, and application details of the applicants.

The researchers found an internal API endpoint from which information about any candidate could be obtained by entering only one predictable parameter. Not only this, some tokens were also found with the help of which any person could present himself in the identity of a candidate.

As soon as this report came out on June 30, McDonald's and its AI tech partner Paradox.ai took immediate action. By July 1, the default login credentials were disabled, and the related API was secured.

Maybe you still do.

The bi-weekly pay structure is how millions of Americans get paid, yet this structure is a huge stressor for lots of people.

💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter💰💵

With a paycheck always a few days or weeks ahead, one unexpected expense, like a car repair or a medical bill, can mean an overdraft at the bank or a massive credit card bill that is hard to repay.

The bi-weekly pay structure is also one reason companies like Dollar Loan Center, MoneyMutual, and Advance America — businesses that offer short-term “paycheck” loans — have thrived over the years, even though they frequently face accusations of predatory lending practices.

Now, a new study reveals insight that might make employers reconsider how they manage this part of their business.

Bi‑weekly pay leads to chronic stress

The current pay structure has hidden consequences. Workers must manage bill due dates and budget for food, rent, phone, internet, etc., all while wondering whether their next check will cover it.

For hourly workers who don't have much savings, the cycle can create a frenzy of short-term financial triage.

The constant financial juggling can take a toll on mental health, straining relationships and reducing productivity at work — all of which is bad for employers.

In a recent Talker Research-commissioned survey, conducted May 13-21, 2025, among 2,000 U.S. hourly workers, including 1,000 who work in retail, nearly 39% reported that living paycheck to paycheck with a consistent income would be an upgrade compared to their current financial situation — and 44% had recently overdrafted their account.

""For a long time, 'living paycheck to paycheck' was considered to be the lowest tier of financial wellness,"" a Talker Research spokesperson told TheStreet. ""In this tier, people aren't able to put their money into savings or level up financially because all their money is going toward immediate needs like rent and groceries. But now, the data shows that many aren't even able to live paycheck to paycheck, slipping into an even lower tier of financial wellness.""

The survey also found:

38% of hourly workers have less than $1,000 in savings.

19% of hourly workers took out loans in the past year to get through the pay cycle.

34% of hourly workers rely on two or more jobs to stay afloat.

Many resort to extreme measures — selling personal property or even dumpster diving — to survive, according to the survey.

This data suggests that current pay structures are both inconvenient and insufficient.

On‑demand pay is a preference for many, not just a perk

The solution may lie in on-demand pay, also known as “earned wage access” (EWA), where workers can access a portion of their earned wages before designated paydays.

Of course, there are dozens of companies competing for employers’ attention in this sector. DailyPay, Payactiv, Earnin, Branch, ZayZoon, and Wagestream are just a few of the EWA companies that have popped up in the last few years.

The survey found that 78% of workers believe having this option would stabilize their finances.

Among those already receiving on-demand wages, results are promising, per Talker Research:

22% of hourly workers used their wages for groceries and essentials;

20% of hourly workers avoided late or missed bill payments; and

15% of hourly workers reported lower financial stress.

These sorts of changes could also benefit employers. Since financial stress correlates with mental strain, absenteeism, and lower productivity, employers who rethink paydays could be rewarded with a stronger workforce.

While we wait for official numbers to come out for Q2 which just closed last Monday, June 30, the year was off to a stellar start when Q1 buybacks hit a record of $293B, according to S&P Global. The previous record was set in Q1 2022 when buybacks totaled $281B.[1] Analysts have said they expect 2025 to hit $1T in total buybacks.[2]

Buybacks remained top heavy, with the top 20 S&P 500 companies accounting for 48.4% of Q1 2025 buybacks, a slight decrease from 49% in Q4 2024. While the concentration amongst top stock repurchases still exists, more companies within the S&P 500 have been repurchasing stock as of late, and the number purchasing over 1% of their public stock has increased.[3] This story changes slightly when you look globally.

Total Number of Global Companies Announcing Buybacks is Lower

Despite the dollar level of buybacks hitting records, Wall Street Horizon data shows that the actual number of announcements has been relatively low, historically speaking. The second quarter closed out with 164 announcements, that comes after Q1 recorded 168 buyback announcements. The quarterly average over the last five years has been 204 announcements. You can see in the chart below that those numbers are steadily climbing after bottom-ing out in 2023.

An Age-Old Debate: Are Buybacks Good or Bad?

As interest rates fall, as many are expecting at the next Fed meeting on July 30, holding onto cash tends to become less attractive to corporations who want to deploy and put it to work. Typically, buybacks are a good thing for shareholders as well, as they artificially improve earnings per share of a company, if not actually improving earnings. Share repurchases come under fire for this reason as well, with many arguing that companies could have put the money to better use by investing it back into the company. Investors tend to prefer companies that are buying back shares while also investing in growth. A great example is the mega tech names, many of which are the largest buyers of their own stock, but also tend to invest heavily in research and development and AI, among other things.

The Bottom-Line

As the Q2 earnings season begins on Tuesday, July 15th with reports from major banks, investors should closely monitor buyback announcements. An increase in share repurchases would indicate corporate America's renewed willingness to deploy cash, which could have positive implications for the US economy.

For Albertsons Media Collective, the chain’s media arm, the physical store at Cannes, stocked with products ready to be sold, represented the ultimate goal: getting products off the shelves and into customers’ hands.

According to Evan Hovorka, VP, product and innovation, Albertsons Media Collective, their presence in Cannes “really reflects our DNA,” adding, “We exist to provide shoppers with cost-effective food solutions.” Hovorka said that bringing this mission to Cannes completes the circle, encompassing media, merchandising, and product sales.

In-store media network

Also at the festival, Albertsons Media Collective launched an in-store digital display network to provide brands and agencies “a more robust way for them to tell their story directly to our shoppers at the most important point of their decision-making process,” Hovorka said.

The network allows them to present creative media-driven narratives featuring recipes, sustainability programs, or new product launches.

The timing is crucial, said Hovorka. Customers are already in the store and ready to spend, making it an ideal moment to connect brands with shoppers. “There couldn’t be a more beautiful way to connect a brand to the shopper,” Hovorka said.

According to eMarketer, in-store retail media ad spending is projected to exceed $500 million in 2025, which supports the emphasis on connecting with shoppers at the point of sale.

Video ads complete the picture

Hovorka noted that the network features high-resolution video ad units distributed across stores, which he sees as an improvement over static images found in other retailers. While shelf tags and screen prints remain important components of a retail media network, “now we’ve got the most exciting missing piece, which is that inspirational video,” Hovorka said.

Hovorka offered an example of influencers showcasing a new guacamole recipe leading into Cinco de Mayo, displayed above avocados on sale, adding that it “really is the icing on the cake to complete our full omni-channel journey.”

Albertsons Media Collective launched “Collective TV” in June 2024, integrating retail media with television advertising, which aligns with the strategy of using video to create richer storytelling.

The pilot program launches across 80 stores, with plans to scale to 2,300 stores. “This is an opportunity for brands and agencies to invest early, help us shape this narrative and shape this product into something that’s going to work best for everybody involved,” Hovorka said.",https://www.beet.tv/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/97784-thumbnail-2-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 14:03:45.490413

He also asked if I wanted to refund my order.” Mr Tay, who said he had ordered the meal for a family birthday, declined the refund.
I was so surprised as I just wanted to know why it took so long,” Mr Tay said.
When Mr Tay asked for the manager’s name to file a complaint, the situation escalated further.","SINGAPORE: McDonald’s Singapore has issued an apology after a customer complained about an unusually long wait time and an unpleasant exchange with a manager at its Hougang 1 outlet.

Mr Tay, who shared his experience with citizen journalism platform Stomp, said he had placed a takeaway order at the restaurant at 10.28pm on June 7. Despite initially waiting patiently, he only received his food at 11.16pm—48 minutes later.

According to Mr Tay, the store was busy when he arrived, so he did not mind waiting at first. However, by 10.55pm, he noticed that other customers who had ordered around the same time were already leaving.

“I asked an auntie at the counter about it. She told me to wait for my order as it was still being prepared,” Mr Tay told Stomp, “After 10 minutes, I asked her again. She told me to wait.”

When his order was eventually ready close to 11.16pm, Mr Tay requested to speak to the duty manager to understand the delay. What followed, he said, was an unpleasant encounter.

“The auntie told him about it, but he turned his head, ignored me and carried on doing his things,” Mr Tay wrote in his feedback to McDonald’s, “After that, the auntie called him again, and he unwillingly came to the counter.”

Mr Tay alleged that the manager’s demeanour quickly turned confrontational when he asked why the food had taken so long.

“He immediately started with a rude attitude, opening his eyes wide and talking like a gangster,” Mr Tay claimed, “He challenged me and asked why I couldn’t see that the store was busy—are the kitchen staff dancing? He also asked if I wanted to refund my order.”

Mr Tay, who said he had ordered the meal for a family birthday, declined the refund. He also expressed shock when the manager suggested he was being disrespectful.

“I asked him why he was so rude. He told me that I did not give him ‘face’ in front of other customers and staff. I was so surprised as I just wanted to know why it took so long,” Mr Tay said.

When Mr Tay asked for the manager’s name to file a complaint, the situation escalated further.

“He threw his name tag on the desk. When I wanted to take a picture of it, he timidly snatched it back and asked me to take a photo of the ‘shift manager on duty’,” Mr Tay recounted, “It was definitely a forgotten order and the manager was not apologetic at all.”

In his feedback, Mr Tay described the manager’s behaviour as “frightening” and said the entire episode left him “a very disappointed customer”.

McDonald’s Singapore has since apologised over the episode. A spokesperson told Stomp, “We’re sorry to hear about what happened and have since reached out to make things right. Consistent service matters to us, and we’ve taken steps—including reinforcing training with our team—to help prevent this from happening again.”

Mr Tay later confirmed that McDonald’s had contacted him, apologised, and refunded the cost of the meal. Reflecting on the outcome, he said: “Social media power is very fantastic.”",https://media.theindependent.sg/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-13-021013.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 15:05:57.112999

The newsroom approaches each quarter with a nervous energy, but this summer it feels especially heightened. Recent market records in both the U.S. and Europe, alongside an unpredictable economic environment, paint a complicated picture for the second half.

It all kicks off on Tuesday with America's banking behemoths, as attention switches from the White House back to Wall Street.

But U.S. President Donald Trump's policies still loom large, with Goldman Sachs predicting that, this quarter, U.S. earnings will start to show the impact of the tariffs.

The investment bank's economists see ""conflicting messages on the margin outlook"" as companies have only announced modest price increases, despite the cost hikes associated with higher tariffs.

Earnings-per-share growth is also set to come under pressure, with Goldman suggesting, ""the consensus estimate among analysts sees S&P 500 companies' earnings-per-share growth decelerating to 4% this quarter relative to the same quarter last year — down from 12% in the first quarter.""

With the banks set to dominate next week — JPMorgan , Citi , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are all reporting within just two days — maybe Europe can provide some optimism.

As reported by CNBC's Jenni Reid, European banks just recorded their best first half since 1997. Gains were driven by strong investment banking returns — something their U.S. counterparts are also likely to capitalize on — as well as stock rallies based on both deal speculation and actual M&A.

As someone who grew up in Cape Town, seeing this year's G20 meetings take place in South Africa makes me pine for the sunshine of the Southern hemisphere.

Next week's meeting in Durban between finance ministers and central bank governors comes at an interesting time for the country.

An Oval Office meeting between South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Trump went spectacularly wrong back in May, when the latter, flanked by his South African (now former) right-hand man Elon Musk, made false claims of a ""white genocide.""

It seems tensions have not abated.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will skip the meeting altogether, opting to head to Japan instead, according to Reuters. South Africa is also subject to a new 30% tariff rate, the only country in sub-Saharan Africa to be singled out in the latest round of announcements.

It does not bode well for the G20 Leaders meeting, due to be held in Gauteng on Nov. 22-23. It remains to be seen if Trump will attend.

To combat slowing sales, Starbucks hired former Chipotle executive Brian Niccol as its chair and CEO in August. Niccol addressed the situation directly at the time, saying, “It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers.""

Niccol named the company's new ""Back to Starbucks"" plan as the key to that change, saying, ""My experience tells me that when we get back to our core identity and consistently deliver a great experience, our customers will come back.""

Part of the company's plan is to attract consumers back to Starbucks as a community gathering space, moving away from the quick-speed tweaks it implemented in prior years.

Since announcing the plan, Starbucks has made a variety of other changes, including writing on cups again, bringing back the condiment bar, ditching the non-dairy upcharge, and adding additional coverage hours in 3,000 of its locations.

In addition to all those tweaks, it's also got a new drink coming to weather the hottest part of summer.

Starbucks has a new take on cold brew

Since it's the hottest time of the year, Starbucks has decided it's time to deliver something exciting with a tasty new spin on a coffee classic: the cold brew.

As we reported previously, Starbucks is bringing back a raspberry syrup it originally discontinued in 2023.

“Starbucks will also be bringing back raspberry syrup for a very limited time this July to delight fans, and the company plans to bring more flavor drops in the future,” the company said in a June 10 news release.

However, Starbucks also has a new drink coming, which it hasn't yet revealed: a Raspberry Cream cold brew, as reporter by food blogger Markie Devo via his X account on July 10.

Devo says that several employees have told him the new drink is coming, which is the chain's signature coffee sweetened with vanilla syrup and topped with a raspberry cream cold foam.

Devo originally reported that the drink could come out on July 24 for rewards members and July 29 nationwide, but it looks like those dates have been changed just a bit, as now the new drink drops for a limited time on July 28.

Starbucks employees sound off on the changes

While Niccol promises the Back to Starbucks program will transform the brand, there's one group of people who don't love the changes: the baristas.

The Starbucks subreddit features a fair number of complaints about the new policies, with one focused heavily on the return to writing on cups.

""WRITING ON CUPS IS STUPID. THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY. It slows us down, no one likes doing it, being coached for not doing it is ridiculous, the customers don’t f**king care,"" wrote one user, who also claimed the practice was unsanitary.

Another user called out the menu simplification, calling Niccol's ordered changes ""laughable.""

""Sure, he took away some pastries (but added some),"" the user wrote. ""Took away creme based frappuccinos which are still being ordered, which are now simply harder and more time consuming to ring up (which makes it more difficult to meet their strict ""peak"" time crunches). Oh, and thanks for the hellish frappuccinos the week of July 4. Really.

Soybean oil is being used as a sustainable replacement for petroleum and other oils in tire sidewalls.

Firestone uses racing as a testing ground for new tire technologies before implementing them in consumer tires.

NEWTON—Tires made in part with soybeans grown in Iowa will be coming soon to Firestone stores.

Firestone, IndyCar's tire manufacturer, tests tire technology by using it first in its IndyCar tires before making it more widely available in consumer tires. The company is owned by Bridgestone Americas, which employs 700 people at its Des Moines Agricultural Tire Plant. The plant also makes Firestone tires for tractors.

Cara Krstolic, Firestone race tire engineering and production executive director, said that Firestone's consumer tires — whether manufactured for cars or tractors — share some materials with its racing tires. In 2022, Firestone introduced an alternative tire made from guayule, a plant that grows in the southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico, to use on street courses. More recently, Firestone added soybean oil to its race tires.

Soybean oil is used in sidewalls of tires, and the company is experimenting with other uses for it, Krstolic said.

""Leftover residual oil from the soybean can be used to replace petroleum,"" Krstolic said. ""And it can also work on reducing some of our other oils in the tires.""

Soybeans are also more renewable than other plants Firestone has experimented with, she said.

""The nice thing about the soybean is that there's enough sources that you can get that (and) you're not competing as food source,"" Krstolic said. ""

Among the products Firestone makes at Bridgestone's Des Moines factory are tractor tires, which sit on a tractor in Victory Lane.

Since its inception, car and tire manufacturers have used racing to test products before rolling sales out to consumers. Firestone founder Harvey Firestone coined the phrase, ""Win on Sunday, sell on Monday.""

Each race weekend Firestone brings about 20 people to mount tires and six engineers to monitor tire temperatures and other data on tires. Eventually all of this work at Iowa Speedway and IndyCar's 15 other tracks makes it into consumer tires, Krstolic said.

""Racing is a mobile lab,"" Krstolic said. ""Where else can you see the extremes of heat and durability and performance than on race tracks?... So there are materials that we'll put into this race and other races that we can prove out at speeds of 200 mph.""

Conclusion: A Resilient Outperformer U.S. Bancorp's strategic moves under Kedia position it as a resilient competitor in an evolving banking landscape.","Amid the volatility of the U.S. banking sector, U.S. Bancorp (USB) has emerged as a standout performer, leveraging strategic initiatives and a leadership transition to fortify its position. The bank's Q2 2025 earnings, to be released on July 17, will offer critical insights into its ability to navigate challenges such as declining interest rates and rising costs while maintaining peer-leading returns. Under CEO Gunjan Kedia's leadership, the bank is executing a multi-pronged strategy to enhance profitability, expand digitally, and capitalize on partnerships—all hallmarks of a resilient outperformer.

Leadership Transition Fuels Strategic Focus

Kedia's April 2025 appointment as CEO marked a pivotal shift. A veteran of the bank's corporate and investment divisions, she has prioritized operational discipline and growth through technology and partnerships. Alongside CFO John Stern, she has outlined ambitious targets: boosting the net interest margin (NIM) to over 3% from 2.72% in Q1 2025 and cutting costs via four new initiatives. These moves align with her vision to balance risk management with aggressive pursuit of revenue synergies from the Union Bank acquisition. Analysts note her potential to accelerate digital transformation, a critical edge in an industry increasingly defined by fintech disruption.

Strategic Initiatives: Efficiency and Digital Growth

U.S. Bancorp's Q2 focus hinges on two pillars: optimizing its existing customer base and leveraging partnerships to drive capital-light growth. The bank's Q1 ROTCE of 17.5%—up from 16.5% in Q1 2024—demonstrates operational leverage, but sustaining this will require execution on cost-saving measures and NIM expansion.

The partnership with Fiserv, announced in June, is a case in point. Integrating U.S. Bank's Elan credit card program into Fiserv's Credit Choice platform creates a seamless digital experience for consumers and small businesses. This collaboration, set to fully convert by year-end, reduces operational friction and expands U.S. Bancorp's reach without physical branch investments. Similarly, its long-running partnership with State Farm—now offering co-branded credit cards and loans—has generated 120,000 accounts in 2023 alone, showcasing the power of third-party networks to scale efficiently.

Navigating Challenges: Cost Discipline and Interest Rate Headwinds

The bank faces headwinds, including gradual interest rate cuts and rising expenses. U.S. Bancorp's Q1 noninterest expense rose 3.5% year-over-year to $4.1 billion, a trend it aims to reverse through cost-saving measures. The goal is an efficiency ratio in the mid-50s by 2026-2027, down from 60.8% in Q1 2025.

On NIM, the bank is countering rate pressures through loan growth (up 0.9% Q/Q to $381.8 billion) and deposit optimization. Its strategy to reduce reliance on high-cost deposits and favor loan growth—particularly in commercial and corporate segments—should help achieve the 3% NIM target. However, the Federal Reserve's potential cuts later this year could test this approach.

Valuation and Investment Considerations

At current levels, U.S. Bancorp's stock trades at 1.6x tangible book value, below its five-year average of 1.8x, suggesting undervaluation relative to peers. Its dividend yield of 2.8%—supported by a strong capital position (Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.8% in Q1)—offers stability.

Investors should monitor Q2 results for progress on:

1. NIM expansion and cost-saving execution.

2. Noninterest income growth (targeted at 5% annually).

3. Loan growth trends and credit quality metrics.

Risks include prolonged rate cuts, which could pressure NII, and execution delays in digital partnerships. Yet, the bank's fortress balance sheet (nonperforming assets at 0.45% in Q1) and ethical reputation—ranked among the 2025 World's Most Ethical Companies—provide a safety net.

Conclusion: A Resilient Outperformer

U.S. Bancorp's strategic moves under Kedia position it as a resilient competitor in an evolving banking landscape. Its focus on digital innovation, cost discipline, and partnerships reduces reliance on traditional branch expansion, while its financial metrics—ROTEC and efficiency ratio—signal operational strength. While challenges remain, the bank's execution could validate its undervalued stock, making it a compelling pick for investors seeking stability in a volatile sector.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 13:02:58.975268

Conclusion: The New Rules of Retail Walmart's anti-theft measures and e-commerce dominance are more than tactical moves—they're a blueprint for the future.","The retail landscape is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by rising theft, evolving consumer expectations, and the relentless march of e-commerce. At the epicenter of this transformation stands Walmart, whose bold moves to combat theft and dominate online grocery sales offer a blueprint for retailers navigating today's challenges. By integrating physical and digital strategies while addressing loss prevention, Walmart is redefining the rules of the game—and investors would be wise to take note.

The Anti-Theft Tightrope: Balancing Security and Trust

Walmart's recent anti-theft initiatives—locking meats in tamper-resistant cages, deploying AI-driven checkout systems, and embedding hidden barcodes—aim to stem losses that cost U.S. retailers $61 billion annually. These measures have sparked public outcry, with critics calling Walmart's “imprisoned” food displays a betrayal of its value-driven ethos. TikTok users and consumer advocacy groups have amplified concerns, citing a 16.5% rise in discrimination complaints linked to intrusive security practices.

Yet, Walmart's actions are strategic. Theft at self-checkouts has surged by 30% since 2020, and the company cannot afford to cede ground to competitors or erode margins further. The operational costs of these changes—new technologies, staff training, and potential declines in customer convenience—are substantial. However, Walmart's scale and infrastructure (e.g., 4,700 U.S. stores) allow it to absorb these expenses while maintaining its dominance.

The E-Commerce Edge: Walmart's 31.6% Market Share Lead

Walmart's true advantage lies in its omnichannel strategy. With 31.6% of the U.S. online grocery market—$63.79 billion in projected 2025 sales—the company outpaces Amazon (22.6%) and Instacart (21.6%) by prioritizing value, convenience, and integration. Its Walmart+ membership program, which offers free delivery and cash-back incentives, has driven a 21% year-over-year global e-commerce sales growth. Meanwhile, delivery costs per order have dropped nearly 40%, thanks to AI-optimized logistics and store-fulfilled orders.

The data underscores Walmart's resilience:

While Amazon's Prime ecosystem and Instacart's delivery network remain formidable, Walmart's physical-digital hybrid model—where 72.2% of its online sales flow directly through its own platform—gives it an edge in controlling pricing, inventory, and customer experience. Shoppers, particularly cost-conscious families, reward this integration: Walmart's average order value exceeds competitors' by 20%.

Competitive Dynamics: Why Walmart's Playbook Works

Amazon and Instacart face structural limitations. Amazon's grocery sales, though growing, rely heavily on one-off purchases (e.g., toiletries), whereas Walmart dominates full-basket shopping. Instacart, while the top delivery intermediary (57.7% of U.S. delivery sales), struggles as retailers like Walmart and Kroger build in-house logistics to reduce reliance on third parties.

Walmart's strategy also addresses a key consumer shift: the demand for seamless omnichannel experiences. Its 2025 delivery share rose nearly 8 percentage points year-over-year, and its pickup services remain preferred by 45.5% of shoppers. By leveraging generative AI for dynamic pricing and personalized recommendations, Walmart is not just keeping pace but setting the pace.

Investment Implications: Betting on Loss Prevention and Omnichannel Mastery

Walmart's moves signal a broader industry trend: retailers must prioritize loss prevention and omnichannel integration to thrive. Investors should favor companies that:

1. Control the end-to-end customer journey (e.g., Walmart's integrated stores and apps).

2. Invest in AI and automation to reduce costs and enhance customer experience.

3. Maintain low prices without sacrificing margins through supply chain efficiency.

Walmart's stock, currently trading at $152.30 (as of July 2025), offers a compelling entry point. Its dividend yield of 1.2% and consistent e-commerce growth (outpacing overall revenue) make it a defensive play in a volatile market. Meanwhile, Amazon's reliance on high-margin digital services and Instacart's dependency on retailer partnerships leave them exposed to margin pressures and competition.

Conclusion: The New Rules of Retail

Walmart's anti-theft measures and e-commerce dominance are more than tactical moves—they're a blueprint for the future. By balancing security with convenience, leveraging scale to absorb costs, and owning the customer experience from shelf to doorstep, Walmart is proving that the winners of the retail revolution will be those who master both physical and digital worlds. For investors, this is a signal to back retailers with similar strategies: those who innovate without losing sight of their core values.

In a sector where theft, convenience, and trust are existential battlegrounds, Walmart's resilience is a harbinger of things to come. The question isn't whether the retail revolution will succeed—it's already here. The answer is who will lead it. For now, the answer is Walmart.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 12:09:56.415167

I secured a forum account with the password ""1234"" when I was a teenager; that account's compromise was ultimately meaningless.
Paradox raised $200 million in 2020, McDonald's has a $213 billion market cap, and McHire's flaws exposed information about tens of millions of people.
Perhaps the only bright side is that Carroll and Curry said the McHire vulnerabilities were addressed a day after their disclosure.","A pair of security researchers has revealed vulnerabilities in the McHire chatbot Paradox, developed for McDonald's, that could have been exploited to reveal personal information about roughly 64 million people who have used the service to apply for jobs at their local franchises. (Hat-tip Wired.)

I was ""hacked"" the first time when I was 14. I put that in scare quotes because the password for the account was ""1234."" (Without the quotes or period, of course, which makes it even worse.) After I regained access to the account, I started using a password manager.

Why is that relevant? Because the researchers who found these vulnerabilities, Ian Carroll and Sam Curry, were able to guess the password used by ""Paradox team members"" to access McHire: ""123456."" That's slightly better than the password I used, I guess, but not enough to justify its use decades after most people realized that using weak passwords is a bad idea.

There is some good news: ""It turned out we had become the administrator of a test restaurant inside the McHire system,"" Carroll and Curry wrote. ""We could see all of the employees of the restaurant were simply employees of Paradox.ai, the company behind McHire. This was great because we could now see how the app worked, but annoying because we had still not demonstrated any actual confidentiality or integrity impact.""

That's where the second vulnerability comes in. (Or the first, depending on whether or not you count the embarrassingly bad password as a true vuln.) An insecure direct object reference (IDOR) flaw in the McHire API allowed Carroll and Curry to gain access to the following information from ""every chat interaction [from anyone who] ever applied for a job at McDonald’s"":

Name, email address, phone number, address

Candidacy state and every state change/form input the candidate had submitted (shifts they could work, etc)

Auth token to log into the consumer UI as that user, leaking their raw chat messages and presumably other information

Carroll and Curry noted that Paradox had previously bragged that 90% of McDonald's franchises were using McHire as part of their hiring practices. (That link still leads to the appropriate post on Paradox's blog, but the section related to McDonald's has been removed, and neither the Wayback Machine nor Google's cache has saved old versions of the post. Weird!)

So let's compare and contrast. I secured a forum account with the password ""1234"" when I was a teenager; that account's compromise was ultimately meaningless. Paradox raised $200 million in 2020, McDonald's has a $213 billion market cap, and McHire's flaws exposed information about tens of millions of people. But at least their password was two characters longer!

Perhaps the only bright side is that Carroll and Curry said the McHire vulnerabilities were addressed a day after their disclosure.

Recognized as Africa’s largest airline and one of the fastest-growing global aviation brands, Ethiopian Airlines continues to embody an African success story — one that has translated a bold vision into a world-class reality over the past eight decades. The airline currently serves over 160 passenger and cargo destinations across five continents.

More than just a carrier, Ethiopian plays a strategic role in connecting Africa to the rest of the world.

Vision 2035 is rooted in a commitment to safe, secure, market-responsive, and customer-focused services across a diverse portfolio that includes passenger and cargo operations, logistics, aviation training, airport management, ground handling, aircraft maintenance (MRO), aerospace manufacturing, and travel and tourism.

CEO Mesfin stated that the airline is implementing the roadmap with an emphasis on “fast and profitable growth.” Key components of this effort include network expansion, fleet modernization, and enhanced operational efficiency.

“As part of this strategy, we’ve continued to open new routes,” he said, citing recent additions such as Sharjah (UAE), Hyderabad (India), Oporto (Portugal), and Hanoi (Vietnam). He noted that Ethiopian inaugurated its Hanoi route this Thursday, underscoring its ongoing global expansion.

Increasing the frequency of flights to existing destinations also remains a key focus, Mesfin added. He revealed that the airline is actively exploring new long-haul opportunities, including a potential launch of services to Australia. A feasibility study for that route is currently underway.

On fleet development, Mesfin confirmed that Ethiopian has placed orders for approximately 120 new aircraft from both Boeing and Airbus. These include Boeing 787 Dreamliners and the next-generation 777X, along with Airbus A350s. The airline is also currently receiving deliveries of the Boeing 737 MAX, with two aircraft received last month and more scheduled for arrival.

To enhance its regional capacity, the airline is evaluating options for acquiring additional 100-seat aircraft, with new orders expected to be placed soon.

Beyond fleet and route expansion, Ethiopian is also deepening its global footprint through strategic partnerships. The CEO disclosed that the airline is currently collaborating with four foreign carriers and remains open to additional joint ventures.

“Several countries have expressed interest in partnering with us to establish their own national carriers,” he told local news agency ENA. “Our approach typically begins with a feasibility study to assess the viability of such initiatives.”

In a shocking cybersecurity lapse, McDonald’s AI-powered hiring tool reportedly exposed the personal data of more than 64 million job applicants — all because it was secured with the world’s most infamous password: “123456”.

The vulnerability was discovered last month by security researchers who, out of curiosity, decided to probe the fast food giant’s recruitment chatbot after a Reddit thread highlighted how poorly it was responding to job seekers.

According to WIRED, they shared the details of the breach on Wednesday (9 July), and McDonald’s has also confirmed that they have patched the security risk.

Researcher gains access to personal data using default login credentials

Security expert Ian Carroll detailed the breach in a blog post, explaining that he was drawn to investigate McHire, McDonald’s AI recruitment system, after seeing a Reddit post about its chatbot, Olivia.

The Reddit post shared a frustrating interaction between a job applicant and the AI chatbot, with the bot giving nonsensical answers.

After just a few hours, he and fellow researcher Sam Curry stumbled upon a serious flaw — they could log in using default admin credentials, where both the username and password were simply “123456”.

This granted them full access to a database containing the private information of more than 64 million applicants, including names, email addresses, and phone numbers.

Breach reported, vulnerability fixed within hours

Upon discovering the flaw, the researchers immediately contacted Paradox.ai, the company behind McHire, and McDonald’s. The alert was sent on 30 June, prompting swift action.

Paradox.ai patched the vulnerability within hours, later confirming in a blog post that no unauthorised parties accessed the system, and that the only individuals who did were the two ethical researchers.

They also pledged to launch a bug bounty programme to catch such issues in future.

“We do not take this matter lightly, even though it was resolved swiftly and effectively,” they told WIRED. “We own this.”

Meanwhile, McDonald’s agreed that Paradox.ai were to blame.

“We’re disappointed by this unacceptable vulnerability from a third-party provider, Paradox.ai. As soon as we learned of the issue, we mandated Paradox.ai to remediate the issue immediately, and it was resolved on the same day it was reported to us,” the fast food chain said.

This week, Wall Street is gearing up for the second-quarter earnings season, with major banks and household names like JPMorgan, Bank of America, Johnson & Johnson, and Netflix set to report their financials. Amidst the earnings releases, trade developments, including President Donald Trump's tariffs on the European Union and Mexico, will continue to draw significant attention from investors and financial professionals. The economic calendar is also busy, with inflation and retail sales reports scheduled for release.

Second-Quarter Earnings Season

The earnings season is expected to kick off with a bang, as major U.S. corporations, including banks and pharmaceutical companies, are set to release their financial results. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, among other major banks, will report their earnings, providing insights into the financial health of the banking sector. Johnson & Johnson, a leading pharmaceutical company, is expected to report quarterly earnings of $2.66 per share, indicating a decline of 5.7% compared to the year-ago period [3]. Analysts forecast revenues of $22.79 billion, representing an increase of 1.5% year over year.

Trade Developments

The ongoing trade tensions and tariffs imposed by the U.S. President Donald Trump will continue to be a focal point for investors. The U.S. has implemented tariffs on the European Union and Mexico, which have the potential to disrupt global supply chains and impact corporate earnings. The impact of these tariffs will be closely watched by investors and financial analysts, as they could influence the performance of companies and sectors that are heavily exposed to international trade.

Economic Calendar

The economic calendar is packed with important releases this week. On Tuesday, July 15, the June Consumer Price Index (CPI) report will be released, which could provide clues about the future of interest rates. The CPI is expected to show a monthly rise of 0.23% and a year-over-year increase of 2.6% [2]. Additionally, retail sales data will be released on Wednesday, July 16, which will give insights into consumer spending habits.

Conclusion

This week promises to be a busy one for Wall Street, with second-quarter earnings season in full swing and a packed economic calendar. Investors and financial professionals will be closely monitoring the earnings reports and economic data releases to gauge the health of the economy and make informed investment decisions.

In his letter to Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump echoed much of the language of his previous missives, including threatening to raise tariffs higher should Mexico retaliate.
Since the country-specific tariffs were first announced, officials from Mexico have often sought to strengthen the bilateral relationship and secure preferential treatment on tariffs, rather than retaliate.
EU imports currently face a 10% baseline duty for entering the U.S.
“A 30% tariff on EU exports would hurt businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic.","The U.S. will implement 30% tariffs on imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective Aug. 1, according to letters President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday morning.

The announcements come amid a rush of country-specific duty proclamations from Trump, covering many of the country's top trading partners, including Canada, Brazil, Japan and South Korea. All tariffs are slated to start Aug. 1.

In his letter to Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump echoed much of the language of his previous missives, including threatening to raise tariffs higher should Mexico retaliate. He also called attention to security topics, like cartel activity within Mexico and its link to U.S. fentanyl trafficking within the letter.

Since early March, imports from Mexico, like those from Canada, have been subject to a 25% tariff unless they qualify for United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement treatment.

The Saturday letter to Mexico does not clarify whether the USMCA exemption will continue under the new tariff rate, nor whether the 35% duty will replace the original 25% levy.

Since the country-specific tariffs were first announced, officials from Mexico have often sought to strengthen the bilateral relationship and secure preferential treatment on tariffs, rather than retaliate. To that end, officials from Mexico met with U.S. counterparts on Friday to establish a permanent working group that would allow the countries to consistently discuss key issues, including flashpoints like security, migration, water management and the economy, according to a press release Saturday.

During that meeting, the U.S. informed Mexico it would send a letter setting new tariffs on Aug. 1, according to the press release, which was issued jointly by Mexico's economy and foreign affairs ministries. Mexico's officials called the action unfair and said they did not agree, but established that one of the working group's first goals would be to seek an alternative prior to the implementation date, according to the release.

“It is highly relevant to have established, since July 11, the necessary channels and space to resolve any possibility of new tariffs going into effect on August 1,” the release says in Spanish. “In other words, Mexico is already in negotiations.”

Trump’s missive to EU President Ursula von der Leyen is also mostly identical to other versions he has shared this week but features a line not included in any previously posted version.

“The European Union will allow complete, open Market Access to the United States, with no Tariff being charged to us, in an attempt to reduce the large trade deficit,” the letter says. It is unclear if this is a provision to which the EU has agreed or a request from the president.

EU imports currently face a 10% baseline duty for entering the U.S. The bloc is one of many U.S. trading partners attempting to navigate Trump's tariff-heavy trade policy and negotiate with the White House for reduced duties.

“A 30% tariff on EU exports would hurt businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic. We will continue working towards an agreement by August 1,” von der Leyen said in a post on X Saturday. “At the same time, we are ready to safeguard EU interests on the basis of proportionate countermeasures.”

In May, Trump said talks with the EU ""are going nowhere"" and recommended a 50% tariff on imports from the bloc starting July 9. The president has also threatened tariffs on specific EU-origin products — including wine and champagne — and levied duties targeting major sectors like steel, aluminum and the automotive industry.

Since February, the barrage of U.S.-imposed tariffs have impacted 70% of total EU trade with the U.S., European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a speech Tuesday.

""The scale and the scope of these measures is unprecedented,"" von der Leyen said. ""Our line has been clear. We will be firm. We do prefer a negotiated solution. This is why we are working closely with the US administration to get an agreement.""

The EU has been preparing its own countermeasures if ongoing tariff negotiations fall short of the bloc's goals. The retaliatory actions would impact more than $100 billion worth of imports and apply to a range of industrial and agricultural products.

Wednesday, July 16:

1. Bank of America: The bank is expected to report on its net interest income (NII) and revenue. Bank of America's NII was $13.7 billion in the second quarter, with optimistic guidance for the latter half of 2024 [2].

2. Goldman Sachs: The investment bank reported a 150% year-over-year increase in second-quarter profits, driven by strong performance in its global banking & markets and asset & wealth management divisions [2].

3. Morgan Stanley: The bank saw a 41% increase in second-quarter profits, with revenue climbing 12% [2].

Market Implications:

The upcoming earnings reports will provide valuable information on the financial health of these companies. For instance, the bond portfolios of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America will be closely scrutinized for any signs of improvement or continued losses. Additionally, the NII and revenue reports from Bank of America will offer insights into the bank's consumer banking business. The strong performance of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley indicates a rebound in investment banking activity, which could have broader implications for the financial sector.

Investors should closely monitor these reports and analyze the companies' performance relative to their peers and market expectations. The earnings reports will likely influence market sentiment and could lead to significant price movements in the stocks of these companies.

The EU exported about 17% of its exportable finished steel products to the US in 2024, according to Comex data.
EU steel product exports remained steady in 2024 year over year, according to S&P Global Commodities at Sea data.

The 30% tariffs were announced by US President Donald Trump in letters sent to the presidents of Mexico and the EU, which he posted on Truth Social July 12.

The EU and Mexico are the leading trade partners of the US.

The US is the EU's second-largest export market for steel, while Mexico leads exports of automotive products to the US.

In the letter to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump said Mexico ""still has not stopped the cartels,"" and as a result, the US will start levying the tariffs. However, he added there will be no tariffs on Mexico if it builds or manufactures products in the US.

Similarly, Trump in his letter to EU President Ursula von der Leyen said the US had decided to end its trade deficit with the bloc and would go ahead with the tariffs, unless the EU decides to build or manufacture products in the US.

It was not clear if the current tariffs on Mexico would conflict with exemptions on trade of goods signed under the USMCA trade agreement.

Both letters mentioned that these tariffs are separate from the ""sectoral tariffs"" and any ""good transhipped to evade this higher tariff will be subjected to that higher tariff.""

In the week starting July 7, Trump sent letters to several countries imposing a varied range of tariffs on its key trade partners, including Canada, another key supplier of commodities such as steel, natural gas, and beef.

Metals sector uncertainty

From a metals perspective, the change in tariffs brings uncertainty to steel, aluminum and copper markets, as the US already has a separate 50% tariff on each of these commodities, considered critical for the economy and energy transition.

The 50% tariffs on steel imports and reciprocal tariff threats have led the US construction industry to postpone projects due to uncertainty about prices.

Since the start of 2025, Platts-assessed TSI US HRC EXW Indiana reached a year-to-date high of $950/st on March 12, the day when Trump announced the first round of tariffs. However, prices since those highs have fallen 8.4%, reaching $870/st July 11. Platts is part of S&P Global Commodity Insights.

The EU exported about 17% of its exportable finished steel products to the US in 2024, according to Comex data.

EU steel product exports remained steady in 2024 year over year, according to S&P Global Commodities at Sea data.

From an agricultural perspective, markets in Mexico will be watching for the next developments as the country is a key importer of US corn, pork, chicken and beef.

Mexico also supplies crude oil to the US, while the US is a major supplier of refined products to Mexico.

The US runs its highest trade deficit with Mexico, according to the US Census Bureau.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-13 12:11:08.545014

There are exciting times ahead as we navigate through 2025. Australia’s hotel sector, whilst choppy, continues to demonstrate remarkable resilience with national occupancy rates at 71% and RevPAR up 3.8% to $171. Despite ongoing challenges, this growth creates a landscape ripe with both hurdles and opportunities.

Sydney leads the recovery charge with occupancy at 78% and RevPAR growing to an impressive $215, making this market our standout performer. Conversely, Melbourne and Hobart continue to face headwinds from supply increases and slightly softening domestic leisure demand.

In New Zealand, we see a similar dichotomy—Queenstown, Christchurch, and Rotorua benefit from returning international visitors. Auckland is grappling with increased room inventory, and Wellington is adjusting to reduced government spending.

Third-party management, stakeholder experiences, and technology integration are key trends reshaping our industry. Eco-certified properties are no longer niche but necessary, with major operators prioritising this. The premium/luxury segments continue to expand, particularly with branded residences attracting both domestic and international guests.

The premium and experiential hotel segments present compelling opportunities. Properties offering immersive experiences command premium rates as travellers increasingly value authenticity over standardisation. We’re also seeing strong performance in market mix diversity, where segments combine to offset the ups and downs of current economic and global conditions.

After subdued transaction activity in 2024 ($1.25 billion in transactions to October), we anticipate increased momentum in 2025 as interest rates plateau. While construction costs have tempered new developments, this has heightened the value of existing assets, particularly in supply-constrained markets. In addition, developers are also sourcing creative ways to deliver economically viable hotel projects.

Introducing 60 new international flight routes enhances Australia’s connectivity to key Asian markets, North America, and Europe, further strengthening investment fundamentals for strategically positioned assets.

For Trilogy Hotels, we are excited and optimistic about the future. We remain focused on markets demonstrating strong performance outcomes for owners while selectively exploring opportunities in emerging destinations where we can leverage these evolving consumer preferences and travel patterns.",https://www.hotelmanagement.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Novotel-Sydney-Parramatta-hm.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 01:00:35.467697

The potentially contaminated products were distributed nationwide and also shipped to the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.
Symptoms may appear anywhere from a few hours to two months after consuming contaminated food and can include fever, muscle aches, headaches, and gastrointestinal distress.
While no adverse reactions have been linked to the recalled products, FSIS is encouraging anyone concerned about potential illness to seek medical attention.
This recall adds to growing concern over food safety after reports showed a spike in U.S. food recalls and hospitalizations linked to contaminated products in 2024.","Kraft Heinz has issued a massive recall of more than 367,000 pounds of Oscar Mayer turkey bacon over fears of Listeria contamination—a serious foodborne threat that can lead to hospitalization and even death.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), the fully cooked turkey bacon was produced between April 24 and June 11, 2025. The potentially contaminated products were distributed nationwide and also shipped to the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

The affected items include:

12-oz. vacuum-sealed packages with UPC ""071871548601,"" dated between July 18 and August 2 with lot code “RS40”

36-oz. packages (three 12-oz. packs) with UPC “071871548748,” dated July 23 to September 4 and lot codes “RS19,” “RS40,” or “RS42”

48-oz. packages (four 12-oz. packs) with UPC ""071871548793,” dated July 18 to September 4 and lot codes ""RS19,"" ""RS40,"" or ""RS42""

No illnesses have been reported to date, but FSIS warned that the products could still be sitting in home refrigerators or freezers. Consumers are urged not to eat the recalled turkey bacon and to either throw it away or return it to the store where it was purchased.

Listeria monocytogenes, the contaminant in question, is a resilient bacteria that can grow even at refrigerated temperatures.

Infections can cause serious illness, particularly for pregnant women, newborns, seniors, and those with weakened immune systems. Symptoms may appear anywhere from a few hours to two months after consuming contaminated food and can include fever, muscle aches, headaches, and gastrointestinal distress.

The contamination was discovered through routine internal testing by Kraft Heinz. While no adverse reactions have been linked to the recalled products, FSIS is encouraging anyone concerned about potential illness to seek medical attention.

This recall adds to growing concern over food safety after reports showed a spike in U.S. food recalls and hospitalizations linked to contaminated products in 2024. It also places renewed pressure on major brands like Kraft Heinz to strengthen safety protocols and maintain public trust as consumer scrutiny over labeling and contamination risks intensifies.",https://www.mensjournal.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjE2MTgzMDU5NDMzNjYxODA3/kraft-heinz-reportedly-considers-sale-of-oscar-mayer.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 01:00:40.442236

The U.S. is home to the biggest tech firms in the world, such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Apple.
Harry Stebbings Founder of 20VC Seven founders and VCs shared why they're resisting the 996 push with CNBC Make It at the time.
But European startups are struggling to access funding at the growth stage.
Harry Stebbings Founder of 20VC Husmus' Wernér said that the right level of capital is needed for European startups to work intensely without breaking themselves.","Venture capitalist Harry Stebbings faced a wave of backlash in June after urging European startup founders to increase their work hours — but he now admits there's some room for nuance when applying his mantra.

Stebbings, founder of 20VC, a firm managing $650 million in funds, advised founders on LinkedIn last month that ""7 days a week is the required velocity to win right now,"" to compete with startups in Silicon Valley and China.

The post went viral, to Stebbings' surprise, and sparked a debate on whether China's brutal ""996"" work culture — which means working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week — is needed in Europe.

The conversation is rooted in a persistent stereotype that Europe's tech and startup scene is lagging behind the U.S. and China, which have produced trillion-dollar tech giants and are known for implementing long working hours.

The U.S. is home to the biggest tech firms in the world, such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Apple. China meanwhile houses giants like Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent.

""If you want to be a $10 billion company in Europe, competing against them [Silicon Valley and China], you can't do it on a nine-to-five, Monday to Friday.""

Harry Stebbings

Founder of 20VC

Seven founders and VCs shared why they're resisting the 996 push with CNBC Make It at the time.

""What Europe really needs isn't more hustle-porn, it's more aggressive funding,"" Sarah Wernér, co-founder of Husmus, said back then.

Speaking to CNBC Make It about the fallout, Stebbings said that he wasn't prepared for the criticism he received, and that his original post didn't apply to the vast majority of people who responded.

""I think it's everything that's wrong with Europe, that backlash,"" Stebbings said. ""We are fighting against companies being built in Silicon Valley, and speed and the ability to move fast, really determines success, in AI especially.""

He added: ""When you go to the Valley now, and when you go to China now, they are working seven days a week in the fastest-growing companies. It's that simple. So, if you want to be a $10 billion company in Europe, competing against them, you can't do it on a nine-to-five, Monday to Friday.""

'We should be working harder than ever'

As companies build more important products, Stebbings said the bar is higher than it used to be.

""We should be working harder than ever because we're working to solve more important problems than ever,"" he said.

But European startups are struggling to access funding at the growth stage. Atomico's State of European Tech report of 2024 showed that, since 2015, Europe's tech startups have missed out on nearly $375 billion in growth-stage funding, with founders losing out on a potential $300 billion in European investments.

""There is nuance. I'm not saying miss dinner with friends or family or just sit at your desk all day.""

Harry Stebbings

Founder of 20VC

Husmus' Wernér said that the right level of capital is needed for European startups to work intensely without breaking themselves. ""If a team of 10 is burning out to keep up with a 50-person U.S. VC or Chinese government-backed startup, the problem isn't their stamina, it's their cap table.""

However, Stebbings pinned this down to poor marketing and said Europeans aren't great fundraisers compared to their American counterparts. ""I don't think it's a lack of access to cash at all, and in terms of the work ethic there, if you think that you can build a $10 billion business and work five days a week, then I'm sorry to say, you're deluding yourself.""

Some founders have even been ""badly"" advised to include exit slides in their pitches, he added. ""That makes me feel sick, like I'm planning my divorce when I get married.""

In stark contrast, Americans are much better at telling exciting stories when they promote their businesses. ""I think, often in the U.K., we downsize in ambitions.""

996 is 'ignorant'

Ultimately, Stebbings admitted that he jokes with the ""marketing facade"" of 996, but that it's a more nuanced picture than working all the time.

""I think that's [996] very ignorant to do,"" he said. ""if you don't allow people breaks in there and a gym workout, it's just moronic.""

Stebbings said that 100% dedication is essential in the first five years — but that doesn't mean abandoning health, wellness, and family.

""There is nuance. I'm not saying miss dinner with friends or family or just sit at your desk all day, and I'm some horrible person, absolutely not. It's really important to turn off and have a couple of hours away from your computer and just be with friends.""

Stebbings himself tries to spend as much time as possible with his sickly mother, who has multiple sclerosis (MS), including walking a marathon with her every Sunday. He jumps straight back to work after.

But it's unrealistic to expect employees to adopt the same attitude, he acknowledged.

""One of the hardest things about running a company is you will never find someone who cares about it as much as you do, the founder… I think it's unreasonable to ever expect that they will work as hard as you.""

Suranga Chandratillake, general partner at Balderton Capital, previously told CNBC Make It in June that the focus on hustle culture in the tech industry is about ""a fetishization of overwork rather than smart work…it's a myth.""

He said: ""California is very good at telling stories, and there's a lot of mythmaking around the concept of what startups look like.""

Stebbings now agrees with this view and said hustle culture is ""over-glamorized"" in the States.

""If you go into a WeWork in San Francisco at 7 p.m., they're not all working like we see on social media... they overly pronounce it when it's not really true, but for the 0.01% in the Valley, it's so true, and they are there and working harder than ever.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108166954-1751461509661-2024_10_02HARRYSTEBBINGS7781_4.png?v=1751899126&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-07-08 23:58:59.567023

TL;DR: Key points with love ❤️

Senior lenders to Hudson’s Bay Co. (HBC), led by ReStore Capital LLC, have filed a motion in Ontario Superior Court seeking to terminate a deal to sell up to 28 store leases to B.C. billionaire Weihong (Ruby) Liu. They argue the deal is unlikely to succeed due to landlord opposition and is wasting cash that should repay creditors. The lenders also seek a ""super monitor"" or receiver to manage HBC's wind-down, alleging mismanagement and unnecessary spending that has expanded their projected collateral shortfall.

What: Senior lenders to Hudson’s Bay Co. (HBC) filed a motion to terminate a deal to sell store leases to Weihong (Ruby) Liu and to appoint a ""super monitor"" or receiver for HBC's wind-down.

When: Tuesday (July 8, 2025) - Motion filed. Last December (2024) - ReStore closed $151-million loan with HBC. March 7 (2025) - HBC filed for court protection. Last month (June 2025) - HBC closed all locations. Late May (2025) - HBC struck deal with Weihong Liu. Between June 30 and Aug. 15 (2025) - Projected rent payments. Next week - Expected court hearing.

Where: Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Canada.

Why: Lenders argue the lease deal is unlikely to succeed due to landlord opposition and is wasting cash, and that HBC has mismanaged its wind-down, to the detriment of creditors.

How: ReStore Capital LLC, as agent for a syndicate of senior lenders, filed a motion in court seeking termination of the lease deal and expanded powers for the court-appointed monitor or the appointment of a receiver.

Senior lenders to Hudson’s Bay Co. (HBC), led by ReStore Capital LLC, have filed a motion in Ontario Superior Court seeking to terminate a deal to sell up to 28 store leases to B.C. billionaire Weihong (Ruby) Liu. They argue the deal is unlikely to succeed due to landlord opposition and is wasting cash that should repay creditors. The lenders also seek a ""super monitor"" or receiver to manage HBC's wind-down, alleging mismanagement and unnecessary spending that has expanded their projected collateral shortfall.",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/ZHPVWIQGLVF2ZCUEPBG7VKYC4M.JPG?auth=655f03de5b804a3fab0112d4463c9b4decb12b3e90a5e43355837d121e9e5e61&width=1200&quality=80,N,,2025-07-08 21:59:23.122227

The 10-person study, where patients were observed inpatient for four days and for a week after device removal, met safety and performance endpoints.

CEO Paul Goode said in an interview that the goal of the study was to show that the device and the procedure to implant it were safe.

No serious adverse events were reported during the study. For accuracy, the results showed a mean absolute relative difference of 7.7%, which would make the device competitive with CGMs on the market, although Goode cautioned that the data is very early and the results were not statistically significant. MARD is a measurement that compares blood glucose readings from a CGM to reference measurements, such as blood glucose from a fingerstick.

Glucotrack is taking an implantable device approach to address some of the challenges that people experience with wearable CGMs, Goode said, such as the lag time in readings when blood glucose changes quickly and irritation from adhesives.

“If you look at CGMs, they're wonderful products. Many of us in the company have worked on one or more of those generations of products, and they've done a lot of good for patients with diabetes,” said Goode, who has worked for Dexcom and MiniMed, the diabetes tech business that was later acquired by Medtronic. “That being said, there are still common problems.”

Most continuous glucose monitors on the market today are worn on the skin and measure the concentration of glucose in the interstitial fluid surrounding cells, which is then used to calculate blood glucose values. Glucotrack’s device is different in that it is implanted in the subclavian vein near the collarbone and measures glucose values directly from the blood. Goode said the approach to implantation is similar to a minimally invasive procedure for placing a pacemaker — the CGM is placed two inches into the vein instead of into the heart.

Glucotrack intends for its sensor to last for three years, although it will still need to prove that out in a study.

Senseonics, which currently has the only implantable CGM on the U.S. market, received Food and Drug Administration clearance last year for the device to be worn for a year. Goode said the development is good for patients, adding that he expects Glucotrack’s implant to last longer because of differences in the devices’ placement and chemistry.

Senseonics’ device sits in the upper arm, in the subcutaneous space, “which is the most difficult environment to get something to work,” Goode said, while Glucotrack’s device sits in the bloodstream.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/V_wQW40bpYCa9RLw584LKY1pLw67ElJcAVnaUG1sD1U/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HbHVjb3RyYWNrX2ltcGxhbnQuanBn.webp,N,,2025-07-08 21:03:53.431193

Creditcorp Expands Inventory Finance to Informal Workers

Emmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo in Umuahia

In a bid to avail the informal sector operators of its services, the Nigerian Consumer Credit Corporation(CREDICORP) has entered into partnership with Sytiamo Technologies to provide affordable credit to 10,000 market women across Nigeria.

The beneficiaries would be spread across 224 markets selected in 28 states with Ariaria International Market, Aba as the starting point.

At the inauguration of the initiative at Aba, the Managing Director of CREDICORP, Mr. Uzoma Nwagba said that it was aimed at expanding financial access to informal sector workers, especially women, who are major drivers of local economies.

“Supporting women with credit is not just a social good; it’s good business,” he said.

Represented by the Executive Director, Credit and Portfolio Management, Mrs Aisha Abdullahi, Nwagba stated that the affordable loans would boost the quality of life and financial inclusion.

He explained the preponderance or women beneficiaries, saying that “women are proven to be better custodians of credit, with higher repayment rates than men”.

“With 66.7% of our executive team and 50% of our management being women, this partnership aligns with our belief that empowering women leads to stronger, more sustainable communities,” he added.

The Managing Director of Sytiamo Technologies, Mr. Michael Ogbaa, explained the rationale for the partnership with CREDICORP, saying that it is the vehicle for delivering affordable credits to market women.

“Through the partnership, we are giving market women quick access to the capital they need to scale up their businesses and improve their livelihoods,” he said.",https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/AXAMansard.png,N,,2025-07-08 21:03:20.653324

As tariffs on imports from China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh soar—reaching 69.1%, 20-40%, and 35% respectively—retailers are scrambling to adapt. For companies like Nike (NKE), Ralph Lauren (RL), and Tapestry (TPR), the challenge is twofold: mitigate costs amid spiraling tariffs and preserve margins while competing in a price-sensitive market. This article dissects how these firms are faring, why geographic diversification and pricing power matter, and which stocks investors should prioritize.

The Tariff Tsunami: A Sector Under Siege

The Trump-era tariff regime has reshaped the apparel landscape. China's apparel exports to the U.S. fell 52% year-over-year in May 看不出. Vietnam's tariffs, initially set at 46%, were reduced to 20% after negotiations, while Bangladesh's 35% rate now sits atop existing baseline duties. These shifts have forced retailers to rethink sourcing, production, and pricing.

The stakes are high: U.S. apparel imports from China hit a historic low of 9.9% of market share in 2025, while Vietnam and Bangladesh's roles expanded—but not without costs. For companies reliant on Asian manufacturing, the path to resilience hinges on two pillars: geographic diversification and premium pricing power.

Nike: Pioneering Diversification, Testing Margin Limits

Exposure:

Nike sources 50% of footwear and 28% of apparel from Vietnam, with 18% footwear and 16% apparel from China. The company's $1 billion annual tariff bill underscores the urgency to shift production.

Strategy:

- Supply Chain Shifts: Nike aims to reduce Chinese footwear imports to the “high single-digit range” by 2026, while expanding into Indonesia and Cambodia. It's also exploring Africa, Central America, and Eastern Europe to avoid overconcentration in Southeast Asia.

- Pricing Power:

- Raised U.S. prices, particularly on premium products like Air Jordan sneakers (up to $10 increases).

- Focused on high-margin performance footwear (running, training) over less profitable classics like the Air Force 1.

Risk:

Despite these moves, tariffs outpace mitigation efforts, squeezing margins. Vietnam's labor strikes and infrastructure bottlenecks—echoes of pandemic-era disruptions—add volatility.

Ralph Lauren: The Agile Luxury Play

Exposure:

Ralph Lauren sources 19% of goods from Vietnam and 15% from China, with production spread across five continents. No single region exceeds 20% of its supply chain.

Strategy:

- Geographic Flexibility: Collaborates with global suppliers to reallocate production to low-cost regions while maintaining quality. Expanded facilities in Cambodia and Vietnam reduce China dependency.

- Pricing & Technology:

- Targets less price-sensitive customers, enabling selective price hikes and discount reductions.

- Leverages AI for inventory optimization, reducing waste and aligning production with demand.

Edge:

Ralph Lauren's diversification and tech-driven agility make it a standout. CFO Justin Picicci's emphasis on “real-time supply chain adjustments” positions the firm to weather tariff shocks better than peers.

Tapestry: Quiet Strength in Margin Expansion

Exposure:

70% of Tapestry's production comes from Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines. The company has exited China but faces lingering tariff pressures on Asian imports.

Strategy:

- Operational Efficiency:

- Achieved a 280 basis point gross margin expansion in Q2 2025 via operational outperformance (+260 bps) and lower freight costs (+20 bps).

- The Coach brand's premium focus (e.g., higher Average Unit Retail for handbags) drives profitability.

- Tariff Mitigation:

- Anticipated a 10% China tariff as “immaterial,” suggesting supply chain adjustments (e.g., shifting production to tariff-friendly regions) and cost controls neutralize impacts.

Wild Card:

While Tapestry's financials are strong, its reliance on Southeast Asia mirrors Nike's risks. However, its luxury tilt (Coach, Kate Spade) grants pricing flexibility absent in mass-market peers.

Investment Thesis: Overweight Premium, Diversified Players

The tariff landscape favors firms with two traits:

1. Geographic Flexibility: Diversification beyond Vietnam and China (e.g., Nike's forays into Indonesia and Ralph Lauren's global supplier network) reduces overexposure.

2. Pricing Power: Luxury brands like Ralph Lauren and Tapestry's Coach division can pass costs to consumers without losing demand.

Avoid:

- Companies with heavy China reliance or low-margin product lines.

- Firms lacking agility (e.g., overreliance on transshipped goods or inflexible supply chains).

Conclusion: Bet on the Agiles and the Luxe

The apparel sector's winners will be those that turn tariffs into opportunities. Nike's bold diversification and premium pricing, Ralph Lauren's tech-driven adaptability, and Tapestry's margin resilience position them as top picks. Investors should overweight these names while staying cautious on companies lacking both geographic flexibility and pricing leverage.",,N,,2025-07-08 23:59:02.826714

Mozee’s road-legal, 12-passenger electric vehicles aim to close the first- and last-mile transit gap that’s dogged dense urban zones for decades.

Now, the Arlington-based mobility pioneer has partnered with Dallas-based 46 Labs—a 13-year-old global business communications firm that calls itself “the carrier’s carrier”—to provide the backbone that keeps its driverless shuttles connected in real time.

Founded in 2012, 46 Labs operates the Peeredge Orchestration Platform, which handles daily voice and messaging traffic for hundreds of global carriers and Fortune 500 companies. Its infrastructure helps large operators manage multi-vendor networks and maintain service reliability at scale.

46 Labs’ system can track each Mozee shuttle like a separate mobile point, giving the startup real-time visibility as it scales up its mobility operations, according to the announcement. The network could also allow the vehicles to double as roaming hotspots during major events, the companies said.

Modular mobility, assembled in Arlington

Mozee’s AI-powered approach to what it calls “modular agile transit” uses self-driving electric shuttles and real-time route adjustments. The fleet, with vehicles that can travel up to 45 miles per hour, can flex to different needs, so cities, campuses, airports, and venues can adapt to shifting crowds and conditions.

The company said it wants to help cities move beyond the “transportation trap” and rethink how people connect.

“Cities are asking the wrong question,” Mozee wrote in a recent post. “Instead of ‘How do we improve mass transit?’ they should be asking: ‘If 20th-century transit no longer works, how will cities move people in the 21st century?’”

Founded in 2021, Mozee announced its headquarters move from Dallas to Arlington last year, which includes plans for a final assembly plant. The 87,000-square-foot facility is intended to serve as an advanced manufacturing site using 3D printing for some parts before final assembly. The city backed the move with up to $4 million in incentives, and Mozee has pledged more than 100 new jobs with average salaries around $100,000.

Mozee’s first major test bed is Arlington’s Entertainment District, with crowds from Cowboys and Rangers games, concerts, IndyCar races, and, soon, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

“The Entertainment District, with its frequent, high-volume events, offers a real-world setting to demonstrate the convenience and efficiency of our autonomous vehicles,” co-founder Hoyt Fuller told UTA’s The Shorthorn last year. He also noted that Mozee was exploring a potential pilot partnership with UTA focused on V2X, or Vehicle-to-Everything technology.

Networking for scale

Reliable, secure connectivity will be key as Mozee expands its fleet in real-world settings, according to the companies.

“Mozee is reimagining what it means to move through modern cities, and we’re proud to deliver the network foundation that keeps their vehicles connected,” 46 Labs CEO Trevor Francis said in the partnership announcement.

“As mobility continues to evolve, partnerships like this highlight the growing need for reliable infrastructure—built not only for scalability, but to help reshape legacy systems with flexible, future-ready innovation.”

Mozee Co-Founder and CEO Shawn Taikratoke said the partnership helps the company “lead the shift toward smarter, more human-centered mobility.”

The dedicated communications backbone is designed to minimize risk and keep the system running even during broader outages.

“This partnership helps us deliver the power of modular agile transit to meet today’s transit challenges,” Taikratoke said. “We’re proud to find a partner who moves at our speed to ensure our autonomous system remains responsive, secure, and adaptable in a dynamic operating environment.”

For both companies, it’s an example of local tech talent building real-world solutions close to home, with larger ambitions on the horizon.

“As two fast-growing DFW companies, we’re excited to partner to shape the future of mobility right here in North Texas—and scale it globally,” Mozee wrote on LinkedIn.

Current Health, known for its remote patient monitoring platform, was acquired by Best Buy in 2021 as part of an effort to expand into the healthcare sector. The platform uses wearable devices and data analytics to track patients’ health metrics and facilitate virtual care. Best Buy’s decision to divest from Current Health signals a potential reevaluation of its priorities within the competitive health tech market. Industry observers are closely watching how this move will impact Current Health’s operations and whether it will continue to innovate under new ownership.

Once a cornerstone of American banking, Wells Fargo has navigated dramatic highs and lows over its nearly 170-year history. Today, under the unwavering stewardship of CEO Charles Scharf, the $1.93 trillion-asset institution is not just rebuilding trust; it's meticulously modernizing its operations and aggressively refocusing on its core financial services to reclaim its formidable position in the industry.

Charles Scharf's Path to the Helm: The ""Chainsaw Charlie"" Era

Charles Scharf arrived at Wells Fargo in September 2019 with an urgent mandate: to meticulously repair a bank profoundly bruised by scandal. A Harvard College graduate with an MBA from NYU Stern, Scharf forged his executive acumen during pivotal stints at Visa – where he served as CEO from 2012 to 2016 – and at BNY Mellon. His reputation for disciplined cost-cutting, strategic restructuring, and rigorous risk management made him the compelling choice to lead the turnaround after the infamous cross-selling scandal, which had already seen two prior CEOs depart.

Within months, Scharf earned the evocative moniker “Chainsaw Charlie” for his decisive actions, which included eliminating underperforming units and aggressively slashing discretionary spending. This wasn't merely about cutting costs; it was about surgical precision to streamline operations and reallocate resources where they could be most effective. By the end of 2024, the bank’s board unequivocally signaled their confidence, rewarding his efforts with a $31.2 million compensation package – a 7.6 percent increase on the prior year – comprised of a $2.5 million base salary, a $7.2 million cash bonus, and $21.5 million in long-term equity awards. This substantial package underscored the perceived value of his transformative, albeit sometimes challenging, leadership.

Rebuilding Trust and Modernizing Infrastructure: A Cultural Overhaul

Scharf immediately prioritized a fundamental overhaul of core systems and a radical strengthening of internal controls – efforts directly necessitated by the bank’s devastating 2016 fake-accounts scandal. That episode, where employees secretly opened millions of unauthorized customer accounts to meet aggressive sales targets, led to over $3 billion in fines and, critically, a unique seven-year asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve.

Under Scharf, Wells Fargo has poured significant investment into its risk and compliance teams, onboarding thousands of new professionals. They have deployed sophisticated fraud-detection software and, most crucially, meticulously rebuilt its entire sales culture. This monumental shift moved away from purely product-sales metrics towards genuinely rewarding positive customer outcomes. While such sweeping changes inevitably present challenges to employee morale and can feel disruptive, the strategic intent has been to instill a deep-rooted culture of ethical conduct and accountability from the top down. Branch renovations, emphasizing collaborative spaces and digital integration, further signal a tangible commitment to a more customer-centric future.

Core Financial Services: A Strategic Recalibration

Wells Fargo steadfastly remains one of the ""Big Four"" U.S. banks alongside JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup. Its primary lines of business continue to generate significant revenue, though a strategic recalibration is underway:

Consumer Banking and Lending: With over 4,100 branches and 13,000 ATMs, this segment remains a cornerstone, serving retail customers with checking, savings, mortgages, and auto loans. While previously a mortgage powerhouse, Wells Fargo is deliberately de-emphasizing home-loan origination in favor of more fee-based businesses, focusing lending more on existing, deep-rooted client relationships.

Wealth and Investment Management: Through Wells Fargo Advisors and Wealth & Investment Management, this segment provides critical financial planning, brokerage services, and trust administration. This capital-light, fee-generating business has been a key focus during the asset cap period and is poised for continued growth.

Commercial Banking: Corporate clients rely on Wells Fargo for comprehensive Treasury management, asset-based lending, and equipment financing. This area is a prime target for expanded deposit-taking and lending now that growth restrictions are lifted.

Wholesale and Investment Banking (Wells Fargo Securities): This division offers underwriting, M&A advisory, and debt capital markets solutions. Having been constrained by the asset cap, this segment is now positioned for significant expansion.

In 2024, the firm reported a robust $82.3 billion in revenue and $19.7 billion in net income, powerfully underscoring a decisive return to profitability and operational stability after years of stifling regulatory constraints. The strong growth in investment banking fees and wealth management income reflects Scharf's strategic pivot towards higher-margin, fee-based businesses.

Turning the Page on Asset Restrictions: A New Growth Trajectory

In a pivotal development in June 2025, the Federal Reserve officially lifted its asset cap, a resounding signal of confidence in Wells Fargo’s extensive reforms and transformed governance. This removal marks the culmination of a painstaking journey and liberates the bank to pursue new growth avenues.

With this significant barrier dissolved, Wells Fargo is now strategically poised to:

Aggressively expand commercial deposits: Attracting new corporate clients and leveraging its vast nationwide footprint.

Reinforce Trading & Capital Markets: Scaling up fixed-income and equity trading desks to regain market share and boost fee income.

Increase lending across core segments: While home lending shifts, the bank can now grow its loan portfolio more broadly, particularly in commercial and investment banking.

This renewed freedom to grow is expected to enhance competitiveness, optimize its balance sheet, and ultimately drive higher returns for shareholders. Investor reaction has been largely positive, with Wells Fargo's stock experiencing a noticeable uplift following the asset cap removal, as analysts now view the bank as ""more than a remediation story."" However, Scharf has cautioned that the bank remains vigilant, with ongoing regulatory consent orders requiring continued focus on risk management. The road ahead demands a delicate balance: seizing growth opportunities while steadfastly maintaining the rigorous controls painstakingly put in place.

What is Wells Fargo CEO’s salary? In 2024, Charles Scharf’s total compensation was $31.2 million, including base pay, cash bonuses, and long-term equity awards, reflecting the board's confidence in his transformative leadership during the bank's turnaround.

Who is the current CEO of Wells Fargo? The current CEO and President is Charles W. Scharf, appointed in September 2019 and specifically charged with leading the post-scandal transformation and rebuilding trust.

What is Wells Fargo known for? Wells Fargo is best known for its extensive branch network, its diversified financial services—ranging from consumer banking to investment management—and its historic role as a ""Big Four"" U.S. bank, now also for its rigorous journey of regulatory compliance and internal reform.

Why is Wells Fargo in trouble? The bank’s reputation suffered severely after the 2016 cross-selling scandal, where employees opened millions of unauthorized accounts to meet sales targets. This crisis led to billions in fines, significant leadership changes, and a Federal Reserve asset cap that lasted until June 2025, from which Charles Scharf has successfully guided the bank's emergence.

Under Charles Scharf’s leadership, Wells Fargo is balancing the pursuit of robust business growth with the disciplined governance and cultural transformation needed to definitively prevent past mistakes from repeating. As it capitalizes on its newfound regulatory freedom, the bank’s enduring success will hinge on maintaining this crucial equilibrium – a testament to its arduous journey from crisis to renewed potential.",https://www.ceotodaymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ceo.png,N,,2025-07-09 01:00:31.247376

With over a dozen items affected—including electronics, appliances, food, and automotive products—shoppers are urged to review their recent purchases.

Whether it’s a risk of fire, contamination, or mechanical malfunction, here’s a breakdown of the recalled items and what you need to know if you’ve purchased any of them.

Costco Items on Recall

Anker Power Bank (Model A1257)

Anker has voluntarily recalled certain batches of this power bank due to a potential issue with lithium-ion battery cells that could lead to overheating. Although the likelihood of malfunction is low, customers are advised to stop using the device. Affected customers can receive a free replacement by submitting a photo of the unit with specific details, including the model number and the word “recalled” written on the power bank.

Anker PowerCore 10000 (Model A1263)

This power bank is being recalled due to a risk of overheating, which poses a fire hazard. Anker advises customers to immediately stop using the device and check their website for details on how to receive a replacement or refund.

BowFlex Adjustable Dumbbells

Reports have surfaced of weight plates detaching from the handle during use, posing a serious injury risk. Customers should immediately stop using the dumbbells and follow recall procedures for a fix or replacement.

Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires (Size 235/40R19)

This tire model is missing the required Department of Transportation (DOT) certification marking. While the tires meet performance standards, the lack of a DOT stamp could lead to improper use. Customers are advised to return the product.

Fresh and Ready Prepared Sandwiches and Salads

These ready-to-eat items, sold at Costco Business Centers in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Washington, may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria is a serious health risk, especially for pregnant individuals, older adults, and those with compromised immune systems.

Igloo 90 Qt Flip & Tow Rolling Cooler

The tow handle on this cooler may cause fingertip injuries, including pinching, crushing, or even amputation. Use of this product should be discontinued immediately until further notice.

Kirkland Signature Severe Cold & Flu (Item #1729556)

A specific lot (P140082) of this over-the-counter medication may contain foreign material due to a manufacturing issue. Distributed to select stores in the Midwest and Southeast, this product should not be used and can be returned to Costco for a full refund.

Midea U-Shaped Window AC Units

Multiple item numbers are involved in this recall due to water pooling inside the unit, which can lead to mold and potentially cause infections or respiratory problems. If you own one of these units, discontinue use and check if your model is included in the recall.

Michelin Agilis CrossClimate Tires (Size 185/60R15C)

Michelin is recalling this tire model due to a failure to meet federal safety standards for endurance. Sections of tread rubber may detach from the tire shoulder, increasing the risk of an accident. Drivers should stop using these tires and contact Michelin for replacement.

Ninja Foodi Pressure Cooker + Air Fryer

Certain models have been found to allow the pressure lid to open while the unit is still pressurized, potentially causing severe burns. Consumers should avoid using the pressure cooking function until a replacement lid is received.

Segway Ninebot Electric Kickscooter (Item #1567456)

This scooter model may suffer from a folding mechanism failure, which poses a risk of falling. Owners are instructed not to use the scooter until they have received and installed a free repair kit.

Sublue Underwater Scooter

Battery packs in Sublue Mix models manufactured between June 2018 and March 2024 have a risk of overheating and catching fire. Affected models include MIXAW01, MIXAB01, and MIXSB01. A free battery replacement program is in place, and users are advised to stop using the devices immediately.

Topo Chico Mineral Water Glass 18-Pack

Some lots sold in Texas and Louisiana may be contaminated with pseudomonas bacteria, which occur naturally in water but can pose a health risk to individuals with weakened immune systems. Affected customers should not consume the product.

What You Should Do

If you’ve purchased any of these items, check your receipts or order history to confirm. Visit Costco’s official recall page for instructions on how to return or replace affected products. In most cases, you’ll receive a full refund or free replacement. Taking quick action can help prevent safety issues for you and your household.

Publicis Groupe’s ambitions were clinical and clear during the Cannes Lions festival last month where it launched an all-out challenge to TV’s untouchable – the Super Bowl.

The French marketing services group, which is outperforming its global holding company peers in the equity markets, launched a real-time campaign during the Cannes Lions challenging the Super Bowl by showing it can build the audience reach of one $8m Superbowl TV ad – with 127 million viewers – in a 24 hour window for somewhere between 5-25 per cent of the cost using influencers and creators.

The holdco has outlaid an estimated $650m in the past 12 months acquiring creator-influencer platforms - Captiv8 and Influencer – which it is wiring up to its consumer identity and targeting engine, CoreID, housed in data unit Epsilon, which it acquired in 2019 for upwards of $4bn. Publicis Group also acquired Australian-founded global retail media ad platform, Citrus Ad, in 2021 for $205m and locally it paid an estimated $30-40m for independent media agency Atomic 212° last December, announcing the deal the following month.

Next on Publicis' agenda to build out its legacy media eating audience ecosystem and compete with the global tech-media giants, which dominated the sprawling beachfront showcase instalments in Cannes last month, is gaming.

Big names and games

Zenith ANZ CEO Jason Tonelli told a breakfast briefing in Cannes last month, put on by iion, a specialist programmatic gaming adtech player. The firm houses tier one titles such as Call of Duty, Minecraft, Fortnite, FIFA and GTA – used by brands like L’Oreal, KFC, Lego, Samsung, Ikea and Coca-Cola to target the 1.4bn global gamers on iion’s “unified” platform.

Advertisers have jumped into the tech-media platforms because of their enormous scale and ability to allow easy access and targeting of their users, who leave an abundant trail of personal data captured and monetised by the global players. Gaming, however, has been sidelined for a decade despite a huge, highly-engaged user base.

Community and connections

Citing Zenith’s Australian single source consumer research panel, Tonelli said 78 per cent of gamers were playing every week, 28 per cent daily. “When you think about that from an Australian perspective, 56 per cent of Australians are watching television every day, so you're starting to see where this reach shift is starting to play,"" Tonelli said. “It's a lean-in environment, and we're all advocates for the gaming industry here. You're not leaning back. You're engaged in it. So there's connection and community – all those things are really important when you think about community, when you think about fandom, when you think about engagement, and when you think about attention – gaming delivers that. So now, with some data behind it, it's got scale.”

Unified programmatic games

“We’ve been talking about insurance here [at the Cannes session], we've got insurance clients too. When I start to think about insurance, where are young people? 18-24 year-olds for health insurance, car insurance etc, where are they going? They're going to social right now to be educated about insurance, they are not going to their parents like we did. And in social they’re using influencers or ChatGPT. But there's a wonderful opportunity if you think creatively about gaming and how health insurance plays a role. So what we need to do is be creative about how that solves problems for the consumer that's using those things.”

Tonelli said iion was the first time a programmatic platform had properly unified the disparate gaming sector to launch campaigns across multiple publishers with the IAB measurement standards in viewability and attention – iion, for instance, incorporates attention metrics from Amplified Intelligence in its reporting.

Publicis as a platform

Gaming, per Tonelli, is emerging as another channel alongside creators and influencers that Publicis Groupe has identified as major audience reach alternatives to TV and legacy media.

“It's quite interesting. I think when you start to consider some of our strategic acquisitions … when you think about Influential, Captiv8 and Epsilon, you start to see how we're helping our clients really build reach, build scale, and really think about identity as a solution,” Tonelli said.

“Some of the big conversations you're getting out of Cannes at the moment are really around experiences and engagement as well as efficiencies. And when you start to put those things together, I think influencers and gaming have a massive role in delivering those three things.""

Building out those platforms affords holdco agencies a greater degree of protection from their platform rivals now openly telling brands they can hand over budgets and outcomes and let their algorithms do the rest.

Some ex-holdco global execs think becoming platforms in their own right is perhaps the major networks' only hope of long-term survival. Dave Gaines, a former GroupM and WPP global exec turned founder at independent agency Media by Mother, holds that view.,

“49 per cent of the money in the [advertising] world goes to Alphabet, Meta and Amazon. Those companies are technology and data operations, and they own all of their media inventory,” said Gaines.

“All of the big holding companies are effectively trying to replicate that model. They're just trying to mirror those three large companies in order that they can compete and big clients, certainly in the US when you pitch, they come looking for those kind of things ... Alphabet, Meta and Amazon have reshaped the way that media is delivered.""",http://www.mi-3.com.au/sites/default/files/2025-07/Jason%20Tonelli%20-%20Lead%20Image%204.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 19:08:23.478222

A NEW HORIZON: Monument Advocacy is merging with Horizon Government Affairs, gaining a major boost in health care lobbying firepower in the firm’s first big private equity-fueled acquisition.

— Horizon pulled in $1.7 million in lobbying revenues last year for work on behalf of clients including PhRMA and McKesson as well as industry coalitions including the Health Innovation Alliance. Horizon and its staff will be folded into Monument, which brought in $14.5 million in lobbying fees last year from clients including Amazon, Starbucks, Waymo, Netflix, Albertsons, Alaska Airlines, Zillow and the Consumer Brands Association.

— The merger will give the combined firm a larger platform with which it can capitalize on the growing overlap between the tech and health care sectors on issues like cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, John Murray, Monument’s chief executive, said in an interview.

— “For me, in terms of our strategy at Monument, health care has always been number one on my list” of acquisition targets, he added. “It’s an important part of the business, and there’s so much opportunity to cross-pollinate with our tech practice and our public affairs practice in particular.”

— That’s especially true now, with sweeping change coming to the sector as part of Republicans’ megabill, which is now law. “All of the health care pieces that are in the reconciliation bill now have to be implemented,” said Murray. “There’s a long road still to make tweaks and advocate on behalf of clients who want to continue to be a part of that process.”

— The combined firm will also be well-positioned to work on issues related to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement by drawing on Monument’s active food and agriculture practice and Horizon’s health expertise. “We see that as a huge opportunity,” Murray told PI.

— Murray called the Horizon merger the “first piece of a multi-pronged business strategy” powered by an investment last year from Boston-based Everlane Equity Partners. For Monument’s next expansion, Murray said the firm is eyeing a presence in California, New York, Texas and Florida in addition to more financial services capabilities in D.C.

BUSTOS LOBBYING FOR OPENAI: Former Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) has registered to lobby for OpenAI as the ChatGPT maker continues to grow its lobbying footprint. Bustos, who’s now a partner at Mercury Public Affairs, began lobbying for the AI giant back in May on issues related to AI policy, along with her son Nick Bustos, who’s also at Mercury, according to a disclosure filing.

— OpenAI has quickly ramped up its advocacy operations in Washington, where the firm dropped more than $1.7 million on lobbying last year. OpenAI retains three other outside firms — Miller Strategies, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and DLA Piper — in addition to its team of in-house lobbyists, but Bustos is the only former member of Congress currently lobbying for the company as it presses for a light-handed approach to regulating AI.

FIRST IN PI — FETTERMAN CHIEF HANGS A SHINGLE: Krysta Juris, who most recently served as chief of staff to Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), has returned to K Street to launch Two Lights Strategies, a government relations and public affairs firm.

— Juris spent nearly a decade working for the late Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid before joining the lobbying firm Subject Matter (now Avoq). She then moved over to public policy roles at Meta and Stripe before heading back to the Hill in 2023 to serve as deputy chief of staff and then chief of staff to Fetterman.

— Juris said in an email that she struck out on her own for a “more focused, hands-on approach” to advocacy. “Starting my own firm allows me to work closely with a smaller group of clients across sectors and bring the full weight of my experience to each engagement,” she wrote.

LEADERSHIP SHAKEUP AT AVOQ: Nicole Cornish is stepping down as chief executive of Avoq after eight years with the lobbying and public affairs firm, per PRovoke Media’s Paul Holmes. During Cornish’s tenure as CEO, the firm (then Subject Matter) scored an investment from Los Angeles-based private equity firm Coral Tree Partners, which enabled its acquisition of the PR shop Kivvit a year later. The merged firm rebranded as Avoq not long after.

— Cornish, who will step down at the end of the year, plans to “remain on the board and actively support a seamless leadership transition and continue to provide ongoing strategic guidance as the firm moves forward,” according to the firm.

FLYING IN: Nearly three dozen retailers are in town today for the National Retail Federation’s latest fly-in on tariff issues. The delegation was set to meet with around 60 offices on the Hill in addition to meeting with majority and minority staff for the House Small Business Committee and Senate Finance Committee, senior officials at the Treasury Department and representatives from the Small Business Administration.

— This is NRF’s fourth fly-in in as many months focused on illustrating the impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs — to say nothing of the uncertainty caused by the administration’s constantly shifting goalposts and deadlines — on the retail industry.

SPEAK NOW: “The I.R.S. said on Monday that churches and other houses of worship can endorse political candidates to their congregations, carving out an exemption in a decades-old ban on political activity by tax-exempt nonprofits,” The New York Times’ David Farenthold reports.

— The statement, made in a court filing, “seemed to formalize what already seemed to be the agency’s unspoken policy,” but it follows a yearslong push by Trump to revoke the so-called Johnson Amendment. “The National Council of Nonprofits, which represents 30,000 such groups, warned that allowing tax-exempt groups to endorse candidates could lead to a future where political groups use nonprofits as a kind of legal disguise,” per the NYT.

— The IRS’ shift is “not about religion or free speech, but about radically altering campaign finance laws,” the council’s president, Diane Yentel, argued in a statement. “The decree could open the floodgates for political operatives to funnel money to their preferred candidates while receiving generous tax breaks at the expense of taxpayers who may not share those views.”

FIRST IN PI II – AUSTIN DODGES SPECIFICS ON CONSULTING FIRM: Former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is defending himself from charges of influence peddling lodged at him by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) but didn’t answer most of their specific questions about his new consulting firm in a response obtained by Daniel.

— He told them in a letter sent on Tuesday that he “will continue to uphold the highest ethical standards” and “will abide by all relevant post-government restrictions and ethics pledges.” He said in the letter that he doesn’t lobby and won’t lobby in the future. During his confirmation process, Austin had pledged to not lobby after his tenure as defense secretary but the senators believe that his new D.C. strategic advisory firm doesn’t live up to the spirit of his promise.

— He didn’t answer whether he would help clients in “making communications [to] or appearances” in front of the Defense Department, whether he would work for foreign governments or entities, whether he’d recuse himself from issues he worked with as defense secretary, which clients he is working for and if they’ve had contracts with the Pentagon, among other questions. “At our firm, we believe that there’s no substitute for integrity, honesty, candor, discretion, and the highest quality of work,” he told Warren and Scott.

— “It’s extremely disappointing that Secretary Austin has undermined the public trust and refused to answer simple questions about his lucrative new role,” Warren said in a statement to PI. “At the very least, Secretary Austin should stop dodging our questions and be transparent with the American people. I will continue fighting to close the revolving door and root out corruption.”

— A spokesperson for Austin declined to comment. A spokesperson for Scott didn’t immediately have a comment on how he planned to try to get the answers he and Warren want.

In the last few months alone, we’ve seen Unilever dedicate half of its ad budget to social channels in an “influencer first” push, Publicis Groupe acquired Captiv8, and WPP created an entire influencer function for L’Oreal.

These shifts in the industry aren’t coincidental. The influencer marketing sector is projected to reach a global market size of $32.55 billion by 2025. Spurred by a seismic change in how consumers interact with media, 92 percent of consumers trust influencer recommendations over traditional advertising, and influencer campaigns led to a 24 percent increase in brand credibility.

As a result of this, brands are finding that micro and nano creators (i.e., those with smaller but highly engaged audiences) are proving particularly effective in creating authentic connections. This allows brands of all sizes to access scalable, credible storytelling. And businesses of all sizes are looking to tap into this channel, earning $6.50 for every $1 spent on influencer marketing, with the top 13 percent earning $20 or more, according to a recent survey by Tomoson. Influencer marketing is proving not only influential but measurably impactful.

AI as a Transformative Force in Campaign Optimization

Artificial intelligence is redefining how brands approach influencer marketing, offering a salve to the industry’s biggest Achilles heel: poor scalability. Typically, influencer programs struggled to keep pace with budgets. Every extra dollar dedicated to influencer budgets meant an extra dollar needed on the headcount to service that budget. Cataloging posts, identifying trends, reporting, managing approvals … every step required human engagement.

Related story: From Influence to Intelligence: The Rise of AI-Driven Creator Commerce

AI solves this issue by analyzing millions of posts in seconds. It can recommend the most effective formats, posting times, caption lengths, and even aesthetic elements tailored to specific audiences. Perhaps most critically, AI enables more advanced performance measurement. Sentiment analysis tools now assess emotional resonance and track shifts in brand perception, offering brands a more nuanced understanding of campaign impact than surface-level metrics alone can provide.

Not All AI is Created Equal

So the answer is simple, use AI right? Not quite. Not all AI models are created equal, and this point is especially pertinent for retailers. AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on. If you’re using ChatGPT or an off-the-shelf equivalent, you’ll just get generic outputs. With retailers relying more heavily on a blend of influencer sizes than other sectors, this tailored information is crucial to ensuring campaign success. Retailers typically have more activations throughout the year than other industries, which adds even more complications. More influencers, used more frequently, to activate more campaigns.

A Move Toward Long-Term Strategic Partnerships

Tied to this is the move from transactional, one-off campaigns to long-term, strategic partnerships. These ongoing relationships help build audience trust through repeated exposure to a consistent brand voice, making the content feel more authentic and less opportunistic. A familiar creator whose brand reinforces the values and message of your own is like gold dust.

Long-term collaborations are often more cost effective, with better rates negotiated across multiple activations. Plus, creators who understand a brand deeply can deliver more informed, compelling content. Strategically, these partnerships allow brands to develop ongoing narrative arcs, using a trusted voice to communicate different aspects of their value over time rather than relying on fragmented, one-off messages from multiple influencers.

As influencer marketing continues to evolve, brands that adopt AI-powered tools, spread their presence across platforms, and cultivate long-term creator partnerships will be best equipped to connect authentically with audiences and adapt to ongoing change in the space.",https://network.napco.com/total-retail/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2022/05/GettyImages-1153698496.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 23:02:02.647038

Those levies range roughly from 25% to 40%.

Here is a breakdown on the potential tariff exposure for U.S. consumer apparel and footwear companies, based on where their manufacturing operations are located.

RALPH LAUREN:

Ralph Lauren produces most of its goods outside the United States, with about 19% from Vietnam and 15% from China, according to an April Raymond James report. The company said in May that supply chain is diversified enough to allow it to deal with supply disruptions.

NIKE:

Nike imported about 43% of its goods into the United States, according to Raymond James. Its sports footwear manufacturing is 50% from Vietnam, 27% from Indonesia, and 18% from China, according to Bernstein analysts. Sports apparel production breaks down as follows: 28% from Vietnam, 16% from China, and 15% from Cambodia. The company in June said it would allocate production differently to try to deal with the tariffs.

SKECHERS:

Skechers sources about 40% of its products from both China and Vietnam, according to Raymond James. The company has been redirecting imports away from China and relocating some production.

CAPRI:

Capri’s Michael Kors line is mostly produced in Asia, while Italy is its primary production source for Jimmy Choo. The company has been expanding production in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Cambodia.

TAPESTRY:

Tapestry’s sources primarily from Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines, which combined represent about 70% of its production, the company noted in its May earnings release.

AMERICAN EAGLE:

American Eagle sources primarily in Asia, Raymond James wrote. The company is reducing its sourcing from China in 2025.

ABERCROMBIE & FITCH:

Abercrombie & Fitch’s sourcing was as follows: 35% from Vietnam, 22% from Cambodia, 12% from India, 7% from China, and 25% “other” in fiscal year 2024, according to Raymond James.

LULULEMON:

Lululemon fabric sourcing is 35% from Taiwan, 28% from China, 11% from South Korea, according to Raymond James analysts. Manufacturing is 40% Vietnam, 17% Cambodia, 11% Sri Lanka, 11% Indonesia, 7% Bangladesh.

WASHINGTON, July 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Allegiant Air pilots represented by Teamsters Local 2118 are raising serious questions about Allegiant's leadership after the company this week sold its failed Sunseeker Resort while continuing to stall contract negotiations for 1,400 union pilots.

The airline claims the sale of its unsuccessful hotel project signals a renewed focus on its core airline operations, but their actions tell a different story.

""Allegiant's executives have wasted billions on failed side hustles while refusing to fairly pay the pilots who actually keep this carrier in the air,"" said Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien. ""Allegiant owes our members over $200 million in hard-earned retention bonuses. The Teamsters demand accountability and a fair contract now from this greedy, corruptible employer.""

Allegiant pilots have been stuck in negotiations for over four years. While others across the airline industry have secured pay increases and improved working conditions in recent years, Allegiant has refused to pay industry standard wages and is asking pilots to make concessions on quality of life and scheduling issues.

Since March 2021, Allegiant's market value has decreased by 78 percent, with a current market cap of $1.3 billion. The company lost $520 million on the sale of its ill-fated Sunseeker Resort, which is equal to over half of the company's current market value. The sale of the South Florida hotel follows a pattern of frivolous spending by the airline. With impractical ventures outside its core airline operations, from sports stadiums to luxury hotels and golf courses, Allegiant has burned millions of dollars on corporate pet projects.

Corporate financial mismanagement has left the company ill-equipped to resolve outstanding contract negotiations for pilots, but the Teamsters continue to call on Allegiant to return to the bargaining table.

""Management at Allegiant has no ability to lead this company. They have no allegiance to the hardworking, dedicated pilots,"" said Greg Unterseher, Teamsters Airline Division Director, Above-the-Wing. ""The Teamsters Union has zero confidence that Allegiant will bargain in good faith, but this company must be held to account.

Test and learn fatigue While Amazon holds a strong foothold in the retail media space — with the likes of Walmart trailing not too far behind — other retail media networks are working to prove their own unique value propositions.","Either RMNs deliver or advertisers pull back spend.

“This year, you’re starting to see more streamlining, more material partnerships start to transpire because [RMNs] understand that having the data alone is not the full story,” said Deanna Mulkeen, head of media investment at Wpromote. The full story, she added, is “data, scaled inventory, reach and eyeballs all through to closed loop measurement.”

Media buyers are focused on total commerce strategies, full-funnel measurement and total transparency in the off-platform push. Amazon may still rule the roost with its data and ad ecosystem, but other players like Walmart and Instacart are working to close the gap, media buyers told Digiday.

Here’s a look at how the retail media landscape is shaping up in the second half of the year:

Amazon and the AMC ‘Holy Grail’

In the retail media network arms race, there seems to be Amazon and then everyone else. According to media buyers, that’s because of the tech giant’s sheer scale, first-party data, and its demand-side platform (DSP) that’s been catching the eye of non-endemic advertisers. More comparisons are being made between Amazon’s DSP to DSPs like Trade Desk or DV360, per Mulkeen.

Amazon Marketing Cloud, however, seems to be “the glue” connecting top and bottom of funnel media, said Damien Bianchi, group media director of retail media and commerce at VML. That full-funnel effect is what retail media networks have been vying for in the push to off-site media, taking RMNs beyond on-clicks and ROAS to deeper, long-term business goals, like household penetration and customer lifetime value, Bianchi added.

“If you’re taking advantage of it correctly, you’ll know exactly what type of Amazon media to serve specific cohorts at very specific times of the year,” he said.

But Walmart and Instacart are still making a play for their share of the full-funnel ad spend and were among the flurry of announcements during Cannes inking partnerships around measurement and off-platform ads.

Blurring budget lines

Internally, brand budget lines are also blurring as retailers push to become full-funnel media channels. Historically, dollars were siloed — either labeled shopper marketing spend or national media spend, per the three media buyers Digiday spoke with for this story. But the type of spend is changing as RMNs expand their capabilities beyond search and display ads on site to encompass video, streaming and social commerce.

It’s less that dollars are being shifted from one budget to another, and more that brands are unifying brand and performance budgets.

“We’re not seeing dollars being pulled out of existing brand building campaigns just yet,” said Anthony Costanzo, chief analytics officer at Mile Marker, an independent media agency.

Off-platform push

Retail media is seemingly hitting its maturation curve. Retailers inked partnerships with streaming services, social media platforms and other third-party partners to extend media capabilities beyond their owned-and-operated channels.

But as much as the space has grown up, buyers say there’s more to go and they’re still left with questions : Who controls access to the inventory? Who controls access to the audiences and delivery of the media strategies? Is the retailer to own that strategy and provide it as a managed service or is the advertiser in control of the off-platform media?

To help get advertisers over the hurdle, retailers are offering incentives, like co-funding (or dollar matching programs) off-platform investments, opportunities to test new ad formats, dedicated resourcing support and, perhaps most importantly, measurement, per Costanzo. The latter is especially true for larger players in the space who have droves of data and insights, he added.

“Measurement is being used as an incentive for a lot of these partnerships, because it’s something that’s in such high demand,” Costanzo said.

Test and learn fatigue

While Amazon holds a strong foothold in the retail media space — with the likes of Walmart trailing not too far behind — other retail media networks are working to prove their own unique value propositions.

Whether advertisers buy into it comes down to sales as the appetite for testing and learning — especially as economic uncertainty looms — is shrinking, said Bianchi.

He added, “If brands are able to effectively create awareness and move product, move SKUs at a very effective rate on the bigger retailers right now, there’s not what I would call a compelling reason to do test and learns on smaller retailers unless there’s some kind of incentive.”

Heading into the second half of the year, retail media’s trajectory is likely one of more investment, but also more scrutiny and pressure to deliver at parity with the broader digital media ecosystem — think Meta and Google.

“This industry loves to talk about measurement, but in reality, there’s so much more sophistication that can be realized,” said Wpromote’s Mulkeen.",https://digiday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/retail-network-digiday_b0a4ee.gif,N,,2025-07-08 19:08:02.140340

In West Virginia, most artificial food dyes will be banned starting in 2028.","(NewsNation) — Major American brands have vowed to remove synthetic food dyes from their products, but M&M’s and Skittles, made by Mars, remain colorful holdouts.

Mars has continued to use synthetic dyes in its candies after backing off a 2016 plan to remove all artificial colors from its food portfolio.

The company reversed course after it found that consumer attitudes varied by country, with Europeans largely opposed to synthetic dyes, while others preferred artificially colored treats, according to the Mars website.

Synthetic dyes have come under fire recently from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who wants them removed from the nation’s food supply over potential health risks.

Some research has linked the dyes to behavioral health issues in children and places like Australia, Canada and the European Union generally have tighter restrictions on their use.

Despite those concerns, synthetic dyes remain widespread, appearing in nearly 1 in 5 packaged foods and beverages on U.S. grocery shelves, according to a recent study.

That study, published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, found that confectionery companies had the most products containing synthetic dyes.

The National Confectioners Association, a candy industry trade group, criticized the study, accusing the authors of having “major gaps in their analysis.” The NCA argued that chocolate and candy differ from other foods because Americans eat them less frequently, only two to three times per week.

Both Skittles and M&M’s list several synthetic dyes on their ingredient labels, including common dyes like Red 40, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6. Mars did not respond to NewsNation’s request for comment on Tuesday.

So far, Kennedy has favored the carrot over the stick, encouraging companies to voluntarily phase out synthetic dyes rather than pushing for major changes in federal regulation. Recent announcements suggest the approach is gaining traction.

Food giants like Kraft Heinz, General Mills, PepsiCo, Nestle and ConAgra have all unveiled plans to move away from artificial colors in their U.S. products. The question is whether they’ll follow through.

Thomas Galligan, principal scientist for food additives at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, has expressed skepticism, noting that many companies have failed to keep similar promises in the past.

“If the FDA were to require warning labels on synthetically dyed foods, similar to the rule in place since 2010 in the European Union, there would be a much stronger incentive for industry to reformulate,” Galligan said in a recent statement.

Several states have taken matters into their own hands, passing legislation restricting synthetic dyes. In West Virginia, most artificial food dyes will be banned starting in 2028. California and Virginia have banned six artificial dyes from school food.

Meanwhile, beginning in 2027, Texas will require warning labels on foods or beverages made with any of more than 40 dyes or additives.

“We follow and will continue to follow regulatory guidance from the authorities in this space because consumer safety is our chief responsibility and priority,” the National Confectioners Association said in an April statement responding to Kennedy’s push to phase out synthetic food dyes.

While several artificial dyes remain, Mars has removed another controversial additive, titanium dioxide, from Skittles.

The chemical, which helps make candy appear shiny, was removed from all Skittles production at the end of last year, the company confirmed to Bloomberg in May. The ingredient was already banned in the European Union in 2022 over possible health risks.

ID18,Elevance Health (Anthem),2025-07-08 21:38:59+00:00,National Health Law Program,"Voluntary Industry Prior Authorization Commitments: Empty Promises, Little Accountability","Brit Vanneman, Ash Bliss, Alexander Cross, Daniel Young, Ian Anderson, Abigail Coursolle, Alicia Emanuel, Shandra Hartly",,,,,https://healthlaw.org/voluntary-industry-prior-authorization-commitments-empty-promises-little-accountability/,"These commitments appear to put more guardrails on how insurers use prior authorization.
Any lack of broad stakeholder representation raises concerns about whether the commitments reflect the interests of the people most affected by prior authorization policies.
At the time, they vowed to reduce prior authorization and increase transparency.
But without any enforcement, those promises went nowhere and the volume of prior authorization increased.
The commitment to process 80% of prior authorization requests in “real time” by 2027 also raises concerns.","AHIP, the national trade association representing the health insurance industry, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association recently announced a set of “voluntary commitments” to “streamline” prior authorization and “improve patient outcomes.” Major insurers including Aetna, Centene, Cigna, Elevance Health, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare have signed on.

These commitments appear to put more guardrails on how insurers use prior authorization. In reality, they largely repeat existing obligations and may simply be a strategic attempt to deflect growing public criticism of insurers’ abuse of prior authorization to deny or delay care.

These commitments were developed during a roundtable hosted by Dr. Mehmet Oz. Notably, it’s unclear whether any consumers, consumer groups, or provider associations participated in shaping them. Any lack of broad stakeholder representation raises concerns about whether the commitments reflect the interests of the people most affected by prior authorization policies.

AHIP also released a policy brief to accompany the announcement, reasserting the importance of prior authorization as a tool for reducing “unnecessary” health care spending and as a “critical safeguard in patient care.” Yet, a large and growing body of research shows that prior authorization is a primary way insurers control costs while tripping up beneficiaries in red tape. This misrepresentation of harm calls into question the credibility of the initiative as whole.

Against that backdrop, a closer look at the commitments reveals that several simply echo the existing requirements already baked into federal regulation, including in the CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization Rule (“Rule”) finalized in January 2024. For example, the pledge to adopt FHIR-based technology for electronic submission by January 1, 2027, is not new. That deadline is already mandated under the Rule for many plans. Likewise, the promise to improve transparency by explaining denials in plain language and providing appeal guidance simply restates baseline requirements found in the Rule and required by the Affordable Care Act.

While some commitments mirror existing requirements that lend a degree of accountability (if enforced), other so-called “new” commitments totally lack meaningful oversight or accountability, relying entirely on voluntary compliance. For example, the pledge to reduce prior authorization volume by 2026 only “as appropriate” for each plan’s local market lets insurers set their own goals without standards, oversight, or consequences. These kinds of statements may sound patient-centered, but are meaningless without regulatory oversight. Another commitment – to have clinicians review denials – is already described by AHIP as an industry-wide “existing norm.” Even if that is true, there is no standard requiring plans to disclose who is making decisions, leaving consumers in the dark and unable to know whether the promise is actually being followed.

These same corporations made similar promises in 2018 and again in 2023. At the time, they vowed to reduce prior authorization and increase transparency. But without any enforcement, those promises went nowhere and the volume of prior authorization increased.

Other commitments are more limited than they appear. The pledge to honor existing authorizations for 90 days when a member switches plans only applies if the person has already started the approved course of treatment and only if the benefit is covered and provider is in-network under the new plan. That’s far from a robust continuity of care guarantee.

The commitment to process 80% of prior authorization requests in “real time” by 2027 also raises concerns. It lacks a clear definition of “real time” and creates incentives for speed over careful, individualized review. In practice, efforts to accelerate processing often rely on overworked clinicians or algorithmic tools that cut corners. A former Cigna medical director, for example, said that she and other doctors were pressured to rush through claim reviews without fully examining patient records. Her superiors were “more concerned about being fast than being right.” We have already seen how automation and AI tools can contribute to opaque, inconsistent, and clinically inappropriate denials. AHIP claims AI isn’t used to deny care without clinician input, but mounting evidence shows otherwise. Without meaningful guardrails, transparency, or independent oversight, this pledge risks increased reliance on the very technologies that have undermined trust in prior authorization.",https://healthlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/prior-authorization.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 23:58:47.851107

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — If you’re a Costco shopper, you may want to check your home for a few items the company recently recalled. Affected products include tires, power banks and air conditioners.

Consumers should stop using some of the products immediately, Costco said.

The following products were recalled:

Anker Power Bank (10K, 22.5W) — Model A1257

This Anker Power Bank recall concerns a “potential issue involving lithium-ion battery cells,” according to Anker. Though the company says the likelihood of a malfunction is “minimal,” consumers should stop using the device immediately.

Anker Powercore 10000 Power Bank — Model A1263

The Anker Powercore 10000 Power Bank recall was issued over concerns it may overheat and pose a potential fire risk. The product was sold between June 1, 2016, and December 31, 2022.

Danby 8,000 BTU U-Shaped Window Air Conditioner — Model DAC080B6IWB-6

This Danby air conditioner recall was issued after it was discovered that the units can fail to drain water quickly enough, allowing water to pool — and may potentially lead to mold growth. The air conditioner was sold between June 10, 2021, and February 2, 2022. If you have one, Danby said to stop using it immediately.

Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires

Bridgestone said these tires “do not bear the DOT certification symbol on the tire sidewalls and therefore do not comply with tire marking requirements.” The company explains these tires were only sold as replacement equipment. The tires were manufactured June 2-22, 2024. Bridgestone explains customers can examine tires for four particular markings to determine if their tires are under recall. Tires must have all four markings, says Bridgestone. These are: 1) “Bridgestone” brand marking 2) “Blizzak 6” marking on tire line 3) “235/40R19” tire size marking and tire identification numbers of 1VR100W122224, 1VR100W122324, or 1VR100W100W122424.

Tires should not bear a “DOT” marking, says Bridgestone. The company adds that any tires reading “Blizzak LM005” are not included in the Blizzak 6 tire recall. Bridgestone says the tires can be replaced for free through Nov. 12.

Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric Tires Size 185/60R15C

Michelin said these tires fail to meet a federal safety standard for tire endurance, and “chunks of tread rubber may detach from the shoulder block.” The Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric tires recall only includes tires in the 185/60R15C size. The affected tires can be identified by their DOT sidewall markings, which will include dimension information, ID numbers and DOT start/stop dates, which can all be found in the recall notice. Michelin says replacement tires will be offered through Jul 1, 2026.

Major manufacturers including Nestle, General Mills, and Kraft Heinz have announced that they will be removing artificial dyes from their products within the next two years.

Illinois Tech Professor of Food Science and Nutrition Indika Edirisinghe says it was time for the food and beverage industry to reevaluate the use of artificial dyes in their products, but he also warns that switching over to natural food dye doesn’t come without challenges.

“One of the big challenges with the natural color is stability and consistency—they are not as stable as artificial colors,” says Edirisinghe. “Their lifespan is maybe weeks or a few months. Over time, they may degrade when exposed to environmental factors such as heat and light, resulting in discoloration. That’s going to be a challenge.”

Though Nestle says more than 90 percent of its current product categories do not contain synthetic colors, most of the products in the food industry that still do use them are targeted toward children—think breakfast cereals and sweets.

With some safety regulations having taken effect decades ago, Edirisinghe says that he thinks it’s the right time for the industry to take another look at those standards.

In particular, Edirisinghe points to a 2021 study that linked synthetic food dyes to an increase in children and adolescents being diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as evidence that the industry needed to reassess those dyes.

“In the last 20 years, the rate [of children with ADHD] has increased from 6 percent to 10 percent,” says Edirisinghe. “That’s a big jump.”

Another concern that Edirisinghe expressed is the amount of time that the industry will need to establish new formulations and comply with existing or new regulations.

Though the timeline before fully transitioning to natural dyes varies by company—ranging from summer 2026 to the end of 2027—Edirisinghe says he is confident that the industry has enough time to properly implement any changes.

“I think that timeline is feasible given the robust structures the industry has,” says Edirisinghe. “We are talking about billion-dollar companies. They have resources, they have money, and they can execute their plan in a short-term period.”",https://www.iit.edu/sites/default/files/2021-06/indika-orange_pomace_1280x850.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 20:02:55.610031

A federal judge has ordered CVS Health's Omnicare unit to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages following a whistleblower lawsuit alleging fraudulent billing of the U.S. government for invalid drug prescriptions.
The company allegedly assigned new prescription numbers without necessary paperwork and pharmacist approvals, after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.
The judge rejected CVS' argument that the $948.8-million award violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment.
The company maintains that the lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription recordkeeping issue that was allowed by law in many states.","CVS Health's Omnicare has been ordered to pay $948.8 million over invalid prescriptions. The company is a leading American supplier of health products and services, with net sales broken down into medical insurance plan management services, medical benefits management, retail distribution, and other activities.

A federal judge has ordered CVS Health's Omnicare unit to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages following a whistleblower lawsuit alleging fraudulent billing of the U.S. government for invalid drug prescriptions. The ruling, made by U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan, comes after a lengthy legal battle that began in 2015.

The lawsuit, filed by former Omnicare pharmacist Uri Bassan and joined by the federal government, accused Omnicare of improperly billing Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare for prescriptions at long-term care facilities. The company allegedly assigned new prescription numbers without necessary paperwork and pharmacist approvals, after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.

Judge McMahon imposed a $542-million penalty for filing 3,342,032 false claims between 2010 and 2018, and awarded $406.8 million in damages, representing three times the $135.6 million awarded by a jury in April 2025. The tripling of damages was required under the federal False Claims Act, which allows whistleblowers to sue on behalf of the federal government and share in recoveries.

The judge rejected CVS' argument that the $948.8-million award violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment. McMahon found CVS jointly liable with Omnicare for $164.8 million of the penalties, after jurors found it failed to stop Omnicare from submitting 30% of the false claims after buying the company in 2015.

CVS Health has announced plans to appeal the judgment. The company maintains that the lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription recordkeeping issue that was allowed by law in many states. ""There was no claim in this case that any patient paid for a medication they shouldn't have or that any patient was harmed,"" CVS said in a statement.

The ruling highlights the ongoing challenges faced by the healthcare industry in ensuring compliance with complex regulatory requirements. It also underscores the importance of robust internal controls and oversight mechanisms to prevent and detect fraudulent activities.

The jury ruled that CVS Health, which acquired Omnicare in 2015, incentivized the unit to submit more than 1 million of those claims after the merger closed.
Given the volume of claims in the mix, the government requested $542 million in penalties against the company.
In addition, Omnicare was hit with $406.8 million in damages, far higher than the $135.6 million set by the jury earlier this year.
The lawsuit was first filed in 2015 by a former Omnicare pharmacist, and the Department of Justice joined the whistleblower case in 2019.","A New York judge has ordered CVS Health's Omnicare subsidiary to pay $948.8 million in fees and damages as part of a False Claims Act whistleblower case.

In April, a federal jury determined that Omnicare submitted more than 3.3 million fraudulent claims for prescriptions between 2010 and 2018, which led to $135.6 million in overpayments from the government.

The jury ruled that CVS Health, which acquired Omnicare in 2015, incentivized the unit to submit more than 1 million of those claims after the merger closed. However, the jurors determined that there was no injury to the federal government related to those claims.

Given the volume of claims in the mix, the government requested $542 million in penalties against the company. In addition, Omnicare was hit with $406.8 million in damages, far higher than the $135.6 million set by the jury earlier this year.

The damages were tripled as per requirements under the False Claims Act, according to the order.

""Admittedly, that is a very big number,"" District Judge Colleen McMahon wrote in the order. ""But this is a very big fraud on the government, one that lasted over almost a decade, and one that Omnicare was aware of but avoided taking steps to correct.""

The lawsuit was first filed in 2015 by a former Omnicare pharmacist, and the Department of Justice joined the whistleblower case in 2019. Omnicare provides pharmacy services to long-term care facilities.

In a statement to Fierce Healthcare, a spokesperson for CVS said the company intends to appeal the penalties as ""the decision on penalties is unconstitutional, especially given the fact that there is no evidence that a single patient suffered harm.""

""This lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription dispensing record-keeping issue that was allowed by law in many states,"" the spokesperson said. ""The dispensing practices referenced were limited to Omnicare, ended in 2018, were used by many others in the industry at the time, and were accepted by CMS.""

""There was no claim in this case that any patient paid for a medication they shouldn’t have or that any patient was harmed,"" they said.

In the order, McMahon pushed back on CVS's argument that the penalties are unlawful.

""The violations in this case were both deliberate and egregious,"" she wrote. ""Omnicare was aware of the problems posed by its dispensing practices; it was warned again and again, both by employees and by outside (State) regulators.""

""Of great significance, Omnicare actually developed fairly straightforward means of resolving those problems but declined to implement them for years,"" she said.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/GettyImages-2165663502.jpg?VersionId=bRHkAfJ2udDglZzvCMsyawk_HBwEbJyM,N,,2025-07-08 18:04:45.377825

As part of that effort, Starbucks is testing a version of its popular egg white and roasted red pepper bites made with avocado oil.

For Starbucks, that could mean cutting back on sugar in key drinks, expanding nutritional add-ins, and offering more customizable options.
If executed well, this strategy could help Starbucks reassert its leadership in the premium coffee space.","The strategy: Starbucks is testing better-for-you products in a bid to win over more health-conscious consumers, per Bloomberg.

The examples:

The company is experimenting with ways to remove canola oil from its ingredient list in a nod to rising consumer skepticism of seed oils, despite a lack of conclusive evidence linking them to negative health outcomes. As part of that effort, Starbucks is testing a version of its popular egg white and roasted red pepper bites made with avocado oil.

It has removed sugar from its matcha powder and eliminated the upcharge for nondairy milk, addressing long-standing complaints from plant-based and sugar-sensitive customers.

Starbucks also tested unsweetened protein powder as a customizable add-in to its cold foam lineup, offering more nutrition-oriented options.

Why is this happening? Starbucks is repositioning its brand amid a sales slump and intensifying competition from Dutch Bros and Luckin Coffee, which are connecting with younger, value-conscious, and health-minded consumers. To stay competitive, Starbucks needs to find ways to adjust its product offerings and pricing strategies.

Our take: Starbucks is making some necessary changes—but there’s still plenty of work to do. Consumers want brands that meet them where they are, and that means prioritizing ingredient transparency and wellness without sacrificing flavor or convenience. For Starbucks, that could mean cutting back on sugar in key drinks, expanding nutritional add-ins, and offering more customizable options.

If executed well, this strategy could help Starbucks reassert its leadership in the premium coffee space.","https://www.emarketer.com/content/storage/socialsharingdefault/default-image-share.png?im=FitAndFill,width=1200,height=628",N,,2025-07-08 18:06:02.320690

The coffee giant is currently evaluating these proposals and creating a shortlist of potential investors for the next bidding round. Starbucks plans to share financial and operational information with these selected bidders to help them assess the value of its Chinese assets.

While Starbucks initially preferred to sell only a minority stake to a partner who could help revitalize growth in its Chinese market, the company is now considering selling a larger portion based on valuation and other factors.

Prospective partners, including industry players and private equity firms, submitted non-binding proposals in June. Most are seeking a controlling stake that would give them decision-making authority and better align with their investment strategies.

Previous Title: CFO, BIC

Medtronic has named Chad Spooner CFO of its diabetes business, beginning July 14. Medtronic plans to spin out the segment into a separate, publicly traded company called MiniMed, with the goal of completing the deal within 18 months.

Spooner has more than 25 years of experience in financial leadership, according to the Tuesday announcement. He was previously CFO of consumer goods company BIC for five years, where he played a key role in a strategy to drive innovation, growth and efficiency. He also was CFO of Slingshot Health, a startup offering a marketplace to connect patients to physicians, and held a senior finance role at GE Energy.

Que Dallara, who leads Medtronic’s diabetes business and will become CEO of MiniMed, said Spooner’s financial expertise and leadership “will be instrumental as we prepare for our next chapter as an independent company.”

Medtronic announced plans to spin out the diabetes unit in May, with the intent of giving the business the funding and focus it needs to reach its full potential in a competitive market. MiniMed would be the only diabetes tech firm to sell both continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps. However, other companies, including Dexcom, Abbott and Insulet, have strong product portfolios, with plans for dual-analyte sensors and patch pumps.

Mobileye, an Intel subsidiary, develops vision-based advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving technologies for automotive manufacturers.","Volkswagen has formed a partnership with Uber to launch autonomous electric ID. Buzz taxis across European and American markets.

The collaboration will see Volkswagen’ s ID. Buzz minivan deployed as a robotaxi solution, combining the carmaker’s manufacturing capabilities with Uber’s global ride-hailing network.

Both companies aim to address urban mobility challenges through connected, electric and sustainable transport solutions.

What is an autonomous electric ID. Buzz taxi?

The ID. Buzz is Volkswagen’s modern interpretation of its Microbus, built on the company's Modular Electric Drive (MEB) platform.

MEB is Volkswagen’s dedicated electric vehicle architecture designed to underpin multiple battery-electric models across the group’s brands.

The vehicle incorporates a 91-kWh battery pack that provides up to 234 miles of range – and the minivan supports rapid DC charging, allowing the battery to charge from 10% to 80% capacity in 26 minutes.

Volkswagen offers both rear-wheel and all-wheel drive variants, with power outputs reaching up to 335 horsepower.

“Autonomous driving is no longer a dream of the future – by 2030, it will change the everyday lives of millions of people in Europe,” says Christian Senger, Member of the Board for Fully Autonomous Mobility and Transport at Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles and CEO of ADMT GmbH.

ADMT GmbH is Volkswagen’s subsidiary focused on autonomous driving technology development.

Christian adds: “At the same time, our solution opens up a new business area for the German automotive industry: physical AI applications used for the common good.”

The Hamburg deployment forms part of Volkswagen’s broader strategy to integrate self-driving vehicles into existing public and private transport networks.

The testing programme provides data and operational experience ahead of commercial launches in other markets.

In 2026, Volkswagen plans to launch the ID. Buzz AV in Los Angeles under Uber’s platform.

Unlike fixed-route services, this deployment will offer on-demand ride-pooling options, with passengers able to request individual rides when required.

Volkswagen also intends to remove safety drivers from Los Angeles operations by the end of 2026.

European cities are expected to follow this timeline by 2027, marking the transition to fully autonomous commercial operations.

How Mobileye’s platform powers the ID. Buzz autonomous technology

The ID. Buzz AV also incorporates Mobileye’s autonomous driving platform.

Mobileye, an Intel subsidiary, develops vision-based advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving technologies for automotive manufacturers.

The vehicle’s sensor suite comprises 13 cameras, 9 LiDAR units and 5 radar systems. LiDAR technology uses laser pulses to create detailed three-dimensional maps of surrounding environments, whilst radar systems detect objects and measure their distance and speed using radio waves.

This sensor configuration generates five gigabytes of data per second, enabling real-time mapping and object detection capabilities.

Volkswagen employs proprietary mapping tools and reduces reliance on GPS systems to improve operational resilience in challenging environments.

What makes Volkswagen’s approach different from competitors who retrofit existing electric vehicles for autonomous operation – is that it manufactures the ID. Buzz AV on dedicated production lines – which the firm claims improves cost-efficiency and reduces environmental impact through streamlined manufacturing processes.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/177cad907fc4368b21dbde6a8109e56d:efa93d8474a4924e7db4d822bb10f4c1/uber-vw.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 17:05:20.685091

Porsche’s 1H sales numbers are a mixed bag, with an overall worldwide sales decline of 6% year over year. But they also include a huge increase in the proportion of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug in hybrids (PHEVs), with the brand selling a total of 36.1% plug-in models across the world – meaning EVs helped to keep the company afloat as combustion car sales dropped quite a lot.

Porsche sold more BEVs than PHEVs, with a 23.5% BEV share and 12.6% PHEV share. This represents a 14.5% increase from the previous year’s results – a big rise in EV sales alongside a drop in gas model sales (hm, where have we heard that before?).

Porsche’s strong electric performance is all the more impressive given that the brand only has two electric models so far – the Taycan and the Macan EV.

Taycan sales were down 6% year over year, which isn’t too unexpected given the model’s age at this point. Porsche has come out with new variants of the Taycan, but those are high-end ultra-performance models, which don’t generally make up the meat of any particular model’s sales numbers.

The big growth in Porsche’s EV sales came from the new electric Macan, which is going gangbusters soon after its release.

Macan is Porsche’s best-selling model, and sales were up 15% for the model overall. That number was buoyed by massive interest in the EV version, which accounted for “almost 60%” (actually 57%) of Porsche’s Macan sales – meaning the EV model sold ~134% as many units as the gas model. Totals were 25,884 for the EV, and 19,253 for combustion models.

Part of the reason for this is because Europe no longer sells the ICE Macan, but outside of Europe, it’s still available, and the EV is still popular (as far as we know, the EV isn’t quite a majority of Macan sales in the US, but it’s close to the gas model, and that’s still much higher than the national ~10% EV share, which the US is an international laggard at)

“The fully electric Macan is making a significant contribution to our proportion of electrified cars. Overall, we have succeeded in keeping sales volumes stable and balanced across the sales regions despite ongoing geopolitical challenges. Our customers continue to place great value on individualised vehicles and we will continue to expand our offerings in this area.”

-Matthias Becker, Board Member for Sales and Marketing, Porsche

We can expect, or at least hope for, similar strong EV sales performance from upcoming Porsche electric models. The next one to release will be the Cayenne EV, which we’ve seen recently setting a hillclimb record and towing lots of stuff in disguise. We expect a full release of that model within the next year.

Porsche also has both the Boxster and Cayman EVs in the pipeline for the future. The only model we’ve not yet heard real plans to electrify is the 911 (c’mon Porsche, why would you wait so long to upgrade your best model? isn’t it embarrassing to see a Macan beating a 911 off the line?)

Across regions, sales were down in Germany (primarily due to strong year-ago performance, says Porsche), China, and the rest of Europe, and up in North America and “rest of the world.” China is of particular note, where Porsche sales dropped 28%, the largest global decrease.

Western automakers have been having a really tough time in China, due to the strength of domestic competition and rapid rise in EV sales percentage there, which caught them by surprise. You can expect more of that to come as Chinese automakers will only get better, particularly as Western governments and automakers (yes, including you, Porsche) unwisely pull back on EV goals, leaving room for China to step up and become more prominent globally.

Electrek’s Take

I reviewed the Macan EV earlier this year and came away thinking that Porsche is great at making cars, but that it could still use some tweaking of its EV strategy. The car didn’t really feel like Porsche was “all-in” on EVs, and wasn’t utilizing the unique advantages of EVs to make a car that was fully focused on being electric, even though the bones of the model show the typical excellent driving dynamics that you would expect out of a Porsche.

So these numbers either show that I’m wrong about EV strategy, or show just how superior electric powertrains can be. Because even though I think there were some missteps in the design of Porsche’s electric model, it’s still just so much better than the gas model.

And, thankfully, the public and Porsche’s dealers seem to get it too. A lot of brands have a tough time selling EVs, often because their dealers refuse to. Porsche’s dealers seem to get it a lot more than a lot of companies, which is a credit to them and to Porsche as a whole for educating them properly about the strengths of their electric models.

So we’re looking forward to seeing how sales go with those future EV models… particularly the eventual and inevitable 911 (I recently drove an EV restomod 911, and it was maybe the best driving experience I’ve ever had in a car, so c’mon Porsche, if Everrati can do it then I know you can).

CVS Caremark is a subsidiary of CVS Health Corp., which also owns CVS Pharmacy.
As a pharmacy benefit manager, CVS Caremark essentially acts as a negotiator between pharmacies, insurers and drug manufacturers within the prescription drug supply chain.
RUNNING LOW ON OZEMPIC OR ANOTHER WEIGHT LOSS DRUG?
This goes beyond CVS Caremark, according to McGowan, who is concerned that its decision with Zepbound ""underscores a troubling trend"" in which ""financial contracts between benefit managers and drug manufacturers are increasingly shaping clinical decisions.""","CVS Caremark, one of the three major pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) in the U.S., stopped coverage for Eli Lilly's popular weight-loss drug Zepbound, blaming drugs like it for driving up overall plan costs.

GLP-1 products, originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, but are now FDA-approved specifically for obesity under brand names like Wegovy and Zepbound, are ""significantly contributing to overall plan costs"", CVS spokesperson Phillip Blando told FOX Business. Removing coverage of the drug will result in an estimated client savings of 10% to 15% year over year in the anti-obesity medication space for its clients who choose to cover these medications for weight loss, according to Blando.

Zepbound, the brand name for Eli Lilly's tirzepatide, was approved by the FDA in 2023 for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or overweight with weight-related medical problems. Tirzepatide was already approved to treat type 2 diabetes and was sold under the brand name Mounjaro.

TRUMP SAYS DRUG PRICES WILL BE CUT BY AS MUCH AS 90%: WHAT TO KNOW

Zepbound was widely viewed as a game-changer in the fight against obesity, after participants in a late-stage study lost up to a quarter of their body weight – making it more effective than Wegovy.

Blando said the ""egregiously high list prices"" for GLP-1 products that are set by drug manufacturers are ""the single biggest barrier to patient access.""

""Many payers, including Medicare and numerous state benefit plans, have declined to cover GLP-1s for weight loss because of the unsustainably high prices set by brand pharma,"" he said.

However, there will still be exceptions if the drug is deemed a ""medical necessity."" That exemption will be reviewed ""on a case-by-case basis,"" according to Blando.

CVS Caremark is a subsidiary of CVS Health Corp., which also owns CVS Pharmacy. As a pharmacy benefit manager, CVS Caremark essentially acts as a negotiator between pharmacies, insurers and drug manufacturers within the prescription drug supply chain. PBMs negotiate with drug manufacturers and pharmacies to decide how much medicines cost, which drugs people can get and which pharmacies are part of their network.

Pharmaceutical giants have been critical of PBMs, saying their role needs to change. Eli Lilly previously told FOX Business that the only way to lower prices for U.S. consumers is if ""intermediaries take less for themselves.""

Gastroenterologist and obesity medicine specialist Dr. Christopher McGowan told FOX Business that CVS Caremark’s decision to drop coverage of the drug is ""deeply disruptive for patients who are already stable and thriving on the medication.""

RUNNING LOW ON OZEMPIC OR ANOTHER WEIGHT LOSS DRUG? A NEW TRACKER CAN HELP

""We’re now seeing insurance policy override medical judgment – forcing patients to switch to an alternative that, while still effective, has been shown in head-to-head trials to produce less weight loss than Zepbound,"" McGowan said.

McGowan highlighted that GLP-1 medications ""are not interchangeable in practice, even if they appear similar on paper."" He said switching medications ""mid-journey can reverse hard-won progress.""

""For many, this isn’t just a simple substitution. It’s a high-stakes change that can affect long-term outcomes, trigger weight regain, or introduce new side effects,"" McGowan said.

This goes beyond CVS Caremark, according to McGowan, who is concerned that its decision with Zepbound ""underscores a troubling trend"" in which ""financial contracts between benefit managers and drug manufacturers are increasingly shaping clinical decisions.""

This means patients with fewer choices not because of what’s best for their health, but because of behind-the-scenes rebate deals, he continued.

""In obesity care, continuity matters. Once a patient finds a medication that works, preserving that success should be the priority,"" he said. ""Instead, we’re seeing progress disrupted and patients forced to navigate treatment changes they never asked for.""

Eli Lilly told FOX Business that the company is committed to ensuring patients have access to the treatment they need.

""While not all CVS Caremark plans are impacted, we’ve made robust efforts to proactively communicate with many of the patients who may be affected and provided clear next steps through our support programs,"" Lilly said in a statement, adding that the company is encouraging patients to speak with their healthcare providers about medical necessity exceptions or alternative coverage pathways. It has also added resources on its website.

If customers do lose coverage, Eli Lilly said it expanded access through LillyDirect’s Self Pay Pharmacy Solutions, which is the company's self-pay program, which removes some third-party supply chain entities, offering patients without coverage drugs at a discount.

Not John Deere.
John Deere will vigorously defend itself against this baseless lawsuit.” Which is what you would expect.
It’s likely John Deere lobbyists are working overtime to get lawmakers to put pressure on the Justice Department to drop the case.","The writing is on the wall.

Should John Deere choose to defend itself in court rather than attempt to reach a settlement, it very much may be handed a massive spanking by the Justice Department, which alleges the company’s repair restrictions violate federal and state antitrust laws. See here, here and here.

In a nutshell, the Justice Department claims Deere is scamming farmers by forcing them to exclusively use Deere dealers to repair their combines and tractors when they stop running. The feds have a case.

As it turns out, it takes proprietary diagnostic software to fix broken Deere tractors. Software that Deere refuses to sell to DIY farmers or independent repair shops. Deere likes it that way because it provides the company a significant after-market revenue stream.

The four-count Federal Trade Commission lawsuit isn’t playing around, alleging Deere monopolized the restricted repair services market, violated the FTC Act by using an unfair method of competition, and violated both Minnesota and Illinois antitrust laws.

John Deere lawyers threw spaghetti at the court walls, hoping something would stick and keep it from having to defend its software at trial.

Among the arguments Deere makes are that the feds’ claims of unfair competition and monopolization are factually and legally insufficient. And for good measure — just in case the unfair competition argument went south — Deere challenged the FTC’s constitutional structure, whether states that joined in the Justice Department’s case have standing, as well as the timeliness of the states’ claims.

The ruling by Judge Iain D. Johnson, of the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois-Western Division, rejected all of Deere’s legal posturing.

Johnson writes that at this stage of the case — a motion for judgment on the pleadings — he has to accept the Justice Department allegations as factual:

“The Governments say there’s a throughline between Deere’s practices: farmers have no alternatives because of the system created by Deere, which charges supracompetitive prices because of the lack of any alternatives. In technologizing its equipment, Deere makes farmers reliant on Deere’s own ADVISOR software. And, in only licensing that software to its authorized Dealers, Deere forces farmers to visit those shops instead of using closer, cheaper options.”

Johnson also noted Deere reaps massive profits from its parts business, which relies on those authorized dealers’ repairs. And Johnson says “because only Deere can create and license the ADVISOR [repair] tool, it entirely controls who (and how many) Dealers may perform restricted repairs and, by extension, how much the Dealers can charge.”

Which suggests Deere might have a significant uphill climb to refute the Justice Department.

This isn’t Johnson’s first rodeo in handling Deere’s software litigation. In late 2023, he rejected Deere’s attempt to dismiss consolidated lawsuits filed by farmers alleging that Deere conspired to restrict services for repair.

In its most recent failed motion for judgment on the pleadings, Deere recycled some of the same arguments it made in 2023, to which Johnson responded:

“Sequels so rarely beat their originals that even the acclaimed Steve Martin couldn’t do it on three tries. See Cheaper by the Dozen II, Pink Panther II, Father of the Bride II. Rebooting its earlier production, Deere sought to defy the odds. To be sure, like nearly all sequels, Deere edited the dialogue and cast some new characters, giving cameos to veteran stars like Humphrey’s Executor. But ultimately the plot felt predictable, the script derivative. Deere I received a thumbs-down, and Deere II fares no better.”

In the immediate aftermath of Johnson’s ruling no one was talking publicly. Not John Deere. Not the Justice Department. Perhaps behind the scenes, the feds and Deere are talking to each other.

The Justice Department is seeking a permanent injunction against Deere, as well as an order to make the company’s full-function service ADVISOR software available to all owners of Deere large tractors and combines.

Back in January when the outgoing Biden administration filed suit against Deere, the company said publicly:

“The complaint is based on flagrant misrepresentations of the facts and fatally flawed legal theories and it punishes innovation and procompetitive-product design. John Deere will vigorously defend itself against this baseless lawsuit.”

Which is what you would expect. But I wonder if Deere higher-ups privately feel the same way. Are they willing to legally go to the mattresses, all the way to the Supreme Court? I feel as though this isn’t the type of case the Justice Department will drop if it loses at the district court.

That the Trump Justice Department hasn’t flat out dropped the case is telling. The feds appear squarely in the farmers’ camp. It’s likely John Deere lobbyists are working overtime to get lawmakers to put pressure on the Justice Department to drop the case. How might that play out?

Are Deere and the Justice Department exploring a settlement?

I imagine there are many moving pieces — many of which have nothing to do directly with the proceedings in Johnson’s court.

Right-to-repair advocates were applauding Johnson’s ruling that the antitrust law case can go forward, but whether farmers who own Deere rigs ultimately get access to the software they need to independently fix them is still far from settled.

By targeting corporations such as Albertsons, The Southern Company, and Merck, these groups are reshaping shareholder activism, forcing companies to confront the tension between social responsibility and profit-driven governance. For investors, the question is stark: Do anti-ESG campaigns represent a legitimate safeguard against corporate overreach, or a destabilizing force undermining long-term value creation?

The Bowyer Playbook: Targeting ESG's Soft Underbelly

Bowyer Research's strategy hinges on exploiting low shareholder ownership thresholds (as little as 1%) to convene special meetings and push proxy proposals. These proposals rarely win majority votes—most secure under 5% support—but their symbolic impact is profound. By framing ESG initiatives as “politicized” or financially risky, Bowyer seeks to delegitimize corporate commitments to diversity, environmental goals, and social justice.

Albertsons: Bowyer's 2024 proposal urged the supermarket giant to audit the costs of its partnerships with LGBTQ+ advocacy groups and its “diversity training” programs. The argument? Such initiatives risk alienating customers and employees with conservative values while offering no clear financial upside.

The Southern Company: A 2023 proposal demanded a cost-benefit analysis of its decarbonization plans, arguing that investments in renewables threaten shareholder returns in a fossil fuel-dependent economy.

Merck: In 2024, Bowyer called for an evaluation of how the pharmaceutical giant's DEI policies might expose it to legal risks under the Harvard affirmative action ruling, which tightened scrutiny of race-conscious practices.

The Risks of Activist Overreach

While Bowyer's proposals fail at the ballot box, their persistence creates tangible risks. First, legal and reputational costs: Companies must divert resources to respond to repeated challenges, even if they reject the proposals. Second, governance instability: Frequent special meetings may signal to investors that management is distracted from core priorities. Third, ESG devaluation: If anti-ESG groups succeed in framing ESG as a “niche” concern, companies may retreat from initiatives that could build long-term resilience (e.g., climate adaptation, inclusive workforces).

Consider Merck's case: Even if its DEI program survives, the threat of litigation could deter it from bold recruitment or supplier diversity goals. For The Southern Company, scaling back renewables might appease activists but leave it unprepared for a carbon-constrained future.

The Legal Battlefield: SEC Rules and Shareholder Democracy

Bowyer's success depends on exempt solicitations remaining a low-cost tool. However, the SEC's recent NCPPR v. SEC ruling—upholding its authority to exclude “ordinary business” proposals—could curb such campaigns. If upheld, this precedent might limit activists' ability to challenge ESG initiatives as non-pecuniary. Yet, anti-ESG groups are refining strategies, such as framing proposals as financial risk assessments (e.g., “evaluating the cost of DEI lawsuits”) to evade exclusion.

Investment Implications: Navigating the ESG-Fiduciary Tightrope

For investors, the key is to distinguish between strategic ESG integration (e.g., climate risk mitigation) and activist-driven theatrics (e.g., symbolic DEI pledges). Companies that align ESG with profitability—such as The Southern Company's balance of renewables and fossil fuels—may weather activism better than those seen as chasing “woke” reputational gains.

Actionable Insights:

1. Avoid Companies with Weak ESG-Performance Linkages: Firms using ESG as a marketing tool, not a risk management strategy, face higher reputational and financial risks from anti-ESG campaigns.

2. Monitor SEC Regulatory Shifts: A pro-ESG SEC could penalize exempt solicitations, while a deregulatory tilt might empower activists.

3. Favor Firms with Transparent ESG Cost-Benefit Analysis: Companies like Merck that publicly justify DEI investments (e.g., “diverse teams drive innovation”) are less vulnerable to Bowyer's “reckless spending” critiques.

Conclusion: The New Fiduciary Imperative

Bowyer Research's campaigns highlight a deeper truth: ESG is no longer optional but a core governance issue. Investors must demand that companies articulate how their ESG priorities align with shareholder value—whether through risk mitigation, talent retention, or market access. Those that cannot will face relentless pressure from activists and regulators alike. In this era of exempt solicitations and ideological warfare, the winners will be firms that treat ESG as a strategic asset, not a political football.",,N,,2025-07-08 19:07:30.296340

Brown wrote in his email that some employees will return right away in September, while others will need to wait for office renovations, which could take until late 2026. The policy does not apply to existing remote employees who are working distantly.

State of play: Some surveys have shown that many employees say they will find a new job if they can't work from home, but the options for remote work are dwindling among Minnesota's largest employers.

Employees at Minnesota' largest corporation, UnitedHealth Group, were called back four days a week starting on Monday. Medtronic workers will need to be in office four days a week starting Sept. 2, up from three days a week.

This summer, Target began requiring multiple divisions to come back to its Minneapolis headquarters.

The state of Minnesota's June 1 mandate requires 50% in-office work.

Golden Valley-based General Mills called the bulk of its employees back Tuesday through Thursday in February.

By the numbers: More in-person work is starting to show up in office space leasing metrics.

Quarterly absorption in the Twin Cities — which measures how much space is leased against how much is vacated or constructed — was positive for the first time since 2020, according to a new report by commercial real estate firm JLL.

JLL says a hefty amount of demand for space will keep leasing strong for the foreseeable future.

The bottom line: While the days of employees working mostly from home are over for big corporations, policies mandating three or four days in the office per week are still more flexible than pre-pandemic setups.",https://images.axios.com/vI1xiNjSCfNNdt__FaIvnm0ovD0=/0x343:5100x3212/1366x768/2025/07/08/1751999182990.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 16:08:47.450660

The warehouse retailer flagged 10 items in recent months for recalls, produced by a variety of manufacturers but sold by Costco. Some were also sold through Costco Next, a program that lets customers buy directly from brands at Costco prices.

The products range from window air conditions to power banks to car tires.

Here's what's included in the recall list:

Anker Power Bank (10K, 22.5W) — Model A1257 (Costco Next)

These power banks were included in a worldwide recall by Anker over reports that some of the items had caught fire or exploded.

Danby 8k U-Shape Window Air Conditioner (Item #1498424)

These air conditioners, sold on the Costco website between June 10, 2021, and Feb. 2, 2022, are being recalled because they could grow mold. The manufacturer says pooled water can't drain quickly enough from them, risking the growth of harmful molds.

Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric Tires Size 185/60R15C

These Michelin-brand tires are under a recall notice because they don't meet federal guidelines for tire endurance. Federal regulators warn that the tires could increase the risk of a crash. Information to identify your tires is located on the sidewall of each tire, directly above the bead.

Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires

These tires, sold only as replacements, don't meet federal safety regulations. Although they adhere to performance requirements, they lack certain markings identifying their use, increasing the risk of the tires being used in improper ways, and increasing the risk of a crash. They were manufactured between June 2 and June 22, 2024, and sold through Costco's automotive department.

Anker Powercore 1000 Power Bank (Costco Next)

These power banks were also part of Anker's nationwide recall over the risk of fire or explosion from the lithium-ion battery within them.

BowFlex Adjustable Dumbbells

These dumbbells are under a voluntary recall because the plates that add weight to them may get dislodged from the handle while being used, causing a safety hazard.

Midea U-Shape Window AC's (Item #'s 1572673, 1657921, 1677429, 1768985, 2677450, and 2677429)

These window-mounted AC units are also being recalled for mold, with the manufacturer warning that pooling water may fail to drain. Mold can cause respiratory issues or lead to infection, especially in the young or elderly.

Topo Chico Mineral Water Glass 18pk - Select Lot Code - Select Locations in Texas and Louisiana (Item #1439351)

Between May 20 and May 29, 2025, Costco sold Topo Chico Mineral Water at a number of locations in Texas and Louisiana. The recall was issued because the water may be contaminated with pseudomonas, a bacteria that is naturally found in some mineral waters. While the bacteria poses little health risk for healthy individuals, it could cause problems for those with compromised immune systems.

Igloo 90 Qt Flip & Tow Rolling Cooler (Item #1356922)

Costco is also warning customers about Igloo ice coolers as part of a nationwide recall, after numerous reports of the tow handles on the coolers pinching fingers while being used, sometimes causing amputation.

Ninja Foodi Pressure Cooker + Air Fryer (Item #2297950 and #3297950)

A number of Ninja-brand pressure cookers have been recalled after being sold at retailers across the U.S., including Costco, because they may cause severe burns. The recall was issued after reports that the lid on the device could be opened while the contents of the cooker were pressurized, causing severe burns and injuries from the hot contents. The pressure cookers were sold between May 2019 and May 2021.",https://media.kvue.com/assets/CCT/images/bcc3d0ab-0c55-4aef-9ba9-f36f7bb1b022/20250603T195933/bcc3d0ab-0c55-4aef-9ba9-f36f7bb1b022_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 16:08:51.054045

Starbucks has rolled out a new layered line of Frappuccino drinks for which the iced, blended beverages are topped with the coffeehouse chain’s signature cold foam.

The new Strato line of beverages, named for the Italian word for “layer,” is now available nationwide.

Although baristas could always add cold foam, made with flavored, aerated skim milk, to beverages upon request (at least since the cold foam was introduced in 2018), they can now be ordered that way via the chain’s app.

They’re available in three flavors, each priced at around $5.95 for a medium “Grande”:

Brown Sugar Strato Frappuccino: Frappuccino roast coffee syrup blended with ice and whole milk topped with brown sugar cold foam and a dusting of cinnamon powder

Strawberry Matcha Strato Frappuccino: Simple syrup and matcha powder blended with ice and whole milk topped with strawberry cold foam

Salted Caramel Mocha Strato Frappuccino: Mocha sauce and Frappuccino roast coffee syrup blended with ice and whole milk topped with salted caramel cold foam and a caramel syrup drizzle

These particular iterations of the Strato platform will be available while supplies last this summer, with new iterations likely to be introduced later in the year.

The first Strato Frappuccino was actually introduced last week, although it wasn’t called by that name, and was only available for that week.

The Firework Frappuccino used the chain’s Summer Berry Refresher as its base, blended with coconut milk, poured over raspberry-flavored popping pearls, swirled with strawberry purée and topped with vanilla cold foam. A Starbucks barista commenting on a TikTok post about the week-long special said that, while people seemed to enjoy it, “I hate making these,” because they require 13 steps.

Layered drinks such as the Strato offer texture and temperature contrasts that appear to appeal to younger consumers. Their color variations also play well on social media.

Earlier this year, Starbucks removed nine Frappuccino drinks from its regular menu as part of a planned 30% menu reduction, but it teased the Strato line during a June convention of Starbucks managers in Las Vegas, among other new food and beverage offerings, including a dark 1971 Roast, named for the year the chain was founded, that is slated to debut this winter, as well as the return of raspberry sauce, updated croissants, and a new cold foam with 15 grams of protein.

CVS DOWNFALL

CVS has confirmed that it will be shutting down 271 locations in 2025.

The struggling pharmacy chain has shut 900 spots over the past three years.

Between 2022 and 2024, CVS wiped out the 900 locations from its nationwide footprint.

The full list of the 271 CVS locations has not yet been released, but local news sources and Newsweek have locked in on about 39 spread across 17 states and Washington DC so far.

A spokesperson for the company said: ""We're focused on ensuring we have the right kinds of stores and the right number of stores in the right locations.

""We're closing locations strategically to better meet consumers'

""At the same time, big rivals like Walgreens health, wellness, and pharmacy care needs — as announced more than three years ago —not in reaction to industry pressures.""

During this, CVS has also pledged to lower prices on prescriptions, amid its many closures.

CEO David Joyner said: ""These entities remain the only part of the drug supply chain entirely focused on lowering costs.

""For more than three decades, PBMs have been a proven unequivocal mechanism to negotiate down the price of drugs for payers and consumers while promoting better adherence and better health.""",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/07/newspress-collage-52bm6nxtm-1751997828356.jpg?1751983447&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-07-08 16:07:36.844608

Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat has taken a measured approach to AI implementation, keeping client experience, cost, and use case at the core of every project. In an interaction with TOI before the WNS deal was announced, he said India remains a strategic hub for Capgemini, which currently has 175,000 employees in the country and is planning a gross addition of 45,000 this year. Ezzat said that GenAI and Agentic AI represented more than 6% of its bookings in the March quarter. The group has forecast revenue growth of -2% to 2% in constant currency for the 2025 financial year.

To what extent has GenAI influenced your internal software development?

It had some impact—especially when it comes to generating new code, where it performs reasonably well. However, even in those cases, the output still requires review, debugging, and thorough testing. So, while there are productivity gains, they’re not as significant as many people assume. When working with existing codebases or complex environments, the benefits are more limited. We’ve used GenAI for enhancements, for example, but the productivity improvements weren’t as dramatic as some might expect. There’s also a common misconception: increased productivity doesn’t automatically translate to cost savings. For instance, a 30% productivity gain among lower-cost roles like testers doesn’t have the same financial impact as a similar gain in higher-cost roles such as project managers or functional analysts. That nuance often gets overlooked. Beyond productivity, we’re equally focused on quality—delivering faster, but with better, more reliable code. So it's not just about cutting costs; multiple factors are driving our approach.

There are discussions around cost overruns with AI implementations. While productivity gains are evident, the operational costs of running AI remain a challenge.

We halted one client’s chatbot project—it was going to cost $25 million per year due to data consumption. The financial return just wasn’t there. AI solutions need to be evaluated case-by-case. Not all implementations yield a positive ROI. That said, in many situations, we can find reasonable returns, whether from speed, quality, or other value drivers.

From a broader perspective—on a recent investor call, you mentioned a subdued demand environment. Has anything shifted since then?

Demand remained steady over the past few months. Some industries are seeing growth, while others continue to face pressure. Overall, it’s a flat environment. We’re not seeing a sharp uptick in activity, but there also haven’t been significant cutbacks due to tariffs or other factors. What remains consistent is the focus on efficiency—cost reduction, productivity gains, and operational optimisation—rather than growth. Given the uncertain economic outlook and muted growth, companies are prioritising savings over innovation. Most large-scale transformations today are centred around cost optimisation, supply chain improvements, and boosting productivity. When it comes to efficiency and cost focus, there's no major difference. But in AI adoption—the US typically moves faster and is more aggressive. American companies are often quick to embrace new tech to stay ahead, while European firms tend to be more measured and cautious. That said, it still varies by company, so it's hard to generalise too much.

There’s growing momentum around GCCs in India. What's Capgemini's playbook?

It’s a natural shift. Clients want more control over key talent areas like tech and shared services, and GCCs offer that. India is a major talent hub, and many clients rely on us to set up, scale, and manage their local operations. We see it as a partnership—GCCs don’t replace us; we continue to support clients even after the setup. That’s the good news—there’s broad recognition that part of global operations, including proprietary work, will be based in India. It shows how Indian talent is important for in-house roles, and that’s a positive shift for both India and firms looking at global partnerships.

In one example, the company is considering making its egg white and roasted red pepper bites without canola oil, a spokesperson said in response to an inquiry from Bloomberg News. The company will also add a new egg bite to its menu that is made with avocado oil.

The coffee chain is in the midst of a brand revamp as it seeks to reverse a sales slump, and one of its priorities is testing products that appeal to more health-conscious consumers. In June, Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol pledged in a meeting with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to further align the chain’s menu with the Trump administration’s health priorities, Kennedy said in a post on X.

Starbucks’ U.S. menu has a number of items that contain canola oil, including a bacon, Gouda and egg sandwich, as well as potato bakes. Starbucks didn’t provide a timeline for the changes to its food lineup.

Seed oils, such as soybean and canola, have become a target for Kennedy and his allies, though multiple meta-analyses have indicated they have no significant impact on inflammation or the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.

The health push is showing up in other places on Starbucks’ menu. The chain removed sugar from its matcha powder in a move that boosted sales, Niccol said during an April earnings call. It also nixed an upcharge for nondairy milk and a recent pilot involves unsweetened protein powder, which can be added to any cold foam flavor.

The chain’s latest U.S. beverage launch was a limited-time Fourth of July themed Frappuccino. The 16-ounce version contains 59 grams of sugar, according to the chain’s website. The American Heart Association recommends that men consume less than 36 grams of added sugar a day and women less than 25 grams.

However, it is understood Droga is not interested in the WPP CEO role.
There has been no word on whether internal candidates may have pitched for the WPP job.
Jansen, former chief executive of BT, started as WPP chair on January 1, having first been named to the job in July 2024.
WPP's flagship agency divisions include WPP Media, led by Brian Lesser and previously known as Group M; VML, led by Jon Cook; and Ogilvy, led by Devika Bulchandani, and a number of smaller subsidiaries, including specialist communications, led by Johnny Hornby.","LONDON: Two big industry names tipped as potential candidates to be the next chief executive of WPP are not in the running for the job.

Campaign understands that Matt Brittin, former EMEA president of Google, and David Droga, outgoing chief executive of Accenture Song, are not involved in the agency holding company's recruitment process. (Campaign is PRWeek's sister business media outlet at Haymarket Media).

WPP has given no update on its search since June 9, when the British agency group said Mark Read, chief executive since 2018, is planning to step down but will remain in the job until December 31, when he will retire from the board.

However, multiple sources said they believe WPP’s board, which is led by Philip Jansen, chair, is set make a decision soon. An appointment will come “sooner than expected,"" one person said.

When WPP last looked for a CEO in 2018, after Martin Sorrell abruptly exited, the search took four and a half months, but Read was widely seen as the internal favorite from the start of the process – unlike in 2025 when no frontrunner has yet emerged.

There have been rumours in industry circles since March that WPP has made overtures to Brittin, but it is understood he is not looking for an executive board role in the near term, after leaving Google this summer.

Brittin previously said in a LinkedIn post when he first announced his departure that he wanted to “take a break for the first time since leaving school – a ‘mini gap year’” – and he was looking forward to spending more time with his family “in the year ahead.""

Droga’s decision to step down as chief executive of Accenture Song in May and move to a new role as vice chair of parent company Accenture also fueled speculation that WPP has approached the Droga5 founder. However, it is understood Droga is not interested in the WPP CEO role.

Other external industry names who have been linked with the vacancy include Lord Carter, chief executive of Informa, the owner of Cannes Lions, who worked at WPP early in his career. Informa did not comment. A source said analysts would be surprised if Carter were to make a move given his expansion plans for Informa.

There has been no word on whether internal candidates may have pitched for the WPP job.

WPP declined to comment on the process.

Jansen, former chief executive of BT, started as WPP chair on January 1, having first been named to the job in July 2024.

Speaking at his first WPP annual shareholder meeting in May, Jansen told investors that the board was under no obligation to make immediate changes, but the nominations committee “continually takes a long-term view on board succession planning."" Read’s departure was announced a little over two weeks later.

WPP has been under pressure as it faces a third year of lackluster revenue growth, with a decline of between zero and 2% expected in 2025. It has lost some major media accounts, including Coca-Cola in North America and Mars globally, to Publicis Groupe.

WPP’s share price has fallen 37% since the start of 2025, reducing its stock market valuation from £8.9 billion to £5.6 billion.

Analysts at Barclays warned in a note last month that they expect WPP’s “underperformance to continue” in the short term, partly “because of the uncertainties created by a change in management.""

“On average, media stocks that have seen a change in management underperform by 10% between the announcement of a change in CEO and the strategy of the new CEO being unveiled,” Barclays said.

The investment bank added that “we do not believe, unlike others, that WPP is fundamentally impaired and we do believe that the new CEO can turn this ship around, but it is likely to come with higher investments and lower margins initially.""

WPP's flagship agency divisions include WPP Media, led by Brian Lesser and previously known as Group M; VML, led by Jon Cook; and Ogilvy, led by Devika Bulchandani, and a number of smaller subsidiaries, including specialist communications, led by Johnny Hornby.

THE LARGER TREND

In June, Hippocratic AI and Universal Health Services (UHS) announced that genAI agents, which support clinicians by making phone follow-up outreach to patients after discharge, were deployed in two UHS subsidiaries: Summerlin Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas and Texoma Medical Center in Denison, Texas.

The initiative aims to support clinicians in continuing to monitor their patients after discharge from the hospital, detecting and alerting UHS clinical staff to changes in patient conditions and addressing patients' questions.

In May, Hippocratic AI partnered with Eucalia, a clinical operations company, to launch the first Japanese-language genAI healthcare agent for non-diagnostic, patient-facing clinical tasks. The partnership marked Hippocratic AI's entry into the Japanese market.

Scheduled to be introduced this year, the Japanese generative AI healthcare agent aims to support clinicians by taking on time-consuming but important non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks, including appointment scheduling, follow-up outreach, chronic care check-ins and medication adherence support.

In April, Hippocratic AI partnered with Burjeel Holdings, a healthcare services provider based in the United Arab Emirates. Burjeel Holdings operates in parts of the Middle East and North Africa.

Through the alliance, Hippocratic AI's agents will be developed for ""patient-facing non-diagnostic clinical tasks,"" distributed across Burjeel Holdings' healthcare facilities and physiotherapy clinics in the UAE and Oman.

In January, Hippocratic AI closed a $141 million Series B round of funding, bringing its valuation to $1.64 billion.

As reciprocal restrictions disrupt traditional trade routes, investors are poised to capitalize on strategic arbitrage opportunities through cross-border mergers & acquisitions (M&A) and regional production diversification. This article outlines how companies are reconfiguring their supply chains—and which stocks to buy, avoid, or short—to profit from—or mitigate—the fallout.

The Trade War in Context: Reciprocal Barriers and Market Fragmentation

Since June 2025, the EU has banned Chinese medical device firms from bidding on public contracts exceeding €5 million, while capping Chinese component usage at 50%. In retaliation, China excluded EU-based companies from tenders above 45 million yuan ($6.3 million). These measures, rooted in accusations of unfair trade practices (e.g., China's “Made in China 2025” localization mandates), have split the $500 billion global medtech market into two walled gardens.

The stakes are high: China's medtech exports to the EU totaled €11.4 billion in 2024, while EU firms face exclusion from 87% of China's public tenders. Companies unable to adapt risk losing access to critical markets, while agile players can dominate niche segments.

Strategic Responses: M&A and Regional Diversification

1. European Firms Acquiring Chinese Partners

To bypass China's procurement bans, EU medtech companies are partnering with or acquiring local Chinese firms to qualify for domestic tenders. Philips (NYSE: PHG) exemplifies this strategy: 90% of its Chinese sales are generated through local manufacturing, shielding it from exclusion. Similarly, Siemens Healthineers (OTCPK: SHLGY) leverages its 15%-revenue-generating China business to navigate restrictions.

Investment Opportunity: Back firms with localized production in China, such as Philips or Becton Dickinson (NYSE: BDX), which already sources 70% of its Chinese devices domestically. These companies benefit from dual access: EU procurement (via non-Chinese components) and China's fast-growing market.

2. Shifting Production to ASEAN

The EU's restrictions have spurred a rush to ASEAN, where countries like Thailand and Malaysia offer cost-effective, geopolitically neutral manufacturing hubs. Stryker (NYSE: SYK) and Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) are expanding production in Vietnam and Indonesia to avoid reliance on China. This strategy not only circumvents trade barriers but also taps into ASEAN's $35 billion medtech market.

Investment Opportunity: Invest in firms with flexible supply chains and ASEAN exposure, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO) or Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG), whose robotic surgery systems are in high demand across fragmented markets.

3. Chinese Firms Seeking EU Assets

While the research highlights limited Chinese acquisitions of EU assets to date, the potential remains. Chinese firms like Mindray Medical (SZSE: 300760) or United Imaging could target EU-based R&D firms or niche manufacturers to gain access to EU procurement tenders. Such deals would allow them to rebrand as “European” entities and bypass the IPI's restrictions.

Investment Opportunity: Monitor state-backed Chinese firms with strong balance sheets, such as Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI), for opportunistic EU acquisitions.

Risks and Short Candidates

The trade war's escalation carries significant risks:

- Geopolitical Volatility: Escalating tariffs or WTO disputes could disrupt supply chains further.

- Overcapacity in ASEAN: Rapid manufacturing shifts may lead to oversupply and margin compression.

Avoid or Short:

- Pure-play exporters to China/EU, such as Smiths Group (LSE: SMIN) or Getinge (OMX: GETI), which lack localized production.

- Companies reliant on high-Chinese-component exports, such as Teleflex (NYSE: TLS), whose EU sales could collapse under the 50% threshold rule.

Conclusion: Bet on Flexibility and Diversification

The EU-China medtech trade war is a zero-sum game for traditional players but a goldmine for firms willing to reconfigure their supply chains. Investors should prioritize companies with localized manufacturing in China, ASEAN production hubs, or cross-border joint ventures. Meanwhile, shorting firms stuck in the trade crossfire offers asymmetric risk-reward.

Intel and HP have co-engineered a new class of AI PCs that run AI workloads locally for enhanced speed and privacy. The collaboration delivers up to 223% faster performance on key business apps, enabling measurable productivity gains.

What is Covered in this Article:

Intel and HP co-engineered AI PCs for business users, including the EliteBook X, EliteBook Ultra, and EliteBook 8, powered by Intel Core Ultra 200V series processors.

Intel optimized CPU, GPU, and NPU resources across 12 configurations and 8 AI PC models, validating performance on key enterprise applications.

AI apps like Power BI, Tableau, and Canvid showed performance gains of up to 223% versus prior-gen systems, with first-time Windows availability for Canvid and Writeup.

Intel’s hands-on involvement extended to benchmarking 9 AI-enhanced applications for HP’s go-to-market execution.

Despite macro uncertainty in PC demand, the collaboration showcases tangible improvements in business productivity from local AI capabilities.

The News: HP and Intel have teamed up to launch a new lineup of AI-powered PCs built for business use, including the EliteBook X, EliteBook Ultra, and EliteBook 8. These devices are designed with a focus on productivity and privacy and run on Intel’s Core Ultra 200V processors. Both companies worked together on the hardware and software to ensure these machines could handle AI tasks locally, using the CPU, GPU, and NPU.

Over eight months, Intel and HP tested a dozen hardware setups across eight different AI PC models. This effort helped fine-tune nine AI-focused apps – like Power BI, Tableau, Adobe Lightroom, Canvid, and Writeup—with noticeable performance boosts over older systems.

Can Intel and HP Finally Make AI PCs a Must-Have for Business?

Analyst Take: The HP-Intel partnership on these AI PCs is a strong, data-backed push to shift business computing toward on-device AI. With 62% of enterprise IT leaders adopting AI PCs to futureproof their organizations, this launch gives the segment much-needed credibility backed by purpose-driven investment. The detailed performance data and use-case testing give HP a strong story to tell enterprise buyers while also helping Intel stay competitive against AMD and Qualcomm, who are rolling out their AI-focused chips.

Performance Improvements Backed by Data

Unlike some AI PC rollouts that have featured vague performance promises, HP and Intel are backing these with solid numbers. Compared to previous systems, Power BI saw up to 45% speed improvements, Tableau was 48% faster, and Adobe Lightroom ran 32% quicker. Canvid, the screen recording tool, was also up to 223% faster. Similarly, the local AI writing tool Writeup hit 165% better output speeds. These results came from over 500 hours of benchmarking by Intel’s software team, focused on real business tasks and not artificial tests. These real numbers give HP more concrete productivity and resource usage pitches to companies looking for clear value before upgrading their PCs and for guidance on which AI PCs to choose.

Intel’s Engineering Push Shows a Strategic Shift

Part of the reason for these improvements is that Intel did not just provide the chips. The company also helped optimize software for them: Engineers from Intel’s Client Computing Group worked hand-in-hand with HP’s commercial PC team to tune performance across CPU, GPU, and NPU, reflecting Intel’s more rounded approach to AI workload resource management in their PC systems. Unlike Qualcomm, which has so far prioritized energy-efficient NPUs for AI workloads, Intel has taken a less NPU-centric approach with a more balanced total system performance between NPU and GPU – a potentially less power-efficient but more flexible system design strategy.

By focusing on key AI apps that business users rely on and ensuring they run well locally, Intel is also carving out a space for itself against ARM-based rivals like Apple, who still lean more on cloud computing than on-device capabilities.

While this kind of collaboration between device OEMs and chipmakers isn’t unusual, the deep focus on how partnerships like this could drive more explicit differentiation between platforms and PC brands could become the new normal for silicon and PC OEM partnerships. (We saw a similar effort between Intel and Lenovo last year with Lenovo’s Aura Edition PCs.) Broadly, Intel’s move toward working with PC OEMs to build systems for specific workloads and help optimize PCs for critical use cases, especially in the commercial segment, suggests that Intel understands that it can’t just put out parts for PCs anymore and expect orders to roll in – even in the Enterprise. The introduction of AI PCs has changed the dynamics of the PC market about as much as the arrival of Windows-on-Arm systems, and Intel understands that to hold on to its slipping market share, it needs to give PC buyers – consumers, in the SMB space, and the Enterprise – a reason not to select another platform.

For HP, the equation is somewhat similar: If Intel is pursuing deep partnerships with other PC OEMs to deliver uniquely tuned AI PCs for critical user categories, HP needs to do the same. This announcement signals that HP is in Intel’s inner circle and that it has uniquely optimized PCs to offer discerning customers with specific performance demands.

On-Device AI Boosts Privacy and Builds Trust

Running LLMs and productivity tools locally can make systems faster and more responsive and also frees users from the constraints of cloud services, connectivity limitations, and bandwidth challenges. An additional advantage is that running workloads locally is also more secure, as data being processed locally is easier to protect from interception and snooping. Two of the most important advantages of AI PCs are that they boost data privacy and security. And while still under-indexed, these privacy and performance benefits could help drive adoption in areas like finance, government, and healthcare, where trust is critical and data security rules are more stringent.

The challenge for now is that many of today’s most important productivity tools are still cloud-based, making AI PCs (particularly Copilot+ PCs) far too reliant on cloud-based AI processing than they need to be. In short, the hardware is ready, but many software platforms remain, with their AI workloads primarily cloud and subscription-based. This doesn’t mean organizations shouldn’t buy AI PCs now as part of their PC refresh schedule. What it does mean, however, is that the security and productivity gains promised by AI PCs may not fully materialize for some time yet.

AI PCs Still Early in the Game

While Intel’s Core Ultra chips offer solid local performance, many companies are waiting for the Panther Lake processor refresh (late 2025) and the Nova Lake processor (2026), which promise considerable performance improvements (50-80 Trillion Operations Per Second / TOPS on the NPU, with total system TOPS reaching for the 200 range). Again, these performance improvements are mostly academic at this point, since most AI-intensive applications continue to be cloud-based by default. That being said, when we start seeing some of these AI workloads truly shift to being handled on-device, these systems will be ready to deliver.

The current gap between system capabilities and what is operationally possible at the moment is the primary reason why demand for AI PCs from commercial PC buyers hasn’t been more aggressive. But this HP-Intel effort makes a solid case for these systems, especially for companies thinking about buying PCs that will be AI-ready when critical AI-accelerated productivity software starts to expand from the cloud to devices.

With over 500 hours of joint testing, HP has a data-backed case to make as one of the first movers in this space – helping shift AI PCs from theory to practice.

What to Watch:

HP’s success hinges on translating benchmarking gains into repeatable outcomes across a wider portfolio of enterprise workflows.

Intel’s momentum in this space could be challenged by AMD’s Ryzen AI 300 Series and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X platform, both of which are gaining OEM traction.

Enterprise customers may wait for higher TOPS performance from the upcoming Nova Lake and Panther Lake processors before scaling AI PC deployments.

The real-world gains showcased in HP’s testing will need to extend beyond launch partners to convince the broader enterprise market.

What is the new Spicy McMuffin from McDonald’s?

The Spicy McMuffin is McDonald’s latest offering to add heat to its morning lineup. The product maintains the core ingredients of the Egg McMuffin — an English muffin, egg, and cheese — but elevates the experience with a peppery hot sauce, perfect for those who like to kick off the day with bold flavor. It will also be available as a Spicy Sausage McMuffin and a Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg.

This isn’t McDonald’s first time flirting with heat. The brand previously won praise for its Spicy Chicken McNuggets, a limited-time item that became an instant hit. Now, McDonald’s continues its tradition of bold innovation, embracing spicy options that satisfy adventurous palates.

Snack Wrap: The Comeback Fans Never Gave Up On

The return of the Snack Wrap has generated genuine excitement among American customers. It’s a product that disappeared from the national menu in 2016 but never left the hearts of fans. Over the years, social media was flooded with nostalgic posts, memes, and even formal petitions begging McDonald’s to bring it back.

Now, finally, the Snack Wrap is back — and this time, it’s a permanent menu item. It features one of the brand-new McCrispy Strips, juicy all-white meat chicken, combined with shredded lettuce, cheese, and sauce, all wrapped in a soft flour tortilla.

Consumers can choose between two flavors:

Spicy Snack Wrap – with a habanero-inspired kick straight from the popular Spicy McCrispy sandwich.

Ranch Snack Wrap – with creamy garlic and onion notes that bring out that classic ranch flavor.

To make things even better, the Snack Wrap will be available à la carte or as part of a combo meal, including two Snack Wraps, medium fries, and a drink — all starting at just $2.99 USD.

McDonald’s openly acknowledged that consumer demand made the difference. In the company’s words: “They’re the ones who inspired us to make its return to the menu happen.” This initiative is part of McDonald’s broader effort to strengthen emotional connections with customers and respond more directly to their preferences.

McDonald’s by the Numbers: A Global Powerhouse

According to data from Statista, McDonald’s generated $25.92 billion USD in global revenue in 2024, with franchise restaurant sales reaching $120.93 billion. In its largest market, the United States, the company surpassed $10.4 billion in revenue that same year.

The company also continues to invest in its brand. In 2024, McDonald’s allocated $445 million USD to global advertising, and reported over 175 million active users in its loyalty program. This highlights a marketing strategy built on personalized experiences and deep emotional engagement with its global audience.

McDonald’s is also recognized as the most valuable restaurant brand in the world as of 2025, with an estimated brand value of $40.5 billion USD, surpassing Starbucks and KFC.

Why is this McDonald’s big announcement menu so important?

This important announcement is more than a publicity stunt — it marks a major milestone in how McDonald’s listens to and engages with its customers. By introducing the Spicy McMuffin and bringing back the beloved Snack Wrap, McDonald’s is showing that it’s in tune with modern tastes and nostalgia alike.

As consumer demand shapes menus more than ever, McDonald’s proves it’s ready to evolve without losing sight of its roots. This big announcement about the menu not only refreshes product offerings — it reinforces McDonald’s position as an industry leader that delivers what fans truly want.

Conclusion: A Test of Strategic Muscle Mondelez's peanut butter cracker recall is less a red flag and more a litmus test of its operational and strategic agility.","Mondelez International's voluntary recall of specific RITZ Peanut Butter Cracker Sandwich products in July 2025—a precautionary move to address mislabeling risks for peanut allergy sufferers—has reignited debates about the snack giant's operational resilience and brand trustworthiness. While the recall itself is narrow in scope, its implications for supply chain management, consumer safety, and financial performance warrant scrutiny. For investors, the question is clear: Does this incident underscore Mondelez's agility in managing risks, or does it expose vulnerabilities that could undermine its long-term growth?

The Recall: A Contained Risk, but a Strategic Litmus Test

The recall, affecting only select carton sizes (8-, 20-, and 40-packs of peanut butter crackers and a variety pack) with “Best When Used By” dates between November 2025 and January 2026, stemmed from a supplier error in film packaging rolls. This defect could have led to peanut butter-filled crackers being labeled as cheese varieties, posing a severe risk to allergy-sensitive consumers. While no injuries were reported, the recall underscores the criticality of supplier quality control in Mondelez's global supply chain.

Mondelez's swift response—issuing a voluntary recall, establishing a 24/7 consumer hotline, and collaborating with the FDA—demonstrates a commitment to consumer safety. However, the incident raises questions about oversight of third-party suppliers, particularly in high-risk areas like allergen labeling. For a company whose brand equity relies heavily on trust (think Oreo, Cadbury, and belVita), such lapses could erode confidence among vulnerable customer segments.

Financial Performance: The Recall's Minimal Impact, but Bigger Storms Loom

The recall's financial consequences appear negligible. Analysts estimate the affected products represent a tiny fraction of Mondelez's $36.4 billion 2024 revenue, and the company has not disclosed recall-related costs in its Q1 2025 results. Instead, the quarter's struggles—organic revenue growth of 3.1% versus a 3.5% expectation, and a 23% year-over-year decline in adjusted EPS to $0.74—were driven by macroeconomic headwinds like cocoa cost inflation (up 70% year-on-year) and unfavorable currency impacts.

Mondelez's margin pressures are systemic, not recall-induced. Gross margins fell to 26.1% in Q1 2025, down 2,500 basis points year-on-year, as cocoa prices and transportation costs surged. The company is countering these challenges with pricing strategies (net pricing contributed 3.1% to organic revenue growth) and cost-cutting, including savings from its “Simplify to Grow” program. While the recall's impact is muted, investors must assess whether Mondelez can navigate broader inflationary pressures and sustain its 2025 outlook of a 10% adjusted EPS decline.

Analyst Optimism vs. Operational Realities: Where Does the Stock Stand?

Despite Q1's misses, analysts remain cautiously bullish. Institutions like BofA Securities and Stifel have raised price targets, citing Mondelez's ability to outperform consensus EPS estimates even amid margin contraction. The stock's beta of 0.49 signals lower volatility than the broader market, and its 19.7% six-month price return reflects investor confidence in its defensive snack business.

However, risks persist. Cocoa prices—Mondelez's largest raw material cost—remain volatile, and geopolitical tensions (e.g., Russia-Ukraine war) could further disrupt supply chains. The recall, while minor, highlights the need for Mondelez to invest in supplier audits and digital traceability systems to prevent future incidents.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Dip, but Mind the Risks

Mondelez's stock (MDLZ) currently trades at 21.5x 2025 adjusted EPS estimates, a discount to its five-year average P/E of 24.3. With a 2.3% dividend yield and a history of shareholder returns ($2.1 billion in buybacks and dividends in Q1 alone), the stock offers defensive appeal.

Buy Signal:

- The recall's limited scope and proactive management suggest Mondelez's brand trust is intact.

- Analysts' upward revisions and the company's reaffirmed 2025 guidance reflect confidence in its cost-saving and pricing strategies.

Hold or Sell Signal:

- Cocoa inflation and margin pressures remain unresolved. If input costs persist beyond 2025, growth could stall.

- A repeat of supply chain errors, especially involving safety-critical issues, could damage brand equity.

Conclusion: A Test of Strategic Muscle

Mondelez's peanut butter cracker recall is less a red flag and more a litmus test of its operational and strategic agility. While the incident underscores the importance of supplier oversight, the company's swift action and broader financial resilience suggest it can weather this storm. For investors, the stock presents a compelling entry point—if they're willing to bet on Mondelez's ability to navigate inflation and maintain its premium snack market dominance.",,N,,2025-07-08 17:05:49.767448

Compliance Costs: A Hidden Drag on Valuations The judgment's financial impact is immediate, but its operational consequences loom larger.
- Reputational Damage: Long-term care facilities may reduce CVS's market share, and federal programs could impose stricter oversight, raising compliance costs.
However, its higher legal exposure and governance risks may warrant a discount to reflect downside scenarios.
- Monitor DOJ actions: The Gilead settlement and ongoing scrutiny of speaker programs could amplify sector-wide compliance costs.","The $949 million legal judgment against CVS Health for its subsidiary Omnicare's fraudulent prescription practices marks a seismic moment for the healthcare sector. This ruling, which could ultimately cost CVS over $400 million in penalties and treble damages, exposes systemic governance failures and compliance risks that investors must now factor into their valuation of healthcare giants. For CVS, the verdict is not just a liability on its balance sheet—it's a stark warning about the consequences of merging under regulatory scrutiny and failing to address legacy liabilities.

The Legal Judgment: A Blueprint for Corporate Accountability

In April 2025, a federal jury found Omnicare liable for dispensing medications to elderly patients in long-term care facilities without valid prescriptions, resulting in over 3 million false claims submitted to Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE. The damages of $135.6 million could triple under the False Claims Act (FCA), while penalties of up to $28,619 per claim could push total costs toward $949 million. Critically, the jury held CVS liable as the parent company for “causing” these violations by failing to address compliance gaps it knew about for years.

CVS's defense—that state laws permitted the practices and that it lacked direct control—was rejected. The court emphasized that as a holding company, CVS was obligated to enforce compliance under a 2016 Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA), which required oversight of Omnicare's operations. This ruling underscores a seismic shift: parent companies can no longer shield themselves from subsidiary misconduct under federal programs.

Regulatory Gaps and Governance Failures

The case reveals two critical governance flaws at CVS:

1. Lax Oversight Post-Acquisition: CVS acquired Omnicare in 2015, but internal audits and compliance reviews from 2016–2018 identified systemic issues, including “roll-over” prescriptions (assigning new prescription numbers to expired ones). Despite these findings, CVS did not mandate corrective actions, violating its CIA obligations.

2. Strategic Ambiguity: In 2022, CVS briefly explored selling Omnicare, recognizing its non-strategic value, but reversed course in 2023. This indecision suggests a lack of clarity about Omnicare's risks versus rewards—a red flag for investors in a sector where regulatory missteps can metastasize.

The Omnicare case also highlights broader industry risks. The jury's focus on “speaker programs” and kickbacks (echoed in a parallel Gilead Sciences settlement) signals that the DOJ is targeting financial incentives influencing prescribing practices—a trend that could expose other healthcare firms to similar liabilities.

Compliance Costs: A Hidden Drag on Valuations

The judgment's financial impact is immediate, but its operational consequences loom larger. CVS faces:

- Penalties and Litigation Costs: Beyond the $949 million estimate, ongoing appeals and settlements could drain cash reserves.

- Reputational Damage: Long-term care facilities may reduce CVS's market share, and federal programs could impose stricter oversight, raising compliance costs.

- Future Liabilities: Other subsidiaries or acquisitions may harbor similar risks, creating a “liability time bomb” for investors.

For investors, this demands a reevaluation of CVS's valuation multiples. The company trades at a P/E ratio of 12.5x, slightly above peers like UnitedHealth (11.8x) and Humana (14.2x). However, its higher legal exposure and governance risks may warrant a discount to reflect downside scenarios.

Investment Implications: Scrutinize Balance Sheet Resilience

Investors must ask two questions:

1. Can CVS absorb this hit without diluting shareholder value? Its $13 billion cash balance and $5 billion in annual free cash flow may cushion the blow, but sustained legal costs could strain its dividend (currently yielding 1.8%).

2. Is management accountable? CEO Karen S. Lynch has emphasized “operational discipline,” but the Omnicare verdict suggests governance gaps persist.

Actionable advice:

- Underweight CVS until management demonstrates a clear plan to address compliance risks and legacy liabilities.

- Compare to peers: Firms like AmerisourceBergen (ABC) or Cardinal Health (CAH), which face fewer regulatory headwinds, may offer safer exposure to healthcare distribution.

- Monitor DOJ actions: The Gilead settlement and ongoing scrutiny of speaker programs could amplify sector-wide compliance costs.

Conclusion: A New Era of Accountability

The Omnicare judgment is a watershed moment for healthcare giants. It signals that regulators and juries will hold parent companies directly responsible for subsidiary misconduct—a paradigm shift with far-reaching consequences. Investors must now treat corporate governance and compliance rigor as core valuation metrics, not afterthoughts. For CVS, the path to recovery hinges on transparency, proactive risk management, and a willingness to divest businesses with unsustainable liabilities. Until then, the stock remains a cautionary tale of how governance failures can unravel even the largest healthcare empires.

Final note: This case is not isolated. Investors should pressure all healthcare firms to disclose compliance frameworks and legacy risks, lest they face similar reckoning.",,N,,2025-07-08 16:07:40.141400

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A federal judge ordered CVS Health's Omnicare unit to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages, in a whistleblower lawsuit claiming it fraudulently billed the U.S. government for invalid drug prescriptions.

In a Monday evening order, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan imposed a $542-million penalty for filing 3,342,032 false claims between 2010 and 2018.

McMahon also awarded $406.8 million of damages, representing three times the $135.6 million that a jury awarded on April 29.

The tripling was required under the federal False Claims Act, which lets whistleblowers sue on behalf of the federal government and share in recoveries.

CVS plans to appeal the judgment. The Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager bought Omnicare in 2015. Omnicare has asked McMahon to throw out the case or grant a new trial.

""This lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription dispensing recordkeeping issue that was allowed by law in many states,"" CVS said in a statement on Tuesday. ""There was no claim in this case that any patient paid for a medication they shouldn't have or that any patient was harmed.""

The lawsuit was filed in 2015 by Uri Bassan, a former Omnicare pharmacist in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and joined by the federal government in 2019.

They said Omnicare improperly billed Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare, which serves military personnel, for prescriptions for tens of thousands of patients in assisted-living facilities, group homes for people with special needs, and other long-term care facilities.

Omnicare allegedly assigned new prescription numbers without necessary paperwork and pharmacist approvals, after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.

McMahon rejected CVS' argument that a $948.8-million award violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment.

""This was a very big fraud on the government, one that lasted over almost a decade, and one that Omnicare was aware of but avoided taking steps to correct,"" the judge wrote.

McMahon found CVS jointly liable with Omnicare for $164.8 million of the penalties, after jurors found it failed to stop Omnicare from submitting 30% of the false claims after buying that company. CVS itself did not submit any claims.

The case is U.S. ex rel Bassan v. Omnicare Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-04179.

U.S. tariffs could pressure costs, though Levi’s management anticipates only a minimal impact on Q2 margins and is considering selective price increases. Organic revenue is expected to grow 3.5%–4.5% in Q2, with gross margin expanding by 80–100 basis points. For the full year, revenue is projected to decline by 1%–2% (excluding tariff effects), while gross margin is expected to rise by roughly 100 basis points to 61.6%.

The company has $7.8 Bil in current market capitalization. Revenue over the last twelve months was $6.3 Bil, and it was operationally profitable with $647 Mil in operating profits and net income of $356 Mil. While a lot will depend on how results stack up against consensus and expectations, understanding historical patterns might turn the odds in your favor if you are an event-driven trader.

There are two ways to do that: understand the historical odds and position yourself before the earnings release, or look at the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns post-earnings and position yourself accordingly after the earnings are released. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception.

Levi’s Historical Odds Of Positive Post-Earnings Return

There are 17 earnings data points recorded over the last five years, with 9 positive and 8 negative one-day (1D) returns observed. In summary, positive 1D returns were seen about 53% of the time.

However, this percentage decreases to 33% if we consider data for the last 3 years instead of 5.

Median of the 9 positive returns = 4.2%, and median of the 8 negative returns = -7.7%

Correlation Between 1D, 5D, and 21D Historical Returns

A relatively less risky strategy (though not useful if the correlation is low) is to understand the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, find a pair that has the highest correlation, and execute the appropriate trade. For example, if 1D and 5D show the highest correlation, a trader can position themselves “long” for the next 5 days if 1D post-earnings return is positive.

""We're likely to see higher multi-channel pricing dispersion if the Fair Pricing Policy weakens,"" predicted a portfolio manager tracking the e-commerce sector.","Court Order Signals Escalating Battle Over E-Commerce Giant's Market Power

The Competition Bureau of Canada has secured a Federal Court order compelling Amazon to turn over internal records related to its Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy, marking a significant escalation in the regulator's investigation into potential abuse of dominance by the e-commerce giant.

The court order, announced Tuesday, advances a probe examining whether Amazon's pricing policies effectively suppress competition and inflate prices for Canadian consumers. The investigation focuses specifically on rules that allow Amazon to penalize third-party sellers who offer lower prices on competing platforms.

""This is a watershed moment for Canadian antitrust enforcement,"" said a competition policy expert familiar with the case. ""It's the first major deployment of the Bureau's expanded investigative powers under the amended Competition Act, and signals a new willingness to confront dominant digital platforms.""

Inside Amazon's Pricing Vise

At the heart of the investigation is Amazon's Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy, implemented in 2017, which gives the company broad authority to suppress listings or remove the coveted ""Buy Box"" from sellers whose products are priced lower elsewhere online.

While Amazon frames the policy as consumer protection against price gouging, critics view it as a sophisticated mechanism to cement market dominance. When sellers cannot offer better deals on competing platforms without risking visibility on Amazon—where many generate the bulk of their revenue—rival marketplaces struggle to gain traction.

The timing aligns with sweeping changes to Canada's competition regime. Recent amendments dramatically increased potential penalties for abuse of dominance to the greater of C$25 million, three times the ill-gotten gains, or an eye-watering 3% of global annual revenue—which for Amazon could theoretically reach US$19 billion based on 2024 figures.

""The Competition Bureau is finally showing its teeth,"" remarked an industry analyst who requested anonymity. ""With the new penalty ceiling tied to global revenue rather than just Canadian operations, the stakes have fundamentally changed for multinational platforms.""

Policy Battlefield: Protection or Predation?

Amazon's fair pricing rules create a complex economic calculus for the thousands of Canadian businesses selling through its platform.

""Many sellers feel trapped in a paradox,"" explained a consultant who advises e-commerce businesses. ""Amazon's policy nominally promotes price consistency, but effectively functions as a most-favored-nation clause that prevents price competition across platforms.""

For consumers, the implications cut both ways. While Amazon's dominant position—estimated at 40% of Canada's US$66 billion e-commerce market—has delivered convenience and seemingly competitive prices, the Bureau is examining whether those prices could be artificially inflated by restricted competition.

The investigation presents Amazon with a delicate balancing act. The company must defend policies it considers fundamental to marketplace integrity while navigating an increasingly hostile regulatory landscape. Amazon has not yet commented on the court order, though the Bureau emphasized no conclusion of wrongdoing has been reached.

Trade Tensions Cast Long Shadow

The investigation unfolds against a backdrop of escalating U.S.-Canada trade frictions, particularly regarding Canada's Digital Services Tax that primarily affects American tech giants. With former President Trump returning to office and renewing tariff threats, the Amazon probe takes on additional geopolitical significance.

""There's undeniably a political dimension to this timing,"" observed a trade policy specialist. ""Canadian regulators are asserting sovereignty over their digital economy while facing pressure from Washington to tread carefully with American companies.""

This dynamic creates unusual investment considerations, as regulatory outcomes could be influenced by diplomatic calculations beyond the traditional antitrust framework.

Market Impact: Beyond the Headline Risk

For investors, the investigation presents both immediate concerns and longer-term strategic implications.

While the theoretical penalty ceiling is massive, precedent suggests a more modest outcome. ""The largest abuse-of-dominance administrative monetary penalty ever imposed in Canada is approximately C$100 million,"" noted a financial analyst specializing in regulatory risk. ""Even with political pressures, I'd handicap the cash impact between C$100-250 million, with an extreme scenario capped around C$1 billion.""

The more significant market impact may come from behavioral remedies rather than monetary penalties. If Amazon is forced to relax its pricing policy, the competitive landscape could shift substantially.

""We're likely to see higher multi-channel pricing dispersion if the Fair Pricing Policy weakens,"" predicted a portfolio manager tracking the e-commerce sector. ""That benefits multi-channel enablers like Shopify and potentially creates openings for traditional retailers with strong online operations—Walmart Canada, Canadian Tire, and Costco could all see margin improvements.""

The Road Ahead: Inflection Point for Digital Regulation

The Competition Bureau's next steps will be closely watched. Amazon has 30 days to comply with the document production order unless it seeks judicial review. Should the Bureau proceed to file an application with the Competition Tribunal, the case would move from investigation to litigation.

Critically, as of June 20, 2025, private parties can now file civil abuse-of-dominance claims under recent amendments—opening the door for competitors or affected sellers to pursue their own cases against Amazon.

""This could become a perfect storm of regulatory pressure,"" warned a corporate governance advisor. ""Public enforcement combined with private litigation creates unprecedented uncertainty for Amazon's Canadian operations.""

Investment Outlook: Positioning for Regulatory Outcomes

For traders navigating this regulatory uncertainty, several strategic approaches merit consideration.

A pairs trade going long Shopify while shorting Amazon could capitalize on Canadian sellers diversifying their channel strategy. Traditional retailers with established e-commerce operations may see relief rallies if Amazon voluntarily relaxes its pricing policies to avoid protracted litigation.

Paradoxically, any significant stock price decline in Amazon specifically tied to Canadian regulatory headlines likely presents a buying opportunity, as the financial impact—even in worst-case scenarios—represents only a fraction of the company's global operations and cash flow.

""The market consistently overreacts to headline regulatory risk,"" suggested an institutional investor. ""Smart money will focus on the structural remedies rather than the theoretical maximum penalties.""

Investors should recognize that this case potentially marks a turning point in how digital platforms are regulated globally. Canadian precedents could influence ongoing investigations in the EU and U.S., creating regulatory contagion that ultimately reshapes the competitive dynamics of online marketplaces.

Investment Thesis

SectionKey PointsWhat Happened- On 8 July 2025, the Competition Bureau forced Amazon to disclose records related to its Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy (MFPP).

- The Bureau is investigating if MFPP allows Amazon to (i) raise fees/prices, (ii) block rivals, or (iii) both.

- No wrongdoing found yet—this is an evidence-gathering step.Legal Changes- Abuse of dominance penalties now capped at C$25M, 3× benefit, or 3% global revenue (vs. C$10M pre-2022).

- Private lawsuits allowed from 20 June 2025 (AMP + damages).

- Compulsory disclosure now applies to market studies (used here).Financial Exposure- Global sales (2024): US$638B; 3P seller services: US$156B.

- Estimated Canadian GMV: ~US$26B.

- Potential AMP cap: Up to US$19.1B (3% global sales) or US$3.9B (3× benefit).

- Realistic penalty estimate: C$100-250M (70% chance), up to C$1B in extreme cases.Probability-Weighted Outcomes- 30%: Co-operative remedy (<C$50M + policy tweaks).

- 40%: Moderate AMP (C$100-250M) + conduct changes.

- 20%: Litigated loss (C$1-5B + algorithmic changes).

- 10%: Structural remedy (split 1P/3P—unlikely but high impact).Strategic Impacts- Sellers: More pricing flexibility if MFPP weakens (benefits Shopify).

- Competitors: Walmart, Costco, Best Buy may regain share.

- Regulatory risk: Could influence EU/FTC cases.

- Political risk: Potential U.S. tariff retaliation.Investment Angles- Long SHOP / Short AMZN: If sellers diversify.

- Long Canadian retailers (CTC-A, WMT): If Amazon relaxes MFPP.

- Buy AMZN dip: If penalty <US$1B (minor earnings impact).Next Steps- Amazon’s 30-day deadline to comply or appeal.

- Bureau’s decision to escalate to litigation.

- Private lawsuits possible after 20 June 2025.

- FTC timeline (Q4 2025) may sync with Canada’s case.

- U.S. election (Nov 2025) could trigger tariff risks.Bottom Line- Market underestimates risk due to new penalty scale (global revenue-based) and private lawsuits.

- Likely outcome: Conduct remedy (not huge fines), but long-term impact on Amazon’s pricing power.

- Opportunity: Buy AMZN dips; Shopify and multi-channel sellers may benefit.

Dive Brief:

Starbucks is offering performance-based compensation awards for executives tied to the Back to Starbucks plans, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 29.

The awards, which have a target value of $6 million, consist of a grant of performance-based restricted stock units that vest after fiscal year 2027.

Executives will receive the stock grants if the company meets cost-reduction goals, and leaders can earn twice the money if Starbucks hits additional goals related to “(i) the rollout of the Company’s Green Apron Service program, (ii) coffeehouse uplifts, (iii) new food and beverage platforms, and (iv) a reimagined Starbucks Rewards program,” according to the 8-K.

Dive Insight:

The stock awards show that among Starbucks’ key goals for the next two years, reducing costs is its highest priority. The additional goals are part of CEO Brian Niccol’s effort to renovate the brand and return its focus to the shopfloor.

The Green Apron Service model, for instance, “combines and unifies new service standards and expectations, changes to partner plays and deployment, streamlined routines, and our order sequencing algorithm,” Niccol said on the brand’s fiscal Q2 2025 earnings call.

Starbucks is in the middle of a transition toward an on-premise, coffeehouse focus. The early steps of that plan included the return of ceramic mugs for in-store orders, the restoration of the condiment coffee bar, improved seating, and handwritten notes on cups, according to the earnings call.

But going forward, Starbucks will renovate large numbers of cafes to meet new, warmer design standards. Niccol said on the earnings call that the chain was balancing the need for renovations with cost: “uplifts feel premium, but keep renovation costs down and minimize closure days.”

Starbucks also has cut a large number of menu items, but the new incentives signal the brand has a long-range strategy to use new menu items to draw in consumers. This menu strategy is likely to include coffee-forward beverages, in keeping with Niccol’s narrowed idea of the brand’s identity. The relatively new ristretto beverage platform is a good example of what a coffeehouse-focused menu innovation move might look like.

The changes to the rewards program, meanwhile, likely mean a shift away from aggressive discounting, given Niccol’s comments on the most recent earnings call. Starbucks, he said, had been discounting too much through its rewards program and was trying to build up transactions through the program that are not based on discounting.

Clarifying that the Capgemini merger does not reflect any immediate changes to the business process management (BPM) company’s global operations, Keshav Murugesh, Group CEO and a member of the Board of Directors of WNS, said the move seeks to address client demand for Agentic AI solutions.

“This transaction will address our global clients’ needs for Agentic AI-driven process transformation to deliver efficiency and agility through hyper-automation, while achieving superior business outcomes,” Murugesh told businessline, adding that Capgemini and WNS will together create a leader in Intelligent Operations, a solution that helps organisations transform activities and processes from back to front office by leveraging intelligent automation, decision intelligence, backed by data, AI and technology.

Murugesh said this will uniquely position the companies to support organisations in their AI-powered business process transformation, blending the capabilities needed from consulting, technology and platforms, to deep process and industry expertise.

When asked about workforce rationalisation, WNS said it maintains a strong presence in New York, London, and India, and is fully committed to all its markets.

“Our geographies are largely complementary to Capgemini’s. Until closing, which we expect to occur by the end of the year, Capgemini and WNS will continue to operate as independent companies. There are no immediate operational changes,” said Murugesh.

In the past, companies like Infosys have acquired BPM companies like Progeon Ltd to offer their clients a complete cost-effective solution based on service and technology outsourcing.

However, Sanchit Vir Gogia, Chief Analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research, pointed out that the Capgemini-WNS merger implies tighter coupling between AI engines and process delivery.

“This may benefit enterprises looking to embed GenAI across operations — invoice scanning, underwriting, agent assistance. But it could also mean less flexibility to run those processes independently or plug them into third-party clouds and AI systems,” said Gogia.

In sectors like insurance and utilities, where WNS has deep traction, platform gravity is especially strong. If Capgemini folds those vertical solutions into its broader transformation narratives, clients may see more value — but also more lock-ins. Early signals suggest WNS will retain its identity as a Business Services unit, but buyers will watch closely for changes in team structures and escalation paths, said Gogia.

Who: Kraft Heinz Foods Company is recalling 367,812 pounds of Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original.

Why: The recall is due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes.

Where: The recall is effective in the United States, the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

Kraft Heinz Foods Company has initiated a recall of more than 367,000 pounds of Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original, produced between April 24 and June 11, 2025, and distributed across the United States, the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong, due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes.

Therecall was announced on July 2 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).

The affected products include 12-ounce, 36-ounce and 48-ounce packages of Oscar Mayer Turkey BACON ORIGINAL, with specific universal product codes and “use by” dates ranging from July 18, 2025, to Sept. 4, 2025. The products also bear lot codes RS19, RS40 or RS42 and display the USDA mark of inspection on their labels.

Consumers urged to check refrigerators and not to consume products, recall states

The potential contamination was identified through laboratory testing conducted by Kraft Heinz, which indicated the presence of Listeria monocytogenes.

Kraft Heinz urges consumers to check their refrigerators and freezers for the recalled products and advises not to consume the affected items.

“Consumption of food contaminated with Lm can cause listeriosis, a serious infection,” the recall notice states. Listeriosis can lead to severe health issues, particularly in older adults, individuals with weakened immune systems and pregnant women and their newborns.

Kraft Heinz is actively working to address the issue by notifying retailers and ensuring the recalled products are removed from shelves.

Consumers seeking more information can contact Kraft Heinz’s consumer hotline at 1-800-280-7185 or email consumerrelations@kraftheinz.com. Additionally, the FSIS website provides updates on the Kraft Heinz turkey bacon recall and retail distribution lists.

Kraft Heinz says it has not received any reports of illness or injury related to the recall so far. The company is not currently facing legal action over the recall, but Top Class Actions follows recalls closely as they sometimes lead to class action lawsuits.

Recently, Boar’s Head Provisions Co. agreed to a $3.1 million settlement to resolve class action claims that it sold recalled meat products contaminated with listeria.

But it can be hard to determine the skills employees will need to adapt to these new ways of working.
AI literacy training should focus on integrating job-specific knowledge with critical thinking, providing hands-on opportunities to engage with Gen AI.
Including AI and data in HR skills strategies HR leaders must embrace AI and data to inform skills strategies.
Don’t forget the human element To succeed in the age of AI, HR leaders must ensure AI adoption respects and enhances human judgement, empathy and creativity.","For the first time in history, we're witnessing up to five generations working side by side – the silent generation, baby boomers, Gen X, millennials and Gen Z – with Gen Alpha also about to enter employment age.

All these generations are currently facing a common challenge: learning how to use AI effectively in the workplace. As generative AI adoption accelerates across enterprises, upskilling a multigenerational workforce presents a unique opportunity for HR leaders to improve productivity and engagement. Perceptions of AI and approaches to learning differ across the generations, so how can organisations equip employees of different age groups with the right skills to succeed in the age of AI?

Changing perceptions

One of the first hurdles is shifting the perception that AI is intimidating or overly complex, which could impact adoption in groups who don't consider themselves 'digitally savvy’. To change these perceptions, HR leaders need to empower employees to lead this transformation.

Today’s workforce has successfully navigated multiple technological disruptions. The AI revolution is simply the latest development. The technology promises to automate repetitive tasks, freeing up time to focus on strategic work. This makes experience and business insight valuable attributes for employees. At Capgemini, I've seen many older colleagues embrace this change and sign up for AI training.

Redesigning career pathways

More than half of business leaders (56 per cent) and employees (54 per cent) believe AI is transforming how they work, according to Capgemini research. This will require reshaping job functions and workflows across all organisational levels.

But it can be hard to determine the skills employees will need to adapt to these new ways of working. HR leaders must re-evaluate workforce planning, roles and career pathways in light of the changes AI might bring.

Success depends on how well employees across generations integrate AI into their daily work. Only 16 per cent of employees report receiving ample support to develop generative AI skills and 46 per cent of leaders have been through formal Gen AI training.

As modern businesses navigate a landscape defined by significant technological change, they must cultivate the right skills across all age groups to harness AI effectively.

Embracing continuous learning and inclusive upskilling

A blanket approach to upskilling risks overwhelming employees and widening inequalities. Instead, HR functions need to embed learning as a continuous part of work, not an additional burden.

Embedding AI training into everyday workflows normalises learning and ensures all employees can train at their own pace according to their career goals. AI literacy training should focus on integrating job-specific knowledge with critical thinking, providing hands-on opportunities to engage with Gen AI. These initiatives can empower employees of any age to take on more strategic roles and enhance their sense of purpose.

Moreover, AI itself can facilitate accessibility by simplifying complex processes and bridging skill gaps between generations. Contrary to stereotypes, older professionals often find AI to be a great equaliser. Many AI tools feature intuitive interfaces that are accessible for people from all age groups. This allows experienced employees to leverage their deep industry knowledge alongside AI, potentially giving them an advantage over more tech-savvy but less experienced colleagues. The key lies in recognising individual strengths rather than relying on generational labels and promoting cross-generational learning between younger and older employees.

Including AI and data in HR skills strategies

HR leaders must embrace AI and data to inform skills strategies. Age-inclusion efforts require regular audits of engagement, promotion, skills proficiency and performance data.

Continuous employee feedback is also important for understanding the effectiveness of AI training programmes. This enables HR professionals to identify skills gaps, areas of improvement and biases, which helps ensure equitable development opportunities for everyone.

AI tools can also create a level playing field in recruitment and performance evaluation by removing human bias. This shift benefits older professionals particularly, creating more opportunities for career progression and meaningful contribution to the workplace.

Another important factor to consider is enabling employees to share their experiences and learn from each other. Creating forums such as multigenerational internal networks enables employees to share experiences and demystify age-related stereotypes.

Reverse mentoring, where younger employees guide older colleagues on new technologies, is another way to encourage intergenerational collaboration.

Don’t forget the human element

To succeed in the age of AI, HR leaders must ensure AI adoption respects and enhances human judgement, empathy and creativity. This tandem approach creates a workforce that is technically skilled, resilient, adaptable and connected.

As organisations face an unpredictable future, HR's role in guiding inclusive adoption of AI becomes paramount. By fostering environments where multigenerational teams thrive through mutual respect, tailored development and continuous learning, businesses can unlock innovation and gain a competitive advantage in the age of AI.",https://cached.imagescaler.hbpl.co.uk/resize/scaleHeight/150/cached.offlinehbpl.hbpl.co.uk/news/OMP/CarolynMillerCorpPhotoHeadshotholly.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 17:05:31.462288

The deal, which is subject to approval by the workers, includes higher pay, larger pension contributions, health benefit and welfare improvements, and other changes. Workers will vote on the proposal over a three-day period that begins Wednesday.

The unions reached the agreement following what they said were more than 40 hours of talks with the grocers. UFCW locals 135, 324, 770, 1167, 1428 and 1442 took part in the talks that led to the tentative agreement, which would cover workers for Kroger’s Ralphs banner and Albertsons’ namesake banner as well as its Vons and Pavilions supermarket chains.

The agreement comes just weeks after workers for the grocery chains voted to authorize an unfair labor practice strike to protest what labor leaders from UFCW Locals 324 and 770 described as “labor violations throughout negotiations that have prevented workers from getting the fair contract they deserve.”

The alleged infractions by Kroger and Albertsons included “breaking the law by surveilling and interrogating employees in their stores, interfering with their discussions with union representatives, equating union support with disloyalty, and preventing them from wearing union insignia,” UFCW Local 770 said in a June 27 statement.

Albertsons said in a statement that the unfair labor practice allegations “are without merit,” adding that it remains ""committed to productive discussions with the UFCW.”

“We respect the rights of workers to engage in collective bargaining and are negotiating in good faith to achieve a balanced agreement that rewards our associates, benefits our customers and is sustainable for our company in the competitive grocery industry,” the company said.

Favorable safety profile supports long-term use: No new safety signals were identified with Caplyta, with headache as the only adverse event occurring at ≥5% and twice the rate of placebo.

Significant unmet need in schizophrenia care: With up to 2.8 million US adults affected by schizophrenia and only 40% receiving adequate treatment, Caplyta may help fill a critical treatment gap.

Johnson & Johnson announced that it has submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA, seeking an expanded indication for Caplyta (lumateperone) to include relapse prevention in schizophrenia. According to the company, the sNDA is based on positive data from a Phase III randomized withdrawal trial, which demonstrated that Caplyta significantly prolonged time to relapse compared to placebo.1

How Effective is Caplyta in Preventing Schizophrenia Relapse?

“For people living with schizophrenia, relapses can be devastating as they disrupt lives, undo hard-earned treatment progress toward patients’ goals, and increase the risk of hospitalization with each episode,” said Christoph U. Correll, MD, clinical professor of psychiatry, Zucker School of Medicine, Hofstra/Northwell, New York, in a press release. “Caplyta substantially lowers the chance of relapse for patients compared to placebo, which is often a major source of anxiety and suffering for them and their families.”

Phase III Trial Results Support Expanded Indication

The double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of Caplyta compared to placebo.

The primary endpoint of the trial was time to relapse during the 26-week double-blind treatment phase. The key secondary endpoint was delayed time to all-cause discontinuation, including relapse.

Results show that time to relapse was significantly longer in patients receiving Caplyta compared to those receiving placebo (p=0.0002). Patients treated with Caplyta demonstrated a 63% reduction in risk of relapse compared to placebo (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 0.37, [0.22, 0.65]).

Caplyta also demonstrated a significantly delayed time to all-cause discontinuation compared to placebo during the double-blind phase (p=0.0007).

Headache was the most common adverse event, occurring in at least 5% of patients and at twice the rate seen with placebo.

The safety profile of Caplyta was consistent with previous studies and no new safety signals were identified.1

Global and US Schizophrenia Burden Underscores Unmet Need

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 24 million people are affected by schizophrenia globally, which is equal to approximately one in every 222 people. Those affected by schizophrenia are two to three times more likely to die prematurely than the general population, primarily due to physical illnesses such as cardiovascular, metabolic, and infectious diseases. Onset is most common between late adolescence and the twenties, with men typically experiencing earlier onset than women.

Currently, half of patients in mental health facilities are living with schizophrenia; however, only 31.3% of people with schizophrenia receive specialist mental health care. WHO suggests that mental health facilities are not currently providing effective care for patients with schizophrenia.2

According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the prevalence of schizophrenia in the United States is estimated to be between 0.25% and 0.64%.3 According to Johnson & Johnson, this equates to 2.8 million adults, with around 40% receiving proper medical care. It is also estimated that patients with schizophrenia experience around nine relapses over the course of six years.1

Long-Term Data Reinforce Caplyta’s Role in Neuropsychiatric Care

“Relapse prevention is a critical goal for the long-term care and management of this debilitating disorder,” said Bill Martin, PhD, global therapeutic area head, neuroscience, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, in the press release. “These Phase III results provide compelling evidence of meaningful relapse prevention, which is critical in preserving long-term patient stability, breaking the cycle of hospitalization, and helping to control symptom progression. We’re committed to building on the decade of research reinforcing the robust efficacy, proven safety, and favorable tolerability of Caplyta and providing additional data to support the long-term use of this medicine in neuropsychiatric disorders.”

As the luxury automaker grapples with slowing demand in key markets, geopolitical tensions, and the costly shift to electrification, its ability to balance innovation with financial discipline will determine its future. Here's how Porsche is adapting—and whether investors should bet on its resilience.

Product Innovation: Electrification as a Double-Edged Sword

Porsche's push into electrification is both a strategic imperative and a financial burden. The all-electric Macan, launched in 2024, has become a critical growth driver, accounting for 14% of deliveries in early 2025. The model's success—14,185 units sold in Q1 alone—highlights consumer appetite for high-performance EVs. Porsche also plans an all-electric Cayenne, its best-selling model, by 2026, signaling its commitment to electrifying its core lineup.

However, this transition is costly. Special expenses for 2025 have surged to €1.3 billion, up from €800 million, due to battery tech investments and supply chain adjustments. The company acquired a majority stake in V4Smart GmbH & Co. KG to secure lithium-ion round cells, while its partnership with Varta AG aims to stabilize battery production. These moves underscore Porsche's resolve to control its supply chain—a necessity in an era of global competition for EV components.

Yet Porsche is hedging its bets. It has delayed plans to independently scale high-performance battery production via its subsidiary Cellforce Group, opting instead to focus on partnerships. This pragmatism reflects a recognition that electrification's ROI requires patience.

Market Challenges: Balancing Global Demand and Geopolitical Risks

Porsche's sales data reveal stark regional disparities. In Q1 2025, deliveries fell 7.9% globally to 71,470 units, driven by a 42% decline in China, its second-largest market. Intense competition in China's luxury EV segment—where local brands like NIO and Li Auto dominate—has forced Porsche to adopt a “value over volume” strategy. This means prioritizing brand prestige over mass sales, even as rivals undercut prices.

Meanwhile, North America saw a 37% surge in deliveries to 43,577 vehicles in H1 2025, partly offsetting losses elsewhere. Yet U.S. import tariffs imposed in April 2025 have strained margins, contributing to Porsche's revised 2025 forecasts.

The stock, down 12% year-to-date as of Q2 2025, reflects investor skepticism about near-term profitability. But Porsche's long-term focus on premium differentiation—via bespoke options like its Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur (offering over 1,000 customization choices)—could insulate it from price wars.

Financial Adjustments: Cost-Cutting to Offset Short-Term Pain

Porsche's financial adjustments are aggressive. The company aims to cut 3,900 jobs by 2029 through attrition and voluntary retirement programs, while halting fixed-term contracts for 2,000 roles. The “Road to 20” cost-reduction program targets a return to its long-term goal of >20% operating margins, down from 14.1% in 2024.

Revised 2025 forecasts reveal the trade-off: Sales revenue is now projected at €37–38 billion (vs. an earlier €39–40 billion), with operating margins dropping to 6.5–8.5% (from 10–12%). Yet Porsche is prioritizing structural health over short-term gains. CFO Dr. Jochen Breckner emphasized that these measures are “sustainably strengthening Porsche for the future.”

Investment Considerations: Is Now the Time to Bet on Porsche?

Porsche's strategy is clear: double down on EVs and exclusivity while cutting costs to preserve margins. But investors must weigh risks:

- Geopolitical Uncertainty: Supply chain disruptions, trade wars, and China's regulatory shifts could prolong headwinds.

- EV Adoption Speed: A slower-than-anticipated shift to electric vehicles could strain cash flows.

- Brand Dilution: Expanding EVs without sacrificing Porsche's “high-performance” identity is a tightrope walk.

The Bull Case: Porsche's brand equity, premium pricing power, and disciplined cost management could position it as a leader in luxury EVs. Its partnerships in battery tech and the delayed Cellforce expansion suggest a smarter use of capital.

The Bear Case: Near-term profitability is under pressure, and competition—especially from Tesla's Model X/Y and local EV players—is intensifying.

Final Analysis

Porsche's resilience hinges on executing a delicate balance: accelerate electrification without overextending financially, maintain exclusivity in oversaturated markets, and adapt to geopolitical shifts. For investors, this is a long-term play. While short-term volatility persists, Porsche's strategic moves suggest it's building a foundation for sustained premium growth.

Recommendation: Hold for long-term investors with a 5+ year horizon, but avoid if seeking quick gains. Monitor EV adoption rates and China's regulatory environment closely—these will be the ultimate tests of Porsche's resilience.

As such, IH failed to demonstrate — because it cannot do so — market power and the exercise of such power to harm competition.
Instead, it is well established that an injunction should issue to prevent ongoing or threatened violations of the antitrust laws.”","Johnson & Johnson’s Biosense Webster subsidiary has asked a federal judge in Central California for a judgment as a matter of law to throw out a jury’s antitrust verdict.

Last month, U.S. District Judge James V. Selna tripled the damages in the case to $442 million, a practice enabled under federal antitrust law. In May, the jury had found in favor of Scottsdale, Arizona–based Innovative Health on all of the questions over whether J&J had violated sections of the federal Sherman Antitrust Act and California’s Cartwright Act through tying and other anticompetitive practices, allegedly maintaining a monopoly on cardiac mapping catheters and squeezing out reprocessors such as Innovative.

In its motion for summary judgment filed on July 3, J&J argues that the jury failed to make a reasonable conclusion based on the evidence.

J&J’s lawyers said in the motion:

“The fundamental premise of IH’s tying theory was that Biosense possessed market power in a distinct market for clinical support services (a market that, as described below, was not shown). Biosense provided that service for free. This left IH to hang its case on the claim that Biosense used its market power to charge supracompetitive prices for its original equipment manufacturer … catheters in separate alleged single-brand catheter markets, thereby barring competition rather than simply competing with a competitor. But at trial, IH presented no evidence that Biosense was charging supracompetitive prices. As such, IH failed to demonstrate — because it cannot do so — market power and the exercise of such power to harm competition. In fact, the evidence showed that Biosense charged competitive prices, and the quality of these products continuously improved.”

In a motion replying to a separate motion seeking to prevent a permanent injunction, Innovative’s Health’s lawyers described Johnson & Johnson’s Biosense Webster as a proven monopolist. “Requiring Innovative to play litigation whack-a-mole against Biosense would thwart the Sherman Act’s purpose to protect market competition. Instead, it is well established that an injunction should issue to prevent ongoing or threatened violations of the antitrust laws.”",https://www.massdevice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gavel-Medtech.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 13:13:31.320115

Kraft Heinz recalls 360,000 pounds of turkey bacon over scary concerns

Kraft Heinz (KHC) , a company behind popular brands such as Kool-Aid, Jell-O, and Oscar Mayer, is recalling around 367,812 pounds of fully cooked turkey bacon that might have been contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.

Listeria is a type of bacteria that thrives in cool and damp environments, even at temperatures as low as 31°F. When food comes into contact with Listeria, the bacteria spreads quickly. It is most commonly found in luncheon meats, such as dry sausages and hot dogs, but also in raw milk, ham, chicken salads, and more.

What happens if you eat food contaminated with Listeria?

You can get listeriosis, an infection that can be serious. Consumers especially vulnerable to listeriosis are pregnant women and their newborns, older people (65+), and those with weakened immune systems.

Infection during pregnancy is hazardous and can even lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or life-threatening infection of the newborn, according to the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). Pregnant women with listeriosis often only have fever and similar flu-like symptoms.

Those who are not pregnant might have headaches, stiff necks, fevers, muscle pain, loss of balance, and convulsions. While the first symptoms might appear in a few hours to three days after consuming contaminated food, sometimes they take up to 2 months to appear.

While healthy people can have mild symptoms when infected with Listeria, older people and those with weakened immune systems can die.

More than 90% of people with listeriosis end up hospitalized, often in intensive care units, according to data from the FDA.

FSIS urges shoppers not to consume these products

The recalled Oscar Mayer Turkey BACON ORIGINAL was produced from April 24, 2025, through June 11, 2025, and includes the following products:

12-oz. Vacuum-packed packages with universal product code (UPC) ""071871548601"" with dates ranging from July 18 to August 02 and lot code “RS40.”

Hershey on Tuesday named Wendy’s chief executive Kirk Tanner as its next CEO effective Aug. 18, according to a company statement.

The announcement brings Tanner back to the CPG industry, where he spent more than three decades at PepsiCo. Among other senior roles, he served as CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America, overseeing the growth of Pepsi, Gatorade and Mountain Dew.

Tanner replaces Michele Buck, who in January announced her intention to retire after eight years in Hershey’s top role. Buck will work closely with Tanner in a senior advisory capacity during the transition.

Dive Insight:

As CEO, Tanner will be responsible for building on Buck’s efforts to transform Hershey into a snacking powerhouse and diversify beyond sweets. Buck oversaw the company’s aggressive move into gummies and salty snacks and led some of the largest acquisitions in Hershey’s history, including a $1.6 billion purchase of SkinnyPop owner Amplify.

“Michele architected and championed Hershey’s Leading Snacking Powerhouse vision, guiding the company through multiple phases of transformational growth,” said Mary Kay Haben, lead independent director and chair of Hershey’s CEO Search Committee. “The impact of her courageous leadership, evolution of portfolio and capabilities, and authentic connection to people leave a legacy and a roadmap that positions Hershey well for the future.”

Still, Tanner joins at a precarious time for the snacking industry, which has experienced broad declines as consumers tighten their wallets and look for healthier alternatives. Hershey reported close to a 14% sales drop in the first quarter.

The candy giant also has struggled with higher cocoa costs amid fast-changing tariffs. The company expects tariffs to cost between $15 million and $20 million during the second quarter and asked the White House for an exemption for duties on cocoa.

At PepsiCo, Tanner led a transformation of the company's $28 billion beverage business, scaling brands, including Pure Leaf and bubly, and overseeing new innovation to address evolving consumer trends.

In addition to leading PepsiCo’s North American beverages business, Tanner also held several other senior leadership positions, including president of PepsiCo Global Foodservice and senior vice president of Frito-Lay North America’s West Division.

“Kirk is a proven, high-impact leader in the food and beverage industry with a great combination of customer and consumer passion, commercial acumen and operational scale,” Haben said. “His deep experience in snacks, beverages, M&A and innovation—combined with public company CEO and board roles—makes him well suited to lead Hershey into the future.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/orTfmCkfPC8KE1L8Cx1WZc6bLb8r3f249BI-ZXtaNEU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTUxMzI0Njk0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-08 14:12:53.207855

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider.

Consumption of food contaminated with Lm can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS is concerned that some products may be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

For fiscal 2025, analysts expect the investment manager to report an adjusted EPS of $2.02, down 15.5% from $2.39 in fiscal 2024. However, EPS is anticipated to grow 9.9% year-over-year to $2.22 in fiscal 2026.

Shares of Franklin Resources have risen 10.9% over the past 52 weeks, lagging behind both the S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 11.9% gain and the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLF) 26.8% return over the same period.

Shares of Franklin Resources climbed over 7% on May 2, driven by stronger-than-expected Q2 2025 revenue of $2.1 billion, which beat the estimate. The company also reported net income of $151.4 million, up 21.9% from the prior year, alongside a higher operating margin of 6.9%. Additionally, better-than-expected investment management fees of $1.67 billion and stable adjusted EPS of $0.47, which met consensus, supported investor confidence despite AUM and long-term net outflow challenges.

Analysts' consensus view on Franklin Resources’ stock is cautious, with an overall “Hold” rating.

Known as “Instacart Shoppers,” these workers play a valuable role in the grocery technology company’s ongoing growth in retail vendor space, as evidenced by the ongoing release of new earnings opportunities and safety features for them.

In its latest shareholder letter, Instacart said that it began piloting several new initiatives to provide its gig workers with more ways to earn money, including taking videos of store shelves to improve inventory transparency, letting them deliver customer orders from a distributor’s warehouse and allowing an Instacart shopper in one store the chance to find out-of-stock items from an order handled by another worker at another store.

Relying on its workers to track on-shelf inventory is “much more real-time than what we get from retailers,” then-CEO Fidji Simo told investors in February.

Along with earnings, Instacart has also revamped how it scores its workers. In April, the company unveiled plans to roll out a new tool that ranks how well its workers shop for customers with a sliding scale from “Needs work” to “Standard” to “Good” based on the number and condition of items the worker selected for their orders completed in the last 90 days.

That new tool is factoring into new and updated reward tiers as part of the Cart Star shopper rewards programInstacart revealed at the end of last month.

Conclusion: The Next Decade's Infrastructure Alpha Lies in MENA Standard Chartered's dual focus on Abbas Husain's dealmaking and Philippe Tabouis' cross-border structuring positions it as the region's banker of choice for green infrastructure.","The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is undergoing a seismic shift from fossil fuel dependency to a sustainable energy future, driven by net-zero commitments, fiscal pragmatism, and geopolitical realignments. At the epicenter of this transformation is Standard Chartered, whose recent strategic moves under leaders like Philippe Tabouis and Abbas Husain position it as a pivotal financier of the region's $2 trillion clean energy pipeline. For investors, this presents a rare convergence of policy tailwinds, scalable financing tools, and underserved infrastructure demand—arguing for immediate allocation to infrastructure funds or ETFs exposed to MENA's renewable transition.

Leadership Pivot: Tabouis and Husain's Dual Play

Standard Chartered's infrastructure strategy is being steered by two key figures:

- Abbas Husain, Global Head of Infrastructure and Development Finance, focuses on structuring deals in renewables, green hydrogen, and public-private partnerships (PPPs) across MENA and EMEA. His team has pioneered sustainability-linked loans (SLLs) and green bond frameworks to align financing with environmental metrics.

- Philippe Tabouis, Head of Infrastructure and Development Finance in Europe, brings Société Générale's expertise in cross-border project finance. His mandate includes bridging European capital markets with MENA's energy transition, exemplified by his role in the $8.5 billion Neom Green Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia.

Together, they are leveraging Standard Chartered's network to capture first-mover advantage in sectors like green hydrogen (a $13 billion market by 2030) and solar/wind energy, which now account for 40% of new MENA power capacity.

The Renewable Energy Gold Rush

MENA's energy transition is not merely theoretical—it is already financing billions in projects:

1. Neom Green Hydrogen: Tabouis' team acted as mandated lead arranger for this landmark project, which will produce 1.2 million tons of green hydrogen annually using solar and wind power. The deal's success underscores the viability of large-scale green loans, which now command premium pricing due to their ESG alignment.

2. Saudi Solar Dominance: Standard Chartered has underwritten over $5 billion in solar projects in Saudi Arabia, including the 1.5 GW Sakaka Solar Plant. These projects are structured as PPPs, with sovereign wealth funds like Public Investment Fund (PIF) sharing risk with international investors.

3. Qatar's Petrochemical Evolution: Even in hydrocarbons, the bank is pivoting toward sustainability—its role in the Ras Laffan Petrochemicals project included green financing terms requiring reduced carbon intensity.

PPPs and Policy Liberalization: The EMEA Catalyst

Governments in the region are accelerating PPP frameworks to attract private capital, particularly for water infrastructure and digital connectivity:

- Abu Dhabi's Noor II Street Lighting Loan: A $200 million PPP deal structured by Standard Chartered, demonstrating how even smaller-scale projects can attract institutional investors through risk-sharing mechanisms.

- Desalination Plants: The Rawabi desalination project in Saudi Arabia, financed via green loans, highlights the bank's ability to monetize water scarcity—a $23 billion opportunity in MENA by 2030.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and Asian Development Bank (ADB) are critical partners, co-financing deals and mitigating geopolitical risks. Meanwhile, policy reforms—such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Authority (PIA) privatization roadmap—are unlocking trillions in dormant infrastructure assets.

Financing the Transition: DFIs, ECAs, and Capital Markets

Standard Chartered's edge lies in its hybrid financing toolkit:

- Sustainability-Linked Loans (SLLs): These instruments, now used in 60% of the bank's MENA deals, tie interest rates to green targets (e.g., carbon reduction).

- Capital Market Refinancing: “Soft-mini perm” loans (short-term debt used to bridge to long-term bonds) are enabling projects like Neom to access yield-hungry bond markets.

- Institutional Investor Appetite: Over $2 trillion in global infrastructure capital is chasing MENA's pipeline, with Standard Chartered acting as a gateway for pensions and sovereign funds.

Note: STAN's outperformance since 2023 reflects growing demand for its regional expertise in sustainable finance.

Investment Thesis: Allocate Now to MENA's Green Pipeline

The convergence of policy momentum, capital market innovation, and underserved infrastructure demand creates a multi-year opportunity. Investors should prioritize:

1. Sector-Specific ETFs: The iShares Global Infrastructure ETF (IFRA) holds exposure to firms like Siemens Gamesa (wind) and Engie (utilities), while tracking projects in Saudi Arabia and Egypt.

2. Green Infrastructure Funds: BlackRock Global Renewable Power Fund and Morgan Stanley Sustainable Infrastructure Fund directly target PPPs in solar/wind and green hydrogen.

3. Geographic Plays: Allocate to ETFs like iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF (SAUD), which benefits from the kingdom's $1.3 trillion energy transition plan.

Risk Factors: Geopolitical instability, delayed policy reforms, and overvaluation in crowded renewable sectors. Mitigate these by focusing on debt instruments (e.g., green bonds) or funds with local partner expertise.

Conclusion: The Next Decade's Infrastructure Alpha Lies in MENA

Standard Chartered's dual focus on Abbas Husain's dealmaking and Philippe Tabouis' cross-border structuring positions it as the region's banker of choice for green infrastructure. With DFIs, ECAs, and institutional capital now aligned, the time to act is now. Investors who allocate to MENA's renewable pipeline and EMEA's digital infrastructure will capture the next wave of returns in a world hungry for sustainable growth.

Note: MENA's share of global clean energy investment rose from 12% to 21% between 2023 and 2024—a trend likely to accelerate.",,N,,2025-07-08 16:09:08.224359

AI and machine learning are transforming private equity exit strategies by accelerating due diligence, enhancing portfolio monitoring and enabling faster, data-driven buyer analysis.

Advanced tech tools, including predictive analytics and ESG dashboards, not only support smarter investment decisions but also boost exit attractiveness by showcasing long-term value creation.

The mid-market and small-cap private equity sector is facing turbulence, driven by inflation and political instability, fueling uncertainty and volatility.

Due to this, firms are prioritizing environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices, emerging markets and technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) for quick and accurate investment calls.

Fundraising remains a challenge, with over 70% of investors citing economic uncertainty and market volatility as top concerns.

Globally, private equity firms are sitting on $2.1 trillion, which can be used for new opportunities (“dry powder”). Most firms have allocated 30% of their capital to dry powder amid cautious optimism.

At least 80% of private equity workflows already rely heavily on technologies to source deals, conduct due diligence and manage portfolios; 95% of these firms are planning to multiply AI investments in the next 18 months.

This reliance has led to an evolution in exit strategies. Secondary buyouts and management/leveraged buyouts are making the most headway. To curb uncertainty in the market and challenges pertaining to liquidity, firms are exploring continuation funds and preferred equity options.

The private equity industry, despite sitting on a lot of dry powder, is encountering insurmountable pressure from Limited Partners (LPs) for efficient allocation of capital. General Partners (GPs) find themselves caught up with due diligence demands and allocation requirements amid market contraction risks.

Technological advancements have become enablers with AI, robotic process automation (RPA) and blockchain driving operational efficiencies. This encourages compliance and helps with decision-making. S&P Global found that 41% of private equity firms are in nascent adoption stages, 13% are at the advanced implementation stage and 7% have fully integrated technology.

In deal sourcing, AI can identify 195 relevant companies in the time it would take a junior analyst to evaluate one. Firms like Blackstone and EQT are investing in solely owned platforms like EQT’s Motherbrain, which consolidates 140,000+ data points for real-time M&A insights.

AI also assists with post-deal requirements like live portfolio monitoring and exit readiness by putting together information for a quicker turnaround on the buyer analysis for decision-making. Firms that delay tech adoption risk falling behind in fundraising and corporate governance and risk being left behind by competitors. Simultaneously, these advances have a real-world impact on the people in the industry, reducing the need for entry-level employees.

The investment projectile has evolved across four major phases: workflow automation and BPM services (before 2018); low-code/no-code platforms (2018-2020); early adoption of intelligent automation across the value curve (2021-2023); and a new era of intelligent automation powered by generative AI (2024-present).

Private equity firms are embracing the tech revolution to drive digital operations and unlock value across sectors.

The allied risks and limitations

AI has a significant impact on the private equity space, although there are reservations about its adoption and scope in the future. In light of the limited adoption rate, it is clear that only a fraction of private equity firms are exploring AI application use cases. These reservations are emanating from cybersecurity threats, opaque workflows and limited visibility on returns.

Having said that, it does contribute to operational efficiency and better portfolio performance. It also supports analysis, given its ability to skim through large and complex data sets, and is useful to entry-level employees as a learning and development tool.

These tools do enhance accurate decision making without negating human judgement, allowing organizations to act swiftly with precision. This has a cascading effect on revenue optimization, cost reduction and improved performance reporting and monitoring. For example, AI can help monitor KPIs across portfolios and processes in deal exits and capital distribution.

However, this shift brings significant risks. Kearney highlights seven key scenarios: rising ownership costs, unreliable data, questionable model outputs, cyber threats, IP disputes, AI-driven ESG platform concerns and negative socioeconomic impacts – all amid evolving regulatory pressures on governance.

It also emphasizes the importance of establishing robust governance frameworks and ethical guidelines to mitigate these risks. For example, some firms have created internal compliance forums to define acceptable AI use and ensure data protection. To successfully integrate AI, private equity firms must align AI initiatives with strategic goals, focus on high-impact use cases and ensure their technology infrastructure is ready. Standardizing and improving data quality across portfolios is also critical, as inconsistent data remains a major barrier to effective AI deployment. Firms that invest in preparing their data and tailoring AI models to their specific needs will gain a competitive edge.

Propelling the ESG engine forward

Private equity firms are leveraging state-of-the-art technologies of AI-driven predictive analytics and powering ESG data platforms to monitor and integrate metrics into their investment strategies. According to EY, private equity funds that have a well-integrated ESG framework have the potential to achieve an initial rate of return, which could be 8% higher than their competitors. This is mainly thanks to more accurate predictive models that provide organizations with the ability to assess value creation potential and sustainability risks over long periods at both deal and portfolio levels.

Bain and Company reports that, despite a low adoption rate of ESG initially, there has been an uptick in interest due to the consistency of data ESG operations provide and its potential long-term assurances. Firms now leverage AI/ML and natural language processing (NLP) to assess regulatory disclosures, sentiment analysis and supply chain data for ESG risks. This approach allows investors to pursue short-term value while staying aligned with long-term goals, supporting broader global efforts by businesses and governments to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_380dG0pxQ_6C-WjpawAW_RWRAy00C8-rSZ5EpzZN6-0.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 12:24:35.900647

Kennedy Jr.’s campaign to eliminate synthetic food dyes from the American food supply is facing stiff resistance from one of the country’s most iconic candy makers — Mars, the manufacturer of M&M’s and Skittles.

Mars released a statement earlier this week saying that it will continue using the synthetic dyes in its candies, reversing a pledge the company made in 2016 to remove artificial colors from all foods and snacks in its portfolio.

The company insisted to the New York Times that its products are “safe to enjoy and meet the high standards and applicable regulations set by food safety authorities around the world.”

While Mars has made incremental changes — such as eliminating titanium dioxide from Skittles — it continues to rely on artificial colorings, citing challenges with cost, limited availability of natural alternatives and consumer preferences for brightly colored treats.

The National Confectioners Association, which represents candy makers, has echoed Mars’ position.

“People can freely buy cannabis, THC products, alcohol, and cigarettes – but vibrantly colored candy is an issue? Give me a break,” spokesman Christopher Gindlesperger told The Post.

Gindlesperger said that consumers “know that confectionery products are treats and that they contain sugar, food colors, and other FDA-approved ingredients, because candy is intrinsically transparent.”

“People have a unique mindset when they enjoy chocolate and candy that is not present when interacting with other foods. Chocolate and candy are safe to enjoy as they have been for generations,” he said.

Gindlesperger added that the industry is “in firm agreement that science-based evaluation of food additives will help eliminate consumer confusion and rebuild trust in our national food safety system.”

“We follow and will continue to follow regulatory guidance from the authorities in this space, because consumer safety is our chief responsibility and priority.”

He noted that alternatives to synthetic dyes are more expensive, harder to source, and could raise prices due to limited supply.

“Companies need time to find alternatives,” Gindlesperger said.

The Post has sought comment from Kennedy, Mars and the National Confectioners Association.

Several leading food manufacturers have recently committed to removing synthetic, petroleum-based food dyes from their products in response to mounting public health concerns and growing consumer demand for cleaner ingredients.

Among the companies that have voluntarily agreed to eliminate synthetic dyes from their portfolios by the end of 2027 are Kraft Heinz, General Mills, PepsiCo, Nestlé and ConAgra Brands.

Their decision follows advocacy efforts by health officials and organizations warning about potential links between artificial dyes and behavioral issues in children, as well as broader concerns over the safety of food additives.

In contrast, the candy industry has yet to fully embrace this movement.

While federal regulators have so far declined to crack down on artifical dyes, lawmakers at the state level have either introduced legislation or are considering proposals that would restrict or outright ban foods that contain synthetic coloring.

West Virginia has passed one of the most sweeping laws on synthetic food dyes, banning seven dyes and two preservatives from school meals starting Aug. 1 and from all foods sold statewide by Jan. 1, 2028.

California will prohibit Red Dye No. 3 and other additives in foods beginning Jan. 1, 2027, with a separate school ban on six synthetic dyes taking effect later that year.

Utah and Virginia have both enacted bans on multiple artificial dyes in foods sold or served in public schools. The Utah ban went into effect in March of last year while the Virginia ban will be effective July 1, 2027.

Texas has opted for mandatory warning labels — rather than outright bans — on foods containing over 40 additives, including synthetic dyes, starting Jan. 1, 2027.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/107804777.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-07-08 12:22:50.533715

Aliko Dangote plans to scale up production at his Lagos-based fertilizer plant to meet Africa’s growing demand and reduce import reliance.

Dangote says Africa can become self-sufficient in fertilizer within 40 months, easing food production pressures and foreign exchange constraints.

A potential Nigerian Exchange listing could unlock new capital as the plant operates at just half its total production capacity.

Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, has announced plans to expand his $3 billion fertilizer plant — Dangote Fertilizer Limited — as part of a wider effort to help the continent become self-sufficient in fertilizer production and reduce the high costs of imports. He made the announcement during the annual Afreximbank meeting held in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital.

Dangote plans major fertilizer expansion

Dangote, who heads the Dangote Group — Africa’s most diversified industrial and manufacturing conglomerate — and is worth $23.3 billion according to Forbes, said the expansion will help meet Africa’s growing demand for fertilizer over the next 40 months.

He noted that the continent currently imports more than six million metric tons of fertilizer each year, a burden that’s made it harder for many countries to grow enough food, especially given challenging farming conditions.

“In the next 40 months, Africa will not import fertilizer from anywhere,” he said. “We’re moving fast. I want Dangote to be the biggest producer of urea in the world — bigger than Qatar. Just give me 40 months.” He added that increasing local production would ease the pressure on foreign exchange, a persistent challenge in Nigeria due to the weak naira.

NGX listing may reshape sector

This announcement comes at a time when Dangote Fertilizer Limited is preparing for a potential listing on the Nigerian Exchange (NGX), which could value the company at more than $3 billion. The plant, located on a 500-hectare site in Ibeju Lekki, Lagos, is already the largest of its kind in Africa. But for Dangote, it’s never just been about size or valuation. His goal has long been to rebuild domestic industries and reduce Africa’s dependence on imports.

The facility has the capacity to produce up to 3 million metric tonnes of urea each year, twice what Nigeria currently needs. That extra capacity is expected to lower prices for local farmers, allow for customized blends tailored to specific soil needs, and open up export opportunities across the region. In short, it’s about creating a more self-reliant agricultural sector — not just for Nigeria, but for Africa as a whole.

The new drinks come as the classic Frappuccino celebrates its 30th anniversary this year.

“It’s the perfect time for a beverage like this,” Susan Engdahl, who is part of the team at Starbucks that helped create the beverage, said in a statement. “Customers know and love the Frappuccino blended beverage drink, and this gives them a new way to enjoy it.”

“As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of Frappuccino, we’re excited to offer a modern take on a classic beverage, with layers of flavor and creamy texture that customers are craving right now.”

The three new Strato Frappuccino Blended Beverages include:

Here’s what you need to know about the company’s Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches and the return of the Snack Wrap.

McDonald’s debuts new line of Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches

The McDonald’s Egg McMuffin breakfast sandwich is perhaps the most iconic fast food breakfast item in the world. As a matter of fact, it’s so iconic that McDonald’s has a page on its site dedicated to the history of the Egg McMuffin.

The delectable breakfast sandwich was first invented in 1971 by Herb Peterson, a McDonald’s owner in Santa Barbara, California. In 1972, the sandwich got its “Egg McMuffin” name and went on sale in test markets for just 63 cents apiece. And in 1975, McDonald’s rolled out the Egg McMuffin nationally.

Egg McMuffin 50th anniversary

Yes, it has now been 50 years since the Egg McMuffin’s national rollout, and in celebration of this milestone, McDonald’s is releasing a line of new Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches.

The Spicy McMuffin sandwich has the egg, cheese, and bacon we all love, with the addition of a Spicy Pepper Sauce. McDonald’s is also releasing the Spicy Sausage McMuffin and the Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg to complete the lineup.

The Spicy McMuffin sandwiches go on sale today, Tuesday, July 8, and will only be available for a limited time. According to McDonald’s, they will be available at participating locations across the United States.

The beloved Snack Wrap returns, too

But what McDonald’s fans seem most excited about is the return of the Snack Wrap. The wrap was originally introduced in the United States in 2006 and became a favorite among many due to its crispy chicken and burrito-like form factor, making it easy to eat on the go.

The Snack Wrap featured white meat chicken, cheese, lettuce, and a choice of sauces.

But in 2016, McDonald’s discontinued nationwide sales of the Snack Wrap in the United States due to declining sales. Some locations still sold the handheld menu item until 2020, before it disappeared for good.

But now the Snack Wrap is back. McDonald’s has confirmed it will go on sale on Thursday, July 10. According to Axios, it is expected to be a permanent menu item and will cost $2.99.

Will menu changes help McDonald’s sales?

McDonald’s is bringing back the Snack Wrap and introducing new versions of a beloved classic at a time when consumers are increasingly conscious of the prices they pay for fast food, which was once seen as a reliable, low-cost meal option.

In recent years, fast food prices have skyrocketed, causing consumers to question their value.

Many fast food places have been trying to lure price-conscious consumers back with time-limited deals and special menu items, hoping that these will help boost their bottom line.

As for McDonald’s most recent quarter, fiscal Q1 2025, the burger chain reported a global comparable sales decrease of 1%. Sales were even worse in the United States, where comparable sales decreased 3.6%.

Since the beginning of the year, shares of McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE: MCD) have been on a bumpy ride. After falling to a year-to-date low of below $277 per share in January, MCD stock bounced back to highs of over $321 in May. But since then, MCD shares have tumbled again to close at under $294 as of yesterday. Since the new year began, MCD shares are now up about 1.2%.

Over the past 12 months, MCD shares have increased nearly 17%.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/07/p-1-91364517-mcdonalds-big-announcement-return-of-the-snack-wrap-spicy-mcmuffin-breakfast-sandwiches.jpg",N,,2025-07-08 12:23:50.352503

Pardon the Disruption is a column that looks at the forces shaping food retail.

In the more than two years they spent trying to combine, Kroger and Albertsons held off on making any deep cuts to their businesses as they looked to curry favor with regulators and consumers.

But now that the supermarket megamerger isn’t happening, the two chains have returned in a big way to the tough but necessary work of making their stores, supply chains and corporate operations run more efficiently.

Call it making up for lost time. Kroger announced in late June that it plans to close 60 stores over the next year and a half. It promptly got to work, with local media reporting impending closures of company-owned stores across several regions. Albertsons, meanwhile, has laid off around 800 employees and shuttered close to a dozen stores so far this year, The Wall Street Journal reported.

There’s much more to come. Both grocers say they are looking to wring unnecessary costs out of their businesses and better focus their efforts on high-performing products and services. Albertsons is in the process of cutting $1.5 billion over a three-year period, while Kroger is looking to bring more discipline to its investments and cost structure.

“We’re going to modernize operations and ways of working across the board, from corporate to our stores and supply chain, to work smarter and more efficiently,” Kroger CFO David Kennerly said during the company’s earnings call at the end of June.

Instead of popping champagne, the nation’s largest supermarket chains are cutting deep so that they can continue battling the very forces that spurred their attempted merger. They are also suing each other over who’s to blame for the deal going up in flames.

The belt-tightening that both companies have embraced this year comes as no surprise, and it will go a long way toward keeping prices down and staying competitive. But Kroger and Albertsons can’t just hack and slash their way to a more compelling grocery experience. That’s going to take innovation and risk-taking. How will these supermarket giants beat the growing threat that low-price and specialty retailers pose?

Here are three things I’ll be watching in the months ahead.

All eyes on the CEOs

Both Kroger and Albertsons will forge ahead with new leadership at the helm. For Kroger, that new leader has yet to be identified four months after former CEO Rodney McMullen resigned following an ethics review. Ron Sargent, who became interim CEO in March, said Kroger’s board of directors has formed a search committee and is currently working with a nationally recognized search firm to identify candidates.

As I wrote earlier this year, Kroger’s next permanent CEO will have a lot of challenges to address, including labor unrest, mounting industry competition, an overly complex e-commerce network and a brand campaign that’s starting to feel stale. The role also offers an opportunity to transform the conventional grocery model, and Kroger would do well to name someone with an innovative spirit.

Albertsons, on the other hand, has its new leader in Susan Morris, the former operations chief who took over for Vivek Sankaran in May. She’s coming into the CEO role at a difficult time. During the merger trial, lawyers painted Albertsons as a company with a bleak future. Since then, speculation has swirled about Albertsons eventually finding another suitor.

But Morris told The Wall Street Journal the company has no plans to sell. She said she wants to make Albertsons leaner and negotiate more forcefully with suppliers. She also sees opportunities to expand its leading retail media network and improve key areas like produce, private label and its loyalty program.

Morris told the Journal that Albertsons’ specialty is one-stop shopping. That may be true, but a lot fewer consumers are shopping this way than when Morris joined the company nearly 40 years ago. Albertsons needs to figure out how to be an important stop for today’s shop-around consumers.

What is Kroger going to do about e-commerce?

Kroger’s online business has been growing at a healthy clip. During its first fiscal quarter this year, e-commerce sales increased 15%, with delivery driving a growing number of households to engage digitally with the grocer. That’s well ahead of the overall sales growth rate in digital across the industry.

But e-commerce remains an unprofitable business for Kroger — and that needs to change, Sargent said during the company’s first-quarter earnings call.

“Our customers are embracing the whole digital model of our business. We are seeing improvements in profitability at an increasing rate. But to be clear… we’re not profitable at this point,” he said.

That’s an understandable goal, and one that comes at a time when fierce competitor Walmart says its online business is now profitable. Trouble is, Kroger seems to be a long way off from achieving this, with Sargent noting: “We still have a lot of work to do.”

The 800-pound gorilla in the room is Kroger’s network of automated fulfillment centers and spoke facilities powering its delivery service. This network needs to build scale and serve high levels of demand to achieve its full value, but right now Kroger and its fulfillment technology partner, Ocado, seem to be stuck figuring out how to make these facilities work for shoppers and Kroger’s bottom line.

Will both grocers continue to innovate?

Kroger and Albertsons have had a strong track record of innovation over the past several years. Both companies ramped up retail media and embraced trends like quick delivery, ghost kitchens and online marketplaces. While some of these bets didn’t pan out, their nimbleness and willingness to learn have been encouraging at a time of rapid evolution across retail.

Will that spirit of innovation diminish as the companies push for greater efficiency? That already seems to be happening, with neither company making the sort of eye-grabbing announcements in recent months that it used to.

I understand pulling back on e-commerce innovation, given how demand has moderated in that channel over the past two years. But Kroger and Albertsons need to take bold steps in areas that are key to their associates and in-store shoppers, including meal solutions, loyalty programs and employee services.

I live in an area that’s packed with QFC, Fred Meyer and Safeway stores, and I can tell you that none of them come to mind when I think, “What’s for dinner?” All of these locations carry prepared meals, salad kits, packaged sushi and more, but the selections are usually uninspiring and merchandised in out-of-the-way areas that make it feel like the companies are checking boxes rather than trying to entice shoppers.

McDonald’s McMuffin turned 50 this year, but it's just getting hotter.

The global fast food chain is bringing out new varieties to help ""spice up"" its breakfast menu in honor of the anniversary, including a Spicy McMuffin, Spicy Sausage McMuffin and Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg.

The new muffin choices will feature their traditional ingredients — cheese, egg, Canadian bacon or sausage and a buttered English muffin, topped with Spicy Pepper Sauce, according to a McDonald's news release.

The Egg McMuffin debuted in 1975 when Herb Peterson, a McDonald's franchisee in Santa Barbara, California, wanted to create a take-out version of Eggs Benedict. Roy Kroc, the businessman who transformed McDonald's into what it is today, loved the idea.

When is McDonald's Spicy McMuffin available?

The items are available beginning July 8 for a limited time at participating locations, according to the company.

McDonald's adds Daily Double burger to menu

That's not the only new thing under the golden arches. McDonald's has also added a new double burger on its menu: the Daily Double.

The Daily Double, available now nationwide, is made with two beef patties, a slice of American cheese, shredded lettuce, slivered onions, mayo and two tomato slices. The burger had been available in limited markets including Miami, Chicago and Seattle, but will be available nationally through 2025, the company said.

On July 22, the Daily Double will join McDonald's McValue Meal Deal options, served with a 4-piece order of Chicken McNuggets, small fries and small soft drink ($6 or $7; pricing depends on your restaurant). That menu still includes the $5 Meal Deal.

The burger is now appearing in the McDonald's app, where you can also get deals including a free medium order of fries with a $1 purchase in the app every Friday through the end of 2025.

Coming soon: the Snack Wrap

After nearly a decade, McDonald's announced the return of the Snack Wrap, one of McDonald's new McCrispy Strips topped with shredded lettuce and shredded cheese, wrapped in a soft flour tortilla. They're available in either Spicy (with a habanero kick) or Ranch (with Ranch dressing and hints of garlic and onion).

The Snack Wrap will be available on its own or in a combo meal featuring two Snack Wraps, medium fries and a drink.

Snack Wraps will be coming back to store menus permanently beginning Thursday, July 10, the company said.

To celebrate the return of the item, McDonald's has launched snackwrapfiles.com, a website they're calling ""fans’ VIP entry to all things Snack Wrap.""

Tanner, who served as the CEO of Wendy’s for nearly a year and a half, was with PepsiCo (NASDAQ: ) before that for three decades. He assumed several leadership roles during his time at the beverage maker, including CEO of PepsiCo North America, overseeing the growth of brands such as Pepsi, Gatorade, and Mountain Dew.

Hershey’s shares were down 2.5% in early trading. The stock has gained 2% year-to-date.

Tanner will succeed Michele Buck as president and CEO, effective August 18.

Buck led Hershey for seven years and is retiring in 2026. She will work closely with Tanner in a senior advisory capacity to ensure his successful transition.

In May, Hershey topped quarterly results driven by demand for its salty snacks business in North America. The company, which houses Dot’s Pretzels, had seen demand pick up after product prices were lowered following several rounds of price hikes over the last few years.

Retail sentiment on Hershey has been ‘bearish’ over the past month, according to data from Stocktwits.

Separately, Wendy’s said it has appointed Ken Cook, its chief financial officer, as interim CEO. Cook, who remains CFO, joined the company in December 2024 and was previously with United Parcel Service (NYSE: ) for 20 years, including serving as head of Financial Planning and Analysis.

Wendy’s said its board has launched a comprehensive search process to select a permanent CEO.

The fast-food chain’s sales have slowed in 2025, particularly in the U.S., where consumer demand has wavered and traffic declines have impacted performance.

Wendy’s shares were down marginally. Stocktwits data showed the retail sentiment on the stock was in the ‘bearish’ territory, compared to ‘neutral’ a week ago.

According to Sherlock’s research, employees in many companies waste up to 20 percent of their time navigating unclear roles and responsibilities. This finding is reinforced by McKinsey’s State of Organizations 2023 report, which identified unclear roles as a top contributor to organizational inefficiency.

Org.Works launches at a time when companies are under pressure to move quickly in response to rapidly changing technology and market conditions. Many attempt to adapt by adding C-suite roles, launching new departments, or undergoing constant reorganization—often without improving execution. Current client work includes advising on AI strategy and structure, IT department design, digital and marketing team structure, and leadership realignment to improve decision-making and delivery.

“Too many organizations prioritize speed and innovation but overlook whether their structure supports either,” said Dr. Sherlock, who previously served as Chief Digital and Technology Officer at Ralph Lauren and now leads Org.Works. “Innovation, decision-making, and execution need to move fast—but organization structure must be the foundation that enables that speed, not the shifting sands beneath it.”

Sherlock’s recent TEDx talk, “Clarity Before Chaos: Building Organizations That Work,” was recently selected as a TEDx Editor’s Pick, an honor awarded to fewer than one percent of all TEDx talks globally. TED described the talk as “a valuable and timely idea for our global audience.”

She is recognized as a leading voice in both corporate and academic communities on organizational design, executive structure, and technology leadership. Her work has been cited in academic literature and featured in Business Insider’s article, “Why the C-Suite Is Getting So Big,” where she highlighted the risks of executive role proliferation and structural misalignment.

The new menu items include the Spicy McMuffin, Spicy Sausage McMuffin, and Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg — all featuring the restaurant's new Spicy Pepper Sauce, the company said in a press release.

The nationwide offering coincides with the 50th anniversary of the Egg McMuffin, the sandwich credited with ushering in the chain's now-famed breakfast service.

Why It Matters

Breakfast menus have become a crucial battleground for fast food brands, with U.S. consumers increasingly seeking novel flavors and limited-time options.

The new sandwich highlights McDonald's efforts to capitalize on the ""spicy"" food trend, which has seen increased popularity across American fast food menus.

Industry analysts have noted that menu additions can drive short-term sales and boost brand engagement during seasonal promotions.

What To Know

The new sandwiches maintain the core elements of a McMuffin — cheddar cheese, a freshly cracked egg, Canadian bacon or sausage, and a toasted English muffin — but incorporate McDonald's signature Spicy Pepper Sauce. This blend offers ""a fiery, delicious twist,"" the company said.

McDonald's also said that its U.S. eggs are now ""100% cage-free,"" which is part of its broader ingredients update that aims to align with consumer demand for animal welfare.

The menu change marks the 50th anniversary of the Egg McMuffin's nationwide rollout. Herb Peterson, a former McDonald's franchisee in Santa Barbara, California, created the sandwich in 1971 with the aim to produce a portable version of eggs benedict.

The innovation eventually gained national attention, notably through the efforts of McDonald's founder Ray Kroc, and played a pivotal role in establishing breakfast as a major sales segment for the chain.

Spicy flavors have become a focal point for fast food innovation, with multiple chains introducing heat-centric menu items to appeal to evolving consumer palates. McDonald's expansion into spicier breakfast options reflects a broader industry movement and an effort to differentiate its morning menu.

What People Are Saying

McDonald's USA President Joe Erlinger said in a press release earlier this year: ""At McDonald's, breakfast isn't just a meal; it's a cherished tradition and cornerstone of our brand... Every morning when we open our doors, we are a breakfast restaurant. Whether it's my personal favorite, the Egg McMuffin, or our crispy Hash Browns, fluffy hotcakes, or sweet and savory McGriddles, we're all about giving our customers the best start to their day. Our fans know they can always count on us for a one-of-a-kind breakfast experience, anchored in great value and high-quality ingredients.""

David Peterson, son of Herb and a McDonald's owner/operator, said: ""When I watched my father introduce this idea to Ray Kroc, we could not have anticipated it would become the foundation for the renowned McDonald's breakfast menu... It's been remarkable to see people embrace this innovation over the last five decades, and now we get to share that heritage with a new generation of breakfast fans.""

What Happens Next

Availability of the new breakfast sandwich may vary by location depending on franchise participation.

McDonald's urged customers not to delay, saying: ""The Spicy McMuffin won't last forever.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2678782/mcmuffin.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 12:24:00.782426

Carrier revenue per parcel ticked down to $9.09 down from $9.10 in 2023, according to Pitney Bowes.
“Since Pitney Bowes began tracking shipments a decade ago, the parcel market has been dominated by FedEx, UPS and USPS.
“This disruption presents a unique opportunity for businesses to take advantage of competitive pricing.” The Pitney Bowes findings echo earlier research from parcel management and consulting firm ShipMatrix Inc.

Smaller carriers are increasingly taking market share from legacy carriers FedEx, UPS and the U.S. Postal Service, but their biggest threat is Amazon. The retailer’s logistics operation handled 6.3 billion parcels in 2024, up 7.3% year over year, and is expected to overtake the Postal Service by 2028, Pitney Bowes (NYSE: PBI) said in its recent Parcel Shipping Index.

The provider of mail and parcel shipping services, technology and equipment said U.S. parcel volume increased 3.4% to 22.4 billion shipments last year and estimated it will grow 5% per year to $30.5 billion in 2030. Revenue, however, grew 2.7% last year to $203.2 billion.

Carriers are increasingly offering competitive pricing to attract customers, leading to lower revenue. Carrier revenue per parcel ticked down to $9.09 down from $9.10 in 2023, according to Pitney Bowes. Independent couriers gaining market traction in recent years include OnTrac, Better Trucks, Jitsu, Veho, SpeedX, Speedy Delivery and UniUni. Many of them are startups or provide regional service with lower overhead than national carriers. The U.S. Postal Service’s new lost-cost shipping option, Ground Advantage, has also contributed to the pricing pressure.

“Since Pitney Bowes began tracking shipments a decade ago, the parcel market has been dominated by FedEx, UPS and USPS. We are witnessing a turning of the tide, evidenced by the nearly 40% volume growth in the five-year compound annual growth rate of [alternative] carriers,” said Pitney Bowes Executive Vice President Shemin Nurmohamed, in a news release. “This disruption presents a unique opportunity for businesses to take advantage of competitive pricing.”

The Pitney Bowes findings echo earlier research from parcel management and consulting firm ShipMatrix Inc. It put domestic parcel revenue at $188 billion and average revenue per parcel at $8. Domestic parcel volumes will grow at a compound annual rate of 4% over the next three years, with Amazon, Walmart and other carriers winning the lion’s share of new business. FedEx, UPS and the U.S. Postal Service will likely experience flat to negative growth, ShipMatrix said.

The U.S. Postal Service retained its hold as the largest parcel carrier by volume with 6.9 billion shipments in 2024, an increase of 3.4% from the prior year, per Pitney Bowes. UPS volume increased 1.7% to 4.7 billion pieces. FedEx was the only carrier to experience a year-over-year decline, with 3.9 billion parcels compared to 3.7 billion in 2023.

Broken Yolk Café is expanding into a major new market.

Brothers John, Bryant and Jason Corona have partnered with their father, Juan Corona, and uncle, Saul DeLa Rosa, to expand Broken Yolk’s presence in Southern California. Juan was the first-ever franchisee to join El Pollo Loco in 1981. The family also operates multiple Movita Juice Bar locations.

“Our family had the opportunity to dine in at one of Broken Yolk Cafe’s Las Vegas locations not too long ago, and the experience left a lasting impression,” said John Corona. “The food was incredible, the hospitality was infectious, and after getting to meet the brand’s president for ourselves, it was clear the leadership and direction of the franchise were second to none.”

Founded in 1979 in the San Diego area, Broken Yolk has expanded into Idaho, Nevada, Arizona and Texas. The chain operates a systemwide total of 41 locations.

Moms are very often the lead decision makers for family purchases – and product information plays a key role in what they decide to purchase.

A new survey from motherhood and pregnancy media outlet What to Expect reveals that more than three-quarters (77%) of mothers are primary decision-makers for family purchases, with more than half (55%) saying that managing family finances mostly falls to them.

More than half of moms (57%) surveyed said “proven safe” is a top priority when buying for their kids, and 52% say they’ve walked away from a product because of poor online reviews. A quarter of moms said they’ve skipped a purchase entirely because the product lacked enough photos or details that could address any safety factors or concerns.

Forty-three percent of moms said they want to choose products that make them feel like they’re doing the best they can for their family.

Product reviews are key to purchase decisions, especially with prices remaining high amid new tariffs on imported goods. What to Expect said that one mom in its survey said “I care about quality, ease of use and adaptability, but I also have a tight budget.” Another noted that she struggles with “having to choose between so many options, and price differences.”

Most recently, Trump said his administration reached a deal with Vietnam wherein imports from the country would be charged a 20% tariff upon entering the U.S.","The U.S. plans to charge up to 70% tariffs on imports from some countries starting Aug. 1 as President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on his country-specific reciprocal duties nears its expiration date.

Starting Monday at noon EST, the U.S. will send letters detailing tariff rates for specific trading partners that have yet to reach a tariff deal with the Trump administration before the pause ends July 9, the president said Sunday. Trump told reporters Friday that the rates would range between 10% and 70%.

The U.S. is specifically focused on “18 important trading relationships,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday. He also indicated that countries that do not reach deals in the next few days will return to the tariff rate Trump first outlined as part of the president’s global reciprocal tariff announcement April 2.

“President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners, saying that, if you don't move things along, then, on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level,” Bessent said.

It remains unclear if countries will be able to negotiate with the Trump administration after this week’s deadline, but Bessent said the Aug. 1 implementation date does not mean the 90-day tariff pause has been extended.

“It's not a new deadline. We are saying this is when it's happening,” Bessent said. “If you want to speed things up, have at it. If you want to go back to the old rate, that's your choice.”

The $3.3 billion all-cash deal brings together two complementary giants, enabling Capgemini to deepen its Digital Business Process Services (BPS) portfolio, especially as enterprises worldwide seek AI-powered operational transformation.

Why This Acquisition Matters

WNS’s strength lies in domain-centric digital services delivered through 25 Indian delivery centres. With 40000+ employees and a strong presence in verticals like banking, healthcare, logistics, and insurance, the acquisition adds scale and specialization to Capgemini’s already diverse global footprint.

The 28 percent premium reflects WNS’s strategic value, driven by long-standing relationships and deep domain knowledge. The integration also aligns well culturally and operationally, ensuring smoother post-acquisition synergy.

AI and Intelligent Operations Take Center Stage

Capgemini is betting big on AI. With over euro 900 million in Gen AI bookings in 2024 and partnerships with Google, AWS, Microsoft, and NVIDIA, this acquisition positions the company as a front-runner in intelligent operations. WNS’s expertise in domain-led, automation-first models complements Capgemini’s platform-driven vision of transforming businesses from digital to autonomous.

Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat emphasized that the shift toward autonomy—where businesses embed AI across workflows—is the future. WNS CEO Keshav Murugesh echoed this, noting clients now seek deeper transformation rather than just efficiency through automation.

India at the Heart of It

India continues to play a pivotal role in global BPM, contributing over 50 percent of WNS’s revenue. The country offers both cost and talent advantages, and centres like Vizag and Hyderabad are now key nodes in the global delivery network. With WNS now part of Capgemini, this strategic presence will likely expand further, reinforcing India’s dominance in global service delivery.

What’s Next?

The transaction awaits regulatory and shareholder approvals, including from the Royal Court of Jersey. If completed as planned by year-end, the merged entity will become a formidable player with euro 23.3 billion in revenue and an expanded Digital BPS footprint—ready to lead in the AI-first era of business transformation.",https://trak.in/stories/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-08-at-7.13.28 AM-1024x572.png,N,,2025-07-08 16:07:13.735238

And what they had said at the time was that this assumes that tariffs stay exactly the same as they are.
But now we're seeing shares sort of revert here as these, as these retailers sort of try to understand how exactly they can stock up accordingly from the holiday.
But what we saw there was we saw shares pull back on Monday morning, down roughly 4% there in after-hours trading, or rather at the close.
What we know there is that these Lululemon, a key source they have there is from Cambodia, China, Vietnam, and Thailand.","Brooke, I know you've been talking to a lot of retailers. I thought it was really interesting initially when that sort of Vietnam deal was announced, or the framework for a deal, the outline of a deal. We saw shares of companies like Lululemon go up. We saw them pull back a little bit yesterday, and I guess some of this is just reflecting the environment that these companies are navigating.

Certainly. What I'm hearing from my sources is that uncertainty here is really the name of the game as these retailers try to make way and stock up ahead of that key back-to-school shopping season, and really that key holiday season. And what we've seen over the past two days is that, take for example, Best Buy. We saw the company put out their updated guidance in late May of this year. And what they had said at the time was that this assumes that tariffs stay exactly the same as they are. Now what we know here is that Best Buy sources 40% of their electronics from Vietnam, India, South Korea, and Taiwan. Now, what we heard yesterday is now we have South Korea at 25%. We also heard last week that Vietnam is at 20%. And so now that updated guidance may be in question here. And that's what really led the stock to move lower on Monday, down roughly 2% according to our Yahoo Finance toolbox here. But now we're seeing shares sort of revert here as these, as these retailers sort of try to understand how exactly they can stock up accordingly from the holiday. Now, another company they want to take a look at is Lululemon. Of course, they're the apparel company. They make athletic gear. They make the shoes. But what we saw there was we saw shares pull back on Monday morning, down roughly 4% there in after-hours trading, or rather at the close. And now those shares are pulling back a bit. What we know there is that these Lululemon, a key source they have there is from Cambodia, China, Vietnam, and Thailand. Now we're hearing those rates, those tariff rates coming higher. And also, as you could see here, what we talked about last week is those sneaker giants key sourcing regions that they source from include Vietnam, Indonesia, and China.

In June, Medtronic announced MiniMed as the name for the company following the intended separation. The name honors its 40-year legacy of being at the forefront of transforming diabetes care to make it simpler and more accessible to the millions of people around the world with intensively managed type 1 and type 2 diabetes (or those needing daily insulin injections to manage their blood sugar levels because their body doesn't produce enough insulin or isn't able to use it effectively). MiniMed's Mission is to make diabetes more predictable so everyone can embrace life to the fullest.

""I'm excited for the opportunity to help shape the future of a company with such a meaningful Mission, and I look forward to working with Que and the leadership team to build a strong, agile finance organization that supports innovation, drives sustainable growth, and creates long-term value for all stakeholders,"" said Chad Spooner .

Medtronic expects to complete the separation within 18 months of the initial announcement through a series of capital markets transactions, subject to customary conditions and legal requirements including consultations with works councils and other employee representative bodies.

“We are always looking for different ways to offer great tasting, compelling choices for our consumers,” Nestle’s U.S. CEO Marty Thompson said in a statement. “As their diverse dietary preferences and nutritional needs evolve, we evolve with them.”

Nestle said 90% of its U.S. products already contain no synthetic dyes. The company has been removing them from its products for the past 10 years, it said in a statement.

Nestle’s announcement dovetails with those of other major U.S. food companies.

Kraft Heinz and General Mills previously announced plans to remove artificial dyes from their U.S. products by 2027.

General Mills said it plans to remove synthetic dyes from its U.S. cereals and all foods served in K-12 schools by mid-2026, and J.M Smucker Co. said it intends to remove artificial colors from its products by the end of 2027, according to media reports.

Petroleum-based food dyes have been linked to a variety of health concerns, including allergies, cancer and behavioral changes.

They are synthetic color additives derived from crude oil and include artificial dyes such as Red No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5 and Blue No. 1.

The recent moves follow decades of scrutiny.

In January, the U.S. government banned Red No. 3 from the nation’s food supply, nearly 35 years after the dye was banned from cosmetics due to potential cancer risks.

U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is among the strongest critics of these additives.

In April, he and U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary announced that the FDA is asking food companies to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of next year and substitute petrochemical dyes with natural ingredients.

“We have a new epidemic of childhood diabetes, obesity, depression, and ADHD,” Makary said in a statement. “Given the growing concerns of doctors and parents about the potential role of petroleum-based food dyes, we should not be taking risks and do everything possible to safeguard the health of our children.”

About two-thirds of Americans support restricting or reformulating processed foods to remove added dyes, according to an AP-NORC poll cited by CBS News.

Many states are taking this matter into their own hands.

California and West Virginia have recently banned artificial dyes in foods served in schools.

In late June, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill requiring a new safety label on foods made with synthetic dyes or additives. The label will state that the products contain ingredients “not recommended for human consumption.”

Why it matters: The contracts for 116,000 tons of CO2 removal between 2028 and 2030, for buyers working through the Frontier consortium, comprise Arbor's biggest deal yet.

It's one of the ""anchor agreements"" that will help the 3-year-old startup finance and build its first commercial-scale plant near Lake Charles, Louisiana, CEO Brad Hartwig tells me.

Driving the news: Buyers include Stripe, Google, Shopify, McKinsey, Autodesk, H&M and various others.

The new deal follows a much smaller agreement with Microsoft last year.

How it works: Arbor is a bioenergy with carbon capture (BECCS) startup, using waste biomass that will initially come from forest management.

But it's an evolution of BECCS, with 99% capture and high efficiency, a blog post states.

Its process first gasifies biomass, then burns that gas in a special furnace with pure oxygen (""oxy-combustion""), producing water but also ""supercritical"" CO2 that drives a turbine.

This simplifies and reduces CO2 capture costs, and the water can be used for irrigation or data center cooling, Arbor and Frontier said.

Reality check: First-of-a-kind hardware systems often don't survive the journey to commercial deployment or scale.

But Hartwig sees Arbor's system among the energy sources that stand to benefit from the AI boom.

""Demand for carbon-free energy is just accelerating at rates that are completely unprecedented, and we have a pretty unique technology stack that can deliver 24/7, carbon-free energy that is cheap and firm,"" he tells Axios.

What we're watching: ""We've gotten a lot of interest from a whole host of folks, from hyperscalers to regulated utilities looking to develop projects for matching supply with load for data centers,"" Hartwig said.

The intrigue: Asked whether Trump 2.0's reversal of climate policies creates headwinds, he argued the opposite, citing ""real interest in baseload power that can add to grid resilience.""

He also said behind-the-meter deployments are possible, avoiding the need for transmission or waiting in interconnection queues.

State of play: ""Its compact design features an 18 MW turbine about the size of a car engine, allowing for efficient scaling and cost reductions,"" the announcement states.

Its modular system and oxy-combustion tech don't produce exhaust or pollution, avoiding the cost of adding separate CO2 capture units.

Scaling the technology provides an eventual pathway toward getting under $100/ton of removal, the post states.

The tech also works using natural gas, which would provide power with CO2 capture, but it's not removal without the biomass.

The bottom line: ""The demand from AI is a big part of helping pull technologies like ours across the development valleys of death, to get a new technology into the world,"" Hartwig said.",https://images.axios.com/qrL0fG8lxmy16vSCUiwY4oIBqx8=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2025/07/07/1751929782005.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 10:07:01.512991

Plant-based nutrition brand Kate Farms has launched two high-protein shakes to tackle “critical nutrition gaps” from GLP-1 use, its first product since its acquisition by Danone.

Just a week after finalising its takeover by dairy giant Danone, US plant-based nutrition firm Kate Farms is taking on Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and the like with new shakes that target a major side effect.

These weight-loss drugs work by suppressing people’s appetite, and this can lead to muscle loss and “critical nutrition gaps”, the brand said. Research shows that GLP-1 use can lead to a 25-40% decrease in muscle mass over eight to 16 months, several times greater than non-medicated weight loss approaches and age-related muscle loss.

Kate Farms’s High-Protein Nutrition Shakes have been specifically formulated to address this “unmet health need”. Made from a base of pea protein, they’re designed to support muscle health, manage weight, and navigate GLP-1 treatment.

“We’ve heard clearly from healthcare professionals and GLP-1 users that appetite suppression often leads to unintentional muscle loss and nutrient gaps. That’s a serious concern,” Kate Farms CMO Catherine Hayden tells Green Queen.

“This product was developed with those insights in mind: 25g of protein, 6g of fibre for digestive health and satiety, and 27 essential vitamins and minerals,” she adds.

Built on input from health experts and GLP-1 users

The shakes are available in chocolate and strawberry flavours, and contain no sugar, instead relying on monk fruit and stevia leaf extracts for sweetening. They contain Spectra, a plant-based phytonutrient blend shown to stimulate antioxidant activity and inhibit free radical production.

The 325ml cartons contain all nine essential amino acids that our bodies can’t produce, making the shakes a complete protein. They’re available in a ready-to-drink format on its website and Amazon for $55 per 12-pack.

The nutrition shakes are the result of 18 months of R&D and hundreds of rounds of iteration, nutrient refinement, and quality assurance. Kate Farms studied the nutritional shortcomings of existing options on the market and consulted with leading healthcare experts and GLP-1 users.

“We conducted extensive taste testing at our Innovation and Quality Center, which is co-located with our headquarters. This included preference testing and sensory panels – particularly with GLP-1 users – who helped shape the final flavour and formula,” explains Hayden.

“GLP-1 users have expressed experiencing changes in their perception of flavour while taking these medications, particularly becoming more sensitive to sweetness,” she adds, nodding to a phenomenon dubbed ‘Ozempic tongue‘.

“Our sensory work included panellists currently taking GLP-1 medications, in addition to panellists not currently taking those medications, to ensure that we were able to delight consumers, regardless of what tools they are using on their health journeys. We didn’t launch until we had something people genuinely wanted to drink every day.”

Why Kate Farms is focusing on GLP-1 and protein

One in eight Americans has already used a GLP-1 medication, and forecasts suggest this could rise to up to 70 million people by 2028 – and by that year, they’ll likely have boosted the national GDP by 1%.

Ozempic and its counterparts have had a knock-on effect on the food industry, with GLP-1 users spending 11% less on most categories of food, and over half (56%) aiming to make healthier food choices. Foods high in sugar, fat and calories stand to lose, while protein and fibre are all the rage.

Food companies are already rethinking their offerings. Nestlé has a new brand dedicated to GLP-1 users, Coca-Cola has launched a prebiotic soda, while PepsiCo bought Poppi for nearly $2B. Conagra Brands has introduced ‘GLP-1 friendly’ labels on packaging for some of its Healthy Choice ready meals, and Daily Harvest (now owned by Chobani) now offers a line of high-protein, high-fibre smoothies.

“The rise of GLP-1s has reinforced that people need clinically precise, sustaining nutrition, and we’re proud to deliver it,” says Hayden, before adding: “This shake was purpose-built for anyone navigating health change – whether or not they’re using GLP-1 medications. We’re focused on people managing weight intentionally, supporting muscle health and seeking doctor-trusted, clean-label nutrition that works.”

The launch serves the growing demand for protein. A 3,000-person survey last year found that the two nutrients Americans are most interested in consuming were protein (71%) and fibre (64%). And polling by Chobani revealed that 85% of these consumers are looking to add more protein to their diet this year.

“Protein is more in demand than ever because people are focusing on strength, muscle health and long-term health – especially amid weight-loss journeys or GLP-1 treatment. But not all protein is created equal,” says Hayden, pointing to the complete amino acid profile of its shakes. “It’s clinically developed, allergen-free and designed without artificial sweeteners or preservatives – helping consumers feel the difference in both taste, quality and outcomes without compromising on ingredient selection of quality.”

She continues: “While plant protein may have had sensory hurdles in the past, we are seeing an increasing number of consumers who are seeking to add more plants to their diets. Plant-based protein options are currently outpacing growth in the ready-to-drink protein shake market. The opportunity that we see is to bring our wholesome ingredients with clinical precision to the growing plant-based segment.”

Danone acquisition will help Kate Farms expand nutrition access

The High-Protein Nutrition Shakes are the first products Kate Farms has launched as a Danone portfolio company. The two companies announced the acquisition in May, with the goal of expanding the firm’s nutrition formulas and shakes to hospitals and consumers across the US and beyond.

“This is a merger of missions. Danone shares our belief that good nutrition is essential to better health and that alignment is what makes this partnership so meaningful,” says Hayden.

While these new shakes were already in development before the acquisition, they represent “exactly why the partnership makes sense”: “It’s about scaling purposefully – meeting more people’s needs with science-based, high-integrity nutrition. We see this as the first of many innovations that reflect our shared mission.”

Founded in 2012, Kate Farms has raised $188M over several rounds to date, including a $75M Series C round led by Novo Holdings, the parent company of Ozempic and Wegovy manufacturer Novo Nordisk. It has a deep focus on the concept of food-as-medicine. According to a poll by the Rockefeller Foundation last month, nine in 10 patients would prefer to rely more on healthy eating than on medications to manage their condition.

“Kate Farms is staying focused on what we’ve always done best: providing clinically-developed, plant-based nutrition that’s trusted by doctors and loved by customers,” Hayden says when asked about the firm’s plan over the next 12 months.

“Being part of Danone allows us to bring that same high-integrity nutrition to more people across both medical and everyday wellness settings – while maintaining the standards, intention, and care Kate Farms is known for.”",https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/danone-kate-farms-ozempic-glp-1-high-protein-plant-based-nutrition-shakes-social.png,N,,2025-07-08 10:06:36.878405

Yet, while most of Kate Farms’ business comes from such B2B sales (it now supplies product to more than 1,400 hospitals), the marketer is not new to CPG.
Its line of Nutrition Shakes now represent Kate Farm’s fastest-growing product segment, Heyden says, with special appeal to people with food sensitivities.
“We’re also actively engaging healthcare professionals [HCPs] so they can confidently recommend [the shake] to patients who need clean-label, high-protein nutrition,” she adds.
Marketing of the High Protein Nutrition Shake is being targeted to both HCPs and consumers via a “multichannel approach… anchored in the idea of Protein with Purpose—the belief that protein should do more than just hit a number,” Hayden says.","by Les Luchter , 66 minutes ago

In separate moves two months ago, Danone bought a majority interest in plant-based nutritional product provider Kate Farms and launched a line of ready-to-drink Oikos Protein Shakes targeting both fitness enthusiasts and the rapidly growing market of users of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs.

Timed to leverage Amazon Prime Day, Kate Farms today launches its own High Protein Nutrition Shakes, designed specifically “for people managing weight intentionally, including those using GLP-1s,” Kate Farms CMO Catherine Hayden tells Marketing Daily.

Hayden stresses that both Kate Farms and Oikos “are focused on expanding access to high-quality nutrition and addressing evolving consumer health needs.”

And both are looking to make inroads in what Hayden cites as a nearly $2 billion U.S. protein shake market. Within that category, though, is “an outsized level of growth in the plant-based segment,” she says. “The opportunity we saw was to bring our wholesome ingredients with clinical precision to [that] segment.”

The clinical part is key as, unlike Oikos, Kate Farms comes to the CPG protein shake market not from selling yogurt but from a nine-year history of selling both nutritional shakes and tube-feeding formulas to the healthcare community.

Yet, while most of Kate Farms’ business comes from such B2B sales (it now supplies product to more than 1,400 hospitals), the marketer is not new to CPG. It began selling in natural food stores even before its B2B push began. Its line of Nutrition Shakes now represent Kate Farm’s fastest-growing product segment, Heyden says, with special appeal to people with food sensitivities.

The difference between Kate Farms’ High Protein Nutrition Shake and other products, she claims, is plant-based nutrition “with clinical precision…developed with the same rigor as our medical nutrition portfolio.”

The new product is launching on Amazon Prime Day “to reach highly engaged shoppers and drive early trial and awareness,” says Hayden. It's also available via KateFarms.com, to reach consumers “already searching for trusted, high-protein options.”

Retail expansion is then planned for later this year and 2026, she says.

“We’re also actively engaging healthcare professionals [HCPs] so they can confidently recommend [the shake] to patients who need clean-label, high-protein nutrition,” she adds.

Marketing of the High Protein Nutrition Shake is being targeted to both HCPs and consumers via a “multichannel approach… anchored in the idea of Protein with Purpose—the belief that protein should do more than just hit a number,” Hayden says. “This shake was created to help people stay nourished through real change, whether they’re managing weight, using GLP-1s, or being more intentional about their health.

“For consumers, we’re leading with that purpose, not just the product features, but why they matter,” she explains.

“In designing the product, we focused on consumers who were on a health journey that may benefit not just from more grams of protein, but an overall product that could help support their nutrition goals. For us, that means in addition to 25 grams of plant-based protein, there’s zero grams of sugar and 160 calories, 27 vitamins and minerals to fill nutrient gaps commonly left by weight loss and GLP-1 use, and six grams of fiber to aid digestion.”

In comparison, Oikos’ new shakes have 30 grams of protein, five grams of prebiotic fiber and one gram of sugar.

“We see our new shake as complementary to other products in the [Danone] portfolio,” notes Hayden. “Together, we’re able to meet a wider range of needs and offer more people the right nutritional support—whether they’re on a personal health journey or managing a medical condition.”",https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2025/07/07/kate-farms_nB27rBr.png,N,,2025-07-08 10:06:41.685926

McDonald's adds Daily Double burger to menu

That's not the only new thing under the golden arches. McDonald's has also added a new double burger on its menu: the Daily Double.

The Daily Double, available now nationwide, is made with two beef patties, a slice of American cheese, shredded lettuce, slivered onions, mayo and two tomato slices. The burger had been available in limited markets including Miami, Chicago and Seattle, but will be available nationally through 2025, the company said.

On July 22, the Daily Double will join McDonald's McValue Meal Deal options, served with a 4-piece order of Chicken McNuggets, small fries and small soft drink ($6 or $7; pricing depends on your restaurant). That menu still includes the $5 Meal Deal.

The burger is now appearing in the McDonald's app, where you can also get deals including a free medium order of fries with a $1 purchase in the app every Friday through the end of 2025.

Coming soon: the Snack Wrap

After nearly a decade, McDonald's announced the return of the Snack Wrap, one of McDonald's new McCrispy Strips topped with shredded lettuce and shredded cheese, wrapped in a soft flour tortilla. They're available in either Spicy (with a habanero kick) or Ranch (with Ranch dressing and hints of garlic and onion).

The Snack Wrap will be available on its own or in a combo meal featuring two Snack Wraps, medium fries and a drink.

Snack Wraps will be coming back to store menus permanently beginning Thursday, July 10, the company said.

To celebrate the return of the item, McDonald's has launched snackwrapfiles.com, a website they're calling ""fans’ VIP entry to all things Snack Wrap.""

S&P Global Ratings said it’s considering cutting Centene Corp.’s credit ratings to junk, citing the health insurer’s suspending its 2025 profit outlook. Centene said last week that it was withdrawing its previous forecast for its earnings for the year, because insurance market trends were veering from its assumptions, particularly in the plans it offers under the Affordable Care Act.

Molina Healthcare became the latest health insurer to warn that higher medical costs will hit earnings this year, adding to Wall Street’s worries about an industry already facing the loss of millions of customers because of the newly passed Republican megabill. Last week, shares plunged across the industry after Molina’s larger competitor Centene withdrew its financial guidance for 2025, saying its profits would fall well short of what the company previously expected. In the wake of that, Molina’s announcement wasn’t a complete surprise, limiting the immediate downside to the shares of the California-based managed care company and its competitors.

The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) has granted conditional approval for a proposed commercial cooperation between Singapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines.

The approval comes after CCCS reviewed the airlines’ proposed collaboration, which involves coordination on pricing and capacity for their full-service operations — specifically on the highly trafficked Singapore-Kuala Lumpur (SIN-KUL) route.

The application was first submitted on 24 March 2023, and updated on 3 November 2023, to clarify that the cooperation applies only to the airlines’ full-service operations.

CCCS found that the cooperation could reduce competition due to coordination on pricing and seat capacity.

To address these concerns, the airlines submitted a set of commitments which include maintaining weekly seat capacity at pre-cooperation levels, proposing capacity increases only upon meeting certain performance targets, submitting annual operational data for their respective low-cost carriers on the SIN-KUL route, and appointing an independent auditor to monitor compliance with these commitments.

From February 11 to 4 March 2025, CCCS consulted industry stakeholders. No objections were raised.

CCCS also considered the upcoming exit of Jetstar Asia from the SIN-KUL route and concluded that the commitments were sufficient.

Based on this, CCCS has approved the cooperation with conditions.

Peltz, who has resigned from the Board, effective today, to devote more time to his other commitments. Winkleblack said, ""We are grateful to Matt for his many contributions to Wendy's over the years. We have made tremendous progress as a brand since Matt joined the Board, and we wish him all the best in his future endeavors."" Winkleblack also said, ""We are excited to have Brad join our Board.

Effective July 14, 2025, Chad will be responsible for overseeing the Finance function for Medtronic Diabetes and supporting initiatives aimed at accelerating profitable growth and delivering shareholder value as it prepares to become fully independent.

Chad brings over 25 years of financial leadership experience across healthcare, consumer, and industrial sectors. Most recently, he served as CFO at BIC (BB:PA), a publicly traded global consumer goods leader, where he played a pivotal role in the successful execution of the company's transformation to drive innovation, sustainable growth, operational efficiency, and shareholder value. He started his career at General Electric, where he spent a decade in management positions of increasing responsibility in corporate audit and financial planning, as well as in a senior finance role in GE Energy. Chad then assumed CFO roles at Raffaela Apparel Group (a Cerberus Capital Management portfolio company) and Slingshot Health, and held senior operational finance roles at Tenex Capital Management, a middle-market private equity firm he co-founded with over $1 billion in investments. He holds a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and serves on the board of directors at Stamford Hospital.

His appointment underscores our commitment to building a strong foundation for long-term success so we can continue to enhance the lives of individuals with diabetes we're privileged to serve.""

In June, Medtronic announced MiniMed as the name for the company following the intended separation. The name honors its 40-year legacy of being at the forefront of transforming diabetes care to make it simpler and more accessible to the millions of people around the world with intensively managed type 1 and type 2 diabetes (or those needing daily insulin injections to manage their blood sugar levels because their body doesn't produce enough insulin or isn't able to use it effectively). MiniMed's Mission is to make diabetes more predictable so everyone can embrace life to the fullest.

""I'm excited for the opportunity to help shape the future of a company with such a meaningful Mission, and I look forward to working with Que and the leadership team to build a strong, agile finance organization that supports innovation, drives sustainable growth, and creates long-term value for all stakeholders,"" said Chad Spooner.

Medtronic expects to complete the separation within 18 months of the initial announcement through a series of capital markets transactions, subject to customary conditions and legal requirements including consultations with works councils and other employee representative bodies.

Starbucks UK is reopening applications for its Accelerated Leadership Programme, a 13-month fast-track scheme aimed at turning entry-level hires into store managers.

The initiative, which coincides with the UK’s Youth Employment Week, will accept over 20 new participants this year. No previous work or hospitality experience is required.

Applications open on 7 July and close on 21 July.

Training for each participant is free, with Starbucks investing £5,000 (£100,000 in total) in their professional development.

Delivered in partnership with training provider Corndel, the programme combines hands-on experience in stores and ends with a Level 3 apprenticeship qualification, roughly equivalent to an A Level.

Graduates will also receive accreditation from the Chartered Management Institute (CMI).

This is the second intake for the newly formed Accelerated Leadership Programme, with 14 partners currently progressing through the scheme after the first round of applications opened earlier this year in April.

In total, Starbucks will invest more than £170,000 across the two cohorts.

The initiative is part of Starbucks UK’s ongoing commitment to providing young people with career opportunities.

It runs alongside a year-round apprenticeship scheme offering 150 new roles across the business, from entry-level baristas to degree-level positions in the support centre.

Such discussions contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).
We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable securities law.","CHARLOTTE, N.C., July 8, 2025 – Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) today announced plans to evaluate strategic alternatives for its Productivity Solutions and Services (“PSS”) and Warehouse and Workflow Solutions (“WWS”) businesses, which serve the transportation, warehouse and logistics markets. This enables Honeywell to further simplify its portfolio in order to accelerate value creation ahead of its planned separation into three independent, industry-leading companies, which is expected to be complete in the second half of 2026.

“Today’s announcement marks an important milestone in positioning Honeywell for success as a pure-play automation business following our planned Honeywell Aerospace separation next year,” said Vimal Kapur, Chairman and CEO of Honeywell. “With a simpler and more cohesive portfolio that serves the end markets of buildings, process and industrials, Honeywell will focus on our core areas of automation expertise, each of which is exposed to long-term secular growth drivers that position us as a powerful, global automation leader.”

PSS, with 2024 revenue of more than $1 billion, is a leading provider of mobile computers, barcode scanners, and printing solutions serving the warehouse and logistics market. WWS, which generated nearly $1 billion in revenue in 2024, is a leading provider of supply chain and warehouse automation projects, services and products – including automated sortation systems, palletizers, conveyors and robotics solutions as well as aftermarket services and software. WWS operates commercially under the brand names Intelligrated and Transnorm.

Kapur added: “Both leaders in their respective markets, PSS and WWS have deep customer and channel relationships, broad product offerings and innovative technologies that help improve efficiency, safety and productivity across the transportation, warehouse and logistics markets. We are encouraged by the recent performance of PSS and WWS and intend to seek opportunities to build on their unique strengths as we determine the best path forward that maximizes value for all our stakeholders.”

As Honeywell continues shaping its portfolio ahead of the planned separation, it has also appointed industry veteran Jim Masso to lead its process automation business. Masso will serve as President and CEO of Honeywell Process Automation, effective July 14, 2025. He brings 20 years of experience in energy services, engineering, operations and management, most recently as President & CEO of Allied Power Group. Prior to that, he held several senior leadership roles at General Electric and delivered transformative solutions across GE's energy portfolio.

Kapur concluded: “We are pleased to welcome Jim Masso to Honeywell to lead our process automation business. Having dedicated his career to leading complex, large-scale projects across the industry, he brings a deep understanding of the energy sector and an extensive background in driving customer-centric innovation that make him well-suited to lead this business into its next chapter of growth and innovation.”

Honeywell’s evaluation of strategic alternatives for its PSS and WWS businesses will run in parallel with ongoing portfolio workstreams and will not impact previously announced timelines for the separations of Solstice Advanced Materials by the end of 2025 or early 2026, and Honeywell Aerospace in the second half of 2026. There can be no assurance that pursuing strategic alternatives will result in any transaction or other outcome.

Since June 2023, Honeywell has announced a number of strategic actions to drive organic growth and simplify its portfolio, including $14 billion of accretive acquisitions: Compressor Controls Corporation, SCADAfence, the Access Solutions business from Carrier Global, Civitanavi Systems, CAES Systems, the LNG business from Air Products, Sundyne, Johnson Matthey's Catalyst Technologies Business and Li-ion Tamer. Honeywell also completed the sale of its Personal Protective Equipment business to Protective Industrial Products in May 2025.

Honeywell has retained Centerview Partners as the company’s financial advisor to assist in assessing strategic alternatives.

Capgemini plans to acquire WNS for $3.3 billion to strengthen its business process outsourcing. The deal awaits shareholder and regulatory approvals, expected by the end of 2025. Capgemini anticipates revenue and margin growth from the acquisition. The combined entity aims to compete with major consulting firms. Concerns exist about AI's impact on the BPO sector and the acquisition's financial burden.

French IT services major Capgemini is keen on building its business process outsourcing (BPO) muscle with its latest acquisition: domain leader WNS. The deal, announced on Monday, will see the two companies pool their capabilities to address the growing enterprise demand for advanced, automated services.

Concerns, however, remain over the prospects. Analysts and investors are worried about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the BPO sector, and the subsequent hit on revenue from the vertical. Capgemini shares reflected these worries during yesterday’s trade.

We take a look at the bones of the deal, and it's likely implications:

Capgemini-WNS deal: Key details

Capgemini had agreed to pay $76.5 for each WNS share, which amounts to $3.3 billion (about Rs 28,280 crore) in cash. This is 17% higher than the closing price of the shares on July 3. They rallied 14% on Monday.

The IT major has secured bridge financing of €4 billion to pay this sum, as well as meet some other obligations. It will refinance the bridge with €1 billion cash and the rest through debt issuance.

The boards of both companies have consented to the deal, which now awaits approval from WNS shareholders and regulators. It is expected to be closed by the end of 2025.

Capgemini expects the acquisition to immediately boost its revenue and margins, projecting a 4% rise in earnings per share (EPS) in 2026 and 7% the year after. It has projected revenue synergies between €100–140 million ($117.8–164.9 million), and an annual pretax run rate for cost and operating model synergies of between 50 million and 70 million euros by the end of 2027.

Acquiring WNS’s $1.3 billion in revenue will be a drop in Capgemini’s $25.5 billion business. It will, however, raise the headcount of the combined entity by a whopping 19%—an indication of the manual nature of WNS’s work.

Paradigm shift

The deal comes at a time when enterprises are looking to replace people-intensive business operations with AI-driven solutions for lower costs and efficient execution. Pure-play BPO companies lack the technical knowhow to address this demand, according to HFS Research founder Phil Fersht. That is a gap the Capgemini-WNS combine can capitalise on.

“By combining consulting, technology, and domain-driven BPO, Capgemini + WNS has the potential to lead AI-powered business transformation, with a robust incumbent WNS client base hungry to replace full-time equivalents (FTEs) with technology solutions,” he wrote.

The combined entity could compete on an equal footing with Accenture, and outcompete the Big 4 of consulting — PwC, EY, KPMG and Deloitte, Fersht noted.

""From a competitive perspective, another potential big win for Capgemini is its new positioning against the Big 4, which have traditionally dominated consulting and technology services. With WNS’s operational expertise integrated into its offerings, Capgemini could deliver end-to-end transformation services that the Big 4 cannot – and at lower price points,"" the analyst wrote.

The flip side

Some analysts, and investors, are worried about the impact generative AI could have on the BPO sector, which Capgemini is looking to tap, noted brokerage house Morgan Stanley.

The bear case is that AI would transform BPO from a people-intensive business to one that is much more highly automated and managed by software, the brokerage noted. This could lead to a fall in BPO revenues and expose incumbent vendors to competition from new entrants, it said.

Disrupting BPO space with generative AI is an opportunity that investors might favour, but there needs to be evidence that WNS is the right vehicle for such a change, Morgan Stanley said.

Also, while WNS is unlikely to prove transformational for Capgemini’s business, the acquisition cost will weigh on the IT major’s balance sheet for a couple of years.

WNS, at a glance

Started by British Airways in 1996 as a captive unit, WNS offers BPO and data analytics services to blue-chip clients, including Coca-Cola, T-Mobile, United Airlines, Aviva, British Gas, Virgin Atlantic Airways, M&T Bank, Centrica and McCain Foods.

It serves over 700 clients with a 64,000-strong workforce operating in 13 countries through 64 delivery centres.

WNS reported a better-than-expected but marginal 0.6% drop in revenue at $1.31 billion for fiscal year 2025, with an 18.7% operating margin. Profit increased slightly to $170.1 million, from $147.5 million the previous year. Revenue has grown by around 9% in constant currency terms, on average, over the last three fiscal years. It also acquired Kipi.ai for $63.4 million in the March quarter to expand its capabilities in data, analytics, and AI.

The IT and tech services subsector is poised for growth as businesses accelerate cloud adoption, AI-driven network automation, and edge computing deployments. While these seem like big, nebulous trends, they require very real products like switches and firewalls as well as implementation services. On the other hand, challenges on the horizon include intensifying competition from cloud-native networking providers, regulatory scrutiny over data privacy and cybersecurity, and potential supply chain constraints for networking hardware. While AI and automation will enhance network efficiency and security, they also introduce risks related to algorithmic bias, compliance complexity, and increased energy consumption.

Market Update

As a result of the Fed’s rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has come down from frothy levels post-pandemic. The general rise in the price of goods and services is trending towards the Fed’s 2% goal as of late, which is good news. The higher rates that fought inflation also didn't slow economic activity enough to catalyze a recession. So far, soft landing. This, combined with recent rate cuts (half a percent in September 2024 and a quarter percent in November 2024) have led to strong stock market performance in 2024. The icing on the cake for 2024 returns was Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. Presidential Election in early November, sending major indices to all-time highs in the week following the election. Still, debates around the health of the economy and the impact of potential tariffs and corporate tax cuts remain, leaving much uncertainty around 2025.",https://news-assets.stockstory.org/cover-images/cisco-cover-image-f37435420cb6_2025-03-04-183054_lflh.jpeg,N,,2025-07-08 09:08:04.707985

These steps come amid the coffee house’s troubles with declining sales as customers become more health-conscious. CEO Brian Niccol has pledged to revamp the brand by testing and rolling out healthier products. Starbucks has not given a specific timeline for implementing these changes.

Starbucks Steps Up Rebranding Initiatives

In June, Niccol met with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary (HHS) Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to discuss the potential for aligning Starbucks’ menu with the Trump administration’s health priorities. The HHS has specifically opposed the increasing use of seed oils in foods, including canola and soybean oil. However, there is no proven theory that prolonged consumption of these oils leads to inflammation or increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Notably, many items on Starbucks’ U.S. menu contain canola oil, such as bacon, potato bakes, and the Gouda and egg sandwich. The company has also made other health-related menu changes at its outlets, such as removing sugar from its matcha powder, a move that has, in fact, boosted sales. Similarly, the chain stopped charging extra for non-dairy milk and is testing unsweetened protein powder that can be added to any cold foam flavor.

Starbucks earns roughly 74% of its revenue from the U.S. market, making it the company’s largest contributor. Additionally, 19% of its revenue comes from Food sales. Therefore, it is important for the coffee chain to keep modifying and aligning its menu with American consumers’ shifting food preferences.

Is SBUX a Good Stock to Buy?

Analysts remain divided on Starbucks’ long-term stock trajectory. On TipRanks, SBUX stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys and 11 Hold ratings. Also, the average Starbucks price target of $95.52 implies 2% upside potential from current levels. Year-to-date, SBUX stock has gained 3.9%.

How Kroger, Albertsons are moving forward following failed merger

After two years of work on a deal that would have had extraordinary scale in the grocery industry, the attempted merger of The Kroger Co. and Albertsons Cos. was ultimately blocked by regulators and terminated in December 2024. How has each company's operations fared following their falling-out?

On March 3, Kroger revealed the resignation of CEO Rodney McMullen after an internal investigation into his personal conduct. A company statement emphasized that McMullen's alleged breach of corporate ethics was not related to the business, including its financial performance, operations, reporting or talent.

While not quite as dramatic as the Kroger CEO departure, Albertsons also made news with its own leadership change. On May 1, Susan Morris, EVP and COO, assumed the role of CEO following the planned retirement of Vivek Sankaran. Morris also joined Albertsons' board of directors, succeeding Sankaran.

Spain: Spar wins the fight for tourists in southern Gran Canaria

More than 4,8 million tourists visit Gran Canaria each year, and nearly 70% of them are concentrated in the south of the island, especially in the municipalities of San Bartolomé de Tirajana and Mogán. In this context, Spar Gran Canaria has consolidated its leadership in sales penetration and adaptation to the tourist customer, surpassing national chains that operate with more homogeneous formulas. HiperDino is not even present in this battle.

While national retailers focus on large formats and rigid opening hours, Spar has increased its presence in tourist areas, achieving coverage that allows it to capture a large share of the market, which represents more than 60% of tourist spending on food outside hotels. This strategy has led more than 40% of foreign tourists to choose Spar for their regular shopping.

UK: Amazon expands UK grocery presence with new Gopuff partnership

From this week, Amazon customers nationwide will be able to order a wide range of groceries, snacks, drinks and household essentials from Gopuff via the Amazon website, with deliveries arriving in under 60 minutes, and as fast as 15 minutes in some areas. The launch follows a trial in Birmingham and Salford earlier this year, and marks a significant expansion in Amazon's third-party grocery proposition, with Gopuff joining existing UK partners including Morrisons, Iceland and Co-op.

To support the new launch, Gopuff is offering 50 core grocery lines price-matched to Aldi, along with promotions such as 3-for-2 on selected fresh produce, while Amazon Prime members are also being incentivised to try the service with free delivery on their first order over £20 and a 15% discount on their first six Gopuff orders.

Ireland: ""Supermarket price probe must lead to decisive action to ease costs for families""

The latest consumer watchdog probe into grocery prices must have teeth, according to Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore. Speaking ahead of the party's motion on supermarket transparency this Wednesday, Deputy Whitmore said:

""The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has re-opened a probe into grocery prices, but the government has failed to give it requisite powers to do its job. A box-ticking exercise serves no purpose for the families around the country who are struggling to make ends meet. The rise in grocery prices, in recent years, has been astronomical. Many families are now spending €3,000 more a year to put food on the table than they were in 2021.""

South Korea: Vouchers leave Korean supermarket franchise owners in the cold again

As the government prepares to distribute up to 550,000 won ($400) per person in consumer vouchers starting July 21 to spur spending and aid small businesses, supermarket franchise owners find themselves left out — again. While mom-and-pop stores and convenience store franchises will accept the vouchers, large corporate supermarkets known as Super Supermarkets (SSMs) have been excluded, a decision fueling anger among hundreds of small business owners who run these stores under big-name banners. Owners argue the policy is unfair. Unlike big-box supermarkets or company-run outlets, nearly half of all SSM branches nationwide are individually owned franchises.

South Africa: Major threat to Pick n Pay and other retailers in South Africa

Pick n Pay has warned that South African retailers face the growing threat of increased competition from the rapid expansion of the informal economy and its retail sector. In its latest annual results, the retailer outlined the country's difficult operating conditions, including low economic growth, high unemployment, inflationary pressure, and persistent infrastructure challenges.

""Consumers are increasingly price-sensitive, demanding better value and lower prices,"" Pick n Pay said, adding that the entire retail market is undergoing a ""structural shift."" This shift is being shaped by rising demand for discount and value-driven retail formats. ""Cash-strapped consumers are increasingly turning to retailers that offer low prices, trusted quality, and convenience,"" the group said.

Perfect timing Contextual advertising technology has enabled creative formats that traditional media could never achieve.
AI algorithms monitored Fortnite gameplay to detect when characters’ energy levels dropped, triggering brand messaging at the perfect contextual moment.
But when advertising becomes indistinguishable from content, through perfect contextual timing, creative work finally achieves its intended impact.
They’ll be those who understand perfect timing beats perfect creative every single time.","Traditional advertising operates on a simple premise: create compelling content, then interrupt audiences to show it. This approach built empires in television and print. But gaming audiences have systematically rejected this model.

The numbers tell the story. Sixty-six percent of gen Z actively use ad blockers. Gaming streams see 89% ad-skip rates when pre-roll interrupts gameplay. Meanwhile, the gaming market represents over £2.8bn in advertising spend annually – money largely wasted on creative that audiences actively avoid.

The problem isn’t the quality of creative work. Agencies produce brilliant campaigns daily. The problem is timing. A beautifully crafted 30-second spot becomes worthless noise when it interrupts a crucial gaming moment.

This disconnect forced our industry to confront an uncomfortable truth: context determines creative success more than content quality ever could.

Perfect timing

Contextual advertising technology has enabled creative formats that traditional media could never achieve. These aren’t minor optimizations – they’re entirely new creative possibilities that have been evolving over years of innovation.

Early experiments, such as Danone’s ‘Small Hunger’ campaign, demonstrated the potential. AI algorithms monitored Fortnite gameplay to detect when characters’ energy levels dropped, triggering brand messaging at the perfect contextual moment. This 2021 campaign generated over 650,000 views and proved that audiences would engage with advertising that felt genuinely integrated with content.

But recent campaigns have taken contextual creativity to unprecedented levels.

Take T-Mobile’s breakthrough voice recognition campaign in Poland. Instead of interrupting streams with traditional ads, the technology monitored stream audio for the phrase “the fastest network.” When streamers naturally mentioned these words during gameplay, the system automatically triggered T-Mobile-branded animations on screen.

The results defied traditional advertising metrics. Across 275 streamers, “the fastest network” became the most frequently spoken phrase in Polish gaming streams in Q4 2024, mentioned over 10,000 times organically. Brand recall increased by 11 percentage points, top-of-mind awareness grew by six points, and brand affinity jumped by 16 points – metrics that surpass most traditional TV campaigns.

The creative breakthrough wasn’t the messaging itself. The revolution was perfect timing.

Cheetos pushed contextual creativity even further with their groundbreaking ‘Chepard Game’ – the first branded game integrated directly with Twitch streams. Rather than showing standard video ads, the brand created custom software that enabled viewers to care for a virtual cheetah through chat commands during streams. This Tamagotchi-inspired experience turned advertising into collaborative entertainment.

Executed across 220 streamers, the campaign generated over 3.2m views and 50,000 viewer interactions. More importantly, it achieved a six-point brand awareness increase and an 11-point boost in perception as a brand supporting gamers. The creative content was a simple virtual pet game – the genius was contextual deployment that made advertising feel native to the streaming experience.

Memorable moments

These successes reveal three fundamental shifts marketers must understand.

Firstly, invisibility requires more creativity, not less. When audiences can’t tell they’re seeing advertising, brands must work harder to create memorable moments. Contextual campaigns demand creative thinking that goes beyond traditional formats.

Secondly, technology enables new creative formats. AI monitoring opens possibilities that human media buyers could never execute. Real-time content analysis creates opportunities for creative integration that simply didn’t exist before.

Measurement changes everything. When campaigns integrate naturally with content, traditional metrics become irrelevant. Success means tracking organic mentions, sentiment shifts, and genuine engagement rather than impressions and click-through rates.

The most forward-thinking brands now approach creativity as a timing problem rather than a content challenge. They ask: ‘When is our audience most receptive?’ instead of: ‘What should we say?’

Intended impact

Gaming represents just the beginning of contextual advertising’s creative potential. As AI technology improves, brands will soon execute contextual campaigns across podcasts, social media, and even traditional television.

The fundamental lesson transcends gaming: audiences will always choose content over advertising. But when advertising becomes indistinguishable from content, through perfect contextual timing, creative work finally achieves its intended impact.

Brands investing in contextual technology today aren’t just optimizing campaigns – they’re preparing for an advertising future where context determines creative success. In this future, the most creative brands won’t be those with the biggest budgets or flashiest executions. They’ll be those who understand perfect timing beats perfect creative every single time.

The gaming industry taught us this lesson first. Smart marketers will apply it everywhere else.",https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-prod/s3/opinion/356431/gaming.jpg?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format,N,,2025-07-08 10:06:46.044934

With 76% of healthcare providers reporting feeling overwhelmed by the pace of innovation, the index offers critical insights into the barriers physicians face when translating breakthroughs into clinical practice. Naumovic outlined how J&J is using these findings to drive meaningful support for oncologists—through enhanced research access, community-based care models, responsible integration of AI, and targeted efforts to reduce cognitive burden across the care continuum.

Pharmaceutical Executive: If the Oncology Care Index were revisited two years from now, what progress would you hope to see—and how is J&J working to help realize that vision?

Biljana Naumovic: Fast forward a few years, and I’d really like to see measurable progress in the key areas we've identified. First and foremost, I hope to see a decrease in the levels of overwhelm reported—particularly by supporting community oncologists with earlier access to information and research engagement.

We're also focused on improving care transitions for patients across institutions, wherever Johnson & Johnson can play a supportive role. Another important goal is increasing the involvement of advanced practice providers and nurses in care delivery—whether in oncology, urology, or other community settings.

These are all areas we’re actively working on. In the disease areas where Johnson & Johnson is directly involved, I’m optimistic that we’ll see meaningful improvements in how care is delivered—making the process more seamless and straightforward for both physicians and patients.

Full Interview Summary: Johnson & Johnson (J&J) launched the Oncology Care Index to better understand the mounting pressures oncologists face amid rapid innovation—highlighting that 76% of healthcare providers feel overwhelmed. In 2024 alone, the FDA approved 50 new indications and 11 new molecular entities, underscoring the urgent need to translate breakthroughs into practical care. J&J uses the index not as a self-promotional tool but as a catalyst for industry-wide dialogue around care delivery, implementation of innovation, and systemic barriers.

Two insights from the index stood out: the difficulty community oncologists face in accessing clinical research and the fragmentation in the continuum of care as patients transition between treatment centers. To address these, J&J is expanding access to community-based clinical trials and co-developing protocols with community providers, particularly in areas like multiple myeloma and lung cancer. They're also pushing for policy changes that support non-academic trial sites. At the same time, the company is investing in training and infrastructure to ensure continuity of care and appropriate treatment closer to patients’ homes.

J&J sees artificial intelligence (AI) as a major opportunity to alleviate provider burden but acknowledges that true adoption requires collaboration across the ecosystem. The company is leveraging AI to improve trial recruitment and streamline decision-making but stresses the need for open, connected databases and industry-wide alignment.

To combat burnout and cognitive overload, J&J is focused on delivering timely, contextualized education and CME programs, supporting advanced practice providers and nurses, and enhancing patient support services.

Looking ahead, J&J hopes to see decreased provider overwhelm and more seamless integration of innovation into care, driven by empowered community oncologists, improved transitions of care, and greater engagement of frontline healthcare workers in both research and treatment delivery.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/pharmexec/80ee8398991bb2a0ac850aea6706537b131c5eae-1280x720.png?rect=0,30,645,606&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-07-08 08:01:29.987262

As the national reproductive health legal landscape shifts, including contraception and abortion access, some state and federal lawmakers have pressed for strengthened consumer protection laws surrounding reproductive health data.
Surovell said the U.S. Congress’ “My Body, My Data Act,” a measure to protect menstrual health data introduced by Democratic lawmakers, inspired him to bring a similar effort to Virginia.
He then worried about how law enforcement and government officials could use consumer data in the private sector.
The law protects reproductive health data, often collected in period tracking digital apps, and allows consumers to sue if their data is sold or released without their consent.","Disclosure pop-ups about the “cookies,” or other aggregate bits of data websites collect and store aren’t an uncommon experience while shopping online. What’s less common: when a pop-up indicates that your potential purchase of condoms, birth control medication or menstrual hygiene products is being noted digitally, a message Virginians have started seeing when they shop virtually for such products.

Since July 1, a new state law outlines that people’s personally identifiable reproductive or sexual health information cannot be obtained, disclosed, disseminated or sold without consumer consent. As new laws took effect in Virginia on July 1, Walmart has begun alerting customers about certain product or service searches and purchases.

“By viewing, searching for, or buying these products or services on our site, or using related features such as the Baby Registry, you consent to our use of this information to complete your purchase, provide the requested feature, and for general analytics, operations and fraud prevention,” a pop-up disclaimer now notifies people who visit Walmart’s website from within Virginia.

If consumers don’t want their data connected to their sexual or reproductive health to be stored, the disclaimer suggests they “avoid viewing, searching for, using or purchasing these products, services, or features.”

But not all pop-ups are new or specifically focused on reproductive-related information. Other retailers like CVS have more broad disclaimers about data collection. Its site explains that information collected about consumer behaviors is used “to provide our products and services recommendations, understand how you engage with our site, and improve the services we offer you.”

It also warns that it may share data with “trusted third parties” that include marketing, analytics and research “partners.”

This sort of data collection is a common practice in e-commerce and is a catalyst for targeted advertisements that people experience elsewhere on the internet, like their social media feeds or when using search engines.

As the national reproductive health legal landscape shifts, including contraception and abortion access, some state and federal lawmakers have pressed for strengthened consumer protection laws surrounding reproductive health data.

Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax and Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, have introduced and supported legislation to shore up these protections.

Surovell said the U.S. Congress’ “My Body, My Data Act,” a measure to protect menstrual health data introduced by Democratic lawmakers, inspired him to bring a similar effort to Virginia.

“I don’t think a lot of people realize the information that private industry buys and sells about them,” he said in a recent call.

He then worried about how law enforcement and government officials could use consumer data in the private sector.

“I was concerned that attorneys generals in some other states who want to be more aggressive about prosecuting women or other people for helping women cross state lines to obtain either contraception or abortion services might use information that the private sector has in order to reverse engineer women and other people to prosecute,” Surovell said.

Surrovell and Favola also worked on bills to prevent menstrual data from being subject to search warrants, which Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed into law. Last year, Youngkin was lambasted by many, including former President Joe Biden and talk show host Stephen Colbert, for opposing the same bill in a previous legislative session.

“It should go without saying that when a woman has her period or visits a doctor, it is nobody’s business but her own,” Favola said earlier this year.

As more pregnant people travel to get abortions outside states where the medical procedure is banned or restricted, some states — including Alabama and Texas — have threatened legal repercussions for people who leave the state for an abortion, and for those who aid them.

This year Favola’s Senate Bill 754 passed the Democrat-controlled legislature and Youngkin signed it. The law protects reproductive health data, often collected in period tracking digital apps, and allows consumers to sue if their data is sold or released without their consent.

Walmart’s interpretation of the law prompted the pop-up disclaimer, and other companies will find their own way to follow suit.

“The companies are trying to figure out how to implement the bill,” Favola said in a text message.

Next, Favola wants to explore how to further refine the bill to ensure people’s identifiable information is protected.

“I made it clear that the law is focused on individually-identifiable data — not aggregate data,” she explained. “I expect to make some revisions next session.”

Further details will be discussed in a workgroup later this summer, she said.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-07-at-11.59.26-AM.png,N,,2025-07-08 09:08:00.416292

Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Julie Creswell report for The New York Times.

In short:

Companies including Kraft Heinz, Nestlé, and PepsiCo have agreed to remove petroleum-based dyes from processed foods by 2026, but Mars, which makes M&M’s, has not joined the initiative.

Industry advocates cite technical and economic hurdles to replacing synthetic dyes, including cost, supply limitations, and consumer preference for bright colors in candy.

Some states are stepping in with policies to ban or label products with artificial dyes, with West Virginia and Texas introducing regulations starting in 2027 and 2028.

Key quote:

“If people are celebrating and eating treats, they don’t want to be tasting beets.”

— Kirk Vashaw, CEO of Spangler Candy

Why this matters:

Synthetic food dyes, found in many brightly colored candies and cereals, have long been controversial. A growing body of research, including reviews by California health agencies, links some of these dyes to behavioral issues in children, especially those with ADHD. Red Dye No. 3 has already been flagged as a potential carcinogen. While Europe has restricted or banned many of these additives, U.S. regulations have lagged behind, leaving American consumers — especially children — more exposed. The stakes are high: Nearly one in five processed foods contain synthetic dyes. As federal efforts rely on voluntary compliance, states may play a larger role in shaping the food supply and protecting public health.",https://assets.rbl.ms/61170826/origin.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 10:07:16.033957

In parallel, Nike also expects a slight price increase in the United States starting next fall season.
One of the first companies to react was Hermès, which in mid-April announced price increases for its products starting in May.
This increase, however, will be on the company’s sales in the United States, precisely to compensate for the extra cost of bringing the merchandise into the country.
The conglomerate, in the hands of French businessman Bernard Arnaud, explained in mid-April its plans to move part of its production to the United States, where it already operates up to three plants.","The reciprocal tariffs announced by Donald Trump in April have hit fashion, which has its largest consumer market in the world in the United States and the largest concentration of its value chain in Asia. Three months later, the president of the American power has announced a new zero day for the entry into force of these levies, and that they will not catch fashion off guard on August 1. What have luxury, footwear and large retailers done so far to prepare for the tariff wave?

In 2024, the United States imported finished fashion, textiles and leather goods worth $147.488 billion, according to data from the U.S. International Trade Administration. Of all the goods purchased by the U.S. from the rest of the world, fashion accounted for 4.5% of the total last year.

A large part of these imports, moreover, come from textile hubs in Asia, where fashion accounts for a large part of the supply chain: China alone exported fashion to the United States for a value of $31,861 billion. From the reorganization of the supply chain announced by giants such as Nike to the price hikes proposed by Hermès, the fashion industry has had 90 days to prepare for an impact on fashion purchases abroad of almost 150 billion dollars, and the companies in the sector have not wasted the room for maneuver.

The United States imported fashion for almost 150 billion dollars in 2024

Large-scale distribution and footwear

The first companies to react were the large chains, which accumulate in the United States a significant weight of their income statements, and especially those of U.S. origin, which are more exposed to an increase in tariffs on trade with Asia. The latest was Nike, the U.S. footwear giant, which during the presentation of its annual results for 2024 estimated an impact of 1 billion on its gross costs.

During the conference with analysts, the company already announced the first measures planned to avoid the impact of the escalation, including reducing its sourcing from China from the current 16% to a single digit figure. In parallel, Nike also expects a slight price increase in the United States starting next fall season.

If the latest announcement has come from Nike, the shoe company Steve Madden or the Kontoor Brands group, both American, were among the first to announce their strategy to the possible new trade order. The path differs between the two companies: while Steve Madden announced back in February a price increase planned also for part of the fall-winter catalog and relocation of part of the value chain, Kontoor, owner of brands such as Lee, opted to maintain its production in Mexico, already with an eye on a possible compensation of the impact in 2026.

Nike was the last company to implement a strategic plan to avoid the tariff impact

Also in the group of U.S. companies, Ralph Lauren, Gap and Victoria’s Secret have estimated an impact on the companies’ financial results for this year. Although the three companies expect the tariff policy to have an impact of between $50 million and $150 million, only Ralph Lauren has commented on a possible strategy, whereby it plans to reduce its sourcing from any country, including China, to less than 20%.

Gap, on the other hand, which in the worst-case scenario could suffer an added gross cost of up to $300 million (or 150 million less in operating income), not only did not announce possible containment measures, but assured that it would maintain its repositioning strategy in Old Navy, Banana Republic and Gap.

On the other side of the ocean, the second-largest retailer H&M was another company to announce a sourcing strategy in the face of rising tariffs. At the end of March, on the occasion of the analyst conference following the first quarter results, the group’s chief financial officer, Adam Karlsson, already announced some relocation of sourcing to markets with “less tariff impact”. The company has also announced “price positioning”.

Puma, for its part, the second largest German group in the fashion and sports equipment sector, has also anticipated a tariff hit on its business. In the last results presentation, in fact, the company had already reduced to 10% its items exported to the United States directly from China, a figure it plans to reduce further. In their place, however, other hubs such as Vietnam and Cambodia, which also face a possible high tariff from the United States, have been gaining weight, which has led the company not to rule out a possible price increase.

The luxury sector has opted to raise prices rather than redistribute the chain

Luxury

This repositioning, which in practice translates into an increase in the final price of products, is the strategy that has dominated among luxury companies in particular. One of the first companies to react was Hermès, which in mid-April announced price increases for its products starting in May.

This increase, however, will be on the company’s sales in the United States, precisely to compensate for the extra cost of bringing the merchandise into the country. The decision of H&M or Nike to relocate their supply chain to other countries with less impact is even more complicated in the luxury sector, which often depends on the know-how of small textile hubs and artisans.

It was under this premise that Kering defended its 2025 strategy, whereby it ruled out moving part of the chain to the country North America. We are selling parts of our culture, of the Italian or French culture,“ explained the group’s CEO, François-Henri Pinault, “so we have no intention of responding to the measure”.

Different has been the strategy of LVMH, the other major competing luxury group with brands such as Dior in its portfolio. The conglomerate, in the hands of French businessman Bernard Arnaud, explained in mid-April its plans to move part of its production to the United States, where it already operates up to three plants. This strategy is not new within the group, which during Trump’s first term consolidated part of these factories in the country, specifically, a factory in Texas, which involved an investment of $50 million.",https://www.modaes.com/global/thumb/eyJ0IjoiZCIsInciOjEyMDAsImgiOjY3NSwibSI6MSwidiI6ImRldjE3NTE5ODAxNTMifQ/files/2025/redaccion-personas/donald-trump/trump-bandera-julio25-1200.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 09:09:15.750944

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday adjusted an earlier tariff hike announced in April, lowering it slightly from 37 percent to 35 percent on Bangladeshi textile and garment imports. While still steep, it marks a slight reprieve from what industry leaders describe as a looming crisis.

“We are hopeful of a reduction,” said Commerce Secretary Mahbubur Rahman, confirming that the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has sent a new draft for review. “Our national security adviser and commerce adviser are working on the issue in Washington,” he added.

Garment sector on edge

Bangladesh exported $8.36 billion worth of goods to the US in 2024—primarily clothing—while importing just $2.21 billion. President Trump has repeatedly cited this trade imbalance as justification for imposing tariffs that are more than double the existing 16 percent levied on cotton products.

The proposed tariffs have rattled an industry still recovering from last year’s student-led revolution that toppled the previous government. Interim Prime Minister Muhammad Yunus is expected to raise the matter directly with US officials.

“This is a big challenge for the garment sector,” said Mahmud Hasan Khan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA). “We had expected something closer to 10-20 percent.”

Economic fallout looms

Leading US brands such as Fruit of the Loom, Levi Strauss, and VF Corp (which owns Vans, Timberland, and The North Face) rely heavily on Bangladeshi suppliers. Industry stakeholders worry the tariff increase could make Bangladesh less competitive globally and trigger job losses.

Former BGMEA director Mohiuddin Rubel warned that the impact could be severe. “The new tariffs raise worries about job losses in Bangladesh as the US is its main export market,” he said. “Bangladesh needs to act quickly by engaging US importers to push for policy changes, resuming high-level trade talks, and highlighting the importance of its products.”

In a bid to ease trade tensions, Dhaka has proposed to purchase Boeing aircraft and increase imports of US wheat, cotton, and oil.

As the August 1 deadline set by the Trump administration nears, all eyes in Bangladesh’s export-driven economy remain fixed on Washington—hoping that diplomacy and trade ties can prevent a major blow to one of the world’s largest garment-producing nations.",https://d2udx5iz3h7s4h.cloudfront.net/uploads/image/1751971708688-1zrlf9-1c5eb77f02926ea8dcd19e260b1e77dc19c1b4d0c5a3e8084a56cb88cc487ad0.jpeg?width=512&format=jpg&quality=80,N,,2025-07-08 12:23:11.011628

Final Call: A Portfolio Must-Have The liquid handling systems market isn't just growing—it's evolving into a $7 billion+ tech ecosystem where precision and automation are non-negotiable.","The global liquid handling systems market is on the brink of an explosive growth phase, driven by the twin engines of automation and genomics. Valued at $4.34 billion in 2024, the sector is projected to surge to $6.75 billion by 2030, riding a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.64%. This isn't merely an expansion of lab equipment—it's a revolution in precision, efficiency, and innovation. For investors, this is a once-in-a-decade opportunity to stake a claim in a market where drug discovery, personalized medicine, and high-throughput screening are rewriting the rules of science.

The Automation-Genomics Synergy: A $7B Gold Rush

The heart of this boom lies in two unstoppable trends:

1. Automation's Rise: While automated liquid handling systems dominate labs, the manual method segment is growing at a blistering 8.75% CAGR, driven by smaller labs and emerging markets seeking cost-effective solutions. Companies like Agilent and Eppendorf are now offering hybrid systems that bridge the gap—think semi-automated pipettes or cloud-enabled manual dispensers.

2. Genomics' Explosion: Next-Gen Sequencing (NGS) and gene-editing tools like CRISPR demand ultra-precise liquid handling for sample prep. The genomics sector alone accounts for $1.2 billion in annual demand, with North America's pharma/biotech giants (e.g., Pfizer, Moderna) fueling this fire.

Why North America is the Engine, and Asia-Pacific is the Accelerator

North America: Already commands ~30-40% of the global market, thanks to $126 billion+ in annual biotech/pharma R&D spending and initiatives like the NIH's Precision Medicine Program. Labs here are early adopters of cutting-edge tools like Agilent's BioTek MultiFlo FX or Eppendorf's epMotion 5077p.

Asia-Pacific: Set to grow at the fastest regional CAGR (9.82%), driven by India's Genome India Project, China's $200 billion “Healthy China 2030” plan, and Japan's $1.2 trillion investment in life sciences. This is where Agilent's and Eppendorf's partnerships with local labs will pay dividends.

Agilent vs. Eppendorf: Who's Leading the Charge?

Both companies are category kings, but their strategies differ in critical ways:

Agilent Technologies (A): The Automation Titan

Strengths:

Owns BioTek Instruments, a leader in microplate dispensers used in NGS workflows.

Launched the 406 FX Washer Dispenser (2023), a game-changer for labs needing high-throughput plate washing.

Leverages AI-driven software like OpenLab Enterprise for lab automation workflows.

Growth Levers:

Drug Discovery Dominance: Captures 60% of the market in systems for ADME/Tox studies.

Global Footprint: 45% of revenue comes from Asia-Pacific, where it's expanding partnerships with contract research organizations (CROs).

Eppendorf AG (EPP.DE): The Precision Specialist

Strengths:

epMotion Series: Automated liquid handlers with error rates below 0.1%, critical for genomics.

Semi-Automated Innovations: Products like the Lambda EliteMax make automation accessible to smaller labs, addressing the $100k+ price barrier of full systems.

Growth Levers:

Emerging Markets Play: Secured exclusive distribution rights in India and Southeast Asia via partnerships like SLS.

Cost Efficiency: Offers modular systems that scale with lab budgets, ideal for Asia-Pacific's growing biotech hubs.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Leaders—Now

The data is clear: Agilent and Eppendorf are the only pure-play liquid handling giants with R&D pipelines, global scale, and genomics expertise to capture this boom. Here's why investors should act:

Valuation Edge:

Agilent trades at 14.5x forward earnings, below its 5-year average of 18x, despite a 25% CAGR in biotech sales.

Eppendorf's stock has underperformed in 2023 (down 12%) due to macroeconomic jitters, creating a buying opportunity ahead of its Asia-Pacific ramp-up.

Moats and Momentum:

Agilent's $200M/year in R&D ensures it stays ahead in AI-integrated systems.

Eppendorf's 500+ patents (including dispensing tech) shield it from generic competitors.

Risk-Adjusted Upside:

Even if growth slows to 6% CAGR, Agilent's biotech division alone could deliver $2B in revenue by 2030.

Eppendorf's niche focus on cost-effective automation gives it a 15% market share target in Asia-Pacific by 2026.

Final Call: A Portfolio Must-Have

The liquid handling systems market isn't just growing—it's evolving into a $7 billion+ tech ecosystem where precision and automation are non-negotiable. Agilent and Eppendorf are the only two names with the scale, innovation, and geographic reach to dominate this space.

Action Items for Investors:

- Aggressive Buy: Agilent (A) at current valuations.

- Accumulate: Eppendorf (EPP.DE) ahead of its Q3 2025 Asia-Pacific sales report.

- Avoid: Smaller players without genomics-specific pipelines (e.g., Tecan) or those overexposed to manual systems alone.

The next five years will separate the lab equipment suppliers from the genomics-era winners. Don't miss the boat.

The acquisition creates a €23.3 billion entity targeting what both companies call “intelligent operations”: business processes managed by AI systems that can make decisions and adapt without human oversight.

The death of traditional outsourcing

“Enterprises are rapidly adopting Generative AI and Agentic AI to transform their operations end-to-end,” says Aiman Ezzat, CEO of Capgemini. “Business Process Services will be the showcase for Agentic AI. Capgemini’s acquisition of WNS will provide the Group with the scale and vertical sector expertise to capture that rapidly-emerging strategic opportunity created by the paradigm shift from traditional BPS to Agentic AI-powered Intelligent Operations.”

The deal reflects a shift in how companies approach business process outsourcing. Traditional labour-intensive services are being replaced by AI-driven automation that promises not just cost savings but transformational business outcomes. Companies that once sought cheap offshore labour now demand intelligent systems that can adapt, learn and operate with minimal human oversight.

WNS, which generated US$1.266 billion in revenue last year serving clients including United Airlines, Aviva, M&T Bank, Centrica and McCain Foods, has positioned itself at the forefront of this transformation, maintaining constant currency revenue growth of 9% annually over three years and projecting growth of 7% to 11% for fiscal year 2026.

“As a recognised leader in the Digital Business Process Services space, we see the next wave of transformation being driven by intelligent, domain-centric operations that unlock strategic value for our clients,” says Keshav Murugesh, CEO of WNS. “Organisations that have already digitised are now seeking to reimagine their operating models by embedding AI at the core – shifting from automation to autonomy.”

Capgemini’s AI ambitions

The acquisition addresses Capgemini’s need for scale in the US market while providing access to WNS's industry-specific platforms and domain expertise. Aiman has invested heavily in AI capabilities, establishing 25 strategic partnerships with technology providers including Microsoft, Google, AWS, Mistral AI and Nvidia. The company says it reported over €900 million in generative AI bookings during 2024.

Market analysts including Forrester, IDC and ISG have recognised Capgemini’s position in the AI services market. Aiman has developed training programmes and AI-focused service offerings to meet enterprise demand for AI-powered business transformation.

Capgemini expects the transaction to generate revenue synergies of €100 million to €140 million by the end of 2027, alongside cost synergies of €50 million to €70 million annually. Aiman anticipates 4% accretion to normalised earnings per share before synergies in 2026, rising to 7% post-synergies in 2027.

Enabling next-generation, data-driven operations

The transaction requires approval from the Royal Court of Jersey and WNS shareholders, alongside regulatory clearances. Both companies’ boards have unanimously approved the acquisition, with closing expected by the end of 2025.

“By combining our deep domain and process expertise with Capgemini’s global reach, cutting-edge Gen AI and Agentic AI capabilities, a robust partner ecosystem and advanced technology platforms, we are creating a powerful proposition that accelerates enterprise reinvention,” says Keshav. “WNS’ complementary portfolio of horizontal and industry-specific solutions will significantly enhance Capgemini’s rapidly-growing Business Services footprint, enabling next-generation, data-driven operations across sectors.”

The companies expect immediate cross-selling opportunities through the integration of complementary client bases and service offerings, supported by what they describe as natural cultural alignment and shared values.

“Just as importantly, our shared values, cultural alignment and complementary client relationships ensure a seamless integration – unlocking exciting opportunities for innovation, co-creation and growth across all stakeholder groups,” says Keshav.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/0666516a6ed09917e8760a14652a3e8c:05a15ea78f107ef709c56890dfad46d7/handshake-blue-line.webp.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 12:21:24.924896

Here's what to expect: Amazon expanded Prime Day this year because shoppers “wanted more time to shop and save,” Amazon Prime Vice President Jamil Ghani recently told The Associated Press.
Amazon doesn’t disclose Prime Day sales figures but said last year that the event achieved record global sales.
For the big event, Amazon said it would have special discounts on Alexa-enabled products like Echo, Fire TV and Fire tablets.
Some third-party sellers are expected to sit out Prime Day and not offer discounts to preserve their profit margins during the ongoing tariff uncertainty, analysts said.","NEW YORK -- Amazon is extending its annual Prime Day sales and offering new membership perks to Generation Z shoppers amid tariff-related price worries and possibly some consumer boredom with an event marking its 11th year.

The e-commerce giant's promised blitz of summer deals for Prime members starts at 3:01 a.m. Eastern time on Tuesday. For the first time, Seattle-based Amazon is holding the now-misnamed Prime Day over four days; the company launched the event in 2015 and expanded it to two days in 2019.

Before wrapping up Prime Day 2025 early Friday, Amazon said it would have deals dropping as often as every 5 minutes during certain periods. Prime members ages 18-24, who pay $7.49 per month instead of the $14.99 that older customers not eligible for discounted rates pay for free shipping and other benefits, will receive 5% cash back on their purchases for a limited time.

Amazon executives declined to comment on the potential impact of tariffs on Prime Day deals. The event is taking place two and a half months after an online news report sparked speculation that Amazon planned to display added tariff costs next to product prices on its website.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt denounced the purported change as a “hostile and political act” before Amazon clarified the idea had been floated for its low-cost Haul storefront but never approved.

Amazon's past success with using Prime Day to drive sales and attract new members spurred other major retail chains to schedule competing sales in July. Best Buy, Target and Walmart are repeating the practice this year.

Like Amazon, Walmart is adding two more days to its promotional period, which starts Tuesday and runs through July 13. The nation's largest retailer is making its summer deals available in stores as well as online for the first time.

Here's what to expect:

Amazon expanded Prime Day this year because shoppers “wanted more time to shop and save,” Amazon Prime Vice President Jamil Ghani recently told The Associated Press.

Analysts are unsure the extra days will translate into more purchases given that renewed inflation worries and potential price increases from tariffs may make consumers less willing to spend. Amazon doesn’t disclose Prime Day sales figures but said last year that the event achieved record global sales.

Adobe Digital Insights predicts that the sales event will drive $23.8 billion in overall online spending from July 8 to July 11, 28.4% more than the similar period last year. In 2024 and 2023, online sales increased 11% and 6.1% during the comparable four days of July.

Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, noted that Amazon's move to stretch the sales event to four days is a big opportunity to “really amplify and accelerate the spending velocity.”

Caila Schwartz, director of consumer insights and strategy at software company Salesforce, noted that July sales in general have lost some momentum in recent years. Amazon is not a Salesforce customer, so the business software company is not privy to Prime Day figures.

“What we saw last year was that (shoppers) bought and then they were done, ” Schwartz said. “We know that the consumer is still really cautious. So it’s likely we could see a similar pattern where they come out early, they’re ready to buy and then they take a step back.”

Amazon executives reported in May that the company and many of its third-party sellers tried to beat big import tax bills by stocking up on foreign goods before President Donald Trump’s tariffs took effect. And because of that move, a fair number of third-party sellers hadn't changed their pricing at that time, Amazon said.

Adobe Digital Insights' Pandya expects discounts to remain on par with last year and for other U.S. retail companies to mark 10% to 24% off the manufacturers' suggested retail price between Tuesday and Friday.

Salesforce's Schwartz said she's noticed retailers becoming more precise with their discounts, such as offering promotion codes that apply to selected products instead of their entire websites.

Amazon Prime and other July sales have historically helped jump-start back-to-school spending and encouraged advance planners to buy other seasonal merchandise earlier. Analysts said they expected U.S. consumers to make purchases this week out of fear that tariffs will make items more expensive later.

Brett Rose, CEO of United National Consumer Supplies, a wholesale distributor of overstocked goods like toys and beauty products, thinks shoppers will go for items like beauty essentials.

“They're going to buy more everyday items,” he said.

As in past years, Amazon offered early deals leading up to Prime Day. For the big event, Amazon said it would have special discounts on Alexa-enabled products like Echo, Fire TV and Fire tablets.

Walmart said its July sale would include a 32-inch Samsung smart monitor priced at $199 instead of $299.99; and $50 off a 50-Inch Vizio Smart TV with a standard retail price of $298.00. Target said it was maintaining its 2024 prices on key back-to-school items, including a $5 backpack and a selection of 20 school supplies totaling less than $20.

Independent businesses that sell goods through Amazon account for more than 60% of the company's retail sales. Some third-party sellers are expected to sit out Prime Day and not offer discounts to preserve their profit margins during the ongoing tariff uncertainty, analysts said.

Rose, of United National Consumer Supplies, said he spoke with third-party sellers who said they would rather take a sales hit this week than use up a lot of their pre-tariffs inventory now and risk seeing their profit margins suffer later.

However, some independent businesses that market their products on Amazon are looking to Prime Day to make a dent in the inventory they built up earlier in the year to avoid tariffs.

Home fragrance company Outdoor Fellow, which makes about 30% of its sales through Amazon's marketplace, gets most of its candle lids, labels, jars, reed diffusers and other items from China, founder Patrick Jones said. Fearing high costs from tariffs, Jones stocked up at the beginning of the year, roughly doubling his inventory.

For Prime Day, he plans to offer bigger discounts, such as 32% off the price of a candle normally priced at $34, Jones said.

“All the product that we have on Amazon right now is still from the inventory that we got before the tariffs went into effect,” he said. “So we’re still able to offer the discount that we’re planning on doing.”

Jones said he was waiting to find out if the order he placed in June will incur large customs duties when the goods arrive from China in a few weeks.

Havas has not struck a direct enterprise deal either, due to existing access to GPT models through Azure and its preference to stay within its current Microsoft-based infrastructure, including tools like Teams.
“Training programs tend to be the second thing they think about.” Dallas-based independent agency LERMA, however, is about to sign a direct ChatGPT Enterprise deal with OpenAI to support client-facing work and internal tooling.
These include ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Team, and ChatGPT Edu.
In a recent investor note, Morgan Stanley raised its Azure revenue forecast, citing OpenAI as a key growth driver.","OpenAI is everywhere, but that might be a problem for the AI startup’s revenue expansion plans.

As it seeks to diversify its income, OpenAI has been courting ad agencies over the last two months, sometimes requesting sizable upfront commitments in exchange for deeper partnerships, as well as inking direct corporate enterprise deals.

But, agencies’ existing relationships with Microsoft, which has an exclusive deal with OpenAI, could undermine the AI startup’s ability to cut those deals.

“The convergence of OpenAI’s advanced generative AI capabilities with Microsoft’s expansive and integrated Azure ecosystem poses potential challenges for OpenAI in attracting direct enterprise deals with specific segments, including ad agencies,” Gartner vp analyst Nicole Greene told ADWEEK.

In at least one recent negotiation, OpenAI sought a $1 million upfront commitment in exchange for annual joint projects and expanded tool licenses, according to a holding company executive who requested anonymity to protect industry ties.

“OpenAI is trying to find the right commercial model,” the executive said. “[But asking for $1 million upfront], that’s not how you build relationships.”

The price tag prevented the agency from formalizing any direct partnership, especially since their existing agreement with Microsoft already provides access to the same models with fewer legal hurdles. Ultimately, the agency rejected the deal because it felt out of step with how other tech platforms, such as Google and Meta, can bundle in free media to longer-term deals, thereby offsetting the costs of AI tools.

OpenAI did not respond to a media request.

Havas has not struck a direct enterprise deal either, due to existing access to GPT models through Azure and its preference to stay within its current Microsoft-based infrastructure, including tools like Teams.

To scale AI use internally, the agency is talking with training companies like Section AI to teach employees model-specific best practices and prompt engineering across multiple AI models.

“With big [AI] providers, their number one goal is the sale of licenses,” Dan Hagen, global chief data and technology officer, Havas, told ADWEEK. “Training programs tend to be the second thing they think about.”

Dallas-based independent agency LERMA, however, is about to sign a direct ChatGPT Enterprise deal with OpenAI to support client-facing work and internal tooling. In return, the independent shop gets access to OpenAI’s tools, including Sora and Dall-E, data security, and the ability to build and white-label bots for client use. The financial details of the deal were not disclosed, but it is structured as an annual agreement, paid monthly. LERMA is also evaluating Azure, weighing features and costs before finalizing its decision.

Laurie Evans, media technology principal at LERMA, notes that other AI providers, including Microsoft’s Copilot, are offering similar enterprise-level packages.

“As an independent agency, we don’t have the resources of big holding companies that can throw a lot of money at innovation,” said Pedro Lerma, founder and CEO, LERMA. “We’re building bots for our workflow on a daily basis—that’s what’s standing out to me about OpenAI,” she added.

OpenAI’s changing revenue structure

To keep revenue growing—and amid its push for profitability under an unorthodox corporate structure—OpenAI began promoting its enterprise offerings in August 2023. These include ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Team, and ChatGPT Edu.

As of June, OpenAI said it was signing about nine enterprise contracts per week and had reached 3 million business users across those tiers. OpenAI is reportedly charging at least $10 million, offering AI customization and consulting services.

OpenAI has doubled its annual recurring revenue, from roughly $5.5 billion last year to $10 billion in June. Yet the San Francisco‑based firm still lost nearly $5 billion in 2024, underscoring the high infrastructure and operational costs of powering generative AI. For now, its revenues come largely from premium ChatGPT subscriptions, like ChatGPT Pro, priced at $200 a month, and API usage (ads may be coming to ChatGPT).

Even so, chief executive Sam Altman recently posted on X that OpenAI is “losing money” on ChatGPT Pro subscriptions, adding that he personally set the price assuming “we would make some money.”

Now, OpenAI is turning its attention to ad agencies, striking enterprise deals and deeper partnerships.

Agencies’ relationship with Microsoft

Through Microsoft’s deal with OpenAI, which integrates OpenAI’s IP, including models and infrastructure, into products like Copilot (Microsoft’s AI assistant) and Azure (its cloud computing platform), certain agencies can already access OpenAI’s tools without signing up and paying for a direct enterprise deal. That access lets them use OpenAI for image and video generation or call the API to build agents, according to sources, all within Microsoft’s ecosystem.

Without a direct relationship with OpenAI, agencies do miss out on enterprise-level perks, like 24/7 support, live training, custom bot deployments, or immediate access to OpenAI’s latest tools, which reportedly takes weeks before showing up in Microsoft software.

Gartner estimates ChatGPT Enterprise costs between $40 and $60 per user per month, higher than Microsoft 365 Copilot, which is typically priced at $30 and often bundled with other Microsoft products. These estimates are based on Gartner’s Digital Workplace Maturity Assessment Tool, which surveyed IT leaders on their digital transformation priorities. OpenAI did not respond to comments on competitive pricing.

“The pricing structures, security assurances, and integrations provided by Microsoft, such as Azure AI Studio and Microsoft 365 Copilot, align with enterprise operational requirements and risk management protocols,” Greene said. “[These are] compelling reasons for ad agencies to work with Microsoft instead of making a direct enterprise deal with OpenAI.”

Meanwhile, OpenAI announced last month that it would shift its ChatGPT Enterprise plan from a pricing-based model to a credit-based system where companies can purchase usage credits based on demand rather than paying fixed per-seat pricing.

Microsoft, for its part, is seeing clear returns from its integration with OpenAI. In a recent investor note, Morgan Stanley raised its Azure revenue forecast, citing OpenAI as a key growth driver. Analysts now expect Azure to grow at a 33% compound annual rate through 2028, up from an earlier 27% estimate.

“Contribution from OpenAI is significant and understated in our original framework,” the note read, pointing to Microsoft’s 20% revenue share from OpenAI, along with additional income from fine-tuning and post-training services.",https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/openai-microsoft-ambitions-2025.jpg?w=600&h=315&crop=1,N,,2025-07-08 09:08:14.275151

Spicy twist on a breakfast classic

Starting on Tuesday, July 8, the fast food chain will roll out three spicy Egg McMuffin options: Egg McMuffin with Spicy Pepper Sauce, Spicy Sausage McMuffin, and Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg.

The Egg McMuffin was first introduced in 1972 and by 1975 had become a breakfast staple for those choosing to eat out first thing in the morning. 50 years later, it’s still going strong.

Why spice up the anniversary with McDonald’s new Spicy Pepper Sauce, the key ingredient to the three new options? McDonald’s says it’s responding to demand, with surveys showing that 78% of Gen Z loves spicy flavors and 74% of Americans add hot sauce to meals.

The return of the Snack Wrap

Additionally, the company has also brought back its Snack Wrap, which was a customer favorite up until 2016, when it was dropped from the menu because of equipment and preparation constraints.

The Snack Wrap comes in two flavors: Ranch and Spicy, both of which use McCrispy chicken strips, lettuce and shredded cheese wrapped in a soft tortilla.

How long will they be available?

McDonald’s has stated the new Egg McMuffins will be on the menu for a limited time, so act fast if you’d like to give it a try.

Unlike the Egg McMuffin, the Snack Wrap will stay on the menu for as long as it’s selling well and customer interest is there. Judging by its first run, it’s unlikely to be going anywhere anytime soon.

ID3,Albertsons,2025-07-08 10:03:31+00:00,Modern Retail,What Albertsons is looking to learn from its test run of in-store digital displays in two markets,Mitchell Parton,,,,,https://www.modernretail.co/marketing/what-albertsons-is-looking-to-learn-from-its-test-run-of-in-store-digital-displays-in-two-markets/,"Albertsons is among a growing number of retailers experimenting with in-store signage as an element of their growing advertising businesses.
“This is all-new, bleeding-edge, I would say, hot-off-the-press types of technology,” Roche said.
At the end of last year, Iowa-based regional grocer Hy-Vee added 10,000-plus in-store screens across more than 400 locations.
“2025 is the tipping-point year of in-store RMN pilots,” said Sean Cheyney, head of retail media at Vistar Media, an out-of-home advertising firm.
He expects to see more widespread adoption of in-store digital signage within the next year and a half.","Albertsons is among a growing number of retailers experimenting with in-store signage as an element of their growing advertising businesses. And, given Albertsons reach — more than 2,200 stores in 35 states — it’s an important validation point. Still, like many other retailers doing pilot programs this year, Albertsons has yet to determine how quickly to scale up the program and how it will measure the efficacy of the technology in generating revenue and profits moving forward.

“We’re taking this pilot as an amazing opportunity to learn. When it comes to in-store, digital screen networks, there really isn’t a playbook,” Roche said, referring to the fact that while there are many case studies about other formats like search ads, there hasn’t yet been a widespread rollout of digital screens at U.S. retailers. “It’s not like we can say, ‘OK, let’s just rip the page out of the textbook. We’ll rinse and repeat and we’ll apply it.’ … We’re really taking this pilot as an incredible opportunity to learn, to tweak, to optimize and to continue rapid expansion.”

Not just ads, but also informational content

The company is adding television screens to key areas of each store such as the entrance, the produce department, the meat department and the center of the store. The screens will display both advertiser content and informational content. For example, in the produce department, a customer could spot a 15-second video on what to do with radishes. Roche said a playlist of ads alone wouldn’t be an ideal shopping experience, so the company is looking at how to optimize content to both enhance the shopper experience and drive growth for suppliers.

“We have a tremendous amount of people who are coming to a store every week. Bringing them excellent content and maybe helping them think outside the box and giving them that inspiration really enables a full-funnel experience for both our advertisers and for our shoppers,” Roche said. “[Brand marketers] are excited to have some space to play to build that affinity. … Learning how to make a seven-layer dip and what chips to use for such a substantial dip is a really great brand moment where brand marketers can build affinity.”

The first brand partners include snack and beverage company Mondelēz, as well as non-endemic brands such as PayPal.

“I think the level of attention you have from a shopper when they’re in store is high. People are alert. They’re looking at the shelves. They’re making real-time decisions,” Roche said. “In such an attention economy that we’re working in, our non-endemic brands are really leaned into trying to add to that journey, whether that’s in the [fintech] space or elsewhere.”

Roche said the genesis of the program was the retailer’s large amount of store traffic, having 36 million people in its stores every week and 45 million loyalty members.

“That traffic is really valuable,” Roche said. “Our shoppers love being in the store, so by enhancing their in-store experience and enhancing their shopper experience, but also helping to get our supplier partners ingrained in that shopping experience and giving brand marketers opportunities to really tell big stories in store, it’s really an incredible canvas.”

The quest for measurement

Ultimately, Roche said the goal of the test is to figure out how to close the loop through measurement technology.

“By introducing more technology, we can start to understand things like, ‘Is this individual ad working?'” Roche said. “We’re able to get a lot more granular and move more into causation and move away from correlated results. That’s what we’re aiming to do, and frankly, that’s what our suppliers want … They want attributed impressions. They want to understand exactly how every impression is driving their business forward, and we want to be able to deliver that.”

Roche said that could include sensor technology to understand exact efficacy of each screen, dwell time and served impressions while maintaining privacy, though the company declined to share exactly how it would accomplish that.

“This is all-new, bleeding-edge, I would say, hot-off-the-press types of technology,” Roche said. “It takes some calibration. It takes partners who want to say, ‘Hey, I’m willing to learn with you all,’ which makes us really lucky in this space, because we have those partners.”

The year of digital signage pilots

Several other major grocers have recently launched digital signage pilot programs in the same vein. Kroger announced in June that Barrows Connected Stores was building a new platform for the retailer to deliver animated content in its stores, integrated onto shelves, endcaps or other locations throughout each store. At the end of last year, Iowa-based regional grocer Hy-Vee added 10,000-plus in-store screens across more than 400 locations.

“2025 is the tipping-point year of in-store RMN pilots,” said Sean Cheyney, head of retail media at Vistar Media, an out-of-home advertising firm. “Everybody’s realizing that this is something they need to do. … The retail media teams are really driving this, because they’re running out of inventory on their owned-and-operated [online] assets.”

Like Albertsons, retailers are generally looking at the best play to manage and expand the screens, how many to put in and how it fits into the broader store strategy, he said. Measurability is a big component to these tests: Most commonly, screens have had little to no way of measuring success of ads. Now, he said, grocers are using platforms like Circana, Inmar or LiveRamp that they’ve been using elsewhere in the store for measurement to determine the ROAS of what’s happening on the screen. Like what Albertsons is experimenting with, sensors can also be used to measure impressions.

He expects to see more widespread adoption of in-store digital signage within the next year and a half.

“It always drives me nuts when [retailers] look at it in a silo, which is the way [in-store] has been for a long time,” he said. “Now they’re looking at it and saying, ‘How can this fold into the greater retail media ecosystem?’”

Still awaiting ‘the killer campaign’

Sean Turner, CTO of retail media tech platform Swiftly — which has worked on retail media platforms for California-based grocery chain Save Mart, as well as Oklahoma-based chain Homeland — also admitted the technology is still in early days.

“I don’t think, as of yet, we’ve really seen the ‘killer campaign,’ or the killer setup where all of the necessary elements come together and just blow away what we’ve been doing in the paper world,” Turner said.

That campaign, Turner said, would ideally start long before a shopper gets to the store, making sure they know about the brand through platforms such as web ads, connected TV or linear TV, as well as on-platform retail media like video in retailer apps. The video could link to recipe ideas that use the product or nutritional information, as well as a coupon. That would get a customer in the store, where they would see in-store videos with quick clips that remind customers of what the product is and how to use it. That would draw attention to the product in the store, where the customer would find something like a QR code driving them back to that offer they saw earlier online.

“The shopper is going to make up their mind as to whether or not they’re going to buy the product, or at least get most of the way there, before they get in the stores,” Turner said. “You have to do that work before they get in.”

He said once retailers and CPG brands figure out how to best use the medium, he expects more rapid adoption, going from the pilots of a few stores or a few markets to every store within a grocery banner. Still, he said such programs can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per store, so it could be a few years before the technology is affordable enough for grocers to make the plunge, as well.",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/07/0.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 09:07:54.602805

This move is in response to the European Commission’s decision in June 2025 to exclude Chinese companies from EU government purchases of medical devices exceeding 5 million EUR.
For non-EU enterprises participating in government procurement projects, the proportion of medical devices imported from the EU that they provide should not exceed 50% of the procurement’s total contract amount.

China’s Ministry of Finance has announced that it will take ‘relevant measures’ against medical devices imported from the European Union (EU) through government procurement projects. This move is in response to the European Commission’s decision in June 2025 to exclude Chinese companies from EU government purchases of medical devices exceeding 5 million EUR.

With the new restrictions imposed in China, when a purchaser buys medical devices with a budget of over 45 million CNY (about 5.34 million EUR at the time of writing) if it is indeed necessary to purchase imported products — after going through relevant legal procedures — the participation of EU enterprises (excluding EU-funded enterprises in China) should be excluded, the ministry said.

For non-EU enterprises participating in government procurement projects, the proportion of medical devices imported from the EU that they provide should not exceed 50% of the procurement’s total contract amount.

The above measures do not apply to procurement projects that can only be met by medical devices imported from the EU, according to the ministry.

This notice came into effect on July 6, 2025. For procurement projects that have already announced winning bids or transaction results before July 6, the above measures don’t apply and government procurement contracts may continue to be signed.

With regards to the EU ban announced in June, a spokesperson from the ministry claimed that China had repeatedly expressed through bilateral dialogue its willingness to resolve differences with the EU via such dialogue, and through consultation and bilateral government procurement arrangements.

The spokesperson for the ministry said that despite China’s ‘goodwill and sincerity,’ the EU has insisted on taking ‘restrictive measures’ to build new ‘protectionist barriers.’

“Therefore, China has no choice but to take reciprocal restrictive measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises and maintain a fair competition environment,” said the spokesperson.

The ministry emphasised that China’s measures only apply to medical device products imported from the EU, and those produced by EU-funded enterprises in China are unaffected.",https://med-techinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/china-and-eu-8th-july-1024x536.png,N,,2025-07-08 10:07:36.864368

Impact and consequences for Burger King This strategic move comes at a complicated time for Burger King in the United States.
While McDonald’s expands their offerings and updates their menu, Burger King hasn't replied with similar innovations in their morning menu.
Meanwhile, Burger King will have to rethink their strategy in order not to fall behind in the breakfast battle in the United States.","In the competitive world of fast food, chains are constantly seeking to innovate in order to attract customers. It's not common for McDonald’s to make major changes to their breakfast menu, since their classic products are usually well received. However, this time the situation has changed and the company has decided to take a step that could mark a turning point.

McDonald’s has just launched three new versions of their iconic McMuffin, adding a spicy touch that hasn't been seen before in their morning offerings. This new development comes at a time when the competition, especially Burger King, is facing a tough blow in the United States.

McDonald’s spicy bet revolutionizes breakfast in the United States

McDonald’s has added three new varieties to their breakfast menu, which until now had remained quite stable. The new Spicy McMuffins include the Spicy Egg McMuffin, the Spicy Sausage McMuffin, and the Spicy Sausage McMuffin with egg. The key is the special spicy sauce that's added to these sandwiches, an exclusive blend that delivers an intense flavor and an extra spicy kick.

This spicy sauce is already used in other menu items, such as the Spicy McCrispy and, soon, in the Spicy Snack Wrap that's returning on July 10, according to All Recipes. With this addition, McDonald’s expands their range of products with a bold flavor, designed to attract spice lovers and those seeking new breakfast experiences.

Previously, McDonald’s had experimented with jalapeños in their breakfasts, but they'd never included their own spicy sauce in a product as classic as the McMuffin. This innovation not only refreshes the menu, but also attracts a younger and more dynamic audience.

Impact and consequences for Burger King

This strategic move comes at a complicated time for Burger King in the United States. While McDonald’s expands their offerings and updates their menu, Burger King hasn't replied with similar innovations in their morning menu. The introduction of these Spicy McMuffins has caused a considerable increase in consumer interest toward McDonald’s, leaving their rival with fewer options to compete.

In addition, the launch campaign has been supported by the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the McMuffin. This has given a special context to this update. This combination of tradition and innovation strengthens McDonald’s's position in a market where breakfast is one of the most important time slots.

Although the new sandwiches will be available only for a limited time, the expectation and demand have been very high. Customers are taking advantage of the opportunity before these products disappear from the menu, which is causing long lines in many locations.

McDonald’s has managed to leverage their legacy and add a bold twist that allows them to keep their leadership strong.

Why it matters: Low- and middle-income consumers have been increasingly shying away from fast-food restaurants like McDonald's, a sign that people are watching their budgets amid recession fears.

U.S. comparable sales fell 3.6% at McDonald's during its first quarter, the chain said in May, which was company's worst showing since the pandemic.

The big picture: Reviving fan-favorite items or adding limited-time offerings can help restaurants drive sales and bring consumers back.

Starbucks announced Monday that its new Strato Frappuccino blended beverages debut nationwide Tuesday.

Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches out Tuesday

The intrigue: McDonald's Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches debut Tuesday at participating restaurants nationwide.

There are three varieties with the chain's Spicy Pepper Sauce — Spicy Sausage, Spicy Egg Cheese and the Spicy Sausage Egg Cheese McMuffin.

The new breakfast addition comes after McDonald's and Krispy Kreme ended their doughnut partnership effective July 2.

When does the McDonald's Snack Wrap come back

Zoom in: McDonald's Snack Wrap will come back starting Thursday, July 10 as a permanent menu item. It uses the new McCrispy Strips that rolled out to restaurants in early May.

McDonald's CEO Christopher Kempczinski has said the launch of new chicken strips and the return of snack wraps should help the company's sales improve.

The Snack Wrap will be available in two flavors — spicy and ranch.

Popeyes and other restaurants have also launched their own chicken wraps, which appears to be the next battle in the Chicken Sandwich Wars.

How much does Snack Wrap cost

By the numbers: McDonald's said the Snack Wrap is priced at $2.99 and is available to order from 10:30 a.m. through late night at participating restaurants.

The wraps can be ordered on the app, restaurant and drive-thru.

The original McDonald's Snack Wrap debuted in 2006 and was discontinued in 2016.

Daily Double joining McDonald's McValue menu

What's next: Starting July 22, the Daily Double will be a new entree option in McDonald's McValue Meal Deal bundle.

It will be priced at $6 or $7 depending on location, the company said.

McDonald's rolled out its McValue menu in January after it introduced the $5 meal deal last summer, which has been extended multiple times.

Zoom out: The Daily Double is a more premium burger than the basic McDouble double cheeseburger, which is also on the McValue menu.

The Daily Double has two patties, cheese, shredded lettuce, tomato, slivered onions and mayo.

The McDouble and McChicken will continue to be on the McValue menu, McDonald's said on its new menu item spotter website.

Hazy IPA has added £1.4m by filling a gap in an alcohol-free beer segment currently dominated by lager.","Low & no-alcohol remains a growing opportunity that major drinks companies can ill afford to ignore.

That much is clear from the latest supermarket data, which shows low & no beer growing 22% year on year, while the total beer category remains near-flat [Circana 12 we 14 June 2025]. Some 76% of UK adults are actively moderating their alcohol consumption and low & no products are one of the main ways they are choosing to do it.

This trend – which has been in motion for at least a decade – prompted an early flurry of M&A from major spirits companies keen to protect themselves against declining booze consumption. Diageo was an early advocate, backing Seedlip and Everleaf through its Distill Ventures incubator. Meanwhile, Pernod Ricard worked with the founders of Ceder’s to bring the non-alcoholic gin alternative to market in 2018, before taking a majority stake in the business in 2021.

Fast-forward to 2025, however, and the landscape looks very different. Multinational drinks companies have developed and launched 0.0% abv versions of their best-selling brands, backing them with major focus and investment. Meanwhile, brands like Seedlip, Ceder’s and Everleaf have seen off-trade sales slump as the major mults delist them in favour of more recognisable alcohol-free versions of household names.

So, why are standalone low & no brands no longer seen as a growth opportunity for drinks majors, and what does that mean for the future of challenger brands in the segment?

How drinks brands hedged their bets

When the low & no category was in its infancy, multinationals understandably wanted to ‘test the water’ with low-risk investments while waiting to see how sustained the moderation trend was likely to be.

By backing early-stage startups, Diageo and Pernod were able to hedge their bets by ensuring they had a stake in the nascent but growing low & no segment, while also protecting their reputation if the products didn’t meet consumers’ expectations. Seedlip was marketed as a non-alcoholic alternative to gin, but nobody bought it expecting it to taste like a Gordon’s or a Tanqueray.

Then – once they were confident they had the formula right – Diageo launched Gordon’s 0.0% in 2020, followed by Tanqueray 0.0% in 2021, and Captain Morgan Spiced Gold 0.0% in 2023. Pernod is now preparing to do the same with Beefeater 0.0%.

It was a similar story in beer – Budweiser Brewing Group initially dipped its toes with Budweiser Prohibition in 2017, while Asahi added Peroni Libera in 2018. Both were axed and replaced by Budweiser Zero and Peroni Nastro Azzurro 0.0% once alcohol-free brewing technology had sufficiently advanced, and low & no sales had shown little sign of slowing down.

What has happened to Seedlip?

These alcohol-free versions of well-known brands have been backed with large-scale marketing investment – Peroni 0.0%, for example, is the alcohol-free beer partner of the Scuderia Ferrari Formula 1 team, while Captain Morgan 0.0% and Gordon’s 0.0% have both appeared in TV advertising.

Predictably, therefore, they’ve come to dominate supermarkets’ low & no aisles and driven much of the growth of the category. Just 12 of the 75 low & no-alcohol products on sale in Sainsbury’s are made by dedicated alcohol-free drinks brands. Meanwhile, just one of the top 10 fastest-growing low & no products – Lucky Saint’s Hazy IPA – is from a brand that doesn’t also operate in booze [NIQ 52 we 17 May 2025].

By contrast, the dedicated low & no brands backed by major multinationals have been left on – or in some cases knocked off – the shelf. Seedlip was last seen in Sainsbury’s in May 2024, and Tesco in 2023 [Assosia]. It remains stocked by Waitrose and Ocado, but sales have declined by 37.6% to £758k in the last year [NIQ 52 we 19 April 2025].

Everleaf and Ceder’s – the latter of which appears destined for the Pernod Ricard scrapheap – have mustered less than £50k between them.

Why 0.0% variants are taking off

Diageo and Pernod Ricard remained tight-lipped when The Grocer asked about their plans for Seedlip and Ceder’s, but it makes sense they would want to shift focus towards 0.0% versions of their big-name brands.

While health and wellbeing are major drivers for moderation, consumers report not wanting to feel left out at social occasions as a reason for choosing alcohol-free beers and spirits over soft drinks. By offering consumers brands they know and trust, drinks companies like Diageo and Pernod can keep moderating drinkers in their portfolio.

As one senior drinks industry executive put it when quizzed last week: “It’s a much easier sell-in if they already know the brand and the product – you don’t need to explain it to them.”

Despite the dominance of 0.0% abv variants, there are still several challenger brands making headway in the alcohol-free segment. For example, Lucky Saint has added £2.3m and is now worth £8.9m [NIQ]. Meanwhile Botivo, which only made its grocery debut in January, had amassed £180k in sales by April.

In the case of Lucky Saint, success has been driven by the launch of new variants like Hazy IPA and Lemon Lager. Hazy IPA has added £1.4m by filling a gap in an alcohol-free beer segment currently dominated by lager. Similarly Botivo’s botanical non-alcoholic aperitif offers a point of difference in a low & no spirits category stacked with gin alternatives. Both brands have also made a point of emphasising the positive case for choosing alcohol-free in their marketing, rather than framing not drinking as a compromise.

If challengers are to survive in a competitive landscape increasingly dominated by major players, this looks like the blueprint for how to do it.",https://dmrqkbkq8el9i.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/7/9/7/363797_gordonszeropercent_78967_crop.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 07:04:49.918131

This strategic partnership positions Firestorm as the only provider of HP’s high-performance 3D printers designed for mobile and field-deployable environments, creating new possibilities for on-demand production in remote locations.

The collaboration represents a fundamental shift in how commercial, humanitarian, and medical sectors can respond to urgent needs in challenging environments. By combining HP’s established 3D printing expertise with Firestorm’s mobile manufacturing platform, organisations can now produce critical components precisely where and when they’re needed, without relying on traditional supply chains that may be disrupted or unavailable.

The xCell Expeditionary Manufacturing System

At the heart of this partnership is Firestorm’s xCell system, an expeditionary manufacturing platform housed within two expandable 20-foot containers that can be transported and deployed worldwide. The system is designed with versatility in mind, capable of operating on various power sources including standard generators, battery backup systems, or conventional power networks. This flexibility makes the xCell particularly valuable in remote settings such as forward operating bases, disaster zones, or areas with limited infrastructure.

The integration of HP’s Multi Jet Fusion technology into the xCell system significantly enhances its capabilities. MJF is a powder-based 3D printing technology that creates highly durable parts with consistent mechanical properties. Unlike traditional manufacturing that requires extensive tooling and setup time, MJF can produce complex components on demand. This technology enables the xCell to manufacture mission-critical parts and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in real-time at the point of need, dramatically reducing response times in critical situations.

Creating Resilient Global Production Networks

Firestorm’s approach aims to establish a distributed and resilient global production network that fundamentally changes how manufacturing responds to logistical challenges. By deploying xCell units strategically around the world, customers can access regional and localised supply chains that adapt quickly to shortages, reduce delivery times, and allow for rapid modifications to products that would otherwise have lengthy lead times.

The concept addresses a persistent problem in global logistics: the vulnerability of centralised manufacturing and extended supply chains. When political instability, natural disasters, or other disruptions affect traditional supply routes, expeditionary manufacturing provides an alternative production method. The system’s ability to operate in contested logistics environments—areas where traditional supply routes are compromised or unavailable—makes it particularly valuable for defence, disaster response, and humanitarian operations.

The partnership between HP and Firestorm extends beyond technology to include significant workforce development opportunities. As the demand for mobile manufacturing solutions grows, the collaboration will create new high-tech jobs across multiple fields, including system operations, maintenance, field deployment, and drone manufacturing.

Next week, McDonald's is launching three spicy breakfast menu items: the Spicy McMuffin, Spicy Sausage McMuffin and Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg. The McMuffins will feature their traditional ingredients – cheese, egg, Canadian bacon or sausage, and a buttered English muffin, topped with Spicy Pepper Sauce, a news release states.

McDonald's launched the Egg McMuffin in 1975. The breakfast item was the brainchild of Herb Peterson, a McDonald's franchisee in Santa Barbara, California. Herb, according to previous USA TODAY reporting, presented the sandwich as a to-go version of a diner classic: Eggs Benedict. Roy Kroc, the businessman who transformed McDonald's into what it is today, loved the idea.

The company’s services “will be the showcase for agentic AI,” Capgemini Chief Executive Officer Aiman Ezzat said in the firm’s statement on Monday.
WNS shares jumped 14% to $74.62 a share in New York trading, more than a dollar below the offer price.

The French group said it will take over the US-listed firm for $76.50 per share, a premium of about 28% to WNS’s average price over the past 90 days. Capgemini expects the deal to close by the end of the year, pending approvals, and to boost its earnings per share by about 4% on a normalized basis in 2026, it said in a statement on Monday.

Capgemini shares fell 5.6% in Paris on Monday. The acquisition reignited investor concerns that AI tools will reduce the need for IT and system-integration services and give rise to rivals that use the technology to deliver at much lower costs, Morgan Stanley said in a note on Monday. There are already signs that AI is bringing down the costs of consulting — and in some cases, the prices that consultants charge, too.

For its part, Capgemini said it plans to use the WNS acquisition to transition into an “agentic AI-powered intelligent” operation. The company’s services “will be the showcase for agentic AI,” Capgemini Chief Executive Officer Aiman Ezzat said in the firm’s statement on Monday.

The acquisition will also increase Capgemini’s exposure to the US market, and Ezzat said in an interview that it expands the company’s “expertise and technology.”

WNS’s products help businesses perform data analysis, manage shipping and routing, automate travel booking and predict how customers will behave. The company serves more than 600 clients and operates in 13 countries, according to its website. In April, it reported better-than-anticipated quarterly earnings, though revenue declined slightly.

Capgemini’s $3.3 billion bid for WNS Holdings looks like a strategic bet on enterprises leaning on low-cost implementers to design and run AI agents, yet business-process-service disruption means expected revenue and profit synergies might not materialize, said Tamlin Bason, industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Yet Capgemini could boost US exposure and end-to-end transformation project competitiveness.

WNS shares jumped 14% to $74.62 a share in New York trading, more than a dollar below the offer price. The shares have gained 57% this year.

Talks about a combination earlier this year were interrupted due to uncertainties around tariffs, Bloomberg had reported.

IT services firms from Capgemini to Accenture Plc are spending heavily on artificial intelligence, which companies around the world are racing to adopt. Capgemini said in the statement that the biggest opportunity for its customers to get value from AI is the “fundamental redesign of their operations and business practices.”

Johnson & Johnson MedTech, a global leader in cardiac arrhythmia treatment, has launched VARIPULSE™ Platform in Asia-Pacific to perform Cardiovascular Solutions.

The VARIPULSE™ Platform is Johnson & Johnson MedTech's Pulsed Field ablation system. The VARIPULSE™ Platform is the first Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) system fully integrated with the CARTO™ 3 electroanatomical mapping system, designed to drive efficiency, reproducibility, and procedural accuracy. The VARIPULSE™ Platform is approved in Japan, Hong Kong, China, Australia, Taiwan and Korea in Asia Pacific. With this Platform is now approved for use in the United States, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Canada.

Catheter ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation (AFib), an irregular and often rapid heartbeat caused by extra, uncoordinated electrical signals in the atria will be performed by using this platform. AFib is associated with structural changes in the heart due to underlying conditions and lifestyle factors. It significantly increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, and mortality.

The VARIPULSE™ Platform is the first PFA technology designed to streamline ablation and mapping through a single integrated workflow with the CARTO™ 3 System. This 3D electroanatomical cardiac mapping technology enables real-time visualization and supports precision, efficiency, reproducibility, and procedural accuracy for physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib). It enables safe and efficient patient-centric therapy with minimal to no fluoroscopy exposurex and is compatible with deep and/or conscious sedation.

Philip McDaniel, CEO and co-founder of the award-winning St. Augustine Distillery, has retired.

Well known for his advocacy for sustainable production and modernizing antiquated distillery regulation laws, the 30-year St. Augustine resident is passing the torch his co-founders to spend more time with his family.

McDaniel told the St. Augustine Record that as retirement feels surreal, he remains “blown away” by the cool idea ― the distillery ― that became one of Florida’s top attractions and the state's largest craft spirit's brand.

“I feel good about it all,” he said. ""We poured our time, energy and heart to achieve becoming respected and engaged. We didn’t just seek profits — we sought to create purpose. We built something that helps take care of people, both in the company and throughout our community.""

Known for his mentorship, advocacy and community give-back, McDaniel said that despite stepping back from the daily operations, he remains a “passionate” supporter of the craft spirits movement and the future of St. Augustine Distillery.

Over the past 12 years, McDaniel and his team have acquired a long list of accolades. Last year, the distillery received USA Today's Reader's Choice Award for the 2024 Best Craft Specialty Spirits.

Additional awards include:

“#1 Whiskey Tour in North America” by the Drammie Awards.

A gold medal for its Florida Double Cask Bourbon.

A platinum medal for its Port Finished Bourbon from the Spirits International Prestige Awards.

A 2014 Award for Excellence for Reuse and Repurpose by the Urban Land Institute of North Florida for the renovation of the Ice Plant.

And the 2014 Adelaide Sanchez Award for Historic Preservation, Restoration, Education and Interpretation.

The distillery treats more than 175,000 annual guests to award-winning whiskey, bourbon, rum, gin, vodka and moonshine. McDaniel and his team spearheaded the renovation of the St. Augustine Distillery, which is nestled in Florida's oldest FP&L Ice Plant. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the evolution of the 1917 ice plant to become a distillery took more than three years.

""Finding a home with lots of soulful character that would be big enough to house a working distillery ― while also being convenient to visit – was no small task,"" McDaniel told the St. Augustine Record in December. ""We lovingly restored this piece of history so it could serve the community for the next century.""

The distillery boasts a culture for community give-back with organizations such as Habitat for Humanity, The St. Johns County Cultural Counsel, the Lincolnville Museum and Cultural Center, the St. Augustine Amphitheatre, the Ponte Vedra Concert Hall, and music festivals such as Sing Out Loud and Fort Mose Jazz and Blues Concert Series.

As a well-respected voice in the industry, McDaniel served on the board of directors for the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, Visit Florida's board and multiple terms — including as chairman — on the St. Augustine, Ponte Vedra & The Beaches Visitors & Convention Bureau, promoting regional tourism and entrepreneurship.

“I’m grateful to our shareholders, our incredible team, our industry partners, and the 1.5 million guests who’ve visited and supported us,” he said in a public statement.” I’m excited to support our leadership team — Mike Diaz (CFO) and Will Hensler (COO) and Rick DeMontmollin — in my new role as Founder Emeritus.”

The facility—now the largest iron ore concentrator in West Africa—is expected to quadruple Liberia’s iron ore output.
Lakshmi Mittal remarked that the concentrator “guarantees the long-term future of mining in Liberia,” solidifying the country’s role as a key supplier of high-grade iron ore.
“This brings great relief to our economy noting that it is impacting the area of job creation,” said President Boakai.
ArcelorMittal Liberia currently employs about 2,000 Liberians full-time and has created more than 10,000 direct and indirect jobs during its two decades in the country.","ArcelorMittal Liberia has officially inaugurated a state-of-the-art iron ore concentrator at its Tokadeh mine in Nimba County, marking a major milestone in Liberia’s mining sector and broader post-war economic transformation.

The facility—now the largest iron ore concentrator in West Africa—is expected to quadruple Liberia’s iron ore output. It represents the centerpiece of ArcelorMittal’s Phase II Expansion Project, a $1.8 billion investment that brings the company’s total stake in Liberia to approximately $3.5 billion.

The inauguration ceremony, attended by Liberia’s President Joseph Nyuma Boakai and ArcelorMittal Executive Chairman Lakshmi N. Mittal, highlighted the project as one of the most significant private-sector investments in Liberia since the civil war. President Boakai hailed the development as a “turning point” in Liberia’s industrial future and a testament to the country’s stability and resilience.

The new concentrator is designed to transform Liberia’s abundant but lower-grade hematite ore (~35% Fe content) into premium 66% Fe magnetite concentrate using advanced beneficiation technology. The upgrade adds significant value before export, aligning with Africa’s broader push toward value addition and industrialization. “The iron ore that leaves Liberia should not just be raw material—we must add value, create jobs, and build an industrial base for our future,” President Boakai stated.

Echoing the African Union’s vision for mineral-led development, ArcelorMittal’s investment demonstrates how resource-rich African nations like Liberia, and by extension Ghana and others, can leverage natural wealth to drive homegrown industrial transformation. Lakshmi Mittal remarked that the concentrator “guarantees the long-term future of mining in Liberia,” solidifying the country’s role as a key supplier of high-grade iron ore.

In parallel with boosting output, ArcelorMittal’s expansion also emphasizes infrastructure development. The company has modernized the 243-kilometer railway linking Tokadeh to the port of Buchanan, laying hundreds of thousands of new sleepers, enhancing track geometry, and installing new passing loops to accommodate long, heavy trains. These upgrades elevate Liberia’s mining corridor to meet international standards and lay the foundation for regional integration.

Crucially, ArcelorMittal supports an open-access policy for the railway, collaborating with the Liberian government to develop a framework allowing other mining companies to utilize the infrastructure under fair agreements. This creates the potential for Liberia to serve as a regional mineral hub, with iron ore from neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone possibly routed through Liberia’s enhanced logistics network in the future.

President Boakai emphasized the strategic importance of these projects, stating they are “essential to deepening Liberia’s integration into global value chains and unlocking long-term benefits for our people.”

The Phase II expansion has already delivered significant socioeconomic impact. During the construction phase, over 5,000 jobs were created—most of them filled by Liberians. Now operational, the concentrator is expected to support around 1,000 permanent roles in mining, rail, processing, and port operations. “This brings great relief to our economy noting that it is impacting the area of job creation,” said President Boakai.

ArcelorMittal Liberia currently employs about 2,000 Liberians full-time and has created more than 10,000 direct and indirect jobs during its two decades in the country. To ensure lasting benefits, the company has expanded its Training Academy in Yekepa, offering a fully funded, multi-year technical training program. Dozens of young Liberians are being trained in mechanical, electrical, and processing disciplines to run the new concentrator. “They are the true face of Liberia’s tomorrow,” President Boakai noted.

Local businesses have also benefitted, with Liberian contractors engaged in civil works, transportation, and support services—stimulating local economies across Nimba, Bong, and Grand Bassa counties.

With future expansion in mind, ArcelorMittal has built infrastructure capable of handling up to 30 million tonnes of iron ore annually, beyond the initial 20 Mt target. Officials have hinted at a phased ramp-up and plans for a pelletizing plant, potentially adding more in-country processing and helping West Africa gain a stronger foothold in the global steel supply chain.

On the community front, ArcelorMittal contributes around $3 million annually to a Community Development Fund, which has financed schools, clinics, water systems, and livelihoods in host communities. President Boakai underscored the importance of corporate responsibility: “Large investments must enrich the corporate social responsibility envelope… so that communities feel the benefits not just in employment, but in schools, clinics, and markets.”

The successful commissioning of the Tokadeh concentrator underscores what’s possible when stable policy, infrastructure investment, and community engagement align. “We would not have invested this scale of capital—nearly $3 billion—if we didn’t believe in Liberia and its people,” said Lakshmi Mittal, signaling ArcelorMittal’s long-term confidence in the nation.

Beyond Liberia, the project holds regional significance. Its alignment with continental initiatives such as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) showcases how integrated infrastructure corridors can drive industrialization and trade across borders. The emphasis on beneficiation and skills development reflects Agenda 2063’s goals of inclusive growth and sustainable development.

For other resource-rich African nations—including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Ghana—Liberia’s model offers valuable lessons: local processing and infrastructure investment can multiply the economic impact of natural resources and position Africa not only as a source of raw materials, but as a leader in global value chains.

In conclusion, the newly inaugurated Tokadeh concentrator stands as a landmark of African industrial progress—symbolizing resilience, ambition, and meaningful partnership. As Liberia prepares to export its first high-grade iron ore from the facility later this year, a powerful message resonates across the continent: Africa is open for business—and ready to transform its natural wealth into lasting prosperity.",https://www.adomonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PHOTO-2025-07-07-07-47-26-Copy.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 03:58:03.857981

This decision has sparked controversy and raised concerns among patients and healthcare providers.
This trend raises questions about the long-term sustainability of obesity treatment and the need for more data on the long-term effectiveness and value of GLP-1 medications [1].
In conclusion, CVS Caremark's decision to exclude Zepbound from coverage has sparked debate and concern among patients and healthcare providers.","CVS' anti-theft measures may be alienating customers and harming profits more than the theft itself, according to liberal columnist Matt Bai. The drugstore chain has experienced a rise in organized theft in recent years, prompting the implementation of barriers to protect merchandise. Bai argues that these barriers have altered his relaxing shopping experience and may be driving customers away.

CVS Caremark, a major pharmacy benefit manager, has announced significant changes to its prescription drug plans, including the exclusion of Eli Lilly's Zepbound from coverage for chronic weight management, effective July 1, 2025 [1]. This decision has sparked controversy and raised concerns among patients and healthcare providers.

Zepbound, a GLP-1 drug approved for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or who are overweight, will no longer be covered under CVS Caremark's most common formulary template, which represents between 25 and 30 million individuals [1]. The change is aimed at encouraging competition among drug manufacturers to lower prices and improve patient access to more affordable alternatives, such as Wegovy from Novo Nordisk [1]. However, the exclusion of Zepbound has been met with criticism from patients and healthcare professionals who argue that the medication is more effective and better tolerated than Wegovy for many individuals [1].

The trial-and-error process required to find the right medication for each patient can be disrupted by insurance coverage changes, leading to potential setbacks in weight loss progress and increased stress for patients [1]. Dr. Jody Dushay, an endocrinologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, has expressed frustration with the impact of insurance coverage changes on patient care and the time burden it places on healthcare providers [1].

Moreover, the exclusion of Zepbound from coverage may have unintended consequences for patients' mental health, as weight stigma and bias can contribute to feelings of depression and anxiety [1]. Tara Eacobacci, a patient who has benefited from Zepbound, has described feeling validated by the medication and concerned about the potential impact of losing coverage on her physical and mental well-being [1].

In response to the coverage change, Eli Lilly has expanded access to Zepbound through its LillyDirect platform, offering single-dose vials at $499 per month for patients who pay out-of-pocket [1]. However, the appeals process for coverage exceptions can be time-consuming and frustrating for patients [1].

The insurance coverage changes are part of a broader trend of exclusions and restrictions on GLP-1 medications for obesity treatment, with BCBS Massachusetts planning to exclude all GLP-1s from coverage for obesity treatment in January 2026, except when indicated for type 2 diabetes [1]. This trend raises questions about the long-term sustainability of obesity treatment and the need for more data on the long-term effectiveness and value of GLP-1 medications [1].

In conclusion, CVS Caremark's decision to exclude Zepbound from coverage has sparked debate and concern among patients and healthcare providers. While the goal of encouraging competition and lowering drug prices is commendable, the impact on patient care and well-being must be carefully considered. As the obesity crisis continues to be a significant public health challenge, it is essential to ensure that patients have access to effective and affordable treatment options.

Washington Post contributing columnist Matt Bai argued Monday that the drugstore chain’s efforts to prevent rising theft may be killing profits more than theft itself.

""As you might have read, CVS and other pharmacies have been struggling to contain a rise in thefts by gangs of fast-moving thieves. Unfortunately for CVS, the solution might be worse for business than the organized shoplifting,"" he wrote.

In recent years, CVS and other similar drug stores have experienced a rise in frequent, organized theft, especially in major U.S. cities where crime has risen.

CREW OF ARMED GUNMEN ROB ARMORED TRUCK OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO-AREA BANK IN BROAD DAYLIGHT

For example, a group of dozens of school-age kids routinely ransacked and looted a CVS in Washington, D.C.’s Columbia Heights neighborhood throughout 2023.

""A big group of kids, like 45 or more, walk in before school, after school and late at night to steal chips and drinks,"" Fox 5 reported in October that year. ""They even throw the food and beverages on the ground and stomp on them, leaving behind a big mess.""

A recent survey by the National Retail Federation found that 70% of retailers believe organized retail theft has become a more prevalent issue in recent years. As a result of these and similar crimes, big chain stores like CVS and others have been forced to lock up merchandise behind glass and plastic barriers to keep it from being stolen off the shelves.

But the Washington Post columnist complained that these barriers have altered his ""relaxing"" CVS shopping experience.

""I come back not just because it’s convenient but because it’s relaxing. I like to roam the deserted aisles at night and consider the myriad ways in which the bounty of 21st-century pharmacology might improve my life. What if my hands could truly be moist? Which combination of vitamins might heighten my chances of grasping string theory?"" Bai asked.

""Except now I’m standing in front of the oral care aisle, and something has changed,"" he continued. ""Virtually all of those mysterious products are now encased in glass. It’s like someone has turned the CVS I knew into a Museum of the American Pharmacy; the only thing missing from the lifelike diorama is a wax employee with a pricing gun.""

He mentioned feeling the ""pressure"" of having a store clerk open an enclosure just so he could look at a product he hadn’t decided on buying while she stood there next to him. He also mentioned how when he had to return products later, he was asked if he had opened them. When he said no, he noted the cashier ""cheekily"" asked, ""Are you lying?""

""I should probably be offended by this, but I’m not. If body lotion is so valuable that it has to be kept in a glass vault, then I guess it’s reasonable to wonder what kind of game I’m running. Plus, I seem suspiciously well hydrated,"" he remarked, before delving into what has caused this new atmosphere in CVS.

""A little research tells us what’s going on here. As you might have read, CVS and other pharmacies have been struggling to contain a rise in thefts by gangs of fast-moving thieves. Unfortunately for CVS, the solution might be worse for business than the organized shoplifting,"" he said, adding, ""According to a recent survey, less than 1 in 3 shoppers at CVS are willing to hang around once they realize that the item they want is behind glass.""

Bai noted that this is hard for the store combined with the fact that ""plenty of online sites"" are offering the same products ""more cheaply and just as reliably,"" and stated that the chain should lean into what makes it unique.

""What your neighborhood chain can offer is the chance to wander down an aisle and suddenly find some new, cucumber-scented solution to a problem you didn’t even know you had. It’s the possibility store.""

The price represents a 28% premium over WNS’ 90-day average share price, and values the transaction at approximately $3.3 billion, excluding net debt.

The deal, unanimously approved by both companies’ Boards of Directors, will position Capgemini as a global leader in Agentic AI-powered Intelligent Operations. It is expected to close by the end of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and shareholder consent.

Strategic Move to Tap the Agentic AI Opportunity

“Enterprises are rapidly adopting Generative AI and Agentic AI to transform their operations end-to-end. Business Process Services will be the showcase for Agentic AI,” said Aiman Ezzat, Chief Executive Officer of Capgemini. “This acquisition gives us scale and sector expertise to lead the transformation from traditional BPS to AI-powered Intelligent Operations. With deep consulting, platform, and technology capabilities, we are poised to deliver efficiency and superior business outcomes for clients globally.”

WNS, with its high-growth, margin-accretive Digital BPS model, will enhance Capgemini’s U.S. exposure and unlock cross-selling opportunities. “I look forward to welcoming the WNS global team to Capgemini,” Ezzat added.

Keshav R. Murugesh, Chief Executive Officer of WNS, noted, “The next wave of transformation lies in intelligent, domain-centric operations that shift from automation to autonomy. Our integration with Capgemini allows us to combine deep domain expertise with Gen AI and Agentic AI capabilities, unlocking strategic value for clients and stakeholders alike.”

WNS Chairman Timothy L. Main called the deal “a pivotal chapter” in the company’s growth journey, stating, “Capgemini is the ideal partner to extend our capabilities, accelerate innovation, and create lasting value for clients, investors, and employees.”

WNS: A High-Quality, Resilient BPS Business

WNS brings strong fundamentals, with a diversified client base across eight industries and a highly automated delivery model. The company achieved a compound annual revenue growth of 9% (constant currency) over the past three fiscal years, reaching $1.27 billion in FY2025 with an 18.7% operating margin.

Its robust operating model, including non-linear pricing and recurring revenue streams, positions it well to benefit from the global shift to Intelligent Operations.

Unlocking Cross-Selling and Revenue Synergies

The combination will yield €1.9 billion in 2024 revenue in Digital BPS alone. Capgemini expects €100–140 million in annual revenue synergies and €50–70 million in operating model efficiencies by end-2027. Normalised EPS is projected to increase by 4% in 2026 and by 7% in 2027 post-synergies.

Agentic AI: A Paradigm Shift in Process Transformation

Intelligent Operations, driven by Agentic AI and Generative AI, is expected to dominate enterprise AI investments. Capgemini and WNS together offer consulting-led transformation of both horizontal and vertical processes, using hyper-automation, AI, and data integration to deliver speed, agility, and improved outcomes.

This shift from labour-intensive models to tech-led, outcome-driven services opens significant growth opportunities in a rapidly evolving market.

Combined Strengths to Lead in Intelligent Operations

Capgemini brings consulting, technology, and platform integration at scale, while WNS contributes industry-specific solutions, a proven delivery model, and recent AI advancements (including its acquisition of Kipi.ai). Capgemini’s 25 strategic AI partnerships—including Microsoft, AWS, Google, NVIDIA, and Mistral—further enhance the combined capabilities.

Together, the companies aim to lead the emerging Intelligent Operations space and become transformation partners to enterprises seeking AI-powered reinvention.

Transaction Structure and Financing

The acquisition will be implemented via a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Jersey law. Capgemini has secured €4 billion in bridge financing to fund the purchase price, existing debt, and a recently redeemed €0.8 billion bond. The bridge will be refinanced using a mix of available cash and new debt.

Q2 and H1 2025 Guidance Unchanged

Capgemini expects Q2 2025 constant-currency revenue growth to slightly exceed Q1’s -0.4% and maintains its H1 operating margin at 12.4%. Full H1 results will be announced on July 30, 2025.

2025 Outlook (Excluding Acquisition Impact):

Revenue growth: –2.0% to +2.0% (constant currency)

Menu additions include the Egg McMuffin with Spicy Pepper Sauce, the Spicy Sausage McMuffin, and the Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg.
Its enduring popularity has helped define McDonald's breakfast offering for half a century.
For long-time customers, the spicy Egg McMuffin and returning Snack Wrap offer a mix of familiarity and novelty.","McDonald's has announced two major menu changes in the US, marking the 50th anniversary of the Egg McMuffin. Starting in July, the chain will introduce a spicy version of the breakfast classic for the first time and reintroduce its long-discontinued Snack Wrap.

The updates reflect shifting customer preferences and come amid wider efforts to attract younger diners and boost footfall.

Spicy McMuffin: A New Take on a Classic

From 8 July, McDonald's will roll out three spicy Egg McMuffin options in the US. The new range will feature a Spicy Pepper Sauce developed to appeal to younger customers and fans of stronger flavours. Menu additions include the Egg McMuffin with Spicy Pepper Sauce, the Spicy Sausage McMuffin, and the Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg.

According to a recent consumer trends report, 74 per cent of Americans regularly use hot sauce, and nearly four in five Gen Z diners prefer spicier food. The move to spice up one of McDonald's most iconic breakfast items signals a shift in how the company is responding to changing tastes and evolving expectations around fast food.

Snack Wrap Returns: A Cult Favourite Revived

​​On 10 July, McDonald's will also bring back its Snack Wrap, a customer favourite that was removed from the menu in 2016 due to equipment and preparation constraints. It will return in two flavours: Ranch and Spicy, both using McCrispy chicken strips, lettuce and shredded cheese wrapped in a soft tortilla. While McDonald's has not officially confirmed whether the grilled version will return, reports suggest that only the crispy chicken option will be available at launch.

The wrap's revival follows years of customer demand and persistent online campaigns. On platforms like TikTok and Reddit, users have frequently called for its return, with some even attempting to recreate the item at home. McDonald's has said the wrap will remain on the menu as long as customer interest remains strong. While this announcement applies only to the US, the company has suggested it may consider broader availability if the product performs well.

Strategic Context: Why Now, and Why It Matters

The Egg McMuffin, first introduced in 1972 by Californian franchisee Herb Peterson, became a national breakfast staple by 1975. Its enduring popularity has helped define McDonald's breakfast offering for half a century. By launching new versions during its anniversary year, the company is leveraging nostalgia while modernising its image.

The limited-time offerings are designed to encourage app downloads, reward programme enrolments and in-store traffic. The reintroduction of familiar items in new formats also plays into McDonald's wider digital strategy, which includes dynamic menu changes and user-customised ordering through mobile platforms.

For long-time customers, the spicy Egg McMuffin and returning Snack Wrap offer a mix of familiarity and novelty. These additions provide more variety during breakfast and lunch hours and are aimed at consumers seeking flavour-forward, convenient food options.

Although the company has not confirmed whether these items will be introduced in the UK or other markets, the announcement marks a broader shift in how McDonald's responds to consumer demand and market trends. The decision to refresh one of its most iconic products, while reviving a cult favourite, reflects a more adaptive and customer-led approach to menu development.",https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1730687/mcdonalds-logo.png,N,,2025-07-08 04:59:35.149506

""Value and essentials will outperform premium as shoppers focus on deals for everyday items, especially back-to-school and replenishment,"" Mike Feldman, senior vice president of commerce at Flywheel, told Axios.

State of play: Retailers have warned that some seasonal events could be affected by tariffs, with shortages and higher prices possible.

Jacob Bennett, CEO and co-founder of small business banking platform Crux Analytics, tells Axios that some Amazon sellers pulled out of Prime Day because of tariffs.

Trump hit Bangladesh with 37 percent tariffs in an April 2 announcement, but in a letter issued Tuesday, the US leader said it would now be 35 percent.
Mahmud Hasan Khan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), called it ""a big challenge for the garment sector"".
""We had expected the tariff imposed on us to be between 10 to 20 percent,"" he said, adding he expected Dhaka's interim leader Muhammad Yunus to ""raise the issue with the United States"".
""The new tariffs raise worries about job losses in Bangladesh as the US is its main export market,"" he said.","Textile and garment production accounts for about 80 percent of exports in Bangladesh and the industry has been rebuilding after it was hit hard in a student-led revolution that toppled the government last year.

""There is a hope for getting a reduced rate of tariffs as USTR (Office of the United States Trade Representative) sent another draft document for review,"" Commerce Secretary Mahbubur Rahman told AFP.

Rahman said the South Asia nation's national security adviser and commerce adviser were ""working on the issue"" in the United States.

Bangladesh exported $8.36 billion worth of goods to the United States in 2024, while imports from there amounted to $2.21 billion, according to the Bangladesh Bank and the National Board of Revenue.

US clothing companies that source products from Bangladesh range from Fruit of the Loom to Levi Strauss to VF Corp -- whose brands include Vans, Timberland and The North Face.

Trump hit Bangladesh with 37 percent tariffs in an April 2 announcement, but in a letter issued Tuesday, the US leader said it would now be 35 percent.

That is more than double the 16 percent already placed on cotton products.

Dhaka has proposed to buy Boeing planes and boost imports of US wheat, cotton and oil in a bid to reduce the trade deficit, which Trump has used as justification for imposing painful levies.

Mahmud Hasan Khan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), called it ""a big challenge for the garment sector"".

""We had expected the tariff imposed on us to be between 10 to 20 percent,"" he said, adding he expected Dhaka's interim leader Muhammad Yunus to ""raise the issue with the United States"".

Former BGMEA director Mohiuddin Rubel warned the impact as tariffs stand would be dire.

""The new tariffs raise worries about job losses in Bangladesh as the US is its main export market,"" he said.

""Bangladesh needs to act quickly by engaging US importers to push for policy changes, resuming high-level trade talks, and highlighting the importance of its products.""

In one example, the company is considering making its egg white and roasted red pepper bites without canola oil, a spokesman said in response to an inquiry from Bloomberg News.

The company will also add a new egg bite to its menu that is made with avocado oil.

The coffee chain is in the midst of a brand revamp as it seeks to reverse

a sales slump

, and one of its priorities is testing products that appeal to more health-conscious consumers.

In June, Starbucks chief executive Brian Niccol pledged in a meeting with US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr to further align the chain’s menu with the Trump administration’s health priorities.

Starbucks’ US menu has a number of items that contain canola oil, including a bacon, gouda and egg sandwich, as well as potato bakes. Starbucks did not provide a timeline for the changes to its food lineup.

Seed oils, such as soybean and canola, have become a target for Mr Kennedy and his allies, though multiple meta-analyses have indicated they have no significant impact on inflammation or the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.

The health push is showing up in other places on Starbucks’ menu.

The chain removed sugar from its matcha powder in a move that boosted sales, Mr Niccol said during an April earnings call. It also nixed an upcharge for non-dairy milk, and a recent pilot involves unsweetened protein powder, which can be added to any cold foam flavour.

The chain’s latest US beverage launch was a limited-time Fourth of July themed Frappuccino. The 16-ounce version contains 59 grams of sugar, according to the chain’s website. The American Heart Association recommends that men consume less than 36 grams of added sugar a day and women less than 25 grams.

In a sector ripe for consolidation, BNP Paribas is staking its claim as Europe's financial services champion.","BNP Paribas, Europe's second-largest bank by assets, has embarked on a sweeping reorganization that reshapes its corporate structure, leadership, and strategic priorities. The moves—consolidating Eurozone commercial and personal banking under Yannick Jung, overhauling governance at its Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB) division, and leveraging the AXA IM acquisition to amplify its asset management footprint—signal an audacious bid to dominate the fragmented European financial landscape. For investors, the question is clear: Can these moves turn BNP Paribas into a growth-driven, tech-enabled titan, or will they expose vulnerabilities in a sector still grappling with low rates and regulatory headwinds?

The Eurozone Play: Yannick Jung's Unified Banking Ambition

At the heart of BNP Paribas' overhaul is the consolidation of its Eurozone commercial and personal banking operations under Yannick Jung, a veteran of its Corporate & Institutional Banking division. Jung's new role as Deputy Chief Operating Officer and head of the newly formed Commercial, Personal Banking & Services (CPBS) unit merges France, Italy, Belgium, and Luxembourg into a single entity. The goal? To unify technological investments, cross-sell products across divisions, and streamline operations for small and midsize enterprises (SMEs)—a segment that accounts for over 70% of European employment but remains underserved by digital tools.

The strategy hinges on a “shared technology backbone” to reduce costs and enhance customer experience. For instance, Jung's unit will collaborate with CIB to offer SMEs end-to-end solutions—from transaction banking to capital markets access—while leveraging the IPS division's wealth management and insurance products. This integration could be a game-changer in the Savings and Investment Union (SIU), the EU's plan to harmonize pensions and savings products across borders.

The CIB Governance Overhaul: A New Model for European Investment Banking

The CIB division, which generates nearly half of BNP Paribas' revenue, has undergone its own seismic shift. Yann Gérardin, the Group's Chief Operating Officer, now serves as Executive Chairman of CIB, while Olivier Osty—a former head of CIB's Global Markets—becomes its CEO. This dual-leadership structure aims to balance strategic vision with operational execution.

The reorganization splits CIB into two coverage arms (Institutional and Corporate), five business lines (Transaction Banking, Capital Markets, Equities, FICC, and Securities Services), and three geographic regions. The move is a clear nod to CIB's “Originate & Distribute” strategy, which has doubled its revenue over the past decade. But the stakes are high: CIB must now compete with rivals like JPMorgan Chase's European arm while navigating regulatory scrutiny and the shift to digital-first client engagement.

The AXA IM Acquisition: Building an Asset Management Goliath

Perhaps the most transformative move is the €5.4 billion acquisition of AXA Investment Managers (AXA IM), finalized in July 2025. This deal, which boosts BNP Paribas' assets under management (AUM) to over €1.5 trillion, positions the bank as Europe's leader in long-term savings and private asset management. The integration of AXA IM's expertise into BNP's existing asset management divisions—BNP Paribas Asset Management and BNP Paribas REIM—creates a platform with global scale and a focus on ESG-driven investing.

The financial upside is compelling: BNP projects a compound annual revenue growth rate of over 5% through 2026, with returns on invested capital (ROIC) exceeding 14% by 2028 and 20% by 2029. Yet risks loom. The transaction temporarily reduces BNP's CET1 capital ratio—a key prudential metric—by 35 basis points, and employee consultations over merging legal entities remain unresolved.

Why Investors Should Take Note

BNP Paribas' reorganization is a bet on three interconnected trends:

1. Synergies in Digital Banking: Unifying Eurozone operations could cut costs by 10-15% and fuel cross-selling opportunities.

2. SME Financing Growth: With the SIU's push to standardize savings products, BNP's integrated model could capture a disproportionate share of SME lending and advisory fees.

3. Asset Management Dominance: The AXA IM acquisition positions BNP to capitalize on Europe's aging population and demand for long-term savings products.

The bank's stock, trading at a 15% discount to its pre-pandemic peak, offers a potential entry point if execution delivers on its ROIC targets. Competitors like Société Générale and UniCredit face similar challenges in cost-cutting and digital transformation, but BNP's scale and geographic focus give it an edge.

Risks to the Play

Regulatory Pushback: The European Central Bank's scrutiny of bank capital adequacy and cross-border operations could delay synergies.

Integration Hurdles: Merging AXA IM's culture and systems with BNP's divisions is no small task.

Economic Downturn: A recession could pressure SME loan portfolios and asset management AUM.

Investment Takeaway

BNP Paribas' reorganization is a high-stakes gamble—but one with a clear path to success. For investors seeking exposure to European financials, the bank's focus on synergies, tech-driven integration, and long-term asset management growth makes it a compelling pick, provided execution stays on track. Monitor ROIC improvements and CET1 recovery closely; patience could be rewarded.

In a sector ripe for consolidation, BNP Paribas is staking its claim as Europe's financial services champion. The question now is whether its strategic overhaul can deliver the returns its shareholders—and the continent's economy—desperately need.",,N,,2025-07-08 02:58:54.543026

Intelligent Operations answers these business needs, providing a consulting-led approach to transform and operate horizontal and vertical business processes leveraging Gen AI and Agentic AI.
Both Capgemini and WNS are already pioneering Intelligent Operations.
Furthermore, the integration will be straightforward into Capgemini’s Global Business Services activities.","Capgemini, a global business and technology transformation partner, and WNS, a leading digital-led business transformation and services company, announced that they have entered into a definitive transaction agreement pursuant to which Capgemini will acquire WNS.

WNS is a leading and trusted business transformation and services partner that uniquely blends deep industry knowledge with business process management, technology, analytics and AI expertise to create market differentiation for clients. With digital-led transformation solutions deployed to clients across 8 industries where it deploys its highly automated platforms to deliver stronger business outcomes, WNS is a leader in Digital Business Process Services (BPS).

This operating model enables strategic engagements that are critical to clients’ daily operations materialized in long-term contracts with recurring revenues streams. Through an expanded ecosystem of partners and network of delivery centers, WNS serves a large portfolio of blue-chip clients, such as United Airlines, Aviva, M&T Bank, Centrica and McCain Foods.

The high-quality business model of WNS, supported by non-linear pricing models and superior profitability has driven a c.+9% constant currency revenue growth on average over the last 3 fiscal years, to reach $1,266 million of revenue in fiscal year 2025 with an 18.7% operating margin.

Global organizations are in constant need of strategic partners to support their transformation to enhance efficiency and accelerate growth. This continues to be a key driver of the Digital BPS market and WNS targets revenue growth of +7% to +11% for FY2026.

This transaction will position Capgemini as a leader in Digital BPS blending horizontal and vertical process expertise, with a global footprint. With combined revenues of €1.9 billion in 2024 in Digital BPS, this will strengthen Capgemini’s ability to accompany clients on their business and technology transformation journeys.

The mix of WNS and Capgemini’s complementary offerings and clients will immediately unlock cross-selling opportunities. It will also lay down the foundations to build the capabilities to seize the Intelligent Operations strategic market opportunity.

The largest opportunity for global organizations to create value with Gen AI and Agentic AI lies in the fundamental redesign of their operations and business processes. It will attract a significant share of their AI investments as they seek to become AI-powered companies to lead their market. This is creating demand for a new type of business process services: Intelligent Operations.

Intelligent Operations answers these business needs, providing a consulting-led approach to transform and operate horizontal and vertical business processes leveraging Gen AI and Agentic AI. It addresses clients’ goal of efficiency, speed and agility through process hyper-automation, while significantly improving business outcomes by combining data, AI and digital.

AI technologies trigger a paradigm shift in delivering business process services: from labor-intensive services to being consulting-led and tech-driven. In parallel, client focus has shifted from efficiency gains toward end-to-end value creation and business outcomes, opening opportunities to add non-linear revenues (i.e. transaction-based, subscription-based or outcome-based models). This is creating a rapidly growing market opportunity.

Both Capgemini and WNS are already pioneering Intelligent Operations. Capgemini with its consulting-led end-to-end transformation of processes, advanced AI tools and technology stacks, and BPS platforms, while WNS has developed a set of sector-specific AI-led solutions recently augmented by the acquisition of Kipi.ai to strengthen its data, analytics and AI capabilities.

The combination of Capgemini and WNS will act as a catalyst to lead in Intelligent Operations providing the required scale and unique set of capabilities from Strategy & Transformation consulting, to horizontal and sector expertise, platform offerings to deep AI and technology capabilities.

This combination will also leverage the significant investments made by Capgemini in AI through training, offers and its 25 strategic partnerships, including Microsoft, Google, AWS, Mistral AI and NVIDIA. The Group’s leadership is recognized by its clients, with over €900 million of Gen AI bookings in 2024, and by market analysts such as Forrester, IDC and ISG.

This transaction will reinforce Capgemini as a business and transformation partner to those enterprises who want to become AI-powered businesses.

Based on calendar year 2024 published information, the combined entities would have generated a revenue of €23.3 billion at a 13.6% operating margin in 2024.

The Group expects accretion to normalized EPS, before synergies from the combination, of 4% in 2026.

Capgemini expects revenue synergies run-rate of €100 million to €140 million by the end of 2027. Costs and operating model synergies are anticipated to reach an annual pretax run-rate of between €50 million and €70 million by the end of 2027.

With the benefits of these synergies, the accretion on normalized earnings per share should reach 7% in 2027.

WNS and Capgemini have a natural cultural fit and share common values that will facilitate a smooth integration of the teams, helped by the Group’s track record of successful integrations. Furthermore, the integration will be straightforward into Capgemini’s Global Business Services activities.

The contemplated transaction will be implemented by way of a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under the laws of Jersey. The transaction has been unanimously approved by both Capgemini’s and WNS’ Boards of Directors.

The transaction is subject to approval by the Royal Court of Jersey and WNS’ shareholders, as well as to receipt of customary regulatory approvals and other conditions. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur by the end of the year.

Capgemini has secured a bridge financing of €4.0 billion, covering the purchase of securities ($3.3 billion), as well as the gross debt and similar obligations of around $0.4 billion and the €0.8 billion Capgemini bond redeemed in June 2025.

The Group plans to refinance the bridge with available cash for around €1.0 billion and the balance by debt issuance.

The Group expects Q2 2025 year-on-year growth at constant currency to be slightly better than the -0.4% reported in Q1 2025. The Group also expects for H1 2025 the operating margin to be stable year-on-year at 12.4%.

Due to the nature and timing of this announcement, the actual Q2 and H1 2025 performance may slightly differ from the above-mentioned expectations. H1 2025 publication will take place as planned on July 30, 2025.

Capgemini’s financial targets for 2025 do not take into account this transaction and are therefore unchanged:

To accelerate progress, Nike is implementing a new strategy called “Sport Offense,” which aims to align its teams more closely around sport.
The Sport Offense initiative will refine Nike’s brand positioning in core categories, simplify its product offerings, strengthen its storytelling, and reshape its market approach to drive growth.
In China, Nike supported local basketball culture through the Chinese High School Basketball League and grassroots platform “Next Stop Dongdan.” It also introduced the Nike ST Flare “Blaze,” a basketball shoe tailored for outdoor play.
This year, Nike’s women’s basketball business grew by more than 50%.","Nike has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025, which ended on May 31. The company reported USD 46.3 billion in annual revenue, with USD 11.1 billion generated in the final quarter. Greater China contributed USD 6.585 billion for the year and USD 1.476 billion in the fourth quarter, exceeding market expectations in both cases. On the day the report was published, Nike’s stock rose 15.25%, marking its largest single-day gain in nearly four years and pushing its market capitalization to USD 106.4 billion.

This was the first full-year report since Heidi O’Neill became CEO. While transformation takes time, Nike’s “Win Now” strategy is beginning to yield results. As O’Neill acknowledged, the company’s financial performance met expectations, but not the internal benchmarks it had set. To accelerate progress, Nike is implementing a new strategy called “Sport Offense,” which aims to align its teams more closely around sport.

The Sport Offense initiative will refine Nike’s brand positioning in core categories, simplify its product offerings, strengthen its storytelling, and reshape its market approach to drive growth.

Meanwhile, the numbers suggest that Nike, still one of the most storied names in global sportswear, is leaning into a period of change. Even in a challenging market, it is building momentum for long-term gains.

A difficult challenge, and a meaningful outcome

Just two hours before Nike’s earnings report went live, Faith Kipyegon crossed the finish line at Stade Charlety in Paris. The Kenyan middle distance runner clocked a personal best of 4:06.42, beating her previous record by more than a second. It was her first attempt at the “Breaking4,” a joint initiative with Nike to break the four-minute mile barrier—a feat no woman has ever achieved.

Back in April, Kipyegon and Nike jointly announced an ambitious goal: to break the four-minute mile barrier, a feat no woman has ever accomplished.

Although she did not reach the target, the attempt marked a significant moment. Kipyegon emphasized that no woman had tried before, and she believes it is only a matter of time until the barrier is broken. Her aim is to encourage more women to pursue bold goals without self-imposed limits.

This is not Nike’s first time supporting efforts to test the boundaries of human performance. At the 1984 Summer Olympics, Joan Benoit won the first women’s marathon gold medal. In 2019, Eliud Kipchoge, with Nike’s backing, became the first person to complete a marathon in under two hours. These events reflect Nike’s brand ethos and are backed by dedicated R&D and product design.

Turning the corner

Breaking4 also connects directly to Nike’s broader Win Now strategy. According to O’Neill, the plan emphasizes quick execution to enhance competitiveness by focusing on core categories, simplifying operations, and reigniting growth amid intense competition and changing consumer behavior.

In this fiscal year, Nike has ramped up its focus on running, combining product innovation with storytelling. It revamped its road running shoe lineup to emphasize cushioning, releasing models like the ultra-cushioned Vomero, the support-oriented Structure, and the responsive Pegasus. The Vomero 18 alone generated over USD 100 million in sales within 90 days, suggesting consumers are responding well to the simplified lineup.

On the athlete engagement front, Nike brought Kipchoge to Beijing and Guangzhou as part of a China tour aimed at boosting local marathon participation. At the Tokyo Marathon in March, Chinese runner Zhang Deshun, wearing Nike’s Alphafly 3, recorded a time of 2:20:53, marking the best performance by a Chinese female marathoner since 2007. The result reinforced Nike’s presence in elite running.

Nike’s emphasis on sport isn’t limited to running. It also maintained leadership in basketball. The company launched new signature shoes including Kevin Durant’s KD18 and Ja Morant’s Nike JA3. In China, Nike supported local basketball culture through the Chinese High School Basketball League and grassroots platform “Next Stop Dongdan.” It also introduced the Nike ST Flare “Blaze,” a basketball shoe tailored for outdoor play.

These product and athlete-focused efforts have been matched by backend improvements. Amid a market where brand fatigue is setting in, Nike is leaning on its foundational strengths: innovation and cultural engagement. It also made progress in managing inventory and strengthening retail partnerships.

O’Neill credited these partnerships as essential to Nike’s progress. Retailers reported stronger holiday season orders in North America, EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), and APLA (Asia Pacific and Latin America). Inventory levels showed improvement as well, with Nike reducing its lineup of legacy footwear by over 20% for the year and more than 30% in Q4. In Greater China, inventory dropped 11% compared to the previous year.

Nike aims to clear remaining excess inventory through select channels over the next two quarters, with a goal of restoring full channel health by the first half of fiscal 2026.

Targeting new segments and emotional engagement

Nike is investing in emerging growth areas too. Industry observers widely agree that women, children, and outdoor activities remain rare pockets of untapped potential for sportswear brands. The Breaking4 represents Nike’s latest bid to claim leadership in the women’s category.

Historically, women’s distance running has lagged in commercial interest and investment. With this initiative, Nike has placed a world-class female athlete at the center of both its brand storytelling and product innovation, unlocking momentum in a category with vast potential.

In April, Nike also launched the global women’s night run series, the “After Dark Tour,” in Shanghai. Over 3,500 women took part, turning the night into a celebration of performance and empowerment.

Nike continued to build a female-focused narrative during Shanghai Fashion Week in April with the “Victory Lap,” a runway event where athletes, designers, and emerging idols reinterpreted sport through a female lens, fusing function with fashion.

The brand also brought Sabrina Ionescu to China for the first time, where her personal story reportedly resonated with younger female fans. This year, Nike’s women’s basketball business grew by more than 50%.

At the same time, Nike is also tapping into youth culture in China, where emotional resonance often guides purchasing decisions. This quarter, a collaboration with Lego introduced a co-branded collection and interactive retail elements. During the 618 shopping festival, Nike Kids led Tmall’s children’s sneaker and sports categories.

Even before the earnings release, analysts had highlighted Nike’s strong appeal among younger consumers as a potential sign of recovery.

In addition to its focus on women and children, Nike is capitalizing on the growing interest in outdoor apparel. The company recently became the title sponsor of the Chongli 168 Ultra Trail and launched a Nike ACG (All Conditions Gear) training camp to offer runners technical guidance and immersive experiences. The ACG line is gaining traction both globally and in China.

As Nike expands beyond its traditional core, its long-term approach—grounded in innovation, storytelling, and local investment—is paving new paths for growth.

And if the current trajectory holds, Nike may once again defy its doubters. Its legacy, and its spirit of pushing limits, remains central to its strategy. Just as Breaking4 reminds us: dare to dream, no matter how distant the goal.",https://console.kr-asia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nike-Run.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 05:58:34.219632

CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS A LinkedIn post about the coffee giant's new 3% Employee Benefits & Retention fee sparked a debate among Starbucks customers, many of which were disapproving of the charge.
They ""are allowed to set their own prices, establish their own pay and benefits, and are completely separate from Starbucks,"" according to a former Starbucks employee of eight years.","STARBUCKS fans have begun noticing that the coffee giant is tacking on an extra charge to receipts, labeling it an ""Employee Benefits & Retention"" fee.

The 3% fee, bumping up customers' bill totals, has many fans up in arms and complaining about the coffee giant's operations.

High inflation, interest rates, and cost-of-living have all placed pressure on businesses, many of which have raised their prices to increase their profit margin.

Consumers have been forced to shell out more cash over the years for the same goods and services, and many establishments have begun rolling out additional fees to help make ends meet.

Starbucks, for example, has started implementing a ""Employee Benefits & Retention"" fee at select locations.

Customers at the location in the John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York, for example, are subject to the 3% fee.

The fee is not a corporate-wide charge but rather a localized surcharge implemented by businesses at certain airports.

The extra charge stems from a policy approved by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, permitting airport vendors to add a surcharge of up to 3% on pre-tax sales.

Following the expansion of a minimum wage policy to include automatic annual pay increases, the new Starbucks fee was rolled out to help offset the costs of increased minimum wages and benefits for airport workers.

The new regulations also permit businesses at the airport to hike their prices up to 15% more than at traditional locations, up from the previous 10% cap.

The U.S. Sun reached out to Starbucks for comment on the Employee Benefits & Retention fee.

CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS

A LinkedIn post about the coffee giant's new 3% Employee Benefits & Retention fee sparked a debate among Starbucks customers, many of which were disapproving of the charge.

""This is so dumb. Just list your price. I'll pay it if I want to. Stop being dumb, Starbucks,"" cried one user.

Another Starbucks customer called the 3% charge a ""forced tip,"" complaining that they ""can live without the coffee"" and would rather spend their money elsewhere in the terminal for water or at McDonald's for a cheap coffee.

""I yearn for the European non-tipping and non-customer responsibility for paying the wages of their employees,"" they wrote.

""Oh, hell no!!! This just shows that Starbucks is focused strictly on their profit margin,"" fumed a third shopper.

""Constant turnover already speaks to an employer's priorities, but expecting customers to pay for Starbucks' failure to invest in and retain employees is beyond ridiculous.""

Other fans defended Starbucks itself, arguing that franchised locations such as the one at the airport are not technically owned by the company.

They ""are allowed to set their own prices, establish their own pay and benefits, and are completely separate from Starbucks,"" according to a former Starbucks employee of eight years.

Another LinkedIn user and HR expert delved into the financial implications of the 3% charge, revealing that it would generate a significant profit to be used on worker benefits.

Based on the John F. Kennedy Terminal 5 traffic and industry estimates, they calculated that the 3% fee could bring in approximately $334,880 per year for Starbucks to spend on employee benefits and retention.

""To put that in context: it’s enough to FULLY fund industry-average benefits for 30+ baristas,"" they wrote.

Other establishments have similarly begun tacking on extra fees in an effort to generate a customer-funded pot that can go towards employees.

For example, diners vowed to never eat at a restaurant again after a man checked his receipt to find he was charged an extra ""living wage fee.""",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/07/SC-Sbux-Charge-Off-Plat-copy.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-07-08 03:58:35.590334

The VARIPULSE™ Platform is approved in Japan, Hong Kong, China, Australia, Taiwan and Korea.

IRVINE, Calif., July 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson & Johnson MedTech, a global leader in cardiac arrhythmia treatment, today announced the launch of the VARIPULSE™ Platform in Asia-Pacific. The platform is used to perform catheter ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation (AFib), an irregular and often rapid heartbeat caused by extra, uncoordinated electrical signals in the atria.x AFib is associated with structural changes in the heart due to underlying conditions and lifestyle factors.x,xi It significantly increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, and mortality.

The VARIPULSE™ Platform is the first PFA technology designed to streamline ablation and mapping through a single integrated workflow with the CARTO™ 3 System. This 3D electroanatomical cardiac mapping technology enables real-time visualization and supports precision, efficiency, reproducibility, and procedural accuracy for physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib)xii. It enables safe and efficienti,ii,iii,iv,v,vi,vii, patient-centric therapy with minimal to no fluoroscopy exposurexiii,xiv,xv and is compatible with deep and/or conscious sedation.2,xvi,xvii

This innovation is backed by compelling clinical evidence. Both the inspIRE and admIRE clinical trials demonstrated strong safety and effectiveness of the VARIPULSE™ Platform:

In inspIRE, 80% of patients achieved freedom from recurrence with zero primary adverse events.xviii

In admIRE, results showed a 75% overall primary effectiveness success rate3, a 2.9% primary adverse event rate4,xix, 100% of patients achieved acute procedural success5, 43% had same-day discharge, and 25% of procedures were performed without fluoroscopy6.

In the ongoing VARIPURE registry, which included first-time users, there were no serious adverse events and no complications linked to the platform, including zero neurovascular events or coronary spasmsxx.

""The introduction of the VARIPULSE™ Platform in the Asia-Pacific region marks a significant advancement towards our goal of transforming atrial fibrillation care,"" stated Jing Li, Vice President, Electrophysiology & Neurovascular, Johnson & Johnson MedTech, Asia Pacific. ""The adoption of the VARIPULSE™ Platform could demonstrate the unique value of integration with CARTO™ 3D to enhance efficiencies in the workflow of AFib treatment and improve patient outcomes.""

Atrial Fibrillation affects over 16 million people in Asia-Pacificxxi. Symptoms and clinical consequences of AFib disrupt patient's quality of life. The most common symptoms are heart palpitations, fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and dizzinessxxii. As a progressive condition, early intervention is critical to reducing the risk of stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular mortalityxxiii.

Unlike traditional ablation methods that use heat or cold, PFA uses short bursts of energy to affect heart tissue, potentially reducing the risk of damage to surrounding tissue such as the esophagus, pulmonary veins, and phrenic nerve.

""PFA, as a new type of energy, has the potential to further enhance the safety and efficacy of catheter ablation treatment, which is desirable for patients"" said Dr. Yasuo Okumura7, Professor and Department Head, Vice Hospital Director, Nihon University School of Medicine, Itabashi Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. ""PFA is a relatively new medical technology, and therefore it is important to continue to assess its effectiveness and efficacy in Asia while ensuring proper use. But so far, we know that the integration of PFA technology with 3D mapping enables physicians to review their procedure in detail, and this contributes to quality of healthcare for patients.""

Until last year, sandwich chain Jimmy John’s franchises were found solely in the United States. It’s since been expanding within Canada — and at least two locations could open in Winnipeg this fall.

Posters displaying sandwiches — perhaps not the Turkey Tom, but meaty options — plaster 1740 Pembina Hwy. and 1430 Ellice Ave. Both sites were construction zones Monday.

Jimmy John’s stayed mum on details but confirmed “several” eateries are planned. Autumn could bring opening dates, the company shared. It will release more information nationally in upcoming weeks.

Last year, the chain’s parent company, Inspire Brands LLC, announced it would use a franchise model for a Canadian expansion. Just one Canadian location has launched thus far, in Toronto.

“I think this is a good fit for our local community looking for more restaurants,” said Sijie Sun, a University of Manitoba marketing professor.

He asks his students to choose brands they’d like to bring to Winnipeg for a class project; Jimmy John’s is often mentioned, Sun said.

The Illinois-based company started in 1983 with four sandwich types. It now counts more than 2,000 stores and a slate of choices, including “unwiches,” where buns are swapped for lettuce exteriors.

The Winnipeg market will be competitive, Sun noted: Subway, Firehouse Subs and Tim Hortons are among the big sandwich-selling chains already in town.

“If there’s more options, definitely people try the new one,” Sun said, adding brands create loyal customers.

He’s noticed American-born chains advertising local leadership at their Winnipeg hubs as a U.S.-Canada trade war persists. Grocery stores are labelling Canadian products as shoppers turn from U.S. imports.

Jimmy John’s will likely highlight its own connection with Canada, Sun said.

“I think this is a good fit for our local community looking for more restaurants.”–Sijie Sun

“You almost wonder, is this a good time (to come)?” added Wenlong Yuan, the Stu Clark chair in entrepreneurship and innovation at the U of M. “Are they going to be damaged because of this political issue?”

Arby’s and Freddy’s Frozen Custard & Steakburgers locations opened within the past four months, amid a ‘Buy Canadian’ push. Arby’s ran out of meat on its first day due to demand; Freddy’s was met with great anticipation.

It’s “really hard to tell” whether companies are being stunted by a Canada-first sentiment, Yuan stated.

U.S. chains including Krispy Kreme and Firehouse Subs have arrived in Winnipeg over the past 1.5 years. Winnipeg’s size and diverse population can be a draw for businesses wanting to try operating in Canada, Yuan said.

Franchisees may be locals wanting to bring the brand home or they may have experienced Winnipeg via family and friends.

Inspire Brands tapped Foodtastic Inc., a Canadian franchisor, to expand Jimmy John’s across Canada. Inspire Brands houses labels like Arby’s, Baskin-Robbins, Buffalo Wild Wings and Dunkin’.

Foodtastic counted more than 1,100 restaurants in January 2024 — the month of the deal’s announcement — and $1.1 billion in sales. The Montreal-based company umbrellas Freshii, Second Cup Café and Pita Pit, among others.

Jimmy John’s Toronto location opened in November 2024. In September and October, the chain unrolled in El Salvador and South Korea.

In Winnipeg, it’s taking a former Urban Barn space off Ellice Avenue.

“I think another restaurant always brings in more people to the area,” said Desiree Rafael, an employee at neighbouring Acuity Vision Care. “If they see that there is an optometry practice by where they’re eating, then maybe they’ll be inclined to come get their eyes checked.”

The Jimmy John’s off Pembina Highway replaces a Macao Imperial Tea.

Jimmy John’s wouldn’t comment on whether more Manitoba shops are coming.

Redberry Restaurants, parent company of sandwich brand Jersey Mike’s Subs, said in January 2024 it aimed to open 300 Canadian locations by 2034. Redberry Restaurants didn’t respond to questions about Winnipeg plans by print deadline.

About The New Terminal One

The New Terminal One at John F. Kennedy International Airport is a bold and exciting project to develop a best-in-class international terminal that will serve as an anchor terminal in the Port Authority's $19 billion transformation of JFK into a global gateway to the New York metropolitan area and the United States. The New Terminal One will set a new standard for design and service, aspiring to obtain a Top 5 Skytrax ranking.

The New Terminal One is being built on sites now occupied by Terminal 1 and the former Terminal 2 and Terminal 3, where it will anchor JFK's south side. Construction is taking place in phases with full completion in 2030. The first phase, including the new arrivals and departures halls and first set of 14 new gates, is expected to open in 2026. At completion in 2030, the New Terminal One, with a total of 23 gates, will be 2.6 million square feet, making it the largest terminal at JFK and nearly the same size as LaGuardia Airport's two new terminals combined.

The New Terminal One consortium of labor, operating, and financial partners is led by Ferrovial, JLC Infrastructure, Ullico, and Carlyle. The New Terminal One is being built by union labor and is committed to local inclusion and labor participation, focusing on diversity and capacity-building opportunities, including a commitment to target participation goals of 20% for minority-owned business enterprises, 10% for women-owned business enterprises, 10% for local business enterprises and 3% for service-disabled veteran-owned businesses.

""Enterprises are rapidly adopting Generative AI and Agentic AI to transform their operations end-to-end.

The purchase price of USD $76.50 per share represents a premium of 28% over the average share price in the last 90 days and 17% over the closing price on 3 July 2025. Both firms' boards of directors have unanimously approved the transaction, with closing anticipated by year-end, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.

Strategic rationale

According to Capgemini, the acquisition aligns with a growing trend among enterprises looking to transform end-to-end operations using Generative and Agentic AI, especially within business process services (BPS). The combined entity aims to capitalise on what both businesses describe as a paradigm shift from traditional BPS to intelligent, AI-driven operations.

""Enterprises are rapidly adopting Generative AI and Agentic AI to transform their operations end-to-end. Business Process Services will be the showcase for Agentic AI. Capgemini's acquisition of WNS will provide the Group with the scale and vertical sector expertise to capture that rapidly emerging strategic opportunity created by the paradigm shift from traditional BPS to Agentic AI-powered Intelligent Operations,"" comments Aiman Ezzat, Chief Executive Officer of Capgemini. ""Together we will create a leader in Intelligent Operations, uniquely positioned to support organizations in their AI-powered business process transformation, blending the critical capabilities needed from consulting, technology and platforms to deep process and industry expertise. This will address the client needs for Agentic AI-driven process transformation to deliver efficiency and agility through hyper-automation while achieving superior business outcomes. WNS brings to the Group its high growth, margin accretive and resilient Digital Business Process Services, which is the springboard to Intelligent Operations, while further increasing our exposure to the US market. Immediate cross-selling opportunities will be unlocked through the integration of our complementary offerings and clients. I am looking forward to welcoming the WNS global team to Capgemini.""

Keshav R. Murugesh, Chief Executive Officer of WNS, also highlighted the significance of integrating AI deeper into operational frameworks:

""As a recognized leader in the Digital Business Process Services space, we see the next wave of transformation being driven by intelligent, domain-centric operations that unlock strategic value for our clients. Organizations that have already digitized are now seeking to reimagine their operating models by embedding AI at the core—shifting from automation to autonomy,"" said Murugesh. ""By combining our deep domain and process expertise with Capgemini's global reach, cutting-edge Gen AI and Agentic AI capabilities, a robust partner ecosystem, and advanced technology platforms, we are creating a powerful proposition that accelerates enterprise reinvention. WNS' complementary portfolio of horizontal and industry-specific solutions will significantly enhance Capgemini's rapidly growing Business Services footprint, enabling next-generation, data-driven operations across sectors. Just as importantly, our shared values, cultural alignment, and complementary client relationships ensure a seamless integration—unlocking exciting opportunities for innovation, co-creation, and growth across all stakeholder groups.""

Timothy L. Main, Chairman of the WNS Board of Directors, underscored the transaction as a milestone for WNS and cited the opportunities for both clients and employees.

""WNS and Capgemini share a bold, future-focused vision for Intelligent Operations. I'm confident that Capgemini is the ideal partner at the right time in WNS' journey to extend our capabilities, accelerate innovation, and establish a leadership position in this rapidly evolving market,"" said Main. ""This marks a pivotal chapter in WNS' growth—enhancing the resilience and agility of our clients through advanced AI-driven solutions, creating sustained value for our investors, and opening up new avenues for our employees to thrive within a global technology powerhouse.""

Financial impact and integration

On a financial basis, Capgemini has secured bridge financing totalling EUR €4.0 billion, with plans to refinance through available cash and new debt issuance. The deal is projected to be accretive to Capgemini's normalised earnings per share by 4% prior to synergies in 2026, rising to 7% with synergies by 2027. Revenue synergies are estimated between EUR €100 million and €140 million annually by the end of 2027, while cost and operating model synergies are anticipated to reach EUR €50 million to €70 million per year within the same timeframe.

Combined, the two organisations would have generated EUR €23.3 billion in revenue at a 13.6% operating margin in 2024, based on published information.

Capgemini expects the integration to be smooth, citing both companies' shared values and cultural alignment, as well as Capgemini's record of successful past integrations. The merger will further strengthen Capgemini's global business services, especially in the US market where WNS has a strong presence.

Market context and future outlook

WNS, which reported revenues of USD $1,266 million and an 18.7% operating margin in fiscal year 2025, has focused on providing digital-led BPS solutions to clients in eight industries. The company has achieved approximately 9% constant currency revenue growth on average over the last three fiscal years. Capgemini believes that combining WNS's industry-specific expertise with its own consulting and AI capabilities will allow the enlarged group to support organisations seeking end-to-end transformation through advanced technologies and platforms.

Both companies say the acquisition will enable them to address rapidly-growing demand for AI-driven business process redesign, which is increasingly prioritised by enterprises aiming to improve efficiency, agility and business outcomes. With market analysts and Capgemini's clients reportedly recognising the group's leadership in AI and business transformation, the acquisition of WNS is expected to reinforce Capgemini's role as a partner to organisations on similar transformation journeys.",https://channellife.com.au/uploads/story/2025/07/08/compatible_business-professionals-shaking-hands-ai-integration-corporate-acquisition-illustration.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 01:58:20.083774

""You created a movement,"" the post said. ""A movement so powerful that you finally won.""

According to McDonald's, the revamped Snack Wrap includes one of the chain's new McCrispy Strips, which hit menus in May. In the wrap, the strip is topped with shredded lettuce and shredded cheese, and wrapped in a flour tortilla.

According to the Affluent Consumer Research Company’s May luxury tracking survey, luxury consumer fatigue is measurable.
Yet, there remains a lack of enthusiasm and emotional draw for affluent consumers.” Note: I am professionally affiliated with ACRC.
These insights require luxury goods brands to reframe their value proposition above the price-value relationship toward a return on worth.
Pamela N. Danziger is an internationally recognized expert specializing in consumer insights for marketers targeting the affluent consumer segment.","The personal luxury goods market faces a decline of up to 5% this year as consumer enthusiasm wanes, according to the latest projections from Bain and Company in association with Altagamma.

Not since the 2008-2009 financial crisis has the luxury market experienced such a significant contraction, except for the 2020 Covid pandemic.

Besides the obvious flashpoints creating uncertainty in the market, including rising geopolitical tensions, currency fluctuations and volatile economic pressures, luxury consumers are disillusioned by the industry’s offerings, particularly after post-pandemic price increases threw a monkey wrench into brands’ traditional price-value relationship.

“There’s a sense of emotional detachment, even among the wealthy, who can’t explain why the same bag that cost $1,200 before now costs $2,000 – prices are too high for such a low level of creativity,” Bain’s senior partner Federica Levato shared with me. “The disillusionment and detachment we talk about is particularly noted among younger consumers.”

Bain’s Macro Overview

Rising luxury consumer detachment was reflected last year, as the luxury market declined 1% at current exchange rates to $418 billion (€364 billion) – or remained flat at constant rates. Yet, most telling was that the luxury market lost some 50 million customers over the last two years. Today, the estimated number of luxury consumers worldwide is approximately 353 million, down from 400 million in 2022.

“This is true alienation, meaning many people are just not buying anymore,” she observed, adding that engagement with luxury brands across all demographics, not just the younger aspirational cohort, has declined since 2022.

Brand-related searches and engagement rates are down more than 40% and social media follower growth has plummeted by 90% – “largely due to price fatigue and stagnant creativity.”

Creative Churn

For an industry that thrives on artistic creativity, the growing churn in luxury brand senior executives and creative directors is taking its toll. Consumers may not be aware of what’s going on behind the curtain, but they see it in the stores and the brands ultimately feel it on their top and bottom line.

“While companies are waiting for a new creative director to introduce a new collection, it can take nine months to a year for the transition – like giving birth to a baby,” Levato explained. “Consumers may not know about the shifts, but they see it when no new products arrive and the brands are totally silent during the transition.”

And she added, “Then there’s also a 50% probability that the new collection doesn’t work, as has been the case for some brands in the recent past.”

Profit Pressure

All this is sinking to luxury brands’ bottom line. Bain notes that since 2021, margins (defined by earnings before interest and taxes) have either stagnated or declined, even among top industry performers, and margins are expected to erode further in 2025.

“All the macroeconomic uncertainties, tariffs, lower traffic, fewer new products – over 70% of luxury brands are pulling back volume from multi-brand retail platforms – have an impact on the topline, but have a more than proportional impact on the bottom line and on the EBIT,” Levato said.

“The message is to some extent is positive because brands are not hitting the brakes on investments in technology, marketing, clienteling and stores, but they still must absorb the costs,” she continued, adding further price increases are probably off the table in the current environment.

Global Luxury Reset

Saying the luxury market faces “far-reaching disruptions,” the Bain report also stresses the industry’s proven resiliency, yet Levato stresses industry players can’t rest on their laurels.

“As the industry faces an increasingly complex global landscape, luxury brands are entering a pivotal new chapter – one that demands sharper focus, greater cultural relevance, and growth rooted in purpose.

“At the heart of this transformation is a redefinition of value and meaning that resonates across all generations – with those shaping luxury today, and those who will define it tomorrow,” she observed.

U.S. Luxury Consumers On Hold

Because the U.S. is the world’s richest market – last year 1,000 new millionaires were minted here each day, totaling nearly 400,000, and more than half of all new millionaires globally – and the largest personal luxury market by far – the Americas totaled about $115 billion last year with the lion’s share in the U.S., compared to $51 billion in Mainland China – what happens here will have a profound impact on the global personal luxury market overall.

According to the Affluent Consumer Research Company’s May luxury tracking survey, luxury consumer fatigue is measurable. Specifically, 52% of the roughly 200 affluent Americans with incomes of $250,000 and above reported being disappointed with luxury options, and 46% were unable to justify new purchases.

But most telling is that among those affluents who tend to opt for the luxury option most often, 55% said they’re bidding their time, and the same 55% share signaled that the available options simply do not move them.

“Purchase hesitation isn’t one-size-fits-all,” observed ACRC’s founder and CEO Chandler Mount. “At the top of the market, it’s not about affordability – it’s about emotional resonance. They’re bidding their time, a signal of flexibility, not resistance. Yet, there remains a lack of enthusiasm and emotional draw for affluent consumers.” Note: I am professionally affiliated with ACRC.

While Americans wait for luxury goods brands to present more compelling options, Bain reports that the luxury experiences market, including hospitality, fine dining, cruising and private jets, is “flourishing,” as consumers prioritize meaningful experiences over goods, particularly among older consumers, where wealth tends to accumulate.

Personal Transformation Is The Goal, Not More Stuff

At its core, luxury is a cultural construct rooted in personal meaning, social status, and an expression of self-worth. While owning an abundance of luxury goods can confer some of those advantages, increasingly affluent and high-net-worth individuals are turning luxury expression inward toward personal growth and well-being.

This cultural shift in consumer consciousness has profound implications for the goods side of the luxury market. “This isn’t a trend – it’s a complete reconstruction of how success is defined by the world’s most affluent and influential consumers,” said Mark Miller, chief strategy officer at Publicis Groupe’s Team One agency. “It’s a shift from building high-net-worth to pursuing high-life-worth.”

He was speaking about Team One’s latest study entitled “Worth Beyond Wealth,” based upon research among its exclusive Global Affluent Collective. The collective represents the top 10% of global earnings across 22 countries and totals some 4,200 consumers aged 25 and above.

“The most provocative finding is how they’ve moved beyond asking ‘What do I own?’ to ‘Who am I becoming?’ This transformation demands an entirely new approach from premium brands,” he continued.

Emerging Values

Findings that popped in the study, which combined both qualitative and quantitative research, include:

Prioritizing emotional fulfillment and human connection through key life moments defined by meaningful connections (89%) and relationships that elevate their lives (90%).

Pursuit of growth and discovery with continuous learning their ultimate luxury (95%) and 75% defining personal growth as life’s most significant moments.

Belief that status is earned through being knowledgeable and respected rather than through possessions (88%).

This shift toward pursuit of high-life-worth through meaningful experiences requires luxury goods brands adapt to a new “return on worth” price-value framework. Miller described this as a selective abundance approach, where people with means will spend abundantly on things that have special worth and save abundantly, i.e. trade down, in purchases that are substitutable or replaceable.

“There’s a strong need in this world of selective abundance for luxury goods brands to not just make things that are functionally excellent – consumers will know the difference – but to offer a value proposition that goes above and beyond the functional things they make,” he explained, stressing the need for greater high-life-worth storytelling, rather than relying on product features, benefits, brand heritage, design and quality.

“Luxury is no longer only about having exceptional things – it’s about integrating excellence with impact. The best premium brands won’t just sell luxury – they’ll help architect high-worth lives,” shared Tahni Candelaria, Team One’s director of cultural anthropology.

Miller added, “Luxury isn’t just about possessions anymore. It’s about acquiring the learning and relationships to become a more evolved version of who I aspire to be over time.”

Value Beyond Money

While the Bain study acknowledges some of this – “Across generations, drivers linked with self-reward, status, personal identity and the celebration of achievements will continue to drive engagement, reinforcing and building the lasting relevance of luxury with the consumers’ lives,” Claudia D’Arpizio said in a statement – Team One’s perspective pushes the concepts of luxury as self-reward, status, personal identity and celebrating achievements further toward value beyond what money can buy.

These insights require luxury goods brands to reframe their value proposition above the price-value relationship toward a return on worth. “The notion of worth is becoming far more dominant in how affluent consumers express themselves. Luxury consumption is becoming more conscious, purposeful, meaningful and impactful with a long-tail orientation that looks to the future, not to the past,” Miller concluded.

Less than two years ago, BermudAir launched service between Bermuda and Boston, with a fleet of two ex-Flybe Embraer E175 jets. The carrier now serves 10 destinations across the U.S. east coast, operating two E175s and two E190s.

The Bermudan carrier has since announced the launch of its subsidiary carrier, AnguillAir, which will operate seasonal flights from Anguilla (AXA) to both Baltimore (BWI) and Boston (BOS). Flights will operate twice weekly, starting on December 19 and 20, 2025, respectively. The winter service is expected to wrap up in early April 2026.

AnguillAir will have their own branded aircraft and respective marketing identity, but will still be part of BermudAir’s operations, rather than operating entirely as a separate airline. I’m no expert at aviation law, but I suspect it might be easier for them to keep operations streamlined, and maybe the fact that both Anguilla and Bermuda being U.K. overseas territories might make it easier for them to climb any regulatory hurdles.

“This is more than a new route – it’s a reflection of what BermudAir was built to do: strengthen island connections, deliver extraordinary service, and create lasting economic value for Bermuda and beyond,” said Adam Scott, Founder and CEO of BermudAir. “We’re proud that, because of the support of Bermudians and the growth in tourism demand, we are now able to extend our reach and share our island hospitality with Anguilla.”

On the flip side, BermudAir also announced that its Providence (PVD) and Ft. Lauderdale (FLL) flights will be suspended. It’s unclear if they will return to PVD, but plan to resume Ft. Lauderdale service only in the winter periods.

While Anguilla currently has some connectivity throughout the Caribbean, they only have two daily flights between the island and Miami (MIA), Florida. This will be a great boost for Anguilla’s travel market, but could also open the possibility of offering more non-U.S. connectivity to Anguilla in the long run.

It’s not clear either if they plan to acquire more aircraft, or if they will rebrand one of their current BermudAir jets for the period.",https://www.gatechecked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bermudair-embraer-e175.jpeg,N,,2025-07-07 21:01:12.338731

Capgemini and WNS already dabble in intelligent operations.
Capgemini offers consulting-led transformation of business processes, advanced AI tools and BPS platforms, while WNS has built a number of industry-specific BPS offerings.
“The key driver is less to do with the tools and software, but rather the access to business process operations expertise that WNS brings to the table,” Ranjan told Computerworld.","French technology consulting services giant Capgemini SE said today it has agreed to buy the Indian business process automation firm WNS Holdings Ltd. in a $3.3 billion cash deal, as part of an effort to expand the range of artificial intelligence tools it can offer to customers.

The acquisition will enable Capgemini to create a consulting service that’s focused on helping companies boost business process and cost efficiency through the use of generative AI and agentic AI technology.

Capgemini said it’s buying WNS for $76.50 per share, which represents a 17% premium over its last closing price on July 3. The deal does not include WNS’ financial debt.

WNS, which is based in India and specializes in business process outsourcing and data analytics, will bring its “high growth, margin accretive and resilient Digital Business Process Services while further increasing our exposure to the U.S. market,” said Capgemini Chief Executive Aiman Ezzat.

WNS counts major customers including Coca-Cola Co., T-Mobile USA Inc. and United Airlines Inc. When the acquisition closes, it’s expected to position Capgemini as a leader in digital business process services, blending WNS’ horizontal and vertical expertise with a global footprint. The two companies generated combined revenues in digital BPS of more than $1.9 billion.

One of the largest opportunities for companies to create value with generative AI and AI agents is said to be in the redesign of business processes and operations. This is likely to attract a significant amount of AI investment budgets, as the technology promises to transform organizations into AI-powered companies with dramatically increased productivity through a new type of service known as intelligent operations.

Intelligent operations is a consulting-led approach that aims to transform horizontal and vertical business processes with AI agents and generative AI, seeking to improve companies’ efficiency, speed and agility and improve business outcomes through process automation.

Capgemini and WNS already dabble in intelligent operations. Capgemini offers consulting-led transformation of business processes, advanced AI tools and BPS platforms, while WNS has built a number of industry-specific BPS offerings.

Capgemini said the addition of WNS will act like a catalyst, transforming it into an intelligent operations leader, with both the required scale and unique capabilities ranging from strategy and transformation to horizontal and vertical sector expertise.

“The mix of WNS and Capgemini’s complementary offerings and clients will immediately unlock cross-selling opportunities,” Ezzat said in a statement. “It will also lay down the foundations to build the capabilities to seize the Intelligent Operations strategic market opportunity.”

Forrester Research Inc. analyst Charlie Dai told Computerworld that hybrid automation and agentic AI will be major priorities for enterprise decision makers in the next three years. He said WNS’s domain-specific AI agents and platforms such as its AI.Agentic suite and WNS Expirus will substantially improve Capgemini’s own agent-focused BPS offerings.

There’s also a strategic angle to the acquisition, said Everest Group Managing Partner Rajesh Ranjan. He pointed out that agentic AI is still a nascent technology, and that most implementations up until now are pilot projects.

“The key driver is less to do with the tools and software, but rather the access to business process operations expertise that WNS brings to the table,” Ranjan told Computerworld. “This is a pre-requisite to develop and deploy real-world AI solutions.”

Capgemini said it expects the acquisition to be finalized by the end of the year, adding that it will be immediately accretive to both its revenue and its operating margin.

The markets didn’t react too kindly to the news, though. Capgemini’s stock fell 5% on Europe’s benchmark STOXX 600 index, as analysts from Morgan Stanley warned that the acquisition would have a negative effect on its balance sheet flexibility, without adding any significant revenue boost.

Franklin St. Starbucks voted 14-1 in favor of unionization, joining Starbucks Workers United, a national worker-led unionizing effort.
Store employees have also dealt with numerous safety issues.
“Our store is considered a high incidence store,” Washburne said.
So, the manager took it to Starbucks corporate, which resulted in security guards being temporarily implemented at the store, Washburne said.
The security guards were phased out after a few months and are no longer stationed at the store, Washburne said.","On June 30, workers at the 100 E. Franklin St. Starbucks voted 14-1 in favor of unionization, joining Starbucks Workers United, a national worker-led unionizing effort.

Earlier in June, the store’s baristas and shift supervisors sent a letter to upper management stating their intent to unionize, and they later read the letter aloud to the store manager and customers.

“We are not writing to ask for favors,” the letter said. “We are writing to demand dignity.”

The letter, addressed to Brian Niccol, Starbucks’ CEO, discussed the workers’ reasons for unionization, including reduced raises, unsustainable workloads and unsafe working conditions..

Unionization had been discussed previously without coming to fruition, Alexandria Washburne, a shift supervisor who has worked for Starbucks for six years, said. What specifically prompted this petition was a discussion with the store’s manager regarding availability, she said.

“[The store manager] told us in a shift meeting that we would either open our availability for one day — open-to-close Saturday or Sunday — or we could demote ourselves or we could transfer to a store that could accommodate our availability,” Washburne said.

Matthew Wynne, a shift supervisor who has worked for Starbucks for six years, said he had his availability and time-off requests denied several times in a row, an experience shared by multiple baristas at the store.

Store employees have also dealt with numerous safety issues. Wynne said that the store has called the police more than 100 times in the past year.

“Our store is considered a high incidence store,” Washburne said. “That's what they call it in the Starbucks language, meaning we have a lot of, I guess, ‘incidents,’ quote, unquote, that occur in the store.”

Employees said they have seen a man choking a woman outside the store, faced harassment from customers and witnessed someone stabbing a person’s hand with a pen in the store.

In response to the stabbing, the store’s previous manager asked the district manager to implement security guards. The district manager denied the request, Wynne said. So, the manager took it to Starbucks corporate, which resulted in security guards being temporarily implemented at the store, Washburne said.

The security guards were phased out after a few months and are no longer stationed at the store, Washburne said. She said employees received no communication from management regarding the guards’ removal.

“It just makes you feel unsafe to be at work in those situations,” Washburne said. “We're supposed to be making lattes, not breaking up fights.”

Ethan Gulledge, a barista at the Starbucks, said the policies of the Back to Starbucks plan — a corporate plan emphasizing policies like a dress code and writing on cups in order to revitalize the chain — have led to more upset customers.

“With this new policy of asking everybody if they've made a purchase to get the free water, people don't necessarily respond well to that when they're used to getting free water,” Gulledge said.

Gulledge said these policies are not feasible when the store experiences a high volume of customers, which can reach up to 160 people in half an hour.

The union prevents Starbucks from firing employees for union-related activities and secures employees’ right to collective bargaining and having union representatives.

“Any conversation that's going to have the result of disciplinary action, we have the right to have a representative there to bargain or argue for us,” Gulledge said.

Starbucks has not discussed the union’s contract in good faith, and a contract will not be signed until the company does so, Wynne said. Employees will not have to pay dues until a contract is signed, he said.

“This win shows that when partners come together and speak up, we can't be ignored,” Wynne said. “We didn't vote for this union just to make noise. We voted because we're tired of being mistreated and left out of the decisions that affect our lives in our day-to-day workplace.”

Murugesh echoed the sentiment, noting the shift from automation to autonomy as clients seek to embed AI into their operating models.

To finance the deal, Capgemini has secured bridge financing of euro 4 billion, covering the purchase price, WNS’s gross debt, and the redemption of a euro 0.8 billion bond due in June 2025. It plans to refinance the bridge through a mix of existing cash and new debt issuance.

Both companies emphasized their cultural alignment and history of successful integrations, which they believe will ensure a smooth transition. The deal is set to create a global leader in Digital BPS, uniquely positioned to support enterprises in their transformation into AI-powered businesses.

“As a recognized leader in the Digital Business Process Services space, we see the next wave of transformation being driven by intelligent, domain-centric operations that unlock strategic value for our clients. Organizations that have already digitized are now seeking to reimagine their operating models by embedding AI at the core—shifting from automation to autonomy,” said Keshav R. Murugesh, Chief Executive Officer of WNS.

WNS in India

Established by British Airways in Mumbai in 1996, WNS (Holdings) Ltd has grown into a major player in the global business process management (BPM) space, with India serving as the cornerstone of its operations. Headquartered in Vikhroli, Mumbai, WNS’s Indian presence spans 25 delivery centres across the country and employs close to 40,000 professionals. These centres blend large-scale transaction processing with high-value, domain-specific services through dedicated centres of excellence, making India integral to WNS’s global delivery strategy.

India contributes more than 50 per cent of WNS’s global revenue, highlighting its critical role in the company’s worldwide footprint. Key Indian cities such as Mumbai, Pune, Noida, Chennai, Bengaluru, Gurugram, Indore, Nashik, Visakhapatnam (Vizag), and Hyderabad host its major operations.

In March 2024, WNS significantly expanded in Hyderabad, opening a 60,000-square-foot facility in Nanakramguda. The centre, designed to support digital transformation for sectors including shipping and logistics, healthcare, BFSI, and high-tech, employs around 1,400 people and operates in multiple shifts.

The Vizag delivery centre exemplifies WNS’s rapid growth in India. From fewer than 50 employees in 2012, the centre now houses over 3,300 staff, more than 2,000 of whom were added in just the past two years. It provides digital-first BPM services tailored to specific industries.

WNS’s Indian operations also include centres of excellence in key domains such as analytics, insurance, banking, finance and accounting, healthcare, travel, and logistics. This domain-led, technology-enabled model reinforces India’s role as the heart of WNS’s global service delivery engine.

French IT services firm Capgemini, which has more than half of its 3.4 lakh employees in India, is acquiring one of the country's business process management (BPM) pioneers, WNS, for $3.3 billion. The move is seen as an attempt to bring strong technology expertise, especially AI, into BPM services to be able to offer enterprises much more comprehensive solutions. This acquisition comes a decade after Capgemini acquired Igate, another India-based IT company, for $4 billion. The WNS deal underscores India's growing importance in Capgemini's global strategy. Over 44,000 of WNS' 65,000 employees are based in India. WNS, founded in 1996 and listed on NYSE, counts United Airlines, Aviva, M&T Bank, Centrica and McCain Foods among its key customers.

"" WNS has delivered an average constant currency revenue growth of over 9% over the past three fiscal years, reaching $1.2 billion in revenue in the 2025 financial year with an operating margin of 18.7%.

Looper Textile has been operational since 2023, but is ready to work on an industrial scale and process up to 150 million garments per year and send them for reuse and recycling.

The company is headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, and operates through three sorting facilities in Europe-two in Germany, in Hamburg and Polch, and one in Poland in Pila.

Garments are sorted into more than 200 categories, based on material and type of product. In 2023, Looper helped extend the useful life of more than 40 million garments. By 2024, the number has risen to more than 72 million garments, of which 65% are destined for reuse, 25% are sent for recycling, and less than 10% disposed of responsibly due to contamination.

“The need for textile collection and sorting solutions has never been more urgent, and Looper is uniquely positioned to generate concrete change,” says Erik Lagerblad, CEO, Looper Textile Co.

""Used textiles represent one of the largest material flows in the world. That's why we rely on digital solutions and our experience in the circular economy to efficiently coordinate the volumes collected. With an operational capacity of up to 150 million garments per year, Looper Textile stands as a key player in the sustainable management of textile streams globally. Together, we want to bring the sustainable use of textiles into the future,"" said Simon Bodmer, head of the Logistics Department at Remondis Recycling GmbH & Co. KG.

Among the services offered to support the initiative, the Rhenus Group provides advanced logistics solutions and services such as centralized coordination of transportation flows, end-to-end supply chain visibility, and implementation of a 4PL digital Control Tower, custom-designed to meet the specific needs of circular textile logistics.

The system was custom-designed to meet the specific needs of the circular economy, making it possible to reuse and recycle textiles through smooth coordination among all stakeholders.

“Our 4PL Control Tower provides a central platform for the integrated and coordinated management of all logistics activities, increasing visibility along the entire value chain,” explains Chris Gerfertz, managing global director, Rhenus 4PL Solutions.

Looper has also started a pilot line for automated sorting based on optical and infrared sensor technologies to meet the increasingly precise requirements of textile-to-textile recycling.

The Rhenus Group is a global logistics specialist, with annual sales of €8.2 billion. It has more than 41,000 active employees in 1,330 locations in more than 70 countries, and develops innovative solutions along the entire supply chain including activities such as transportation, warehousing, customs clearance or value-added services.

The company made the “difficult decision” to withdraw from several of its service areas as it prioritized its financial turnaround, the company said in a July 7 statement.

“Like health plans across the nation, UCare has experienced significant losses in Medicaid because of a payment mismatch between the government payments we receive and the rising cost of care among our members,” the insurer said.

UCare reported an operating loss of $504 million in 2024, amid rising costs in its Medicare Advantage and Medicaid businesses.

The county exits will affect 88,000 Medicaid beneficiaries, the Minnesota Star-Tribune reported July 7. Each county UCare is exiting has at least two other health plan options, the company told Becker’s. UCare’s service area for its Medicaid plans for older adults and people with disabilities remains unchanged.
