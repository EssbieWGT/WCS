On 8 January 2026, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) announced that it will return £400,000 to nine victims of a global email fraud dating back more than two decades. The move, achieved through a civil recovery order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA), highlights an innovative use of the SFO's powers: enabling victim compensation, rather than remittance to HM Treasury, and deploying flexible legal tools where prosecution is impracticable.

A novel route to restitution

The fraud, orchestrated by Abdallah Ali Jammal between 2001 and 2002, was essentially an advance fee fraud and involved unsolicited emails promising commissions for helping release funds from overseas accounts. Some £4.4 million was stolen from 18 individuals worldwide. Jammal fled before he could be charged and is believed to remain in Lebanon.

Investigators froze assets during the original probe, including funds linked to Jammal Trust Bank; a bank later liquidated after US sanctions were imposed for its links to a terrorist organisation. With no realistic prospect of a criminal conviction, the SFO applied to the High Court on behalf of the victims for a declaration that the money was recoverable property under section 281 POCA.

Under this section, if certain statutory conditions are met – namely that the applicant was deprived of the property by unlawful conduct, the property was not recoverable property immediately before they were deprived of it, and the property belongs to the applicant – the court may declare the property as belonging to the victim. The ruling, obtained in 2023, enabled the SFO to redirect frozen funds to victims rather than HM Treasury. This approach was appropriate as the victims could establish a proprietary claim to funds traceable to their losses, rather than the funds being treated as general criminal assets to be forfeited to the state. It also avoided the complexities associated with criminal prosecution, particularly where the perpetrator remains outside UK jurisdiction.

This is the first time that the SFO has used POCA in this way, and their announcement states that they will “now seek to use this technique across other relevant cases.”

How does this fit with the SFO's wider posture?

This novel method of enforcement illustrates two themes running through the SFO's 2024-29 Strategy and 2025-26 Business Plan: a commitment to international partnership and a willingness to use every tool available to deliver tangible outcomes. The latter has been a strategic focus of Nick Ephgrave since he became Director of the SFO. In his first speech as Director in February 2024, Ephgrave emphasised the need for innovative investigative techniques and a results-driven approach.

In this case, tracing and verifying victim accounts required multi-agency cooperation. The SFO worked with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Australian Federal Police, Belgian Police, the French Liaison Magistrate and the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office to locate the victims and secure their consent for the action. This level of collaboration highlights the complexity of cross-border fraud cases and reflects the SFO's ambition to be “the partner of choice both domestically and internationally”.

More broadly, the restitution move aligns with a discernible shift in the SFO's approach: flexibility, pragmatism, and victim-centric outcomes. Historically, the agency's enforcement model has been criticised for lengthy timelines and limited visible impact. Recent developments, however, suggest a recalibration.

In 2025, the SFO secured its first Unexplained Wealth Order and executed coordinated dawn raids in connection with its investigation into Basis Markets, signalling a more assertive use of powers and a determination to accelerate case progression. The agency also issued new guidance on cooperation and enforcement, introducing a presumption in favour of Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPAs) for corporates that self-report and cooperate fully, alongside commitments to faster timelines.

The restitution initiative now adds a third dimension to this evolving approach: prioritising victim compensation even where criminal prosecution is not viable. Taken together, these developments point to a pragmatic enforcement model that combines speed, partnership, and tangible outcomes, reshaping expectations of how the SFO will deploy its powers in the years ahead.

Practical implications for corporates

Expect civil recovery to feature more often where prosecution is impractical, with implications for disclosure and asset-tracing support.

Victim compensation is now a priority in enforcement outcomes and may influence DPA negotiations.

Cross-border readiness matters: multi-agency cooperation brings accelerated timelines and complex data requests.

Legacy risks can persist: old issues can resurface if money was frozen at the time – or if it can still be traced.

Conclusion

The SFO's return of £400,000 to victims is more than a one-off. It signals a broader shift toward flexible enforcement, international collaboration, and victim-centric outcomes. For corporates, that means recalibrating expectations and readiness for an enforcement landscape where civil recovery and international partnership are firmly part of the toolkit.

I'm your host, Arnold Davick, reporting from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Here are the top IT stories you need to know for Wednesday, January 21st.

Up first, Google just launched a new AI shopping standard called the Universal Commerce Protocol, or UCP. It's an open standard that enables different AI agents, payment systems and stores to collaborate through a common language with partners like Shopify, Etsy, Walmart and Target and payment giant Visa and MasterCard.

UCP aims to make checkout frictionless. Soon, instant checkout could be coming to AI mode in search and the Gemini app. The big change is fewer redirects and less tab hopping. From CIO, IBM is stepping up its push into sovereign computing with Sovereign Core.

It is a software stack designed to run across multiple cloud platforms, not just one provider's environment. Sovereign deployments typically try to combine cloud benefits with strategic autonomy. The focus is on keeping data encryption keys and access policies under local authority.

Meanwhile, applications would still move between on prem systems, regional partners and major clouds. IBM is also emphasizing continuous compliance and support for sovereign AI as regulations tightening. And from CSO Online, the World Economic Forum warns cyber risk is accelerating in 2026 and AI is a major driver.

The widespread integration of AI systems adds an expanded attack surface that creates novel vulnerabilities that traditional security controls were not designed to address. Attackers can scale phishing fraud and exploit supply chain weak spots faster.

Ophthalmic device business BVI has named former Insulet CEO Jim Hollingshead as its next leader, the company said Monday.

Hollingshead led Insulet, which sells the Omnipod insulin pump, for three years before resigning in 2025. Ashley McEvoy, the former head of Johnson & Johnson’s medtech business, replaced Hollingshead.

Hollingshead will now replace Shervin Korangy as CEO of BVI. The change in leadership comes after BVI raised $1 billion in capital last year. BVI is using the money to accelerate product innovation and expand its global footprint.

RoundTable Healthcare Partners created BVI, which was originally called Beaver-Visitec International, by rolling up ophthalmology products acquired from Aspen Surgical, BD and Medtronic. The private equity firm acquired Aspen in 2006 and combined its ophthalmology business with eye disease assets bought from BD and Medtronic in 2010.

Hershey’s was founded in 1894 — and has been a chocolate favorite for 132 years.

The company, which relied on in-store displays for decades, shifted to media ads in 1970 to confront competition. Brand campaigns have been intermittent — “Hershey. It’s Your Happy Place” — is the first since 2018.

The new work launches with five U.S. Winter Olympic and Paralympic athletes and their families ahead of the 2026 Winter Olympic (Feb. 6) and Paralympic Games (March 6). The athletes are Brenna Huckaby, parasnowboarding, Erin Jackson, speedskaking, Hilary Knight, ice hockey, Jason Brown, figure skating, and Jordan Stolz, speedskating.

Two spots are here and here.

IPG's The Martin Agency is producing creative throughout the year, with various social and digital executions. The spots position Hershey's as a familiar source of happiness. MiltonONE is a dedicated team formed by Publicis Groupe specifically to handle U.S. media for The Hershey Company. Digitas, part of that team, handles integrated media.

""It’s actually a pretty bold statement to say you exist as a brand to make people happy, and it’s refreshing to help make work that’s able to follow through. Also, I definitely didn’t cry on set. My eyes just got really watery for some reason,"" Patrick Wells, associate creative director, The Martin Agency, told Agency Daily.

Jerry Hoak, Chief Creative Officer at The Martin Agency, added: ""The Opening Ceremony of the Olympics is the perfect place to launch a new brand platform for one of America’s most storied brands.

She then went back in 2012 as part of Expedition 32/33 and became the space station commander for Expedition 33.
Williams had 608 days in space, the second-longest cumulative time in space by a NASA astronaut.
She has done something that no one else has: run a marathon in space, NASA said.
She was the director of Operations in Star City, Russia, and established a helicopter training platform to help future astronauts for moon missions, NASA said.","Suni Williams, one of the NASA astronauts whose trip to the International Space Station was extended from days to months, has retired from the agency.

NASA announced her retirement, saying that it was effective on Dec. 27, 2025.

“Suni Williams has been a trailblazer in human spaceflight, shaping the future of exploration through her leadership aboard the space station and paving the way for commercial missions to low Earth orbit,” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in a news release. “Her work advancing science and technology has laid the foundation for Artemis missions to the Moon and advancing toward Mars, and her extraordinary achievements will continue to inspire generations to dream big and push the boundaries of what’s possible. Congratulations on your well-deserved retirement, and thank you for your service to NASA and our nation.”

Williams is originally from Needham, Massachusetts, and has a bachelor’s degree in physical science from the U.S. Naval Academy.

She earned a master’s degree in engineering management from Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, Florida.

The retired Navy captain is also a helicopter pilot and fixed-wing pilot, logging more than 4,000 flight hours in 40 different aircraft, NASA said.

But space is her place.

“Anyone who knows me knows that space is my absolute favorite place to be,” Williams said in the announcement. “It’s been an incredible honor to have served in the Astronaut Office and have had the opportunity to fly in space three times. I had an amazing 27-year career at NASA, and that is mainly because of all the wonderful love and support I’ve received from my colleagues. The International Space Station, the people, the engineering, and the science are truly awe-inspiring and have made the next steps of exploration to the Moon and Mars possible.

Williams first went into space on the shuttle Discovery in 2006 and returned on the shuttle Atlantis. She then went back in 2012 as part of Expedition 32/33 and became the space station commander for Expedition 33.

Williams had 608 days in space, the second-longest cumulative time in space by a NASA astronaut.

She also performed the sixth-longest single spaceflight by an American. Williams and is tied with Butch Wilmore. Both were on the Boeing Starliner as part of a test mission and then returned to Earth as part of SpaceX Crew-9 in March 2025, after there were issues with the Starliner, which kept the pair on the ISS for 286 days.

Williams also completed nine spacewalks for 62 hours and six minutes, the longest amount of time for a female astronaut and the fourth most cumulative hours.

She has done something that no one else has: run a marathon in space, NASA said.

Williams didn’t just contribute to NASA with her trips into space. She was part of the NEEMO crew, or NASA Extreme Environments Mission Operations, living for nine days in an underwater habitat.

She was the director of Operations in Star City, Russia, and established a helicopter training platform to help future astronauts for moon missions, NASA said.

For a profitable company, the P/E ratio is a straightforward way to gauge how much investors are paying for each dollar of earnings, which makes it a useful cross check against a DCF model.

What counts as a “normal” P/E depends a lot on how fast earnings are expected to grow and how risky those earnings are. Higher growth and lower perceived risk can justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty usually calls for a lower one.

Eli Lilly currently trades on a P/E of 50.64x. That compares with a Pharmaceuticals industry average P/E of 20.49x and a peer average of 17.07x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Eli Lilly is 42.00x, which is its proprietary estimate of a suitable P/E given factors such as earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk profile. This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple comparison to peers or the industry, because it adjusts for company specific characteristics rather than assuming all firms deserve similar multiples. On this basis, Eli Lilly’s current P/E sits above its Fair Ratio, which points to the shares looking expensive on earnings.

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Eli Lilly Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simply your story about Eli Lilly linked directly to your own numbers for future revenue, earnings, margins and a fair value estimate. A Narrative starts with how you see the company, turns that story into a financial forecast, then ties that forecast to a fair value you can compare with the current share price to help you decide whether the stock looks attractive or stretched for your goals. On Simply Wall St, Narratives sit inside the Community page, where millions of investors share and refine these story plus numbers views in an accessible format you can copy, adjust and make your own. Each Narrative automatically refreshes its fair value when new information arrives, such as news or earnings, so your view stays aligned with the latest data rather than a static spreadsheet. For Eli Lilly, one investor might set a relatively high fair value based on optimistic assumptions about future margins while another might choose a lower fair value with more cautious expectations, and you can see both side by side.

JNJ shares were down more than 1% to $215.15 apiece in morning trading. The S&P 500 was up slightly.

For the quarter that ended Dec. 28, 2025, Johnson & Johnson earned $5.1 billion, or $2.10 per share, off of $24.6 billion in sales. The bottom line was up 49.1%, and the top line was up 9.1% compared with Q4 2024.

Adjusted to exclude one-time items, J&J had earnings of $2.46 per share, matching the Wall Street consensus. Revenue beat analysts’ expectations of $24.15 billion.

“2025 was a catapult year for Johnson & Johnson, fueled by the strongest portfolio and pipeline in our history” CEO Joaquin Duato said in a news release.

“Last year kicked off a new era of accelerated growth, driven by medical innovation that is transforming lives in our six key businesses: Oncology, Immunology, Neuroscience, Cardiovascular, Surgery, and Vision. In each of these important areas, our leadership is expanding driven by game-changing science and technology.”

In the fourth quarter, J&J Innovation Medicine segment sales were up 10.0% (6.2% adjusted operational) to $15.8 billion, while MedTech segment sales were up 7.5% (5.9% adjusted operational) to $8.8 billion.

MedTech growth was mostly primarily by electrophysiology products and Abiomed heart pumps in Cardiovascular and wound closure products in General Surgery.

M&A has fueled Johnson & Johnson MedTech’s growth in recent years. Those deals include the $13.1 billion purchase in 2024 of Shockwave Medical and its intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) technology that uses sonic waves to treat calcified arterial plaque. J&J continues to report positive data on Shockwave technology. The Shockwave purchase followed J&J’s $400 million acquisition of left atrial appendage (LAA) device maker Laminar in 2023 and the $16.6 billion purchase of Abiomed and its catheter-delivered Impella heart pumps to treat heart failure in 2022.

Summary

IREN Limited has executed a successful AI pivot, outperforming peers like MARA Holdings and positioning itself as a leading data center provider. It is a first mover, like Nvidia in 2021.

My DCF-based valuation model suggests IREN is worth $80–$580 per share, with a current price near $55 presenting a compelling entry point.

IREN's upside depends on scaling data center capacity, prudent capital allocation, and sustained AI demand; risks include overleveraging and a potential slowdown in AI.

I assign IREN stock a Buy rating, viewing it as a relatively safe investment rather than an asymmetric bet, given current market expectations.

MARA may outperform IREN going forward, but I find IREN's investment case more compelling today. I entered a position in the stock and partially reallocated from MARA.

Throughout 2025, I made the mistake of stubbornly focusing on MARA Holdings (MARA) as an asymmetric AI bet. My fundamental investment thesis was not incorrect: moving data center capacity from Bitcoin (

Decoding markets beyond P/E. As an investor, I either put my money into low cost funds or in single stocks that (I think) are asymmetric bets. My portfolio is roughly 50/50 between the two. I like to write about Macro and Fundamentals, with the (painful) awareness that Momentum and Sentiment are what really matters. That’s why I never try to time the market and I only buy stocks if I am willing to hold them for at least 10 years.When it comes to fundamentals, everybody knows the market is forward looking, but few understand what that means. I don’t look at a P/E number and decide to buy if a stock is “cheap”. I see markets as literally just the meeting point between demand and supply. Predicting human behavior is key.I always try to understand what the market is seeing in a stock beyond the numbers, which often implies trying to understand sectors, industries and long term growth trends. My approach requires ingenuity, curiosity and a good dose of naivete, as well as being comfortable in (sometimes) going against the current.I am based in Geneva, Switzerland (hence my SA name) and I have a Master’s Degree in Business.

The investment from NPS into the Single Family Housing Fund will be used by Long Harbour to deploy up to £600 million, including leverage, into single-family homes across the UK.
Jack Spearman, managing director of single-family housing at Long Harbour, said: “Scaling [the fund’s] portfolio and meeting our ambitious deployment targets requires well-structured debt funding that can support forward funding for our investments.","Long Harbour has obtained a £66.8 million (€76.5 million) development facility from UK lender Barclays, Real Estate Capital Europe can reveal.

The loan will fund the development costs for the current and pipeline schemes associated with the London-headquartered manager’s Single Family Housing Fund.

Barclays’ loan finances the first two transactions by the manager on behalf of the vehicle, which totalled £180 million in acquisition costs. The first deal was the forward funding of 105 homes in Newhall, Derbyshire, in May 2025, followed by the purchase in December of 369 rental homes from Dandara in Horsham and Great Dunmow, and Miller Homes in Kent.

Barclays was an active lender in the residential sector in 2025. The bank lent across UK residential rental, build‑to‑rent and social housing schemes, typically via corporate and fund‑level facilities. In May, the bank provided a £50 million revolving credit facility to the Urban Splash Residential Fund to support the continued creation of UK rental homes, replacing a £20 million facility issued by Barclays in 2023.

During the first three quarters of 2025, Barclays lent a total of €7.96 billion and had a loan book of €12.9 billion, according to REC Europe’s Active Lenders 2025.

Single-family housing fund

In January 2025, Long Harbour secured a seed equity commitment of £300 million from South Korea’s National Pension Fund. The vehicle, which is targeting £1.2 billion of capital commitments over the next 18 months, will acquire new-build family homes across the UK, focussing on the south and southeast of England.

The investment from NPS into the Single Family Housing Fund will be used by Long Harbour to deploy up to £600 million, including leverage, into single-family homes across the UK. The deployment target for the fund is £1.6 billion.

The manager anticipates holding a second close for the vehicle during 2026 with a final close expected in 2027. Should it reach its target size, the fund will be Long Harbour’s largest-ever closed-end fundraise, as per affiliate title PERE.

Jack Spearman, managing director of single-family housing at Long Harbour, said: “Scaling [the fund’s] portfolio and meeting our ambitious deployment targets requires well-structured debt funding that can support forward funding for our investments. The option to extend the size on the loan with Barclays based on future acquisitions gives us flexibility while we focus on identifying the best opportunities in the market.”

Established in 2009, Long Harbour has £3.3 billion of residential assets under management across the UK and Europe. Its first investment in single-family assets was in 2013, with the acquisition of a portfolio of homes from Lloyds Bank, and it subsequently invested in the sector through its LHIF I fund, which was fully divested by 2022.",https://media.recapitalnews.com/uploads/2026/01/02-Corner-Turner.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 11:08:57.740348

These companies represent breakthrough innovations across quantum computing, artificial intelligence, biotech, and other foundational technologies, and will participate in Alchemist’s flagship six-month program designed to accelerate fundraising outcomes, expand enterprise traction, and prepare startups for scalable growth.

Selected from a competitive pool of nearly 400 applicants, Alchemist Chicago’s Phase 1 featured 27 startups representing more than 10 cities and five countries. Following the program’s customer validation and proof of concept curriculum, startups in Phase 2 have demonstrated exceptional technical strength, market potential, and readiness for commercialization

“Alchemist Chicago was built to help deep tech founders bridge the gap between breakthrough science and real-world impact,” said Samir Mayekar, managing director of the Polsky Center. “These teams have shown not only technical excellence, but also the discipline and market focus required to build lasting companies.”

Phase 2 of Alchemist Chicago is designed to help founders sharpen commercial readiness, build traction, and prepare for fundraising by aligning technical innovation with clear customer value. During this phase, teams receive customized 1:1 coaching, curated investor introductions, and direct access to Alchemist’s global investor and enterprise network, culminating in Demo Day in May 2026.

“This is where we see founders translate their technology into compelling commercial opportunities,” said Shyama Majumdar, senior director of science accelerators and investments at the Polsky Center. “These startups are tackling some of the hardest problems in science and engineering, and this next phase provides the tailored support, capital exposure, and partnerships needed to move from proof to market.”

QodeX Quantum and SQK, two startups participating in Alchemist Chicago, also benefit from the University of Chicago’s collaboration with IBM Ventures to advance quantum computing software and algorithm development through Duality, the nation’s first quantum startup accelerator.

Through this collaboration, these startups will have access to IBM technical expertise, plus funding support, and may gain access to IBM’s cloud-based quantum computing resources, including the opportunity to work on the IBM Quantum System Two that’s planned to be deployed at the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park (IQMP).

“We’re looking forward to collaborating with Qodex Quantum and SQK and equipping them with the resources, mentorship, and strategic connections they need to succeed,” said Emily Fontaine, global head of venture capital at IBM. “By providing access to IBM quantum technology, valuable networks, customer ecosystems, and clear pathways to practical applications, we aim to help these founders drive sustainable, long-term growth. This effort is strengthened by the University of Chicago’s collaboration with IBM, which reflects our shared commitment to advancing breakthrough technologies and accelerating real-world impact through quantum computing.”

Launched last year, Alchemist Chicago combines Alchemist’s global track record of launching category-defining B2B companies with the University of Chicago’s research leadership, national laboratory affiliations, and commercialization expertise.

Alchemist Chicago operates as part of Alchemist’s flagship accelerator platform, enabling founders in the Midwest and beyond to tap into a global venture ecosystem while remaining closely connected to the University of Chicago’s research enterprise. The program is open to founders worldwide, with no University affiliation required.

“Deep tech – the novel bits, atoms and science powering the future’s most impactful innovations – has never been more relevant or important,” said Ian Bergman, partner and managing director at Alchemist. “We’re thrilled to see a group of founders who have shown remarkable vision and momentum advance to Phase 2 of Alchemist Chicago, joining Alchemist’s flagship Class 41 and accessing the network, resources, and community that will help them take the important next steps on their journey.”

He was surrounded by the love of his family by his side. Born in Joliet, IL, on August 5, 1948, he was the son of the late Sterling and Iola Greiner. Bill was a graduate from Joliet West High School and Eureka College and went on to build a long and dedicated career, retiring as a Global Purchasing Manager from Ecolab after 37 years of service.

Bill married the love of his life, Marlene (nee Hanna) Greiner. With over 51 years of marriage, they built a life centered on family, faithfulness, and shared experiences, especially their enjoyment of traveling and golfing together. Bill was an avid golfer who not only played countless rounds at local Joliet golf courses, but also around the country and overseas. Bill and Marlene took many golf trips to Ireland and Scotland with their family and dear friends, Greg and Mary Ellen Webb. Bill and Marlene cherished the months they spent in Ft. Myers, Florida, embracing a half-year lifestyle filled with sunshine, relaxation, and golfing together.

Deeply involved in his community, Bill gave generously of his time and leadership. He was a member of Prestwick Country Club, Past President of Joliet Country Club, and Past President of the Joliet Park District. He also served as a former member of the Joliet Park Foundation, Joliet Junior College Foundation, and the Joliet Exchange Club. Through these roles, he helped shape the recreational and civic life of Joliet.

Bill’s greatest joy was his family. He is survived by his devoted wife, Marlene; two daughters, Stacy (fiancé Scott Updegraff) Greiner and Lisa (Dr. Brian) Winkleman; and four beloved grandchildren, Quinn and Campbell Connelly and Hanna and Alexander “A.J.” Winkleman.

He was preceded in death by his parents, and his dear cousin, Linda Babich.

The family would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to Dr. Sunil Narula, M.D., and Dr. Michael Bishop, from the University of Chicago Medicine at the Silver Cross Campus.

Visitation for Bill Greiner will be held on Friday, January 30, 2026, at the Fred C. Dames Funeral Home, 3200 Black Rd., Joliet, IL, from 4:00 to 7:00 p.m. and again on Saturday, January 31, 2026, from 9:30 a.m. until the time of funeral service at 10:30 a.m. Interment will follow at Woodlawn Memorial Park in Joliet, Illinois.

Quick Insights

LLY's oral obesity drug is expected to differentiate the company, expand patient access, and accelerate global scaling, particularly in markets where injectables face adoption barriers.

LLY faces intensifying generics competition and price wars, especially in ex-US markets like China, which could pressure margins despite its robust pipeline and diversification.

LLY's forward multiple has compressed to 33x, near its 10-year average, indicating the market has priced in execution risks but still supports a Buy given healthy consolidation and upcoming catalysts.

The reasons for this prediction were rather simple: The AI hyperscalers would continue spending at a rapid pace, and I was right on that account.

However, I was wrong about Nvidia's valuation multiples. Nvidia breached the $5 trillion market cap level, and although it's below that threshold right now, I think it will return in 2026.

Nvidia was a $5 trillion company, but only briefly

Nvidia entered 2025 valued at just over $3 trillion, so it would take a significant gain for it to breach the $5 trillion mark. Following President Trump's tariff announcements in April, this prediction was in even worse shape as Nvidia was nearly a $2 trillion company.

However, as the market rallied throughout the year, Nvidia became the first $5 trillion company in October, although it is no longer at that level.

What drove it there was the insatiable demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), and AI hyperscalers willing to spend a near-unlimited amount of money on computing equipment. That trend didn't shift throughout 2025, and there are no indications it will change in 2026. As a result, I think Nvidia will end the year solidly in the $5 trillion club.

Nvidia's valuation is cheaper than I expected

At the end of 2024 (when I made the initial prediction), Nvidia had a price-to-forward earnings ratio of 45. I called that a bit expensive, but it's slightly cheaper now at 40 times forward earnings.

Make no mistake; Nvidia's stock still isn't cheap. However, the other big tech stocks' valuation levels have climbed to around the 30 times forward earnings level. That gives Nvidia a slight premium over its peers, but I still think that it's a much better buy. After all, which big tech company will be able to match Nvidia's growth this year?

The partnership is being spearheaded by Palantir, which will lead the software front while Accenture helps with operational control, including sales and engineering support. Specifically, Palantir will use its Chain Reaction operating system to build and deploy the AI infrastructure.

To achieve this, the Dell AI Factory with Nvidia — Dell’s end-to-end stack of hardware, software and services — will function as the “secure, high-performance backbone” for the project.

Sovereign AI noted that the goal is to “deliver a resilient sovereign AI foundation for commercial and government sectors” across EMEA.

Sovereign AI refers to a type of cloud infrastructure that maintains data within a specific country or region in terms of physical location, legal frameworks, and management.

“This collaboration with Accenture and Palantir will help accelerate the development and deployment of [Palantir’s] Dell AI Factory- and NVIDIA-powered sovereign-grade AI capabilities, supporting economic security and digital resiliency across EMEA, with plans to expand into Asia Pacific,” Sovereign AI explained in a statement.

The fourth quarter earnings season is picking up speed.

After several big banks reported last week, more financials will deliver results, with reports from Charles Schwab (SCHW) and regional banks like Fifth Third (FITB) on the schedule. But the attention will likely shift to Netflix (NFLX) and Intel (INTC), headlining the earnings calendar.

An optimistic consensus is forming: As of Jan. 16, 7% of S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies have reported fourth quarter results, according to FactSet data, and Wall Street analysts estimate an 8.2% increase in earnings per share for the fourth quarter. If that rate holds, it would represent the 10th consecutive quarter of annual earnings growth for the index.

Heading into the reporting period, analysts were expecting an 8.3% jump in earnings per share, down from the third quarter's 13.6% earnings growth rate. Wall Street has raised its earnings expectations in recent months, especially for tech companies, which have driven earnings growth in recent quarters.

Although Big Tech continues to set the tone, this earnings season promises to test the improved stock market breadth that has emerged at the start of 2026. Plus, the themes that drove the markets in 2025 — artificial intelligence, the Trump administration's tariff and economic policies, and a K-shaped consumer economy — will continue to provide plenty for investors to parse.

In addition to quarterly reports from Netflix and Intel, the earnings releases highlighting this week's schedule include United Airlines (UAL), 3M Company (MMM), D.R. Horton (DHI), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), GE Aerospace (GE), Procter & Gamble (PG), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), and Capital One (COF).

Netflix stock falls as Warner Bros. Discovery bid adds pressure

Netflix (NFLX) stock dropped more than 4% in after-hours trading as the company's fourth quarter earnings were closely scrutinized amid Netflix's bid to purchase Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD).

The creator of ""Squid Game"" and other popular shows said it would ramp up new content in the year ahead and pause its share repurchase program, given the M&A deal with Warner Bros. Discovery.

Netflix posted diluted earnings per share of $0.56, coming in ahead of Wall Street's forecasts of $0.55 per share. Revenue of $12 billion also beat estimates of $11.96 billion, according to Bloomberg data.

The company's operating margin declined slightly to 24.5% from 28.2% last quarter but increased from Q4 2024. For the current quarter, Netflix guided for an operating margin of 32.1%, which was a bit lighter than the Street expected.

Charles Schwab stock rises as trading volume boosts results

Charles Schwab (SCHW) stock rose over 1.7% on Wednesday after the brokerage and asset manager posted 22% annual revenue growth, supported by record trading volumes, but missed the high expectations set by Wall Street.

Fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.33 fell short of analyst estimates of $1.35 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue of $6.33 billion also came up short of expectations for $6.39 billion.

""While we had anticipated some moderation in client trading activity towards the back end of the year, we instead saw an acceleration in activity, which contributed to higher volume-related costs, inclusive of performance-based compensation,"" Charles Schwab CFO Michael Verdeschi said on the earnings call.

Net interest revenue grew 25% year over year to 3.1 billion. Asset management revenue increased 14% to $1.7 billion. And revenue from trading surged 22% to $1 billion.

Schwab brought in record client assets during the quarter, the company said, as total client accounts grew 6% year-over-year to 46.5 million.

Halliburton stock climbs after the oil services giant posts better-than-expected profits

Oil services provider Halliburton (HAL) posted better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter, sending its shares up 2%.

The Houston-based company reported profits of $0.70 per diluted share, beating Wall Street estimates of $0.55 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Profits were flat from a year ago, when the company also posted earnings of $0.70 per share.

Revenue of $5.7 billion also came in stronger than the $5.4 billion estimated. It was also higher than the $5.6 billion in revenue reported a year ago.

Halliburton's revenue in its Completion and Production segment was roughly unchanged from a year ago at $3.3 billion, while revenue in the Drilling and Evaluation unit was $2.4 billion, also flat.

While the oil majors have shown reluctance in exploring Venezuelan oil following the US's removal of Nicolás Maduro (ExxonMobil's (XOM) CEO called it ""uninvestable""), oil infrastructure companies like Halliburton have shown more eagerness to revisit the country.

Reuters reported on Tuesday that the company has started looking at resumes for roles in the country, in a sign that Halliburton may be ready to reenter Venezuela.

Fastenal stock declines after execs note headwinds in the 'sluggish industrial economy'

Industrial bellwether Fastenal (FAST) is battling a ""sluggish industrial economy,"" the company's executives said on an earnings call on Tuesday.

After reporting earnings per share of $0.26, in line with analyst estimates, the company's new CFO Max Tunnicliff said that the industrial sector has ""continued to see mixed signals."" Tunnicliff noted that ""while some areas showed resilience, others faced continued headwinds that impacted demand and supply chains.""

Shares of Fastenal, which produces an array of products such as bolts, nuts, screws, and studs for industrial manufacturing and construction materials, fell more than 2.5% in afternoon trading Tuesday.

Sales of $2.02 billion slightly missed analyst estimates for $2.04 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Touching on the company's heavy manufacturing markets, Fastenal president Jeffery Watts added that, while the company hasn't seen declines, demand has been flat.

""We're not really seeing [the economy improve], but we're also not seeing any declines in our manufacturing as far as the year-over-year usage,"" he said.

U.S. Bancorp earnings beat on record consumer deposits, CEO says credit card rate limit would be 'detrimental' to 'crushing' for consumers

U.S. Bancorp (USB) gained about 1% in midmorning trading on Tuesday after the Minneapolis-based super-regional bank reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter on the back of strong consumer deposits.

The U.S. Bank parent reported $4.31 billion in net interest income, a 3.3% annual rise that topped Wall Street estimates for $4.28 billion. Revenue of $7.36 billion also beat estimates of $7.31 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Earnings of $1.26 per share came in higher than the $1.19 per share the Street was expecting.

U.S. Bancorp said it achieved record consumer deposits in the fourth quarter and saw green shoots in the beaten-down commercial real estate sector.

""The effectiveness of products like bank smartly, more sophisticated pricing capabilities, and a significant overhaul of skills, training, digital tools and incentives, together with investments in our branches drove our performance,"" CEO Gunjan Kedia said on the earnings call. ""Additionally, commercial real estate loans also showed modest growth after 11 quarters of decline.""

Like other bank executives, Kedia weighed in on the proposed 10% credit card rate limit President Trump has floated. Kedia estimated that over 90% of U.S. Bancorp's clients would see ""a detrimental impact"" if that rate cap were enacted, and that 50% would face a ""crushing"" impact.

""We have observed that just in the last few days, the conversation around the rate cap has shifted more productively to options for customers to help them in the short term,"" Kedia added.

D.R. Horton stock rises on better-than-expected earnings

Homebuilder D.R. Horton's (DHI) first quarter earnings were better than expected, but a sluggish housing market marked by affordability concerns weighed on results.

The company reported earnings per share of $2.03, beating estimates of $1.93, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue of $6.8 billion also topped expectations of $6.6 billion, but fell from $7.6 billion a year ago.

Net sales orders increased 3% to 18,300 homes, which was slightly below estimates. Homebuilders have increased sales incentives in recent months to try and entice buyers off the sidelines. That, coupled with lower mortgage rates, has sparked some optimism that the housing market could improve.

D.R. Horton reiterated its full-year 2026 guidance for revenue in a range of $33.5 billion to $35 billion. The company expects to close 86,000 homes to 88,000 homes by the end of the year.

3M adjusted earnings beat, but the stock is sinking

Post-it Note maker 3M (MMM) reported adjusted earnings per share that beat Wall Street expectations on Tuesday, but the stock fell 5% as part of a broader market sell-off.

The Minnesota-based company posted adjusted earnings, which strip out one-time costs, of $1.83, compared to analysts' forecasts of $1.80, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The company expected temporary charges from tariffs and stranded costs from removing PFAS materials from its products. In Q4, 3M realized $0.56 per share in net costs from litigation.

Sales grew 2.1% in Q4 to $6.1 billion, topping expectations for $6 billion in sales.

For 2026, the company expects adjusted sales growth of around 4% for full-year adjusted EPS of $8.06. Full-year operating cash flow is expected to be $2.3 billion.

""2025 was an important year for 3M as we build a strong foundation that is reshaping our operating model and driving sustainable value creation,"" 3M CEO William Brown said.

J.B. Hunt stock falls after revenue declines year over year

Freight and logistics company J.B. Hunt (JBHT) reported a 2% decline in revenue year over year, led by weaker volumes and revenue in its main Intermodal segment.

The Arkansas-based company posted diluted earnings per share of $1.90 for the fourth quarter, topping Wall Street analysts' expectations of $1.82 per share, according to estimates on S&P Global Market Intelligence. Total revenue of $3.1 billion came in line with estimates but declined slightly from $3.15 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024.

In the Intermodal segment, its largest by revenue, the company reported a 2% decline in volume, driven by a 6% decrease in transcontinental network loads between US ports, Mexico, and Canada year over year (though eastern network loads increased 5%). J.B. Hunt also saw weakness in its last-mile segment due to softer demand in end markets, the company said.

Morgan Stanley results show boom in Wall Street dealmaking

Like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley's (MS) fourth quarter benefited from a boom in Wall Street dealmaking.

Morgan Stanley reported an 18% lift in profits in Q4 as its total client assets in wealth and investment banking grew by $350 million to reach $9.3 trillion. Net income rose to $4.4 billion, or $2.68 per diluted share, from $3.7 billion a year ago. Analysts were expecting earnings per share of $2.45, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The standout in the quarter was Morgan Stanley's investment banking revenues, which increased 47% year over year to $2.4 billion. The company's debt underwriting revenue, in particular, nearly doubled year over year to $785 million.

Revenue in the wealth management unit also surged 13% to $8.4 billion, compared with $7.5 billion a year ago.

For the full year, Morgan Stanley reported record net revenue of $70.6 billion and net income of $16.9 billion. However, the stock wavered in premarket trading.

HOW FORTUNE DETERMINES THE MOST ADMIRED COMPANIES

Fortune’s list is based on a survey conducted with Korn Ferry. Starting with about 1,500 candidates, the list was narrowed to 685 top-revenue companies across 31 countries.

To determine the best-regarded companies, Korn Ferry asked executives, directors and analysts to rate companies within their industry on nine criteria, including management quality, product quality, social responsibility and talent attraction. A company’s score must rank in the top half of its industry survey to be listed.

To select the top 50, Korn Ferry asked senior executives, directors and industry analysts to select the 10 companies they admired most and rank each one on various attributes. They chose from a list made up of the companies that ranked in the top 25% in last year’s surveys; ranked in the top 3 within their industry the previous year (top 4 for non-U.S. companies); or a company that ranked among the top 50 All-Stars last year and did not make any of the above cuts. Anyone could vote for any company in any industry.",https://news.delta.com/sites/default/files/styles/twitter_share_1200/public/2024-01/20231213_delta_frontline_01-0179_j.jpg?itok=f8KFaEXF,N,,2026-01-21 10:00:35.657949

By Tony DiZinno

DETROIT – Before they get started racing in this weekend’s 64th Rolex 24 At Daytona, General Motors IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship drivers Jack Aitken and Alexander Sims paid a visit to Detroit for a double duty round of promotional efforts for both the 64th Rolex 24 At Daytona and Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix.

Aitken, co-driver of the No. 31 Cadillac Whelen Cadillac V-Series.R in the Grand Touring Prototype (GTP) class and Sims, defending Grand Touring Daytona Pro (GTD PRO) champion and co-driver of the No. 3 Corvette Racing by Pratt Miller Motorsports Corvette Z06 GT3.R, finished this weekend’s Roar Before the Rolex 24 test at Daytona International Speedway and departed for Detroit.

They started off the week at Monday night’s Boston Celtics vs. Detroit Pistons’ game, part of NBC and Peacock’s return to broadcasting the NBA for the first time in more than two decades, sitting courtside across from the Detroit Pistons bench at Detroit’s Little Caesars Arena. The Pistons won by one point, 104-103, in a thriller over their Eastern Conference rivals to extend their lead in the conference to 5.5 games.

Aitken and Sims moved onto the Detroit Auto Show’s annual “Racing Day” on Tuesday to participate in a pre-event media tour for both this weekend’s Rolex 24 to kick off the 2026 WeatherTech Championship season, and also for the Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix held in downtown Detroit encircling the Renaissance Center in late May.

Aitken and Sims toured the show with Auto Show and Detroit GP executives and key stakeholders, participated in several rounds of media interviews, engaged in fan Q&As at the Cadillac and Chevrolet displays, and took fans around an indoor “DGP” track in Chevrolet E-Rays and Cadillac CT-4s. The key word here is “indoor” with temperatures in the low single digits and “feels like” temperatures below zero on a sunny, yet cold Tuesday in Detroit.

“It’s been great fun,” Sims said. “It started off last night with the NBA game with the Pistons playing in a pretty tight contest. Being courtside for that was a really cool experience. Today, to see the Auto Show for the first time, see all the cars on display and all the amazing GM products is really nice. To meet some of the IndyCar guys, meet the fans, do some hot laps, see some smiles on some faces, it’s been really good fun.

“We were given some (Corvette) E-Rays to thrash around for a while and give some hot laps to the fans with some controlled drifting and putting some rubber down, which the fans seemed to love. It was good fun for everyone.”

Aitken added, “It’s been a fun time. It’s been great to see such a big presence from GM and Cadillac. We did some hot laps on a scale circuit of the GP Track and it’s been a great show put on by the Detroit GP. I had a lot of fun and met a lot of new people and hopefully we’re going to see them again in May. I can’t wait to get back on the streets of Detroit. We got to see a bit of a corker; it was tight down to the wire. We had courtside seats and I’ve never had that before. It was really cool and got us into the spirit of the hometown heroes. It was a fun day.”

The two IMSA drivers weren’t alone, as four full-time IndyCar Series drivers also made the voyage. That included David Malukas, Rinus VeeKay, Marcus Armstrong and Kyffin Simpson. Simpson, of note, is also competing in the Rolex 24 this year as part of the Tower Motorsports No. 8 ORECA LMP2 07 in Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) entry. VeeKay has started a Rolex 24 before and Malukas and Armstrong would be rookies in any future Rolex 24 appearances.

Both WeatherTech Championship races air live on network NBC. The Rolex 24 starts this Saturday, January 24, at 1:30 p.m. ET on NBC and finishes on the network as well, with flag-to-flag streaming on Peacock.

Real returns rise in Türkiye, supporting monetary easing Keller said he expects inflation to continue declining steadily this year, adding that the central bank only changes policy rates when it sees, or can clearly anticipate, that inflation is falling.
Türkiye's annual inflation fell to 30.9% in December 2025, while the policy rate stands at 38%, implying a 7.1% real return gap.
""The central bank is doing a good job in regaining trust,"" he noted.
According to Keller, Türkiye is historically well-positioned to manage periods of global uncertainty.","Türkiye’s declining inflation trend is expected to sustain real returns on lira-denominated assets through 2026, strengthening investor confidence and reinforcing capital inflows, according to Barclays Global Head of Economic Research Christian Keller.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) 56th Annual Meeting in Davos, Keller told the state-run Anadolu Agency that the Turkish central bank’s monetary policy, which is steering the country’s disinflation path, has begun to yield results.

Real returns rise in Türkiye, supporting monetary easing

Keller said he expects inflation to continue declining steadily this year, adding that the central bank only changes policy rates when it sees, or can clearly anticipate, that inflation is falling. ""This prevents the bank from trailing behind developments and gives investors confidence that the real interest rate will stay at a certain level,"" he said.

Türkiye's annual inflation fell to 30.9% in December 2025, while the policy rate stands at 38%, implying a 7.1% real return gap. This situation allows the central bank to implement further cuts at the next Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting on Thursday, with market participants expecting a 150 basis point reduction. As of Wednesday, Türkiye’s two-year treasury yield declined to 35.44%.

Keller noted that the current macro framework is functioning effectively. ""There is money flowing into Türkiye, the central bank is able to accumulate reserves, and at the same time, the country’s competitiveness does not appear to have been hurt,"" Keller added.

As of the week ending Jan. 9, the central bank’s total reserves rose to $196.08 billion, while net reserves excluding swaps reached $70.1 billion. Preliminary data indicate that total reserves have reached a new record above $200 billion this week, with net reserves excluding swaps above $80 billion. During the same period, the total carry trade volume also increased to $54.78 billion.

Türkiye gains ground on stability, growth, global resilience

Keller said the Turkish economy frequently surprises to the upside in terms of growth, citing its underlying dynamism. The Turkish economy grew by 3.7% in the third quarter of 2025, and according to government estimates, the full-year growth rate was 3.3%.

He stressed the importance of continuing the ongoing macroeconomic stabilization program and underscored the central bank’s performance in rebuilding policy credibility. ""The central bank is doing a good job in regaining trust,"" he noted. According to Keller, Türkiye is historically well-positioned to manage periods of global uncertainty. ""Türkiye is one of the best countries in coping with uncertainty, and it has been that way for a long time,"" he said.

Keller highlighted that Türkiye’s geopolitical standing may offer a buffer against escalating international tensions. He pointed out that Türkiye is not currently in the ""negative spotlight"" compared to economies such as China, Russia, or European Union member states under U.S. pressure.

Emerging markets that maintain balance in global relations may be better placed to navigate volatility, Keller added. ""If Europe revives its economy and invests more, Türkiye could also benefit,"" he said.",https://img.turkiyetoday.com/images/2026/1/21/turkiye-to-continue-offering-real-gains-through-2026-as-inflation-declines-barclays-3213304_20260121143520.jpeg,N,,2026-01-21 13:03:46.247180

Well, let's talk a little bit about your business in India, you know. Sukses one of your key markets, not j. Some logistics point of view and mobility point of view, but also from a technology perspective, layout for me what the year ahead for India for Uber will look like. So you're, you're right from a technology perspective, I mean, First off, I'd say we have tremendous talent in India. The Uber team in India is great. It's our largest engineering center outside the Bay Area and we're continuing to grow, grow the center. We're doing a lot of our new AI work out of our India team. So we've got a, a program called Uber AI Solutions. Which is really participating almost as a human in the loop in AI development and that's being innovated out of India and for Uber globally, for Uber globally, clients all over the world's. Most of the team is in India that's building that, that offering. But it's super compelling, it's new, it's interesting. We're participating in government technology schemes like ODBC, which I think is a really interesting approach to try to grow marketplace businesses across a number of sectors. And a lot of our global products actually debut in II is a tremendously competitive. Environment competition brings the best out of us and and we're seeing a lot of awesome. That's the competitive intensity increase or you know, is, is, is it status quo there? India has always been competitively intense. You know, it's not a question of growth for us in India. It's, you know, how sustainable is that growth? And would I give credit to the ecosystem for is there's new players that pop up, they innovate, they bring new business models, they bring lower cost products, which I think are popular with Indian consumers. So it's as intense as ever, but I think we're faring. Well, in that competition, and again, a lot of what we're learning in India is making its way into our 75 countries around the world and, and that's a good thing. What's been the biggest learning from India that you're taking to the world? I think your ability to continue to innovate on the consumer experience while being mindful of price is really, really critical. I mean, we, we're a marketplace business at the end of the day, we're trying to meet the needs of both the drivers and couriers who unearned money on our platform and consumers who depend on us for services. And actually that balancing act is, is challenging. And in India, I think it's probably the hardest market for that balancing act and it's made us better on both fronts. You know, you have now restarted M&A. Is India likely to see some action on that front for you? You know, I never love speculating on M&AI. Think there's lots of interesting technology companies in India that of course we'll take a look at. And and you know, for us, we've been doing the deals that make sense for our customers, that makes sense for our platform. You know, Uber is increasingly becoming a daily use case. And so if we can plug more modes of moving or give you more access to local selection in your city, then we're going to do that either organically or through M&A. Well, you know, you talked about how Uber wants to position itself as a daily use service. What will that mean in India? You know, you exited the Uber Eats business, but you're now re entering that space while ODC take me through the new bets and the new avenues that you hope to double down on in India. We've we've got a tremendous driver base in India, right? And we've got drivers who use cars as their vehicles, 3 Wheelers or two Wheelers and increasingly that sort of two and three Wheeler section in the market is also doing deliveries. And so our ability to actually give our drivers more opportunity to either do consumer to consumer package delivery or. The full fulfill for retailers, I think that's interesting in India. So no plans to re enter the food delivery market, but I do think you'll see us experimenting and growing some segments that sort of further complement our offering.

U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is included on our list of the best undervalued wide moat stocks.

On January 13, 2026, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) announced that it will acquire Wall Street brokerage BTIG for up to $1 billion in cash and stock. With this move, the company marks a strategic expansion into capital markets.

In addition to $725 million upfront, the deal includes an additional $275 million contingent on performance over three years. BTIG has served as the bank’s equity capital markets referral partner since 2014, bringing strengths in investment banking, institutional sales and trading, research, and prime brokerage. The firm has helped U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) diversify beyond traditional banking. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2026.

Within this context, Piper Sandler analysts noted,

While U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) certainly has capital markets capabilities, they have historically been ‌much ‌more limited than those of several peers. This transaction therefore rounds out USB’s offerings to become more competitive with those of other large banks.

On the same day, Keefe Bruyette spoke out on the recent development, viewing it as a modest positive for U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB). The firm noted the company’s strategy of gradually growing its internal capital markets capabilities amid rising industry-wide demand. The firm maintained its ‘Market Perform’ rating with a $58 price target.

U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), founded in 1929 and headquartered in Minneapolis, offers comprehensive banking services, including lending, deposits, wealth management, mortgages, credit cards, and brokerage services across the U.S.

While we acknowledge the potential of USB as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

The chocolate maker said CEO Peter Feld would leave his role on 26 January “to pursue other career opportunities” after less than three years on the job.

The CEO change signals the business is still not developing as hoped, analysts from Zeurcher Kantonalbank said in a note to investors.

One of the world’s top cocoa processors, which supplies chocolate for Magnum ice cream and Nestlé’s Kit Kat bars, said its sales volume fell 9.9% to 509,401 metric tonnes in the first quarter that ran from September to November.

Analysts were expecting 512,000 tonnes on average in a company-provided poll.

Shares of the company, which also confirmed its outlook for the financial year, were trading 3.4% higher at 0957 GMT, a move than analysts attributed largely to the CEO change.

Vontobel analysts wrote, “The appointment of Hein Schumacher lands like a small bombshell.”

‘In The Right Position At The Right Time’

Talking to analysts on a call, chairman Patrick De Maeseneire said Barry Callebaut was undergoing the biggest transformation in its history, having been unable to foresee the volatile geopolitical situation and record cocoa prices that have shaken the market.

De Maeseneire said, “People often forget the right leader is in the right position at the right time.

“And the right time is often forgotten. And doing a transformation requires a certain profile of leader.”

He however denied that the company was exploring a separation of its global cocoa unit from the rest of the group, as reported by Reuters last month.

AlphaValue analyst Filippo Ercole Piva noted that Schumacher was behind the separation of Unilever’s ice cream business Magnum.

He said, “They are hiring a guy that has experience spinning off certain businesses, so I think they are paying for that.”

Leadership Change

Barry Callebaut’s change of leadership is the latest of several for leading consumer companies over the last 18 months.

Schumacher, a Dutch national ousted by Unilever in February 2025, will benefit from already having deep industry relationships with Barry’s key customers, Vontobel said in a note.

Feld began his role as CEO in April 2023 and has steered the company through high cocoa prices, to which Barry is more exposed than consumer-facing firms, and a subsequent fall in demand.

The latest quarterly data on cocoa grind, a proxy for chocolate demand, showed a slum in Asia and fell 8.3% year-on-year in Europe, which represents roughly two-fifths of Barry’s revenue.

Barry buys cocoa beans that it processes into cocoa butter and powder.

Manufacturers then use its product to produce chocolate and candy which is sold to consumers directly.

After three cuts to the company’s volume guidance last year, it guided in November for a mid-single-digit percentage decline in sales of cocoa products in 2025/26.",https://img.resized.co/checkout/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLm1hZGlzb25wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMuZXVcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDIxXFxcLzA5XFxcLzAxMTI1ODM2XFxcL0hlaW4tU2NodW1hY2hlci1Gcmllc2xhbmRDYW1waW5hLmpwZWdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6MTIwMCxcImhlaWdodFwiOjYyNyxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LmNoZWNrb3V0LmllXFxcL2lcXFwvbm9pbWFnZS5wbmdcIixcIm9wdGlvbnNcIjpbXX0iLCJoYXNoIjoiMzEyNTJjZGYwZGU2MTdlMzQwMjcwMTU4Yzc5NjQzNWExYjM1MjEzOSJ9/barry-callebaut-taps-ex-unilever-boss-schumacher-as-ceo-checkout.jpeg,N,,2026-01-21 11:09:32.166984

According to GSK in a Jan. 20, 2026, press release, IgE is the only clinically validated systemic target shown to protect against harmful allergic and inflammatory immune responses, with approximately 94% of severe food allergies mediated through this pathway (1).
“Food allergies cause severe health impacts to patients with existing treatment requiring injections as frequently as every [two] weeks.
What could this deal mean for the future food allergy treatment landscape?
Food allergies impose a substantial economic and societal burden, with US families facing an estimated $33 billion in annual costs (5).","GSK’s newly announced $2.2 billion acquisition of RAPT Therapeutics reflects a broader industry shift toward immunology assets that pair validated biological targets with improved treatment durability. Central to the transaction is ozureprubart, a long-acting anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) monoclonal antibody (mAb) in Phase IIb development for prophylactic protection against food allergens (1).

As food allergy prevalence continues to rise, the deal highlights how dosing frequency, manufacturability, and late-stage risk reduction are shaping biopharmaceutical acquisition strategies (1,2).

According to GSK in a Jan. 20, 2026, press release, IgE is the only clinically validated systemic target shown to protect against harmful allergic and inflammatory immune responses, with approximately 94% of severe food allergies mediated through this pathway (1). Existing therapies require injections every two to four weeks, however, which creates challenges for patients in terms of adherence, care delivery, and healthcare utilization—particularly given that most patients with severe food allergies are children (1).

“We are excited to enter into this agreement with GSK, which offers an attractive path forward for our programs, particularly the opportunity we envision for ozureprubart in food allergy,” said Brian Wong, president and CEO, RAPT Therapeutics, in the release (1). “This transaction has the potential to provide access to the global development and commercialization capabilities, resources and infrastructure that GSK has to offer and ultimately bring added value to our pipeline, patients, and stockholders.”

Why does extended-interval anti-IgE dosing matter for food allergy care?

Ozureprubart is designed to extend dosing intervals to approximately 12 weeks, a change that could materially alter prophylactic treatment paradigms. Less frequent dosing may reduce treatment burden for patients and caregivers while also influencing how healthcare systems manage chronic allergy care (1).

From a development perspective, long-acting biologics require precise control over formulation stability, pharmacokinetics, and batch consistency, placing added emphasis on mature manufacturing platforms (3).

Data from a Phase IIb trial (prestIgE) evaluating ozureprubart as monotherapy are expected in 2027, and Phase III trials are planned across adult and pediatric populations at risk of severe reactions. In the United States, more than 17 million people are diagnosed with food allergies, and over 1.3 million experience severe reactions annually, resulting in more than 3 million emergency and hospital visits each year (1).

“The addition of ozureprubart brings another promising new, potential best-in-class treatment to GSK’s pipeline,” said Tony Wood, chief scientific officer, GSK, in the release (1). “Food allergies cause severe health impacts to patients with existing treatment requiring injections as frequently as every [two] weeks. Ozureprubart offers the opportunity to bring sustained protection to patients with dosing every 12 weeks and is consistent with our approach to acquire assets that address validated targets and where there is clear unmet medical need.”

How does this acquisition reflect shifts in biopharmaceutical development strategy?

The transaction underscores growing industry preference for mid-stage clinical assets with established mechanisms of action. Anti-IgE therapies benefit from regulatory and clinical precedent, allowing innovation to focus on durability, patient eligibility, and long-term safety rather than target validation.

Approximately 25% of patients are currently ineligible for existing therapies, suggesting potential for broader access if late-stage trials support ozureprubart’s clinical profile (1). Long-acting mAbs also introduce new considerations for manufacturing scale-up and lifecycle planning.

Extended dosing intervals may stabilize demand forecasting, but they require early alignment between development, formulation science, and global supply infrastructure to ensure consistent product availability (4).

What could this deal mean for the future food allergy treatment landscape?

Food allergies impose a substantial economic and societal burden, with US families facing an estimated $33 billion in annual costs (5). For biopharma developers and manufacturers, therapies offering sustained protection with fewer administrations may improve adherence while reducing variability in production and distribution.

If confirmed in late-stage trials, ozureprubart could help redefine expectations for durability in allergy biologics and reinforce industry momentum toward differentiated, long-acting immunology therapies (1).

The Nasdaq-listed company said it will invest $50m in development capital through Glenfarne Alaska Partners, while also lining up as the preferred tonnage provider for at least six LNG carrier newbuilds to support the export phase of the project.

Under the agreement, Danaos would construct and operate the LNG carriers that will ship cargoes from Alaska to global markets once the project moves into its export phase.

Glenfarne is developing Alaska LNG in two standalone stages. Phase one centres on a 765-mile pipeline from Alaska’s North Slope to supply the state’s domestic gas demand. Phase two adds liquefaction and export infrastructure designed to handle up to 20m tonnes per annum of LNG.

Glenfarne took over as lead developer of Alaska LNG in March last year and has since secured preliminary offtake commitments for around 11m tpa from buyers in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. The project’s partner list also includes Baker Hughes and POSCO International. Glenfarne holds a 75% stake in Alaska LNG, with the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation owning the remaining 25%.

For Danaos, the move marks a step into LNG shipping and energy-linked investments, adding another leg to a business best known for its containership exposure.

Chief executive John Coustas said the project opens up a new supply source for the North Pacific and gives Danaos an opportunity to deploy its shipping expertise in LNG transportation.

The deal comes as Danaos continues to build out its wider fleet. The company currently controls 75 containerships and has more than 20 newbuildings on order. It has also been expanding in dry bulk, recently confirming the purchase of a capesize bulker due for delivery in late first-quarter 2026, taking its capesize fleet to 11 ships.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ALASKA-LNG-Alaska-Gasline-Development-Corporation.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 07:01:02.521051

French personal care giant L’Oréal announced plans to invest Rs 3,500 crore (350 million euros) over the next five years in Telangana, with its new Global Capability Centre (GCC) set to be inaugurated in Hyderabad this November. The facility will focus on advanced beauty-tech solutions, artificial intelligence, and digital innovation.

The company said the Hyderabad GCC will create around 2,000 highly skilled jobs, including positions for AI specialists, data scientists, and technology engineers. The hub is expected to accelerate the development of AI-driven beauty products and services, positioning Hyderabad as a key centre for global digital operations.

L’Oréal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus made the announcement on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland. He described the GCC as “the world’s first Beauty Tech Hub of its kind,” serving as a flagship for AI-powered beauty innovations. “With an initial investment of over Rs 3,500 crore through 2030, this hub will become a global powerhouse, integrating AI, generative AI, and other emerging technologies,” Hieronimus said.

The centre will function as L’Oréal’s innovation, technology, data, and supply chain hub, supporting the company’s global digital transformation. Telangana Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy welcomed the investment, highlighting its alignment with the state’s “Telangana Rising: 2047 Vision” and the creation of high-value jobs. “This decision reflects the confidence global leaders have in Telangana’s innovation ecosystem and talent pool,” he said.

Industry Minister D. Sridhar Babu noted that Hyderabad’s selection for the GCC was a “strong endorsement” of the state’s ability to attract leading global companies. He added that the state government is committed to extending full support to L’Oréal and other international investors.

Hieronimus emphasized India’s strategic role in the company’s global plans, citing over three decades of L’Oréal’s presence in the country. “The future of beauty lies at the intersection of science, technology, and creativity. Hyderabad will now sit at the heart of our AI and digital ambitions,” he said.

The new hub will operate alongside L’Oréal’s global technology network in countries including France, the US, China, Singapore, Spain, Poland, Canada, Brazil, and Mexico. Officials said the GCC will foster collaboration across L’Oréal’s global teams to co-create innovations for the beauty industry.

Telangana’s Special Chief Secretary (Industries) Sanjay Kumar also invited L’Oréal to explore potential manufacturing opportunities in Hyderabad, in addition to the GCC investment. Hieronimus expressed interest in expanding the company’s footprint in the state, signaling further potential investments in the near future.

Further, with AI lowering entry barriers, he said that when it comes to content, quality now matters more than quantity.","With user search now shifting towards an agentic web, the World Wide Web is no longer what it once was. As a result, it has become important for brands to build digital experiences not just for humans but also for AI, as per Vyshak Venugopalan, Senior Director, India & JAPAC Partner at Adobe India. While this is worrying for brands, as they lose some control over how they are represented, it also means they must adapt to how discovery is changing.

“Brands should recognise that they are now building for both humans and AI. This is not the end of SEO; it is about combining SEO with generative optimisation. Without this, brands risk not being accurately represented in AI-driven environments,” said Venugopalan.

There are risks here. If a company’s content is not structured and AI-readable, their brand can be misrepresented, as per Venugopalan. “We have already seen this happen to platforms that once dominated user journeys. Revenue models are changing because consumer opinions are being shaped elsewhere. What brands need are guided and trusted conversations when users finally arrive on their apps or websites,” he added.

Further, with AI lowering entry barriers, he said that when it comes to content, quality now matters more than quantity. He added that while the demand for content has grown exponentially, it also goes stale far more quickly than it did even six months ago.

If a company has eight products, once you factor in channels, languages, and formats, this can translate into hundreds of thousands of content assets, he added. “Many enterprises are unprepared for this. Creating content that is authentic, structured, brand-aligned, and scalable is very different from producing generic material,” he further explained.

This means companies must assess whether they have a content supply chain that is AI-accelerated but human-led. While AI can generate volume, human oversight is essential to ensure brand integrity. According to Venugopalan, this is a journey rather than a quick fix and requires a clear roadmap to create content that is efficient, cost-effective, compelling, and conversion-driven.",https://media.assettype.com/outlookbusiness/2025-08-07/eqqbeqtn/ABC.avif?w=1200&amp;ar=40%3A21&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;ogImage=true&amp;mode=crop&amp;enlarge=true&amp;overlay=false&amp;overlay_position=bottom&amp;overlay_width=100,N,,2026-01-21 08:59:37.639876

A great starting point for your Kraft Heinz research is our analysis highlighting that could impact your investment decision.
If Kraft Heinz has sparked more questions than answers, do not stop here.","What Kraft Heinz’s Recent Returns May Signal for Investors

Kraft Heinz (KHC) has seen its share price under pressure recently, with negative returns over the past month, past 3 months, year to date, and past year, even as annual revenue and net income figures remain positive.

At a share price of $23.76, Kraft Heinz’s momentum looks muted, with a 30 day share price return of a 3.06% decline and a 1 year total shareholder return of a 14.58% loss, pointing to fading enthusiasm despite positive annual revenue and net income figures.

If this kind of mixed performance has you looking around the market, it could be a good moment to broaden your search with .

With Kraft Heinz trading at $23.76 and indicators like analyst targets and intrinsic value estimates suggesting a discount, the key question is whether this is a genuine value opportunity or whether the market already sees limited future growth.

Price-to-Sales of 1.1x: Is it justified?

On a P/S of 1.1x at a share price of $23.76, Kraft Heinz screens as good value against peers in some checks, but looks more expensive in others.

The P/S ratio compares what investors are paying for each dollar of revenue. It is often used for companies where earnings are weak or volatile. For Kraft Heinz, this tilt toward sales-based metrics fits with its current unprofitable status and the reliance on future earnings improvement rather than present profits.

Against its own fair P/S estimate of 1.3x, Kraft Heinz trades at a lower level. This suggests the market price is sitting below where our fair ratio work indicates it could settle. Yet when you stack that 1.1x P/S next to the broader US Food industry average of 0.8x, the stock looks more expensive than many peers, hinting that investors are still assigning a premium even with recent share price pressure.

Result: Price-to-Sales of 1.1x (ABOUT RIGHT)

However, you also need to weigh risks such as Kraft Heinz’s recent net income loss of $4.4b and a 30.7% three-year total shareholder return decline.

Another View: What the SWS DCF Model Suggests

While the P/S of 1.1x makes Kraft Heinz look roughly in line with its fair ratio work, our DCF model points in a different direction. It estimates future cash flows at $68.79 per share versus today’s $23.76 price, which flags a sizeable potential undervaluation.

That kind of gap can signal either an opportunity or that the cash flow assumptions are too optimistic, so it is worth asking which story you think fits Kraft Heinz better, and why.

As The New York Times reported, Delta planned to have premium-cabin revenue supplant main cabin by 2027.

Now, that option is coming to its premium cabins as well.

The airline revealed during a Q4 earnings call last week that it will soon begin offering tiered fares for both Business and First class, becoming the first U.S.-based airline to do so.

Although the details have not yet been revealed, it's likely that these fares will operate similar to Basic Economy, which unbundles the airline seat itself from other perks like lounge access, seat selection, and the ability to earn SkyMiles. An exact timeline has not been announced, but the company plans to launch the new offerings sometime this year.

Delta is also set to offer an Extra tier for its premium cabins, mirroring a tier already offered in its Main cabin. The Extra Economy tier currently offers boarding and SkyMiles upgrades as well as increased ticketing flexibility.

No other U.S. airline currently offers lower-cost options for its premium cabins, although international carriers like Qatar Airways, Emirates, and Etihad offer similar products for their Business class fares.

Airline President Outlines New Strategy

Delta President Glen Hauenstein said in the call that the airline plans to offer “three categories for every product, which is basic, main, and extra.”

Hauenstein explained his reasoning, saying passengers will appreciate the added flexibility across all of its cabins.

“I think that if you were offered a $500 ticket, there was no reason for you to ever want to pay more than $500 because it was fully loaded,"" he said. ""Now that seat is $500, but you can buy it for $450 if you’re willing to get the seat assignment at 48 hours, if you’re willing to have it non-refundable, and then all the way up to extra where it’s fully refundable and you get the best seats unlocked at that time.""

Ticket Update Comes Amid Changing Airline Economics

Delta's decision to offer both pared-back and premium options for all its tickets comes as the economics of air travel have changed. The airline sold over a billion dollars less in main cabin tickets last year, but still had its most profitable year ever due to jumps in business and first class ticket sales as well as co-branded credit cards. As The New York Times reported, Delta planned to have premium-cabin revenue supplant main cabin by 2027. It ended up happening by 2025, two years earlier than projected.

Meanwhile, budget airlines like Spirit and Frontier are struggling. Spirit continues to teeter on the verge of bankruptcy, while low-cost carriers Sun Country Airlines and Avelo Airlines recently announced plans to merge in order to better compete against its larger rivals. The introduction of Basic fares like Delta offers is largely credited with the shift, and it seems likely that new Business and First class ticketing tiers are likely to further shake up the economics of air travel.",https://s.yimg.com/os/en/men_s_journal_718/fe5a537ad50284f02595b35bda60c09a,N,,2026-01-21 02:58:39.421065

Scheduled for a November 2026 opening, the facility marks a significant shift in how beauty giants integrate technology. Rather than a traditional administrative office, this hub is designed as a global powerhouse for innovation, data science, and supply chain logistics.

The announcement followed a meeting at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2026 between L'Oréal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus and the `Telangana Rising’ delegation, led by Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy.

A Global Nerve Center for Digital Transformation

The Hyderabad GCC will not merely serve regional interests but will act as the digital backbone for L'Oréal’s global operations. CEO Nicolas Hieronimus highlighted that the solutions developed in Telangana—ranging from Artificial Intelligence (AI) to advanced data analytics—will be exported to L'Oréal facilities worldwide. ""This facility will support our digital transformation on a global scale. Tech solutions generated here in Hyderabad will be supplied to our facilities all around the world,"" Hieronimus explained during the summit.

Highlights of the Strategic Discussion

The meeting between the Telangana delegation and L'Oréal leadership covered several key pillars of growth:

The Beauty-Tech Niche: Minister D Sridhar Babu emphasized that while Hyderabad is already a leader in med-tech and health-tech, L'Oréal’s entry creates an entirely new category—Beauty-Tech—expanding the state’s GCC portfolio.

The AI Connection: The delegation presented the newly launched Telangana AI Innovation Hub (TAIH). Hieronimus expressed a strong interest in the hub, noting that AI is central to L'Oréal’s future strategy for personalized beauty and virtual ""try-on"" experiences.

Future Manufacturing: Beyond the tech hub, special chief secretary Sanjay Kumar formally invited L'Oréal to establish a manufacturing unit in the state. Citing Telangana’s robust infrastructure and existing ecosystem, the proposal was met with a positive response, with L'Oréal agreeing to explore future investments in local production.

A Growing Ecosystem: The Minister noted that L'Oréal joins an elite group of global giants—including Netflix, Vanguard, and Marriott—that have recently chosen Hyderabad as their global base.

What is a Beauty-Tech GCC?

To understand the scale of this investment, it helps to look at the ""Beauty-Tech"" ecosystem L'Oréal has been building. The Hyderabad center is expected to focus on:

Hyper-personalization: Using AI to analyze skin and hair types for custom product recommendations

Smart Supply Chain: Real-time data tracking to optimize global distribution and reduce carbon footprints

Augmented Reality: Developing the next generation of virtual makeup and hair color testing tools

Big Data: Analyzing global consumer trends to predict the next big beauty movements

Looking Ahead

Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy and Minister D Sridhar Babu have been officially invited to lead the inauguration ceremony in November 2026.

Despite the positive brand news, Levi Strauss’ recent share price performance has been subdued, with a 1-day share price return decline of 3.68% and a 30-day share price return decline of 3.45%. At the same time, the 1-year total shareholder return of 23.02% and 3-year total shareholder return of 36.90% point to momentum that has built over a longer stretch.

If brand strength and sustainability are on your radar, this could be a good moment to widen the lens and check out as another corner of the market to research.

With Levi Strauss posting a 1-year total shareholder return of 23.02%, trading at $20.96, and sitting at roughly a 30% discount to the average analyst price target, you have to ask: is there real value here, or is the market already baking in future growth?

Price to earnings of 15.7x, is it justified?

At a last close of US$20.96, Levi Strauss trades on a P/E of 15.7x, which screens as good value against both its own fair P/E and key peer groups.

P/E compares the company’s share price to its earnings, so it is a quick way to see how much investors are paying for each dollar of profit. For a branded apparel group like Levi Strauss, this matters because earnings quality, return on equity and growth expectations often influence how far that multiple can stretch.

Here, the 15.7x P/E sits below the estimated fair P/E of 18x, which suggests the market price is not fully reflecting the level of earnings being generated. It also comes alongside high quality earnings, a 24.2% return on equity and earnings that grew much faster than their 5 year average. This provides some context for why a higher multiple could potentially be supported over time.

Against the wider market, the P/E appears more compressed. It is lower than the US Luxury industry average of 20.1x and well below the peer average of 31.9x. This points to a gap that could close if sentiment shifts toward companies with stronger profitability metrics.

Result: Price-to-earnings of 15.7x (UNDERVALUED)

However, you still need to weigh risks such as recent short term share price weakness, as well as the possibility that brand driven expectations outpace actual revenue and earnings trends.

Another view on value

Our DCF model points in the same direction as the P/E comparison but from a different angle. With Levi Strauss trading at US$20.96 versus an SWS DCF fair value estimate of US$25.52, the shares sit at about an 18% discount on this method as well. If both signals are pointing to value, what factors could potentially influence the story from here?

The packaged food giant has been struggling with sluggish sales amid a lack of innovation, underinvestment in brands, fierce competition from healthier alternatives, and rising food prices. The filing does not confirm a sale but enables the selling shareholder to dispose of its holding.

Why Is Berkshire Exiting Its Stake?

Warren Buffett first acquired shares during the 2015 merger between Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz, alongside Brazilian private equity group 3G Capital. However, the combined company did not progress as expected. Buffett has called the investment a mistake due to excessive optimism about its prospects.

Under Buffett’s leadership, Berkshire already wrote down the KHC investment twice and took huge losses: a $3 billion write-down in 2019 and another $3.76 billion in August 2025.

Kraft Heinz Prepares for a Split

Berkshire’s potential sale comes ahead of Kraft Heinz’s planned split in the second half of this year. In September 2025, KHC announced the breakup, citing the merged company’s complex structure, which has hindered effective capital allocation, initiative prioritization, and scaling of promising areas.

The split will create two companies, one for groceries and the other for sauces and spreads, so each can focus resources better and improve results. Kraft Heinz also pointed to shifting consumer tastes toward healthier foods and weak sales, including a 3% drop in 2024, as factors driving the decision.

KHC appointed new CEO Steve Cahillane on January 1, 2026, to oversee the split, the same day when Greg Abel took over Berkshire’s helm from Buffett. Both Abel and Buffett have opposed the split, which could also be one of the reasons for Berkshire’s potential exit.

Why Is Kraft Heinz Stock So Low?

KHC stock has lost 19.4% over the past year amid ongoing challenges. On TipRanks, Kraft Heinz has a Hold consensus rating based on zero Buys, 13 Holds, and one Sell rating. The average Kraft Heinz price target of $25.38 implies 6.8% upside potential from current levels.

The announcement was made following a high-level meeting at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2026 between D. Sridhar Babu, Hon’ble Minister for IT, Electronics & Industries, Sanjay Kumar, Special Chief Secretary, Government of Telangana, and Nicolas Hieronimus, CEO of L’Oréal.

Billed as the first Beauty Tech hub of its kind globally, the Hyderabad facility will serve as a flagship centre for developing the next generation of AI-powered beauty innovation and services. With an initial investment of over ₹3,500 crores (€350 million) through 2030, the hub will focus on Data, AI, Generative AI, Agentic AI, and other emerging technologies. It is expected to create 2,000 highly skilled jobs, including roles for AI specialists, tech engineers, and data scientists, while accelerating the global deployment of AI-led beauty solutions at scale.

The partnership between L’Oréal and the Government of Telangana was formalised at Davos and stands as a key milestone in the 2026 India–France Year of Innovation. Beyond infrastructure investment, the collaboration emphasises talent development and upskilling, with the vision of building “from India, for the world” AI-driven beauty solutions. By establishing the hub in Hyderabad, L’Oréal aims to contribute to Telangana’s growing stature as a centre for digital excellence and high-value technology talent.

The India Tech Hub will also play a strategic role within L’Oréal’s integrated global AI and Tech ecosystem, complementing existing hubs in France, the USA, China, Singapore, Spain, Poland, Canada, Brazil, and Mexico. Together, these centres are designed to foster global collaboration and co-create the future of Beauty Tech.

Welcoming the development, Revanth Reddy, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Telangana, said, “We are delighted that L’Oréal has chosen Hyderabad for its new global tech hub, a decision that reflects the deep confidence global leaders place in Telangana’s innovation ecosystem and highly skilled talent pool. This partnership directly supports our ‘Telangana Rising: 2047 Vision’ by creating 2,000 high-value jobs and positioning our state as a global epicentre for AI and digital excellence.”

At ServiceNow, we’re actively realigning our Finance & Strategy organization for an AI-native future. As AI becomes embedded in how decisions are made, our workforce must evolve just as quickly. For us, AI fluency is now table stakes. Every role in Finance & Strategy must confidently leverage agentic tools—from research platforms and summarization engines to forecasting copilots and modeling assistants—to accelerate insight and execution. But fluency alone is not sufficient. The real shift is toward hybrid talent: professionals who combine deep financial and strategic judgment with the ability to work with, interrogate, and govern AI at scale.

ServiceNow just signed a three-year deal with OpenAI. This is the specialization model playing out in real time. ServiceNow is excellent at workflow platforms. OpenAI is excellent at AI models. Neither is trying to do the other's job. Each focuses on what they do best and partners for the rest. This validates what I keep hearing from vendors: ""We don't have the bandwidth to build everything."" ServiceNow could have tried building their own models. They have the resources. They did if I recall correctly. But building world-class AI models would pull focus from what actually differentiates them - their workflow platform and enterprise integration capabilities. OpenAI gets distribution into one of the largest enterprise software platforms without building workflow tools. ServiceNow gets leading AI models without years of R&D investment. Both win because they're not trying to own layers they don't need to own. The article (link in comments) mentions ServiceNow has similar deals with OpenAI's competitors. That's the point. They're platform-agnostic because their value isn't the AI models themselves. Their moat is the workflow layer, the data layer, and how well they integrate into enterprise operations. When AI models commoditize, differentiation comes from everything around the models. This includes the workflows, the context, and the integration quality. This is the same model Unito operates on. We specialize in the integration layer so vendors can focus on what they do best while their systems actually talk to each other. ServiceNow's partnership with OpenAI is a blueprint for how enterprise AI gets built at scale. Not by vendors trying to own the entire stack, but by specialists focusing on their layer and partnering for the rest. The vendors that figure this out will ship products people actually adopt. The ones still trying to build everything will keep struggling with complexity.

OpenAI and ServiceNow’s three-year deal embeds AI models and agents directly into enterprise workflow software. ServiceNow made a revenue commitment to OpenAI; customers will access OpenAI intelligence within ServiceNow platforms. The deal reflects AI agents becoming standard business software infrastructure, not standalone products but embedded capabilities. ∙ Distribution Strategy: OpenAI gains enterprise reach through ServiceNow’s installed base rather than selling direct. The revenue commitment structure guarantees OpenAI income while ServiceNow absorbs adoption risk—a favorable arrangement for the model maker expanding beyond consumer chatbots. ∙ Computer-Use Integration: ServiceNow will embed OpenAI’s computer-use model, enabling agents to perform IT tasks autonomously—restarting computers, accessing legacy mainframe data. This targets real enterprise pain: unlocking information trapped in old systems without costly custom integration. ∙ Voice Agent Development: ServiceNow will build customer service voice agents using OpenAI’s speech models. The workflow software + voice AI combination creates end-to-end automation for call centers and IT helpdesks—high-volume, high-cost functions ripe for agent replacement. ∙ Competitive Positioning: OpenAI faces Anthropic, Google, and Microsoft in enterprise AI. ServiceNow’s “open platform” stance—maintaining relationships with multiple model providers—means this deal provides distribution without exclusivity. OpenAI must compete on capability within ServiceNow’s multi-model environment. ∙ IT Labor Implications: The article explicitly notes AI agents will “disrupt the IT labor market, which has been in steady decline.” ServiceNow deploying “forward deployed engineers” to help customers implement automation acknowledges the product’s purpose: reducing human IT headcount through agent substitution. The partnership structure previews enterprise AI’s distribution model: workflow platforms become the surface where agents operate, model makers provide intelligence, and customers pay through existing software relationships rather than new AI contracts https://lnkd.in/ekr98TKb

It was only a matter of time, but still ""newsworthy""...not quite ""breaking news"" worth though.. #ServiceNow's deal with #OpenAI allows them to enhance their platforms by integrating the ChatGPT-maker’s AI models into ServiceNow’s products. In other words, ServiceNow doesn't have to build out the #AI capabilities on their own. Of course, this comes at a cost...for ServiceNow and ServiceNow customers. Based on the reporting, ServiceNow has made a revenue commitment to OpenAI. Specifics were not shared, but did we expect them to be? ServiceNow customers should expect an accelerated push to get adoption and usage of ServiceNow ""AI"" offerings. ServiceNow customers, that have not properly protected themselves, should also expected meaningful price increases imposed come renewal time.

Boston Scientific’s Big Bets On Growth Versus Valuation In Focus

Simply Wall St

Reviewed by Bailey Pemberton

January 21, 2026

Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) announced a $14.5b agreement to acquire Penumbra, expanding into neurovascular and mechanical thrombectomy markets.

The company also agreed to acquire Valencia Technologies, adding the FDA approved eCoin System for overactive bladder to its Urology portfolio.

Both deals mark some of the largest transactions for Boston Scientific in recent years and target underpenetrated medical device segments.

Boston Scientific comes into these acquisitions with shares at $91.2 and a long run of strong multi year returns, including 99.0% over 3 years and 148.9% over 5 years. Recent performance has been softer, with a 9.6% decline over 1 year and smaller declines over the past week, month and year to date, so investors may be watching how these transactions influence sentiment.

For shareholders and potential investors, a central consideration is how effectively Boston Scientific can integrate Penumbra and Valencia Technologies and scale the new platforms. The deals meaningfully widen NYSE:BSX exposure to neurovascular, thrombectomy and urology devices, so future updates on regulatory, clinical and commercial execution around these assets are likely to be important catalysts.

Summary:

The dollar weakened as Greenland tensions and tariff threats escalated.

Barclays warns euro faces greater risk in a severe US–EU fallout.

NATO cohesion and European defence spending are key concerns.

Export-heavy economies like Germany are seen as most exposed.

Analysts expect limited US asset divestment even in worst case.

The US dollar weakened on Tuesday as markets reacted to an escalation in geopolitical tensions linked to President Donald Trump’s renewed push to assert control over Greenland, including threats to impose tariffs on European countries opposing the move.

While the greenback softened on the day, some strategists argue the longer-term risks from a deterioration in US–Europe relations may fall more heavily on the euro. Analysts at Barclays said that in an extreme scenario, the Greenland dispute could become a far greater problem for Europe and the single currency than for the United States.

Barclays noted that the situation has sharpened investor focus on strains within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, raising tail risks around alliance cohesion. European governments, already under pressure to lift defence spending following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, have this month deployed troops to Greenland and now face the prospect of trade retaliation from Washington. In a worst-case outcome, Barclays warned that relations between the US and its NATO partners could deteriorate to the point where Washington effectively disengages from the alliance.

Other analysts echoed the view that a tougher trade environment would be more damaging for Europe than the US. Export-heavy economies such as Germany, the region’s largest, are seen as particularly exposed, with tariffs likely to hurt European corporates and growth prospects more than their US counterparts. That dynamic, strategists argue, would ultimately pressure the euro more than the dollar.

Market moves on Tuesday reflected near-term risk aversion. The ICE US Dollar Index fell around 0.8%, extending its decline over the past year to nearly 10%, while US equities and bonds also sold off sharply.

Barclays cautioned against over-interpreting these initial reactions, arguing that knee-jerk market moves often differ from longer-term outcomes. Its base case remains that the US and Europe eventually find a compromise allowing Washington to meet its security objectives in Greenland without a full rupture in relations.

Even in a more adverse scenario, the bank does not expect a wholesale exit from US assets. Instead, any dollar weakness would likely reflect low hedging ratios among foreign investors rather than a mass divestment. Barclays added that Europe’s fiscal constraints mean the bar for policy-driven euro support remains high unless there is coordinated joint issuance to fund common defence capabilities.",https://images.investinglive.com/images/eurusd%20charrt%20update%2021%20January%202026_id_5809a09a-faac-4251-8005-82cfeef4dfac_size975.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 21:01:00.789090

Despite recent challenges, Kraft Heinz maintains a robust market position with a market capitalization of approximately $28.12 billion.

Kraft Heinz (KHC) has announced in a recent regulatory filing that it has taken steps to register the possible resale of up to 325,442,152 shares of its common stock. This action is in accordance with the terms outlined in the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, which dates back to July 2, 2015. This agreement involves The Kraft Heinz Company, 3G Global Food Holdings LP, and Berkshire Hathaway. The company submitted a prospectus supplement to the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 20, 2026, to facilitate this registration exclusively for the Selling Stockholder. This move potentially positions these shares for resale in the open market.

The Kraft Heinz Company, formed through the merger of Kraft and Heinz in July 2015, stands as one of North America's largest food and beverage manufacturers. The company is strategically positioned in the Consumer Defensive sector, specifically within the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. Its extensive portfolio includes well-known brands such as Oscar Mayer, Velveeta, and Philadelphia. With a market capitalization of approximately $28.12 billion, Kraft Heinz operates a vast distribution network that spans over 190 countries and territories, contributing to nearly 25% of its consolidated sales base outside North America.

Financial Health Analysis

Kraft Heinz's financial performance reflects a complex landscape. The company's revenue stands at $25.16 billion, with a three-year revenue growth rate of 0%. Despite a gross margin of 33.71%, the company faces challenges with a net margin of -17.35% and an EPS of -3.73. The operating margin is relatively strong at 19.45%, but the EBITDA margin is negative at -18.65%.

On the balance sheet, Kraft Heinz exhibits a current ratio of 1.13 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.51, indicating moderate leverage. The Altman Z-Score of 0.42 places the company in the distress zone, suggesting a potential risk of bankruptcy within the next two years. Insider activity reveals a trend of selling, with 250,000 shares sold in the past three months.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

In terms of valuation, Kraft Heinz's P/S ratio of 1.12 and P/B ratio of 0.68 are close to their historical lows, suggesting potential undervaluation. The forward P/E ratio is 9.47, indicating a cautious market outlook. Analyst recommendations average at 2.9, reflecting a hold sentiment. Technical indicators such as the RSI of 42.76 and moving averages suggest a neutral to slightly bearish trend.

Institutional ownership is robust at 83.5%, while insider ownership is relatively low at 0.96%. Recent insider activity has been predominantly selling, with no insider purchases in the past year.

IBM Deepens Enterprise AI Push With Governance Focus And GRAMMY IQ

Simply Wall St

Reviewed by Bailey Pemberton

January 20, 2026

IBM launched IBM Enterprise Advantage, a new offering focused on enterprise AI adoption and governance.

The company announced a collaboration with e& to deploy one of the region's first enterprise-grade agentic AI governance solutions.

IBM also worked on GRAMMY IQ, applying its AI capabilities to fan engagement in entertainment.

International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is leaning further into enterprise AI with products and partnerships that aim to embed AI into core business and compliance workflows. The company’s recent moves come with the stock around $291.35 and a 1 year return of 33.3%, along with multi year gains of 129.7% over 3 years and 206.3% over 5 years.

IBM Enterprise Advantage and the e& collaboration point in the same direction: IBM is leaning into agentic, governed AI as a core part of how large organizations run workflows, particularly in risk, compliance, and complex data environments. GRAMMY IQ then shows the same toolset applied to a consumer facing setting, which may help IBM showcase watsonx and its Granite models to a wide audience while still focusing on enterprise grade use cases behind the scenes.

How This Fits the International Business Machines Narrative

These announcements line up closely with existing narratives that emphasize IBM’s focus on hybrid cloud, AI and software execution, with consulting used as the delivery engine. Enterprise Advantage, in particular, speaks to the idea that IBM aims to be the partner that helps clients weave AI into day to day decision making, while the e& deployment and GRAMMY IQ give concrete proof points that may matter to investors who are tracking execution rather than just high level AI messaging.

Risks and Rewards Investors Are Weighing

Enterprise Advantage could support IBM’s push toward higher value consulting and software style engagements if clients adopt internal AI platforms at scale.

The e& deployment and GRAMMY IQ give IBM reference cases in both regulated and consumer settings, which may help win future AI and hybrid cloud work.

Analysts have highlighted execution risk around software and AI, and these offerings still need to translate into sustained revenue growth and margins to support more optimistic narratives.

IBM’s debt level remains a consideration for some investors when assessing how much flexibility the company has to keep investing in AI, quantum and acquisitions.

What To Watch Next

From here, it is useful to watch how many large clients adopt Enterprise Advantage, how broadly the e& governance solution is rolled out, and whether high profile projects like GRAMMY IQ lead to repeat work in other industries.

The companies said the consortium is open to engagement with project developers, investors, and stakeholders active in ecological restoration.","Scor, a French global reinsurance company headquartered, providing life, health, property, and casualty reinsurance services worldwide, and Axa, a French multinational insurance and financial services group, have launched a Lloyd’s consortium focused on ecological restoration, targeting a segment of environmental risk long left outside mainstream insurance coverage.

The consortium aims to support financing for ecological restoration projects by reducing investment risk tied to implementation phases.

By providing insurance protection, the partners intend to unlock capital for projects restoring ecosystems damaged or destroyed by prior activity.

The initiative, branded Restore, is led by Scor Syndicate 2015 at Lloyd’s and managed by Scor Managing Agency. Capacity support comes from Axa XL Syndicate 2003.

Combined reach and balance sheet strength allow the structure to underwrite larger and more complex restoration projects across multiple regions.

Scor and Axa said the consortium addresses a gap in the insurance market where projects aimed at ecosystem recovery struggle to secure protection during early and execution-heavy stages.

Restore underwrites the phase where conditions for ecological recovery are established, a point where uncertainty often deters investors.

The launch builds on Scor’s Nature Restoration and Conservation initiative introduced in May 2024. That programme focuses on insurance solutions designed to support restoration and rehabilitation projects built around long-term environmental resilience.

Jean-Paul Conoscente said the Restore structure increases the probability of project completion by improving confidence for developers and financiers.

Partnering with Axa, allows Scor to expand capacity and address environmental challenges at greater scale.

The companies said the consortium is open to engagement with project developers, investors, and stakeholders active in ecological restoration.

The aim is to build a pipeline of insurable projects where risk transfer helps convert environmental ambition into deployable capital.",https://beinsure.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2-25.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 20:00:08.575978

Greater Wellington Chair Daran Ponter says that the strong rating during a time of major government reforms and uncertainty is a valuable indicator of Greater Wellington’s fiscal responsibility.

“This rating makes it clear that while Greater Wellington is doing everything it can to deliver value for money services to our ratepayers, the proposed rate caps and other pressures from central government are putting a huge strain on our ability to do so,” says Cr Ponter.

Chair of the Finance, Risk and Audit Committee, Yadana Saw, says reforms are likely to erode existing core services while also threatening the viability of longer-term strategic projects.

“Changes to the Resource Management Act, rate capping and a review of the role of regional councils could negatively affect our future financial landscape, which makes it harder for us deliver on a cleaner environment, a more flood resilient region and critical public transport improvements.”

New York Adopts Two Bills Regulating Commercial Use of AI-Generated Content

Supergoop! Sunscreen Hit With False Ad Class Action Claiming ""Mineral"" Products Contain ""Unnatural"" Ingredients

FTC Sets Aside Rytr Order, Finding Prior Order Was Not Supported by the Complaint

New York AG Scrutinizes Instacart's Algorithmic Pricing Practices

On January 8, 2026, the New York Attorney General's Office sent a formal information request to Instacart seeking details about its pricing practices and compliance with New York's recently enacted Algorithmic Pricing Disclosure Act. The AG's letter follows a December 2025 report by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative alleging that Instacart users were shown materially different prices for identical products at the same stores and at the same time.

The AG's letter raises concerns that Instacart's pricing experiments—and the tools it offers to retailers and CPG brands—may constitute ""personalized algorithmic pricing"" under New York law, which requires a clear and conspicuous disclosure whenever an algorithm sets prices using personal data. The Attorney General specifically questions whether Instacart's current disclosures, which appear only through fine-print links on certain pages, satisfy the statute's disclosure requirements.

Although Instacart has publicly stated that it ended item-level price testing in December and that its testing did not rely on personal or behavioral data, the AG notes that Instacart has also acknowledged that retail and brand partners may continue to test promotions and discounts on the platform. The letter seeks extensive information about Instacart's pricing tools (including Eversight and smart cart technology), agreements with retailers and brands, the scope of any price experiments, and how consumer data may be used in pricing or promotions.

Why it matters: This inquiry signals heightened enforcement attention on algorithmic pricing and transparency—particularly where platforms, retailers, or brands rely on automated tools to test prices, discounts, or promotions. Companies operating in New York should carefully evaluate whether any pricing variability could be viewed as ""personalized algorithmic pricing"" and whether disclosures are sufficiently clear, prominent, and consistently presented wherever prices are displayed.

New York Adopts Two Bills Regulating Commercial Use of AI-Generated Content

New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed two bills on December 11, 2025, that together expand New York's approach to AI transparency and post-mortem rights of publicity in entertainment-adjacent contexts.

Synthetic performers in advertising (S.8420-A / A.8887-B). The first law amends New York's General Business Law to require a clear and conspicuous disclosure when an advertisement includes an AI-generated ""synthetic performer."" The law includes carveouts for certain audio advertisements and for situations where AI is used solely to translate the language of a human performer, and it generally does not apply to ads or promotional materials for certain expressive works (e.g., films/TV/streaming/video games) where the use of the synthetic performer is consistent with its use in the expressive work. A first violation may result in a $1,000 civil penalty, with $5,000 for subsequent violations. The disclosure requirement becomes effective 180 days after enactment (approximately June 2026, based on the December 11, 2025, signing).

Post-mortem name/image/likeness and digital replicas (S.8391 / A.8882). The second law strengthens New York's right of publicity framework by requiring consent from heirs or executors for the commercial use of a deceased individual's name, image, or likeness after death. In addition, it updates the definitions and liability standards applicable to digital replicas—including tightening the rules for using a deceased performer's digital replica in certain expressive works by moving from a disclaimer-oriented approach toward a prior-consent model. The bill takes effect immediately.

Key Takeaways

These bills illustrate an accelerating state-level push to address AI-enabled impersonation and consumer confusion in advertising while simultaneously expanding protections against unauthorized post-mortem commercialization. For advertisers and studios, the practical compliance focus is (i) auditing whether campaigns use synthetic performers (and whether an exception applies), (ii) building disclosure into production workflows ahead of the June 2026 effective date, and (iii) obtaining appropriate rights and permissions—particularly where a campaign uses a deceased individual's identity or a digital replica in a way that could trigger New York's consent requirements.

Supergoop! Sunscreen Hit With False Ad Class Action Claiming ""Mineral"" Products Contain ""Unnatural"" Ingredients

Supergoop! was the target of a proposed California class action alleging that its marketing of certain sunscreen products as ""100% Mineral"" and ""Mineral"" is false and misleading under state consumer protection laws.

According to the complaint, the plaintiff alleges that reasonable consumers interpret ""100% Mineral"" claims to mean that the entire product formula, not just the active sunscreen ingredients, consists solely of mineral or natural ingredients and does not contain synthetic, chemically altered, or otherwise non-mineral components. The plaintiff further alleges that Supergoop's use of ""100% Mineral"" language creates a net impression that the products are free from non-mineral or highly processed ingredients.

This complaint challenges labeling and marketing for more than a dozen Supergoop sunscreen products sold nationwide, including products marketed for adults and children. Plaintiff alleges that, contrary to the challenged representations, the products contain numerous non-mineral ingredients. In addition, the complaint asserts that certain ingredients derived from minerals or natural sources have been subjected to significant chemical processing or modification, resulting in ingredients that are materially different from their original mineral or natural form.

The lawsuit asserts claims under California's Unfair Competition Law and False Advertising Law and seeks restitution, injunctive relief, punitive damages, and attorneys' fees on behalf of a proposed statewide class of California purchasers. Supergoop denies the allegations, and the case is in its early stages.

Key Takeaways

The case reflects continued litigation risk around ""100%"", ""free-of,"" ""natural,"" and ""mineral"" claims—particularly where plaintiffs argue that consumers reasonably interpret such claims to apply to an entire formulation rather than discrete components. While some courts have been open to crediting reasonable consumers with the ability to read ingredient declarations, this isn't universal and frequently turns on the specifics of the label. One thing is certain, which is that ingredient-based claims remain the most common risk point for CPG claims. Brands can manage this risk through thoughtful use of qualifiers and marketing copy.

FTC Sets Aside Rytr Order, Finding Prior Order Was Not Supported by the Complaint

The Federal Trade Commission has reopened and set aside its December 2024 consent order against Rytr LLC, concluding that the complaint underlying the order failed to plead facts sufficient to support a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act.

Rytr offers an AI-enabled writing assistance service, including functionality that could be used to generate draft consumer reviews. In 2024, the FTC alleged that this service provided the ""means and instrumentalities"" for deception and constituted an unfair practice because it could generate large volumes of reviews without regard to accuracy. Rytr agreed to settle those allegations through a consent order that broadly barred it from offering any AI-enabled service designed to generate consumer reviews or testimonials.

In its December 2025 Order Reopening and Setting Aside the 2024 Order, the Commission determined that the complaint did not adequately plead either theory of liability. With respect to the means-and-instrumentalities claim, the FTC concluded that the complaint failed to allege that Rytr itself created deceptive marketing content, that its service was inherently deceptive, or that Rytr knew or had reason to know its customers would use the tool to violate the law. The Commission emphasized that providing a general-purpose tool with legitimate, pro-consumer uses—such as assisting users in drafting or editing review content—does not, without more, establish liability under Section 5.

The FTC also concluded that the complaint failed to plead an unfairness violation. The allegations did not establish that Rytr's service caused or was likely to cause substantial consumer injury, nor did they plausibly allege that any such injury outweighed countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Because the complaint failed to plead a cognizable Section 5 violation, the Commission found that the consent order provided no consumer benefit and was therefore not in the public interest.

In reaching this conclusion, the FTC also cited recent federal policy directives calling on agencies to review and, where appropriate, set aside final orders that unduly burden artificial intelligence innovation. The Commission stressed, however, that its decision rested on the legal insufficiency of the complaint itself. The FTC reiterated that it would continue to pursue enforcement where AI tools are used to deceive consumers or where companies misrepresent the capabilities or outputs of AI-enabled products.

What could change if CMS updates its Medicare policies for TAVR?

CMS first finalized its national coverage determination (NCD) for TAVR back in 2012 and then revisited that policy in 2019. Now, after receiving a formal request from Edwards Lifesciences, CMS is once again reconsidering the NCD to determine if any major updates are needed.

It is not exactly clear how far CMS is thinking about going with its changes to the TAVR NCD, but multiple major updates appear to be on the table.

The end of CED requirements

TAVR techniques and technologies have evolved significantly in recent years, and Edwards said in its request that coverage policies need to evolve as well. For example, the TAVR NCD has always included coverage with evidence development (CED) rules that require patient data to be gathered through clinical trials or registries. CED requirements are meant to be temporary, Edwards argued, and the TAVR has matured enough as a therapy that these restrictions are no longer necessary.

“TAVR is among the most rigorously studied medical device technologies subject to CED,” according to the Edwards. “Through this NCD reconsideration, CMS has an opportunity to demonstrate responsiveness to the extensive evidence collected to date by establishing a successful end to CED for TAVR.”

Approved TAVR procedures for asymptomatic patients

Edwards also asked CMS to consider fully covering TAVR in asymptomatic patients. TAVR was initially approved for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS)—no symptoms meant no procedure—but there has been a push in recent years to approve treatment in asymptomatic patients who present with signs of severe AS on medical imaging results.

Edwards has been leading that particular charge, pointing to clinical evidence from the EARLY TAVR clinical trial—which it sponsored—as proof that treating these patients right away provides significant value.

In May 2025, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officially approved Edwards’ balloon-expandable Sapien 3 TAVR platform for the treatment of asymptomatic AS, it became clear the company would be pushing CMS to rethink its current coverage policies.

Even experts who do not necessarily agree with treating asymptomatic patients with TAVR still largely believe CMS and the FDA should to be on the same page. When the FDA is approving medical devices for specific therapies, but CMS does not cover the therapy in question, it creates the potential for considerable confusion.

A changing approach to multidisciplinary heart teams

For Medicare to cover any TAVR procedure, there are rules in place that required at least one cardiac surgeon to be consulted. Now that the procedure has evolved, however, there is a belief among some TAVR advocates that surgeon evaluations are no longer necessary and an interventional cardiologist can handle any treatment decisions.

The Edwards request pointed to positive outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, a time when collaborations were harder in healthcare for logistical reasons, as evidence that surgeons only need to be consulted on more complex cases. CMS now appears to be considering changes to these requirements.

Potential changes receive mixed feedback

CMS announced its intention to reconsider the current NCD for TAVR in December, urging stakeholders to share public comments by Jan. 14. Medical societies, medtech vendors, cardiologists, surgeons and many other stakeholders all stepped forward to share their perspective.

Leading medical societies share unified statement

Five leading U.S. medical societies responsible for the treatment of patients with severe AS collaborated on a unified response to the CMS request. The American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS), American College of Cardiology (ACC), Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA), Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) and Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) all signed on to the statement

One key takeaway from the statement is that the societies think it is still too early to end the CED requirements. Registry data and clinical trials have provided substantial evidence that directly led to TAVR being offered to additional patient populations, the groups wrote. They emphasized that real-world evidence and clinical data remain necessary as the procedure continues to evolve.

“The societies strongly believe that continuation of the CED paradigm is essential to address existing and emerging clinical questions,” they wrote. “Submission of data on all TAVR procedures to a national registry should remain a requirement.”

The five societies also appear to accept that TAVR may be covered for the treatment of asymptomatic patients in the near future. This remains a relatively controversial topic among cardiologists and cardiac surgeons, with some embracing the use of asymptomatic TAVR and others fearful that it could put patents at risk, but it does appear to be inevitable in the wake of the FDA’s approval of the Edwards platform.

Instead of arguing against the treatment of asymptomatic patients, the groups highlighted the importance of maintaining high-quality patient care. Treating AS requires a “comprehensive, team-based approach,” they wrote, and multi-disciplinary teams should remain at the center of any treatment decisions.

Medtronic shares its own perspective on potential TAVR coverage changes

Medtronic and Edwards are largely seen as the two leading TAVR vendors in the United States. Edwards was the company that initially got this process started, but what does Medtronic think about these potential changes? The company shared a public comment that summarized where it stands.

Overall, Medtronic said it remains in support of CED as “a mechanism to support coverage and evidence generation.” Data can be captured in a “minimally burdensome manner,” the company wrote, and doing so is beneficial for both providers and the patients they serve.

In addition, Medtronic shared its concerns about Medicare coverage being approved for symptomatic patients. While the initial approval of TAVR in symptomatic patients was based on a significant amount of data, the company wrote, there is still only limited data on the treatment of patients who present without symptoms.

“While promising, the evidence of efficacy of TAVR in asymptomatic patients is focused on one trial plus another which is noted to have inadequate statistical power, with two more randomized controlled trials currently enrolling,” according to the Medtronic comment.

Medtronic also said it still wants cardiac surgeons to be involved in treatment decisions, highlighting the importance of their experience and expertise when it comes to surgical aortic valve replacement.

Edwards provides an additional comment

Edwards did issue a public comment of its own. The company reiterated that it believes 1.) the NCD’s CED requirements have been satisfied, and 2.) TAVR should be covered for the treatment of asymptomatic severe AS.

However, Edwards also said it believes cardiac surgeons should remain a central part of any multidisciplinary heart team. Removing surgeons from TAVR discussions is one potential change the company does not appear to support.

The full Edwards statement is available here.

Other public comments show a variety of responses

CMS received a total of 170 public comments about the TAVR NCD. Many of those comments cheered the possibility that there could soon be fewer restrictions on patient car, but others included genuine concerns about how things might unfold if too many changes are put into place.

For now, CMS certainly has a lot of feedback to consider. A proposed decision memo is expected in June 2026.

SUMMARY

U.S. Bancorp (USB 0.04%) reported record revenue and earnings, citing broad-based growth in both net interest income and fee revenue. Strategic focus included disciplined expense management, sustainable operating leverage, and continued investments in technology and productivity. Management emphasized deposit growth, especially in consumer and operational accounts, along with improved capital and credit quality metrics. The planned BTIG acquisition is projected to meaningfully increase quarterly fee revenues and support capital markets growth, with minimal initial impact on capital ratios or EPS due to merger-related costs. Guidance for 2026 reflects confidence in both net interest and fee income expansion, further supported by flexibility in expense controls if revenue growth slows.

John Stern stated, ""We expect merger-related costs to happen in the next quarter or two. And so as that occurs, that will keep the EPS neutral. And so, after that, then we expect to have some, obviously, we'll see margin expansion in this business once we get through those costs.""

Loan growth expectations for 2026 are in the 3%-4% range, led by commercial, credit card, and improving commercial real estate segments.

Gunjan Kedia described robust client demand in digital assets and highlighted the launch of custody offerings for cryptocurrency and stablecoin, supporting GFS and ETF growth.

The company expects deposit growth to track loan growth, with ongoing reductions in CDs and a focus on more accretive consumer and operational deposits.

Management highlighted that productivity gains from digital investments and AI are generating cost flexibility while allowing continued investment in fee-based growth areas.

The net interest margin outlook maintains a targeted path to 3% by 2027, with contribution from asset repricing and further deposit mix improvements.

Consumer deposit balances rose $7 billion, and the company noted momentum in acquiring new client accounts and leveraging digital tools nationally.

Global Fund Services achieved nearly half of all new U.S. ETF launches in 2025, demonstrating market share gains in a high-growth, capital-efficient business.

Branch strategy centers on modernizing existing locations and achieving top-five market share in core geographies, with $200 million allocated to continuous branch investments annually.

Full Conference Call Transcript

Gunjan Kedia: Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. I will begin on Slide three. This quarter, we delivered strong earnings per share of $1.26, an increase of approximately 18% year over year on an adjusted basis. Net interest income this quarter increased 3.3% year over year, supported by strong consumer deposit growth. Fee revenue grew 7.6% year over year with broad-based strength across most of our fee businesses. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, we posted record net revenues of $7.4 billion and $28.7 billion, respectively. More specifically, in the fourth quarter, total net revenue grew 5.1%, and we delivered meaningful positive operating leverage of 440 basis points as adjusted.

John will provide more details on our financial performance in his opening remarks. Moving to Slide four. A clear focus this year has been on restoring investor confidence in our ability to deliver strong and more consistent financial results. For the second consecutive quarter, more focused execution on our three key priorities resulted in us operating within all of our medium-term target ranges. On Slide five, we highlight steady progress against our expense management priority. Four signature productivity programs have helped us deliver nine straight quarters of largely stable expenses. This has meaningfully contributed to our ability to deliver positive operating leverage of 370 basis points for the full year of 2025.

Our expense initiatives continue to generate sustainable productivity in our operations and will remain foundational disciplines going forward. In 2026, we will make strategic investments necessary to drive our growth, particularly in technology, sales, and marketing. As such, we expect revenue growth to be a stronger driver of continued positive operating leverage for the year. Slide six highlights our strong fee growth and improving mix. For the full year, fee income represented 42% of total net revenues for the company and grew 6.7% year over year. A highly diversified mix of fee revenue business is a core differentiator for our franchise.

Our organic growth strategy has focused on the principle of interconnected product solutions that have created unique value propositions and deeper relationships with our 15 million clients. In '26, we will remain highly focused on executing the initiatives that we launched in 2025. In addition, we are excited to close on our acquisition of BTIG and capture the considerable revenue synergies offered by that combination. On Slide seven, we recap the strategic rationale for this bolt-on acquisition. We've had a ten-year partnership with BTIG and have completed 350 deals or more together in that time frame.

Last week, after we announced, I heard from many of our clients who applauded this next step in our partnership, which gives us confidence around the cultural fit between our two organizations and our ability to build an extraordinary capital markets franchise that can support an even broader array of client needs. We look forward to updating you on our progress there at a future analyst conference. Let me turn to Slide eight. We briefly spotlight our global fund services business, which generated strong fee revenue growth for the company this year. GFS is a highly capital-efficient business that serves our institutional clients, in particular private capital, and asset managers across the U.S. and Europe.

The products offered by GFS attract high-quality operational deposits, money market assets under management, and capital markets business such as foreign exchange. BTIG capabilities will further support growth in this business. As you can see from the chart on the left, GFS total net revenue has grown at a healthy 11% CAGR since 2021 and grew at 12% in 2025. We have some unique product capabilities for start-up and first-time ETFs and have onboarded nearly half of all new U.S. ETF launches in 2025. The underlying drivers of performance within this business are continuing to gain momentum as ETFs stay in favor with investors for their cost efficiency and recent favorable regulatory changes.

And we continue to innovate in areas like digital assets and derivative-based ETF products. Moving to Slide nine. Our payments transformation is a strategic and long-term priority for the company. Today, a payments product is oftentimes the first and the most frequent engagement with clients, especially with Gen Z. Embedded interconnected payments capabilities are fundamental to retaining, deepening, and growing our future client franchise. The chart on the left shows the steady strengthening of growth rates for our payments businesses as we execute our transformation. With our payments leadership team now fully in place, we have hit our stride on execution.

In '26, we expect to maintain momentum on our transformation and add additional focus on the small business segment for both card and merchant. Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income and margin are both improving. We delivered record consumer deposits this quarter. The effectiveness of products like BankSmartly, more sophisticated pricing capabilities, and a significant overhaul of skills, training, digital tools, and incentives together with investments in our branches, drove our performance. Additionally, commercial real estate loans also showed modest growth after eleven quarters of decline. Today, our balance sheet is poised for continued NII growth. On the loan side, we will drive commercial and credit card loans to deepen client relationships.

On the deposit side, we'll drive consumer and operational deposits to improve our funding mix. Turning to Slide 11. Operating within our medium-term target ranges has resulted in leading EPS growth as adjusted in 2025, even with more modest buybacks as compared with the industry. Let me now turn the call over to John, who will take you through more details of the quarter.

John Stern: Thank you, Gunjan, and good morning, everyone. This was another strong quarter for us, driven by continued new business momentum and an improving macroeconomic environment. If I could turn your attention to Slide 12, I'll start with some highlights for the quarter followed by a discussion of fourth-quarter earnings trends. As Gunjan mentioned, we reported earnings per common share of $1.26 and achieved record net revenue of $7.4 billion this quarter. Revenue growth benefited from improved spread income, and all fee categories performed well. Key credit quality metrics improved both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. As of December 31, our tangible book value per common share increased 18.2% on a year-over-year basis. Slide 13 provides our key performance metrics.

This quarter, we delivered a return on tangible common equity of 18.4%, a return on average assets of 1.19%, and an efficiency ratio of 57.4%. All improvements on a year-over-year basis. Slide 14 provides a balance sheet summary. Total average deposits increased 0.7% linked quarter to $515 billion as we continue to emphasize growth in our consumer and relationship-based deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased both sequentially and year over year, as we gained traction across several institutional fee businesses, like treasury management and Global Corporate Trust. Our percentage of noninterest-bearing to total average deposits remained stable at approximately 16%.

Average loans totaled $384 billion, up 1.4% from the prior quarter, on accelerating year-over-year growth in our focus areas of commercial and credit card loans, which grew 10% and 15.7%, respectively. On an ending basis, these loans now represent approximately 48% of total loans for the bank, compared to approximately 45% last year. The ending balance on our investment portfolio as of December 31 remained at $171 billion. Turning to Slide 15. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $4.3 billion, an increase of 1.4% on a linked quarter basis, primarily driven by favorable deposit mix shift.

Net interest margin increased two basis points sequentially to 2.77% as we look to achieve greater margin expansion in the medium term. Slide 16 highlights fee revenue trends within noninterest income. Total fee income was approximately $3.05 billion, an increase of 7.6% on a year-over-year basis with broad-based growth across our payments, institutional, and consumer fee businesses. For the full year, fee income increased 6.7% compared to the prior year. In 2025, we benefited from high single-digit growth in our institutional fee businesses, continued strength within Impact Finance, and stronger payments revenue. Turning to Slide 17. Noninterest expense totaled approximately $4.2 billion, up 0.7% linked quarter as FDIC expense favorability was partially offset by severance charges.

Slide 18 highlights improved asset quality trends. This quarter, our ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.41% at December 31, an improvement of two basis points linked quarter and seven basis points year over year. The net charge-off ratio improved to 0.54%, a two basis point decrease sequentially, while our allowance for credit losses of $7.9 billion represented 2.03% of period-end loans. Turning to Slide 19. As of December 31, our common equity Tier one capital ratio was 10.8%, or 9.3%, including AOCI. On Slide 20, we provide a comparison of our fourth quarter and full-year results to our previous guidance.

For the fourth quarter, net interest income, fee revenue, and noninterest expense all exceeded our previous guidance. Taken together, this resulted in another quarter of meaningful positive operating leverage for the company. For the full year, revenue growth of 4% hit the midpoint of our full-year guidance expectations, while positive operating leverage meaningfully outperformed our full-year 2025 outlook. Moving to Slide 21, I'll now provide full-year and first-quarter 2026 forward-looking guidance. Starting with the full year of 2026, we expect total net revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 6% compared to the prior year. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage of 200 basis points or more for the full year.

Our guidance excludes the impact of the BTIG acquisition, which is expected to contribute $175 million to $200 million of fee revenue per quarter. I have provided some additional details on page 30 of the appendix. Let me now provide first-quarter 2026 guidance. Net interest growth on a fully taxable equivalent basis is expected to be in the range of 3% to 4% compared to 2025. Total fee revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 5% to 6% compared to 2025. And we expect total noninterest expense growth of approximately 1% compared to 2025. Turning to Slide 22. We continue to operate within our medium-term target ranges.

Our consistent execution against these ranges will remain a key focus entering 2026, and we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to strengthen our performance and build on these results over time. Let me now hand it back to Gunjan for closing remarks.

Gunjan Kedia: Thank you, John. We are wrapping up 2025 with a significant leadership transition behind us and strong momentum going into 2026. The banking industry will likely see meaningful shifts in capital supervision, digital assets, AI, and novel banks in the coming years. Our scale, business mix, and culture position us for success. We remain focused on executing our priorities to drive organic growth, high returns, productivity, and strong risk management. Finally, I would like to offer a special thanks to many of you for your well wishes for Minneapolis, where we are headquartered. With all the challenges this community is facing, we remain focused on our clients and our teams.

With that, we will now open the call for your questions.

Operator: At this time, as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, press star and the number one on your telephone keypad. And our first question comes from Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Scott Siefers: Let's see. John, let's thought I'd start with you. Can you please speak to how you might think about the pace of share repurchase as this year plays out given you're increasing the capital ratio toward the 10% CAT two target? You'd, of course, dipped your toe back in at the end of last year, but would love to hear your thoughts on the go forward.

John Stern: Sure, Scott, and good morning. In terms of share repurchases, we've made a tremendous amount of progress in our capital build over the last several years, and we obviously have business momentum behind us. And of course, our first priority is going to be client and loan growth as we move forward with obviously then a focus on capital return to our shareholders. But knowing all that, our intention is to grow our share repurchase amount starting this quarter in a gradual way. Likely go from $100 million or so to $200 million and then the commitment to glide into our 75% payout target that we have over time.

Scott Siefers: Terrific. Okay. Good. Thank you. And then just sort of a broader question. Given all the noise regarding whether it's credit card rate caps and then, you know, newer chatter regarding the Credit Card Competition Act. Could you speak to how you all are thinking about how, I guess, how USD is thinking about these possible responses in you know, how are these granted they're all sort of in flight, but, you know, what are you all thinking about at this point?

Gunjan Kedia: Scott, good morning. You know, our estimate is that 90 plus percent of our clients will see a detrimental impact if there was an across-the-board 10% rate cap on credit cards. The impact to 50% of the clients will be crushed as it will be for the economy. We have observed that just in the last few days, the conversation around the rate cap has shifted more productively to options for customers to help them in the short term. So just as a reminder, our shield credit card offers twenty-four months of 0% APR for consumers. And in fact, most card issuers have some product of that sort.

So we think that's a productive conversation and we are thinking of ways to increase communications, financial education to try and make sure people know what options they have. But that's sort of the momentum. The CCCA, as you asked, has come and gone many times. There are very credible reasons why that would be very costly for many small merchants and not achieve the goal intended. So at this point, we continue to it, but it is not a meaningful planning that we are focused on.

Scott Siefers: Gotcha. Okay. Terrific. Thank you very much for the color.

Operator: Our next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

John Pancari: Morning. I just wanna ask a bit around the revenue growth expectation of 4% to 6% for 2026. I appreciate the color you gave around the first quarter. In terms of the spread income versus the fee growth expectation. Could you possibly help us and kind of how that think about how that could play out for the full year in terms of some of the, you know, the balance sheet dynamics in terms of the growth expectations and your margin outlook. Then the same thing on the fee side, how should we think about the breakout of that total revenue when you look at '26?

John Stern: Sure. It's John. Thanks, John. So the way we think about the revenue growth this year, obviously, we gave you the 4% to 6% on that side of the thing. But given the momentum that we have and what we see today, we think that mid-single-digit growth is appropriate for both net interest income and fee revenue growth. So maybe just to break it out a little bit. So on net interest income, as an example, we expect that to strengthen over time. We have 3% to 4% here in the first quarter. But with the increase in loan pipelines that we see as well as NIM expansion as that continues, we do expect that to grow.

And then fees, we expect that to have a more consistent approach and performance as we look through the course of the year. Of course, that's gonna be led by many of our key businesses like trust capital markets, impact finance, and payments. So overall, we see a lot of momentum in the businesses. We've had several good quarters here in a row, our job is now to continue to execute on the strategy.

John Pancari: Got it. Alright. Thanks for that, John. And then, Gunjan, you mentioned that revenue rather than expenses may be a bigger driver of the expected positive operating leverage in 2026. If revenue doesn't cooperate, can you discuss the flexibility that you still may have to achieve the 200 basis points plus and positive operating leverage? Like, what are your levers and do you have flexibility around the strategic investments that you that you emphasized?

Gunjan Kedia: John, good morning. The short answer is yes. Our productivity and expense management is being created in a very fundamental way. You'll remember that for six years, we have been investing very heavily in digital capabilities. Nearly all back-end platforms have been upgraded, and that creates a lot of productivity once you start getting the operations aligned. You add to it the AI boost we are seeing in big expense pools. So we are very confident about expense management. We have aggressive plans to invest back in the business, just to drive the revenue growth, especially fee revenue growth in businesses like capital markets and payments that attract more expenses. But we have a lot of ability to flex that.

Those are not long-term investments. Things like sales and marketing are quarterly investments. So we are very committed to our meaningful positive operating leverage, and we expect it to come from revenue. But something happens in the macroeconomic environment, we have levers on expenses.

John Pancari: Great. Thank you.

Gunjan Kedia: Thank you. Thanks, John.

Operator: Next question comes from John McDonald from Truist.

John McDonald: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering, John, if you could expand a little bit about your outlook for balance sheet growth in 2026 and any mix shifts or trade-offs that you want to highlight between loans within loans and also loans earning assets. You had given a forecast last year, early last year about balance sheet growth by the end of the year and it had some mix shift. So I just wanna get an update on that.

John Stern: Sure. Good morning, John. Yeah. So largely, I think you're talking about the slide that we had in the first quarter of last year, talking about our asset growth and things like that. I think that still holds. We still feel like that's that range is the appropriate range for our balance sheet. Maybe just to go into some of the pieces, you know, we do expect loan growth to be stronger this year. Probably more in the 3% to 4% loan growth area led by commercial and card again. But, you know, we also see that commercial real estate is starting to grow, and we expect that to be a help in terms of growth there.

We do expect that deposits will continue to grow consummate with loans. That should be kind of one for one in the way we're looking at it. And in terms of other assets, I expect the investment portfolio to kind of flex based on if loan growth is faster, we'll probably have fewer investment portfolio and other earning assets. And if it's less, then perhaps we kind of keep the balances the same. So those are going to be kind of as we go manage through the quarter, we'll go and see how that progresses.

But all this is to say that the mix is improving in the balance sheet, and that's going to continue throughout 2026, and that's what gives us confidence in the NIM expansion as well.

John McDonald: Great. And maybe just on that note, you could give us your updated thoughts on the timeline for the NIM expansion, you know, to get to 3% over the next year or two. And in addition to that loan mix shift, what are just an update on some of the fixed asset reprice drivers. Thank you.

John Stern: Sure. Yeah. So, I think, first of all, there's no change to our outlook. We still feel there's definitely a path to 3% in 2027. The drivers of net interest margin are going to be the mix that I just mentioned as well as the fixed asset repricing. What I would say there on the fixed asset repricing is that we'll have slightly or we'll have more balances that should reprice this year than last year. But it'll be likely at a lower spread just because the nature of long-term rates have come down over the course of the year, and based on our forecast. So those are kind of the pieces.

And then the deposit mix is gonna continue to improve with the focus on consumer deposit growth, which we've been very successful at growing this year, as well as commercial deposits that are tied to strong fee categories like treasury management, institutional businesses, and things like that. So that's all, again, a big focus for us as we look into 2026 and continued NIM expansion.

John McDonald: Okay. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Ebrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I guess good morning. Maybe, John, just hey, John. Following up on the slide 10 on the deposit growth, just spend some time talking about drivers of deposit growth. You're having the mix towards consumer deposits. What's driving that net? Is that accretive as we think should we continue to think about that mix shifting to the consumer side? And how accretive is that when we think about either deposit margin or the overall margin? Thanks.

John Stern: Sure. So, you know, on the deposit, a couple of things are going on in the deposit growth. This over the course of the year, we saw steady growth in the consumer deposits. And as that Slide 10 illustrates, we continue to believe that is accretive and it is helpful to bring in new accounts and clients to the bank typically that are younger, more affluent base that we have, and this is particularly in our BankSmartly product, which is a savings and a card tied together. We've seen very good success in growing that savings product over the course of the year. We find these clients to be stickier, and that's going to be overall long periods of time.

That's gonna be very helpful from our funding cost perspective. The other thing we're focused on the commercial side is a reduction in CDs. We reduced our CD count by $6 billion this quarter. We are at the lowest point in CD usage in the last ten quarters. So that has been that will be helpful going forward to our mix. In our wholesale and institutional balances are gonna be really driven by our core institutional and, like, fund services, corporate trust, treasury management, and other middle market and other type of accounts that's gonna give us. So the mix is gonna be very important for us as we move forward.

Gunjan Kedia: And, Ebrahim, I can just add that we are very intentional about using the balance sheet to drive deeper relationships and fee-based businesses. An expansion in the core client franchise brings a lot of payments and card revenue and merchant revenue at the back end of it. So it's very accretive in the long run and very strategic for us as well. So the focus is very much on consumer deposits and operational wholesale deposits, which come with expansion of treasury management, investment services, and some of the fee-based products. That's one of the reasons we wanted to highlight the global fund services business.

While it's, you know, billion-dollar-like business for us, so not huge enough with it's a very important source of operational deposits.

Ebrahim Poonawala: That's helpful. And just a separate question, I guess, I think last quarter you all established a digital assets organization. Just talk to us. You put out a few press releases. A lot of energy around tokenization. Is there a role for USB to play there? And is that a needle mover as we think about either fees or deposit growth outlook for the bank?

Gunjan Kedia: Yes. Thank you. So let me just describe the world here a little bit from our perspective. We are obviously taking it seriously as an industry shock. That's why we stood up an organization called Digital Assets and Money Movement, and it's led by a very seasoned payments executive for us. We have seen progress in two very distinct areas. The first is on capital markets where the investment side around cryptocurrency stablecoins is leading to demand for core custody type of capabilities. We have almost $12 trillion in assets there. We were very quick to stand up a cryptocurrency custody offer. Last year, we stood up a stablecoin custody offer.

Ibrahim, I'll tell you, last year has been a very brisk place of new ETF launches, and a large majority of them have been to take advantage of the digital assets. And we are seeing the revenue model come through in a very real way. And we think that's real and there's momentum. On the bigger conversation of payments, it's more speculative. So we do press releases because there's a lot of interest every time we actually conduct a stable coin transaction with some partner platforms. We have done many of those. I can't point to a specific revenue-generating use case.

The demand specifically from the client base is not very strong or real yet, the revenue model is still to be figured out. There's enough momentum there, both from a supervisory and commercial side that we expect to be very front-footed as this world evolves around payments.

Ebrahim Poonawala: That's good color. Thank you.

Gunjan Kedia: Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Mike Mayo: Hi. Well, you announced the acquisition of BTIG. And I think there's a little confusion. Is that the reason why you're slowing down buybacks? And just more generally, there's a few covered U.S. Bancorp for a while, and this is over two decades after you spun off Piper, and now you're you know, going back into the capital markets business a little bit more than you're already there. So if you can also just talk about the investments that you'll be making with BTIG, the business lines, what else that requires. I imagine this is kind of like a link and leverage deal where you buy a firm and you leverage it over your entire franchise, but I'm not sure.

On the other side, this, you know, what do you expect in terms of cap to market fees? Other opportunities for balance sheet growth? Thank you.

John Stern: Sure, Mike. I'll start on your share repurchase comment, then maybe I'll Gunjan will comment on the other side of questions that you had. There's no impact to our buyback. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, we'll be increasing our share repurchases from $100 million to $200 million this quarter. And then, thereafter, we'll glide into our eventual target of 75% that we've talked about. And so, this transaction is a 12 basis point impact on the CET one ratio. No more, no less. That's, that will be the impact no matter what the earnout or anything else. So, we feel really good about the financials, and it's not material to EPS.

This year, simply because there will be some merger-related costs that will offset any revenues for this or margin. So as we look to the following year, that will shift.

Gunjan Kedia: Mike, good morning. I'll just step back and maybe recap the strategic rationale. You know, our clients use both bank balance sheets and capital markets to manage their own balance sheets. We have had a lot of success with the fixed income side of our capital markets business that has grown organically over the last fourteen years or so, and it's now grown to about $1.4 billion in revenues for us. It's a sizable business. The last gap in our product lineup was the BTIG set of products. We've had a partnership with them for ten years. And it is true twenty years back Piper Jaffray was acquired.

And just as a reminder, we retained all of the wealth and asset management sites of Piper Jaffray, and those have become sizable businesses for us today with a lot of cultural fit. The capital markets wasn't appropriate for us at the time. It is very much more culturally aligned with what we do plus we know the property. On your balance sheet question, I think the issue is you're already deploying a very sizable balance sheet today against our commercial and corporate clients. And a broader lineup of fees leverages that balance sheet more. We do not expect the BTIG business in itself to be a big driver of additional sort of balance sheet usage.

But otherwise, lots of revenue synergies across our IS business, across our family office business. And we'll report on that more to you once the deal closes. And we give better guidance on what the economics of that deal will be like.

Mike Mayo: Alright. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Erika Najarian from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Erika Najarian: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. First question, period end assets ended at $692 billion for the year. And I guess this is a two-part question. First is, as you understand it, you know, how do the tailoring for proposals or the removal of tailoring proposals in you know, Washington, how would that positively impact that $700 billion crossing? And additionally, you know, as we think about John, that path to 3%, does that consider the currently more stringent liquidity requirements that you would need to adhere to if nothing changed on tailoring?

John Stern: Sure, Erica. Thanks for the question. So on the asset side, yes, we're continuing to grow. Obviously, as you know, it's a four-quarter average of assets that is the deciding factor in how when you trip into category two. You know, we're running our business without any regard to that level. We are growing our loans consummate with the industry. We wanna make sure we're there for our clients. Any rule that happens or change to the tailoring rules over this process will take in stride. We understand there's obviously been chatter about that. As folks on, in the regulatory spheres have talked about those perhaps being reindexed, but we don't know that for sure.

So in the meantime, we're gonna continue to do what we need to do on the growth and supporting our clients through that. And then, in terms of the consideration that you had, I'm just trying to remember your second question. It was on the LCR that you LCR. I'm sorry. Yeah. Thank you. On the LCR, there is no impact to that. We have that fully loaded into our calculus here as we think about the NIM. So, as we jump from a more modified LCR to a full LCR, there's no impact, and that's all incorporated into our guidance.

Erika Najarian: That was very helpful. Thank you. And just as a follow-up question, Gunjan, during prepared remarks, you talked about, you know, faster evolution of the banking industry and also in your, you know, responses to the other analyst questions, it seems like, you know, you have a very nimble organization in terms of how you're responding to these changes.

And, you know, as we think about the investments that you have to make you know, in terms of moving the continuing to move the company forward, you know, is there just enough productivity savings that you can identify where you can continue to invest for the future, whether it's nearer term like capital markets or medium term like you know, the digital asset transformation, you know, and still deliver on that positive operating leverage, you know, of 200 plus that it has been clear message to your investor base.

Gunjan Kedia: Thank you, Erica. Good morning. It's a very thoughtful question. And let me start really by the new investments in AI and stablecoin. They are actually very capitalized. There is so much support that is being provided to us from a whole suite of sort of partners who really like our business mix, our payments, and capital markets. You know, we are unusual in having sizable capabilities on both of those. And we've organized that data. As you know, we are on the cusp of category two transition, and that has given us a lot of imperative over the last two or three years to have better data. Collectively, we are a very important partner.

So we are getting a lot of support when we do these pilots on stablecoins. They're not huge investments yet. However, we stand ready to invest as needed when the market flexes. You have to learn. You have to have your products set ready. So I would say to you that for some time, at least, you're getting a lot of benefit of industry-wide investments to just scale up our product capability. The real investments we are making is to support our fee business growth. We are doing bigger deals, they come with more upfront cost. The payments transformation, if you think about the revenue model of payments, we are looking at acquired, but not installed business.

We are looking at sales pipelines, and the revenue model follows twelve to eighteen months after you sold the business. So we are very prepared for that kind of expense inflection. But also creating productivity. So I feel very comfortable with both investing heavily for organic growth and delivering a positive operating leverage. And again, I always want to remind when you spend 5 or 6 billion upgrading your digital investments, which we did over the last six years. You have a long runway to drive productivity out of them. Which we will.

Erika Najarian: Got it. Thank you for that.

Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Usdin from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Ken Usdin: Thanks. Good morning. A follow-up on that last point. So as you've made these all these investments, it's nice to see a little bit of improvement year over year in payments business fees in aggregate. I was just wondering just what's the pace of improvement that we could expect as you think about next year and to John's prior point about mid-single-digit growth on the fee side overall? How much does payments play a part of that? If you can kind of just talk through each of the each of the three businesses areas there. Thanks.

John Stern: Sure. Thanks. Appreciate the question. You know, absolutely, payments has a role in our mid-single-digit call for fees overall. But take it piece by piece, you know, card, we have a lot of progress with the Smart Leap program and other cards that we've introduced into the market. There's a tremendous focus on small business that we are very much focused on internally. So we have a lot of momentum there. We do expect mid-single-digit growth in this business for the year of 2026.

On the merchant side, as we talked about on our strategy, at a recent investor conference, we talked about, you know, increasing our margins through more distribution, and direct model, really being thoughtful about what verticals that we want to be a part of. And really focusing on that embedded software, and having that be a key component of our growth. And so, again, here, we think that mid-single-digit growth for the year is appropriate for this business as well. And then on the corporate payment side, clearly, you know, we saw improvement this year on a year-over-year basis, but it's still negative growth.

Just given the spend levels on the government side as well as just some caution just on the corporate T and E side of the equation. That will likely continue into the first half of the year, but should overall strengthen as we get through that. And that will, by the time we exit that, that will be more in the mid-single-digit range. So overall, single-digit for this business is what we should expect, and we're looking forward to executing our strategy.

Ken Usdin: Okay. Great. Thanks. Thanks, John. And just one follow-up on the credit card side on and charge-offs. That loss line has really settled down a little bit. Are we at kind of a new I know there's some seasonality, but, like, what's your expectations for card losses? You know, versus where we kinda ended the year and averaged for 25?

John Stern: Yeah. Thank you. So, you know, card, if I think about there's seasonality, so you should expect a little bit higher charge-off rate on card in the first half of the year just given that seasonality. But overall, if I just kind of look big picture on card 25 versus 26, we expect stability in that charge-off rate based on what we know today.

Ken Usdin: Okay. Got it. Alright. Thanks, John.

Operator: Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Gerard Cassidy: Good morning, Gunjan. Good morning, John.

John Stern: Good morning.

Gerard Cassidy: John, you talked about the commercial loan growth, and you talked a bit about commercial real estate. I think you said maybe the first time in the November, it may have seen a little bit of growth. Can you expand upon that for 2026 along with the commercial loan growth? Are the 10% year over year is quite nice. And can that continue, do you think, in 2026?

John Stern: Thanks, Gerard. Short answer is yes. On the continuation on the commercial side of the equation. But let me start with the commercial real estate side. Since you talked about that, I'll mention that we do expect growth in the real estate line. As you said, the first growth that we've had in eleven quarters in that line item, which is great to see. I think what we're seeing here is the continuation of the pipeline building, particularly as it relates to multifamily and industrial. I think those have been strong areas of growth. And I would also say that paydowns have actually slowed down as well.

Our office numbers, our CRE office has dropped $3 billion over the last three years and at a pretty rapid pace. And so that has started to slow down. So that has been helpful. I'll also say that this growth is not driven by data centers and things like that. We have less than a billion dollars of data centers in our portfolio, and we do select high quality in that sense. So that's kind of the story on real estate. On the C&I side, we're just seeing growth in a number of different areas. I'd just say it's very broad-based.

Even though utilization has been pretty flat, we've seen growth in subscription lines, supply chain, some of the M&A activity is picking up with our clients. And so there's just core growth on that side of the equation. We've also been going into business banking and SBA, seeing very strong growth as well as our expansion markets and middle markets. So a combination of all these things, we think, persists into 2026, and so we're looking forward to that growth.

Gerard Cassidy: Very good. And Gunjan, one of your peers in asking this question called me a curmudgeon. So I'll try to ask the question a little less negative. But the setup for you folks and your peers is really good this year. Investors see that. But being bank people that we are, we're always looking over our shoulders. Aside from the obvious geopolitical risks, do you guys keep your eye on just, you know, in case of a surprise comes up that we're not expecting right now?

Gunjan Kedia: Well, thank you, Gerard. I will not call you a curmudgeon. We worry about what's coming around the corner as much as you do. You know, the economic backdrop going into 2026 is broadly constructive. The consumer did very well through the holiday cycle, and that was all ranges of FICO scores and across discretionary and spending. As John just described, the delinquencies are coming down. While the employment picture is a little bit muddy, it's still strong, and we are not yet seeing the impact of the one big beautiful bill and some of the new tax provisions like tips and overtime, etcetera, will come into the consumer's balance sheet. So we expect that to be good.

The sentiment on the corporate side too has moved to sort of more M&A and real CapEx rather than just sort of a pause and replacement CapEx waiting for tariff uncertainty. I would say the economic backdrop feels like tailwinds rather than headwinds going into the year. So our attention really is on unexpected policy changes. In front of us is a very big capital bill. In front of us are some real discussions around stablecoin bank industry, novel charters. And so I would say our attention is really focused on the policy side with some relief on the economic front.

Gerard Cassidy: Very good. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Betsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning.

Gunjan Kedia: Good morning.

Betsy Graseck: I had one question on BTIG. I know we talked about it earlier in the call. But I wanted to get an understanding of how much of a capital call do you think this piece of the business will be? And just from my vantage point, it feels like it's a little bit less than what the fixed income would be, which you already have. But I'm not sure how much you're looking to lean in and grow, what they have and increase the balance sheet items associated with the equity book. So some color there would be helpful. Thank you.

John Stern: Sure, Betsy. So maybe just as a starting point for BTIG, they have a very low balance sheet. There's not a lot of loans and balance sheet with that. I think that potentially could be one of the synergies that's not built into our current forecast. We think the synergies are really gonna be around areas like our fund services, our capital markets as well as our ICG or our institutional client group. There could be loans associated with that. But, you know, we'll treat that in the context of the entire capital market suite.

And so this will be just another component of how we manage and have grown in the capital markets space methodically over the last fifteen years. This is another component of that journey, and so we'll grow as the market allows, and we'll be taking it into consideration with our risk management framework.

Betsy Graseck: Okay. And is it a self-funded capital call or does it pull from other parts of the organization?

John Stern: Yeah. It's self-funded. I mean, we are there's no other parts of the organization. It's all contained here at the bank.

Betsy Graseck: Okay. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Saul Martinez from HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Saul Martinez: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I'll ask also on this is more of a clarification. John. It's expected to close in the second quarter. You mentioned there are some merger costs embedded in the guidance. For it being PPNR neutral. But with that, I guess, can we surmise that it will be PPNR accretive by year-end and into early 2027, especially considering, you know, some of the synergies that you just mentioned in your response to Betsy's question.

John Stern: Yeah. Thanks, Saul. The answer is yes. We expect merger-related costs to happen in the next quarter or two. And so as that occurs, that will keep the EPS neutral. And so, after that, then we expect to have some, obviously, we'll see margin expansion in this business once we get through those costs.

Saul Martinez: Okay. That's helpful. And then, you know, I hate maybe beating a dead horse here would be the question on BTIG, and you kind of addressed this. But it does really change the composition of your capital markets business adding equities and I think, you know, one of your competitors said that this really isn't a business that makes a lot of sense. For a large regional bank. It's what we've given that, at least in their view, it really does require massive scale and there's more suitable for, you know, for a larger bank. Guess, what makes you think that these businesses, especially equity makes sense for U.S.

Bancorp and that you why are you confident that you'll be successful in extracting value with that business under your umbrella?

John Stern: Yeah. I thanks for the question. You know, I think I'll and Gunjan, you can add on here. But, you know, our view is that these businesses, we added because we had an opportunity here with a partner that we know, a known that fits into our risk management. But, also importantly, it's what our clients have been asking for. We have had very good reach out from clients across the board that have wanted to have us participate more in their financings, have us participate more in their broader activities, but have not been able to give that to us freely, in terms of the full spread and wallet share that they would have liked or intended to do.

So this is something that's really gonna, it's something that our clients have asked for. It fits well within our risk management profile as that has been built up internally here over the last several years. And so it is a great fit for us.

Gunjan Kedia: You know what I'll add, Saul, that you have to look at our track record in growing the fixed income book, which not all regionals have been able to do. So everybody has a different strategy here. Our confidence in leaning in heavily into the capital markets comes not just from the client conversations. From the real success we have seen just holding our own. The market is not uniform. There's a lot of need for family offices, for middle market clients that are unique, that require high touch, and so we think at our size, we definitely have the ability to carve out a very nice business given the size of our balance sheet here.

Saul Martinez: Great. That's helpful. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Steven Chubak: Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So I wanted to start off with one on Global Fund Services, and I appreciate the additional disclosure that you provided in the slides. You noted you're seeing strong growth in GFS. You outlined the strength of the ETF servicing capabilities. I was hoping you could speak to the competitive landscape in that area. How much of the growth that you've seen since '21 is tied to organic efforts versus some of the rate and market tailwinds that transpired and just how that informs what you believe is the sustainable growth rate or outlook over the medium term relative to the mid-single-digit guidance that you offer at the firm level?

Gunjan Kedia: Steven, thank you for that. Let me start. GFS has a very niche specific set of products for highly complex small boutique type of firms around private capital, private credit. So you have to play the game right. We have done this for now many, many years, and there's a very sustainable competitive path for this business going forward. We do like to highlight smaller businesses don't get airtime. Just to teach you last quarter, we just gave you some visibility to our impact finance business. So we see this being a real engine of growth as the whole world of investments overall growth. Obviously, when you have good strong equity markets, do slightly better.

In other times, you do slightly worse. But the core organic growth and market share gains here are very real.

Steven Chubak: That's great. And for my follow-up, on deposit mix, looking at noninterest-bearing deposits, you saw solid growth 4%, sequential increase on average. Recognizing some of that is gonna be seasonal. But do you feel we've reached a sustained inflection in noninterest-bearing deposits? And within the NII guidance for the full year, what are you assuming for deposit remixing and shrinkage in time deposits? As well as betas with some of the upcoming rate cuts.

John Stern: Sure. Thanks. Appreciate that. In terms of noninterest-bearing, and yes, we have grown both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. That year-over-year basis has not been achieved in quite some time. So it was very nice to see that. And we do expect that to continue into 2026. So in our call here for growth, on both loan and deposit, I would anticipate it's both a mix of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits with roughly the mix probably being in the same area that it is today is kinda how we think about it.

You know, in terms of deposit mix and rates and things like that, I'm just gonna kinda go back to, you know, we're focused very much on growing our consumer business as well as these key areas that are gonna help us grow in our fee revenues, the treasury management areas, the institutional businesses, and several and select corporate clients. So that's gonna be our focus as we think about deposits this upcoming year.

Steven Chubak: That's great color. Thanks for taking my questions.

Operator: Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I was hoping you could give a quick update on your branch strategy. Your branch count, I think, is down about four or 5% versus a year ago. I think you've talked about kind of not being that interested in bank deals. So kind of bringing that all together and in lieu of some other banks maybe announcing branch expansion strategies. You know, just talk about the branch strategy and, you know, again, if there's any change on the M&A, I think. Thanks.

Gunjan Kedia: Matt, thank you. Let me begin. So just for historical context, U.S. Bank had a very, very heavy presence in-store branches. And before our digital tools, that's what provided servicing access to people over the weekends and after hours. You don't need that anymore. So the vast majority of our branch closures is really these small servicing units. What we are building instead is multi-client hubs that have many products represented in more hub-like branches. We invest about $200 million in our branches. We find that to be a very effective channel, continuing to be a very effective channel.

So our strategy, though, is to try and get to top five market share in the places that we are in and create sort of modern interconnected branches in those areas. So for example, in Denver, we've just finished the renovation of all our branches into the new format. We are continuing to lean in on branches as a source of growth and client service. It's just our starting point was slightly different. So we have to close all these sort of in-store branches and then rebuild from that point onwards. And on your second question, there's no change in our strategy. We are very focused on our organic growth opportunities and seeing a lot of momentum there.

Matt O'Connor: Okay. That's all helpful. And then so if we strip out the in-store branches. Any numbers on kind of the remaining branch network, and then from your perspective, like, how much more refurbishing or retrofitting is there still to do for the traditional branches? Thanks.

John Stern: Sure. So on how much to do, you know, the $200 million is going to be kind of a consistent always-on approach to remodeling, to adding and branches and things of that variety. So we've had several hundred branches remodeled this year. We expect to have that occur next year as well, and that'll be just a continuation of our strategy that Gunjan just laid out.

Gunjan Kedia: Matt, it's very much always on, you know, because you refresh these formats over and over again. So it's not sort of one and done. But the message here really is we are investing very much in our branch. It's an important channel for us.

Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you.

Operator: Our last question will come from Chris McGratty from KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris McGratty from KBW. Your line is open.

Chris McGratty: Oh, sorry about that. Was on mute. John, when you look at your top five goal for market share, and across your footprint, the metro market, where would you not be where you need to be? Where do you need to invest a little bit more to get the market share?

John Stern: You know, in terms of are you speaking more on the consumer side or on the commercial side?

Chris McGratty: Consumer side?

John Stern: Sure. So, you know, like Gunjan just laid out, the Denver area, we've certainly been making investments here in our hub here in headquarters here in Minneapolis, Nashville, Arizona, areas, of course, in California, given the Union acquisition where we've combined, where locations were very close to each other and obviously, took the premier spot or refurbished those areas. So, what we're doing is really we're refurbishing and we're building branches in areas where there's high growth in those MSA areas. So not every area is, of course, the same, so you have to go kinda market by market. But that's been the course of our strategy over the last couple of years.

Chris McGratty: Great. And my follow-up would be on just consumer checking account growth. It's gotten a lot of attention this quarter. You guys had good consumer deposit growth in the quarter. Can you share any statistics about the checking account growth over the past, you know, year or two that would give you optimism? It's gonna be this could continue?

John Stern: Thank you. Yeah. So I think the important thing is really, I mean, accounts are good, of course, and we watch that. But it's really about the balances is what we're really focused on. And so our consumer amounts were up two and a half percent, or $7 billion or so this past year. Not many peers grew consumer deposits this year. It's a very competitive market. And I think what's important for us is we've developed a very nice set of products that can meet a number of different clients. And we have pricing capability tools that we've been building over the last several years that have helped us in this regard as well.

So the combination of all that is really, I think, is what is giving us strength in that consumer number. As well as our capability digitally to compete anywhere across the country. So it doesn't have to be just our footprint. That is necessarily the case. So all those are leading factors to where why we think that consumer growth will continue.

Gunjan Kedia: I'll just add that the branch performance has inflected very nicely too with all of the investments that we have made, all the tools that we've put in the hands, all the AI-powered next best solutions, you know, collectively that has created a fair amount of momentum, and we've been building towards those capabilities all of 2025. And beginning to show up in our results here.

Chris McGratty: Great. Thank you so much.

Whether driven by growth, aging facilities, or new research directions, redesigning or moving a laboratory can feel overwhelming, especially for managers tackling their first major project. The challenge is not just about fitting equipment into a new footprint. It’s about balancing staff workflows, safety requirements, budget realities, and future flexibility, often under tight timelines.

By understanding why space planning matters, defining clear decision criteria early, and learning from lessons others have already experienced, lab managers can approach planning with greater confidence and fewer surprises.

Understanding the “why” behind laboratory space planning

Space planning directly affects safety, productivity, and long-term adaptability. Hastily planned labs may technically function on day one, but they often carry hidden costs, like inefficient workflows, operational workarounds, compliance challenges, and staff frustration that builds over time.

Organizations increasingly prioritize flexible layouts, shared equipment zones, and smarter use of utilities to support changing research demands and sustainability goals. Instead of placing equipment simply where it fits, lab users should consider how the space supports science and workflow.

Many labs operate in spaces that have barely changed in decades, says Chris Orlando, BSN, RN, president of VOC Associates, a Cleveland-based laboratory equipment planning firm. “They've been following the same process, same protocol, with just minor modifications as equipment has come online. They've kind of rigged it up so it works, but they're so used to that that we've heard quite often, ‘Well, that's just not going to work.’”

Through careful discussions and visits to comparable sites, Orlando notes, the tone often shifts to “I guess that could work.” He explains that reluctance to change doesn’t stem from pure doubt, but from a need for more information and exposure to new ideas.

Key lab planning decision criteria for lab managers

While every project is unique, several decision criteria consistently shape successful outcomes.

Start with workflow mapping

Effective lab planning begins with understanding how people, samples, and materials move through the lab. This means involving the people who do the work (not just leadership) in mapping current and future workflows.

Orlando emphasizes that excluding end users often backfires. “The people that actually do the work, as you get deeper into operational planning and get into the meat and potatoes of actually planning the lab move, may say, ‘Wait a second, that's not how we do it. How did this get designed that way?'” Ensuring the right people are involved early allows the lab to be designed correctly from the start, rather than retrofitting or adjusting operational workflows later.

Plan equipment placement in detail

Equipment planning goes beyond large, floor-mounted instruments. Even smaller benchtop equipment consumes space, power, and clearance—and overlooking it adds up quickly.

Danielle Benford, senior vice president at VOC Associates, cautions against relying solely on cut sheets: “Spec sheets, while great, don’t actually account for the real-time use of a piece of equipment.” Handles, hinges, monitoring devices, and seismic bracing can add inches that derail layouts if not planned for early.

Prioritize safety and compliance

Environmental health & safety (EHS) teams, chemical safety professionals, and regulatory stakeholders should be involved from the earliest design phases. For example, flammable cabinets are sometimes positioned based on available space rather than volume calculations and fire barrier requirements—both essential for proper smoke compartmentation. Delaying EHS involvement can lead to costly redesigns and user resistance.

“Make sure you have your EHS folks at the table in schematic design,” says Benford. “I think the biggest issue we see is when those folks aren't involved until later. They have a lot of knowledge that they bring to the table.”

Lab staff moving from grandfathered spaces may also struggle to understand why updated rules now apply. “A lot of these groups have lived in their space for decades, so regulations were very different 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago,” Benford notes. Taking the time to explain the reasoning behind these requirements, rather than simply enforcing them, is essential.

Design for flexibility and growth

Resist the urge to fill every available space, Benford advises. “If at all possible, try not to fill every single inch of space that you have in your design.” Overpacking layouts leaves no room for growth and magnifies the impact of even modest equipment changes.

Projects that rely on “cookie-cutter” bench and shelving layouts frequently result in the removal of costly, unused casework after move-in because equipment lids interfere with shelves or required clearances were overlooked.

Get utilities and infrastructure right early

Power, HVAC, data, and specialized utilities must align with both current and legacy equipment. Orlando notes how often teams discover late in design that facilities lack required power: “‘We did an inventory and we’ve got a bunch of 240V equipment.’ And the first thing the product team says is, ‘We don’t have 240V power.’” These gaps often lead to unplanned costs and operational compromises.

Lessons from the field: what successful projects have in common

Across projects, a few consistent themes emerge.

First, be transparent and involve staff in the process. “Good projects have good communication,” says Orlando. “Things can't be overcommunicated enough, whether it's meeting minutes, whether it's having recurring meetings with the individual laboratories to plan out their moves so that they understand the subtleties.”

Second, be honest about internal capacity. Moving or redesigning a lab is labor-intensive. Organizations that assume they can handle everything internally often realize too late that planning has consumed thousands of hours and stretched staff beyond sustainable limits. “Moving your lab should not be an experiment,” Orlando says.

Third, budget realistically up front. Improper budgeting often leads to value engineering that saves capital dollars but increases operational costs for decades. Projects may finish on budget, but workflows suffer, and staff dissatisfaction grows because early trade-offs have long-term consequences.

Actionable takeaways for lab managers

While no checklist replaces thoughtful planning, several practical steps can help guide the process:

Define “must-haves” versus “nice-to-haves” early. This clarity supports better decisions when budgets tighten.

Inventory everything, no matter its size. “Almost no equipment is too small to include in your planning,” Benford emphasizes.

Document current and future states. Understand what processes look like today and what you want them to become.

Leave room to grow. Plan layouts closer to 80–85 percent capacity rather than at maximum fill.

Invest in communication tools. Meeting minutes, site visits, and visual aids help users envision change and reduce resistance.

Utilize smart design tools and software. Tools such as space audits, utilization tracking, digital modeling, and even VR walkthroughs help stakeholders visualize workflows and catch issues before construction or move-in.

Seek outside perspective when needed. Change management specialists and lab planning experts can ask difficult questions that internal teams might overlook or avoid.

Thoughtful laboratory space planning is more than a logistical exercise. It’s a chance to create safer, more efficient, and future-ready environments that truly support science. By understanding the drivers behind space planning, involving the right voices early, and designing with flexibility in mind, lab leaders can turn redesigns or relocations from stressful disruptions into opportunities for improvement.",https://cdn.labmanager.com/assets/image/55728/lab-planning-m.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 18:01:36.319324

NVIDIA and AMD Rumoredly Informed AICs About Higher GPU Memory Prices; NVIDIA's Price Increase is Reportedly Lower Than AMD

Higher GPU prices are imminent, and we have not just been tracking the prices of the latest-gen GPUs, but have been continuously reporting on the new pricing and supply strategy by the GPU giants. Most reports have centered on NVIDIA GPUs, as there have been rumors regarding the discontinuation of some RTX 50 series GPUs temporarily, which have ultimately been denied and put to rest by NVIDIA itself. Though there is no doubt about the reports that suggest higher GPU prices in the coming days.

On January 16th, NVIDIA officially notified its AIC partners that all bundled GDDR6 and GDDR7 memory packages are now increasing in price. We have been informed of the price increase through familiar AIC partners, but we won't specify the exact price here. What we can say is that NVIDIA's new prices are still lower than those announced by AMD to its AIB partners.

via Benchlife

NVIDIA promised that it would absorb the memory costs to ensure gamers can still get GPUs at an affordable price, and so did AMD. It appears that both GPU manufacturers have now informed their board partners about the price hike in memory chips. Both supply the GPU and memory chips to their board partners, and therefore, the AIBs will have no choice but to increase the GPU prices. However, it's said that NVIDIA's newly announced GPU memory prices are still lower than what AMD told its board partners.

So, if higher costs are passed down to the AIBs, one can expect a noticeable increase in AMD GPU prices vs NVIDIA. That said, the AIBs can decide how much they want to charge for various editions, and we have already seen NVIDIA's high-end RTX 50 series GPUs costing nearly twice as much. AMD RX 9000 GPUs have also seen a significant price change in recent days, and since AMD is expected to focus more on the 16 GB cards, the GPUs may see a higher price hike.

On the other hand, the shipment volume of the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT has consistently exceeded that of the Radeon RX 9070, so the focus on the Radeon RX 9070 XT is somewhat puzzling... After all, they both use the same NAVI 48 chip, differing only in XTX, XT, XL, and XTW versions...

via Benchlife

Keep in mind that it's reported that neither NVIDIA nor AMD is changing their MSRP for the GPUs, which means the suggested retail prices will remain the same. As of right now, NVIDIA & their partners have denied special treatment to a specific line of GPUs. AMD, on the other hand, is said to have increased the shipment capacity of its higher-end RX 9070 XT GPUs rather than focusing on more mainstream models such as the RX 9070.

United joined its rival Delta Air Lines in forecasting potential record earnings for the year. The two carriers accounted for almost all of the U.S. airline industry's profit in the first nine months of 2025. Other airlines are set to report later this month.

United's unit revenue fell 1.6% in the fourth quarter compared with last year. Still, United said premium revenue rose 9% in the fourth quarter and 11% for the full year over 2024. Restrictive basic-economy ticket sales, which compete with discount airlines, were up 7% in the last three months of 2025.

Most airlines are chasing revenue from higher-priced tickets like first class, racing to add in fresh, new cabins that command a premium.

Here is what United Airlines reported for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on estimates compiled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $3.10 adjusted vs. $2.94 expected

Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.4 billion expected

The carrier's fourth-quarter profit rose 6% from a year earlier to $1.04 billion, or $3.19 a share, while capacity rose 6.5% from the same period in 2024. Adjusting for one-time items, United posted earnings of $1.01 billion, or $3.10 a share.

Jan 20 (Reuters) - All three major Wall Street indexes ended Tuesday with their biggest one-day drops in three months, in a broad selloff triggered by concerns that fresh tariff threats from President Donald Trump against Europe could signal renewed market volatility.

The risk-off trade was pervasive, helping vault gold to fresh record highs, and pushing up debt costs with U.S. Treasuries wobbling under renewed selling pressure. Bitcoin, which can find favor when traditional markets waver, fell more than 3%.

All three U.S. equity benchmarks registered their worst one-day performance since October 10, with both the and slipping below their 50-day moving averages.

The S&P 500 lost 143.15 points, or 2.06%, to end at 6,796.86 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gave up 561.07 points, or 2.39%, to 22,954.32. The fell 870.74 points, or 1.76%, to 48,488.59.

UNCERTAINTY RISES

Tuesday was the first opportunity for U.S. investors to act on Trump’s weekend comments, given the market holiday for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.

This included Trump saying additional 10% import tariffs would take effect on February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Great Britain — all already subject to U.S. tariffs.

The tariffs would increase to 25% on June 1 and continue until a deal was reached for the U.S. to purchase Greenland, Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. Leaders of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, and Denmark have insisted the island is not for sale.

The reinjection of tariff threats into global markets harkens back to April’s ""Liberation Day,"" when Trump’s levies on global trade partners pushed the S&P 500 to near bear market territory.

The CBOE Volatility Index, also known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, spiked to 20.09 points, its highest close since November 24.

Trading volumes were also higher: around 20.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Tuesday, up from the 17.01 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

While investor sentiment was frayed on Tuesday, the question being asked is whether Greenland represents a knee-jerk selloff, or something that will have longer-term implications for markets.

Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, said he was not seeing indications investors were fleeing.

""I’m not at the point yet where I’m willing to say what is happening with Greenland, and the resurgence of the tariff threat back and forth, is going to precipitate a correction in the equities markets,"" he said, adding he would be surprised if there was a 3% to 5% drop this week.

BOND MARKETS SPILLOVER

A potentially more significant action, in Cox’s eyes, would be whether Japanese authorities intervene in financial markets.

Japanese government bonds plunged on Tuesday, sending yields to record highs, while Tokyo stocks and the yen also fell after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s call for a snap election shook confidence in the country’s fiscal health.

The moves helped push the cost of longer-term European government bonds higher, while a selloff in U.S. Treasuries was more pronounced on the long end of the curve.

Despite tariff talk, and notable bond movements, the U.S. economy remains in a strong position.

Investors are due a host of fresh data this week on the state of the U.S. economy, including the third-quarter U.S. GDP update, January PMI readings and the Personal Consumption Expenditures report, which is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge.

Earnings season is also kicking into higher gear, with several industry bellwethers set to report their quarterly earnings this week.

USB Price Action: U.S. Bancorp shares were down 3.25% at $52.63 during premarket trading on Tuesday.","U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) stock fell on Tuesday after the lender reported fourth-quarter 2025 results.

The company reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, beating the analyst consensus estimate of $1.19. Quarterly sales of $7.337 billion outpaced the Street view of $7.308 billion.

The company’s provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter was $577 million, compared with $571 million in the third quarter of 2025 and $560 million in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The fourth quarter provision was $6 million (1.1%) higher than the third quarter of 2025 and $17 million (3%) higher than the fourth quarter of 2024.

The increase in provision expense year over year was primarily driven by loan portfolio growth, partially offset by lower net charge-offs.

Other Metrics

Net income rose 23.0% year over year to $2.045 billion.

Return on tangible common equity rose to 18.4%, while return on average assets increased to 1.19%. The efficiency ratio improved to 57.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2024.

The company delivered 440 basis points of positive operating leverage, adjusted for prior notable items. Net interest margin rose to 2.77%, up 6 basis points year over year and 2 basis points sequentially.

Noninterest expense remained relatively stable compared to the prior-year period. The CET1 capital ratio stood at 10.8% as of Dec. 31, 2025.

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis rose to $4.31 billion, up from $4.25 billion in the prior quarter and $4.18 billion a year earlier.

Average deposits rose to $515.1 billion from $511.8 billion in the third quarter, while average total loans increased to $384.3 billion from $379.2 billion in the prior quarter.

“Record consumer deposits this quarter and effective balance sheet remixing contributed to net interest income growth and margin expansion. Fee income exceeded our mid-single-digit growth target and was supported by broad strength across our diversified fee businesses,” said CEO Gunjan Kedia.

Important Highlights

U.S. Bancorp signed a definitive deal to buy BTIG, LLC, expanding its investment banking and trading platform. BTIG’s roughly 700 employees across 20 locations will join U.S. Bancorp, and current leadership will stay.

The company expects the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approvals.

U.S. Bank also completed a cross-border stablecoin pilot, signaling readiness for future compliant commercial offerings.

Outlook

U.S. Bancorp forecast fiscal 2026 revenue of $29.85 billion to $30.42 billion, compared with Wall Street expectations of $30.04 billion.

“Looking ahead to 2026, we remain committed to our strategic priorities and medium-term targets as these measures will continue to drive sustainable EPS growth and industry-leading returns,” Kedia added.

USB Price Action: U.S. Bancorp shares were down 3.25% at $52.63 during premarket trading on Tuesday. The stock is approaching its 52-week high of $56.19, according to Benzinga Pro data.

Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp was $2.04 billion, up 22.9% from the prior-year quarter.
The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.6%.
Over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for HBAN’s quarterly earnings has been unchanged at 39 cents per share.
Over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for BOH’s quarterly earnings has been unchanged at $1.25 per share.","U.S. Bancorp’s USB fourth-quarter 2025 earnings per share of $1.26 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19. The bottom line increased 24.7% from the prior-year quarter.

Results benefited from lower expenses and higher non-interest income. Also, a rise in net interest income (NII) and a strong capital position were tailwinds. However, a rise in provision was concerning.

Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp was $2.04 billion, up 22.9% from the prior-year quarter.

In 2025, earnings of $4.62 per share surpassed the consensus estimate of $4.55 and rose from $3.79 in 2024. Net income was $7.6 billion, up 20.2% from the prior-year quarter.

USB’s Revenues Rise, Expenses Decline

Total revenues in the reported quarter were $7.36 billion, up 5.1% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.6%.

For 2025, total revenues were $28.54 billion, which marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28.61 billion. The top line rose 4.4% year over year.

Tax-equivalent NII totaled $4.31 billion, up 3.2% from the year-ago quarter. The increase primarily resulted from loan growth and fixed asset repricing.

The net interest margin of 2.77% expanded 6 basis points year over year.

Non-interest income moved up 7.8% year over year to $3.05 billion. The upside was driven by a rise in almost all components.

Non-interest expenses declined 1.9% year over year to $4.23 billion. The decrease was due to lower compensation and employee benefits expenses, partially offset by higher marketing and business development expenses, technology and communications expenses and other expenses.

The efficiency ratio was 57.4%, lower than the year-ago quarter’s 61.5%. A decline in the ratio indicates an improvement in profitability.

U.S. Bancorp’s Loan & Deposit Balances Increase

Average total loans rose 1.3% to $384.3 billion from the previous quarter. Average total deposits moved up slightly from the previous quarter to $515.1 billion.

USB’s Credit Quality Improves

Total allowance for credit losses was $7.94 billion, down marginally year over year. As of Dec. 31, 2025, U.S. Bancorp’s non-performing assets amounted to $1.59 billion, down 13.2% from the year-ago period.

Net charge-offs were $527 million, down 6.2% from the year-ago quarter.

The provision for credit losses in the reported quarter was $577 million, up 3% from the prior-year quarter.

U.S. Bancorp’s Capital Ratios Improve

The Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.3% as of Dec. 31, 2025, up from 12.2% in the prior-year quarter. The Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel III standardized approach was 10.8% as of Dec. 31, 2025, up from 10.6% in the year-ago quarter.

The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.7%, up from the prior-year quarter’s 5.8%.

Our Take on USB

U.S. Bancorp’s diversified revenue streams, solid balance sheet and disciplined cost control continue to support its strong financial performance. Growth in NII and non-interest income, coupled with improved efficiency, bodes well for future profitability. Although provisions rose modestly, USB remains well-positioned to deliver steady returns on tangible common equity and maintain positive operating leverage in the upcoming quarters.

Marla was the youngest of seven children raised by John and Jane Kleinheinz in Lake Oswego, OR. She was born with Down syndrome but never let that stop her from living a full life. Her older brothers and sisters loved her unconditionally, and she thrived off the energy that constantly filled the house at 74 Touchstone — a home always full of kids, parents, and friends.

From the beginning, her mother Jane insisted that Marla lead as normal a life as possible. She attended Uplands Elementary and graduated from Lake Oswego High in 1993. In 1996, John Janko, then store manager at Albertsons in Lake Grove, gave her a chance, and she worked there for the next twenty-three years. She was always quick with a “hi” and a hug to everyone she met.

Marla had boundless energy. She competed in Special Olympics skiing, swimming, and occasionally track and field. She loved bowling and golfing. She also enjoyed dancing and singing and was never shy to grab the microphone and make a speech. She savored life and was rarely angry. She taught all of us to love everyone and, most importantly, not to take ourselves too seriously.

Marla is survived by her mother Jane; sisters Anne (Steve Andersen), Kathy, Laura (Mark Yockey), Patrice (Mark Echols); and brothers John (Marsha Kleinheinz) and Michael (Rachèle Lamontagne), as well as numerous nieces, nephews, and friends.

Elon helps Microsoft win OpenAI Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI has been one of its key strategic advantages in the cloud.
“Good,” Nadella wrote.
The other slots were “still up in air.” Altman asked, “would [redacted] be ok with you?” “No,” Nadella wrote.
“We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Nadella posted on X.","The launch of the AI lab that would redefine Microsoft caught the tech giant by surprise.

“Did we get called to participate?” Satya Nadella wrote to his team on Dec. 12, 2015, hours after OpenAI announced its founding. “AWS seems to have sneaked in there.”

Nadella had been Microsoft CEO for less than two years. Azure, the company’s cloud platform, was five years old and chasing Amazon Web Services for market share. And now AWS had been listed as a donor in the “Introducing OpenAI” post. Microsoft wasn’t in the mix.

In the internal message, which hasn’t been previously reported, Nadella wondered how the new AI nonprofit could remain truly “open” if it was tied only to Amazon’s cloud.

Within months, Microsoft was courting OpenAI. Within four years, it would invest $1 billion, adding more than $12 billion in subsequent rounds. Within a decade, the relationship would culminate in a $250 billion spending commitment for Microsoft’s cloud and a 27% equity stake in one of the most valuable startups in history.

New court filings offer an inside look at one of the most consequential relationships in tech. Previously undisclosed emails, messages, slide decks, reports, and deposition transcripts reveal how Microsoft pursued, rebuffed and backed OpenAI at various moments over the past decade, ultimately shaping the course of the lab that launched the generative AI era.

More broadly, they show how Nadella and Microsoft’s senior leadership team rally in a crisis, maneuver against rivals such as Google and Amazon, and talk about deals in private.

For this story, GeekWire dug through more than 200 documents, many of them made public Friday in Elon Musk’s ongoing suit accusing OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman of abandoning the nonprofit mission. Microsoft is also a defendant. Musk, who was an OpenAI co-founder, is seeking up to $134 billion in damages. A jury trial is scheduled for this spring.

OpenAI has disputed Musk’s account of the company’s origins. In a blog post last week, the company said Musk agreed in 2017 that a for-profit structure was necessary, and that negotiations ended only when OpenAI refused to give him full control.

The recently disclosed records show that Microsoft’s own leadership anticipated the possibility of such a dispute. In March 2018, after learning of OpenAI’s plans to launch a commercial arm, Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott sent Nadella and others an email offering his thoughts.

“I wonder if the big OpenAI donors are aware of these plans?” Scott wrote. “Ideologically, I can’t imagine that they funded an open effort to concentrate ML [machine learning] talent so that they could then go build a closed, for profit thing on its back.”

The latest round of documents, filed as exhibits in Musk’s lawsuit, represents a partial record selected to support his claims in the case. Microsoft declined to comment.

Elon helps Microsoft win OpenAI

Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI has been one of its key strategic advantages in the cloud. But the behind-the-scenes emails make it clear that Amazon was actually there first.

According to an internal Microsoft slide deck from August 2016, included in recent filings, OpenAI was running its research on AWS as part of a deal that gave it $50 million in computing for $10 million in committed funds. The contract was up for renewal in September 2016.

Microsoft wanted in. Nadella reached out to Altman, looking for a way to work together.

In late August, the filings show, Altman emailed Musk about a new deal with Microsoft: “I have negotiated a $50 million compute donation from them over the next 3 years!” he wrote. “Do you have any reason not to like them, or care about us switching over from Amazon?”

Musk, co-chair of OpenAI at the time, gave his blessing to the Microsoft deal in his unique way, starting with a swipe at Amazon founder Jeff Bezos: “I think Jeff is a bit of a tool and Satya is not, so I slightly prefer Microsoft, but I hate their marketing dept,” Musk wrote.

He asked Altman what happened to Amazon.

Altman responded, “Amazon started really dicking us around on the T+C [terms and conditions], especially on marketing commits. … And their offering wasn’t that good technically anyway.”

Microsoft and OpenAI announced their partnership in November 2016 with a blog post highlighting their plans to “democratize artificial intelligence,” and noting that OpenAI would use Azure as its primary cloud platform going forward.

Internally, Microsoft saw multiple benefits. The August 2016 slide deck, titled “OpenAI on Azure Big Compute,” described it as a prime opportunity to flip a high-profile customer to Azure.

The presentation also emphasized bigger goals: “thought leadership” in AI, a “halo effect” for Azure’s GPU launch, and the chance to recruit a “net-new audience” of developers and startups. It noted that OpenAI was a nonprofit “unconstrained by a need to generate financial return” — an organization whose research could burnish Microsoft’s reputation in AI.

But as the ambition grew, so did the bill.

‘Most impressive thing yet in the history of AI’

In June 2017, Musk spoke with Nadella directly to pitch a major expansion. OpenAI wanted to train AI systems to beat the best human players at competitive esports, Valve’s Dota 2. The computing requirements were massive: 10,000 servers equipped with the latest Nvidia GPUs.

“This would obviously be a major opportunity for Microsoft to promote Azure relative to other cloud systems,” Musk wrote in an email to OpenAI colleagues after the call.

Nadella said he’d talk about it internally with his Microsoft cloud team, according to the email. “Sounds like there is a good chance they will do it,” Musk wrote.

Two months later, Altman followed up with a formal pitch. “I think it will be the most impressive thing yet in the history of AI,” he wrote to Nadella that August.

Microsoft’s cloud executives ran the numbers and balked. In an August 2017 email thread, Microsoft executive Jason Zander told Nadella the deal would cost so much it “frankly makes it a non-starter.” The numbers are redacted from the public version of the email.

“I do believe the pop from someone like Sam and Elon will help build momentum for Azure,” Zander wrote. “The scale is also a good forcing function for the fleet and we can drive scale into the supply chain. But I won’t take a complete bath to do it.”

Ultimately, Microsoft passed. OpenAI contracted with Google for the Dota 2 project instead.

‘A bucket of undifferentiated GPUs’

Microsoft’s broader relationship with OpenAI was starting to fray, as well. By January 2018, according to internal emails, Microsoft executive Brett Tanzer had told Altman that he was having a hard time finding internal sponsors at Microsoft for an expanded OpenAI deal.

Altman started shopping for alternatives. Around that time, Tanzer noted in an email to Nadella and other senior executives that OpenAI’s people “have been up in the area recently across the lake” — a reference to Amazon’s Seattle headquarters.

The internal debate at Microsoft was blunt.

Scott wrote that OpenAI was treating Microsoft “like a bucket of undifferentiated GPUs, which isn’t interesting for us at all.” Harry Shum, who led Microsoft’s AI research, said he’d visited OpenAI a year earlier and “was not able to see any immediate breakthrough in AGI.”

Eric Horvitz, Microsoft’s chief scientist, chimed in to say he had tried a different approach. After a Skype call with OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, he pitched the idea of collaboration focused on “extending human intellect with AI — versus beating humans.”

The conversation was friendly, Horvitz wrote, but he didn’t sense much interest. He suspected OpenAI’s Dota work was “motivated by a need to show how AI can crush humans, as part of Elon Musk’s interest in demonstrating why we should all be concerned about the power of AI.”

Scott summed up the risk of walking away: OpenAI might “storm off to Amazon in a huff and shit-talk us and Azure on the way out.”

“They are building credibility in the AI community very fast,” the Microsoft CTO and Silicon Valley veteran wrote. “All things equal, I’d love to have them be a Microsoft and Azure net promoter. Not sure that alone is worth what they’re asking.”

But by the following year, Microsoft had found a reason to double down.

The first billion

In 2019, OpenAI restructured. The nonprofit would remain, but a new “capped profit” entity would sit beneath it — a hybrid that could raise capital from investors while limiting their returns.

Microsoft agreed to invest $1 billion, with an option for a second billion, in exchange for exclusive cloud computing rights and a commercial license to OpenAI’s technology.

The companies announced the deal in July 2019 with a joint press release. “The creation of AGI will be the most important technological development in human history, with the potential to shape the trajectory of humanity,” Altman said. Nadella echoed that sentiment, emphasizing the companies’ ambition to “democratize AI” while keeping safety at the center.

So what changed for Microsoft between 2018 and 2019?

In a June 2019 email to Nadella and Bill Gates, previously disclosed in the Google antitrust case, Scott cited the search giant’s AI progress as one reason for Microsoft to invest in OpenAI. He “got very, very worried,” he explained, when he “dug in to try to understand where all of the capability gaps were between Google and us for model training.”

Nadella forwarded Scott’s email to Amy Hood, Microsoft’s CFO. “Very good email that explains why I want us to do this,” Nadella wrote, referring to the larger OpenAI investment, “and also why we will then ensure our infra folks execute.”

Gates wasn’t so sure. According to Nadella’s deposition testimony, the Microsoft co-founder was clear in “wanting us to just do our own” — arguing that the company should focus on building AI capabilities in-house rather than placing such a large bet on OpenAI.

Nadella explained that the decision to invest was eventually driven by him and Scott, who concluded that OpenAI’s specific research direction into transformers and large language models (the GPT class) was more promising than other approaches at the time.

Hood, meanwhile, offered some blunt commentary on OpenAI’s cap on profits — the centerpiece of its new structure, meant to limit investor returns and preserve the nonprofit’s mission. The caps were so high, she wrote, that they were almost meaningless.

“Given the cap is actually larger than 90% of public companies, I am not sure it is terribly constraining nor terribly altruistic but that is Sam’s call on his cap,” Hood wrote in a July 14, 2019, email to Nadella, Scott, and other executives.

If OpenAI succeeded, she noted, the real money for Microsoft would come from Azure revenue — far exceeding any capped return on the investment itself.

But the deal gave Microsoft more than cloud revenue.

According to an internal OpenAI memo dated June 2019, Microsoft’s investment came with approval rights over “Major Decisions” — including changes to the company’s structure, distributions to partners, and any merger or dissolution.

Microsoft’s $1 billion made it the dominant investor. Under the partnership agreement, major decisions required approval from a majority of limited partners based on how much they had contributed. At 85% of the total, Microsoft had an effective veto, a position of power that would give the company a pivotal role in defining the future of the company.

‘The opposite of open’

In September 2020, Musk responded to reports that Microsoft had exclusively licensed OpenAI’s GPT-3. “This does seem like the opposite of open,” he tweeted. “OpenAI is essentially captured by Microsoft.”

Nadella seemed to take the criticism seriously.

In an October 2020 meeting, according to internal notes cited in a recent court order, Microsoft executives discussed the perception that the company was “effectively owning” OpenAI, with Nadella saying they needed to give thought to Musk’s perspective.

In February 2021, as Microsoft and OpenAI negotiated a new investment, Altman emailed Microsoft’s team: “We want to do everything we can to make you all commercially successful and are happy to move significantly from the term sheet.”

His preference, Altman told the Microsoft execs, was “to make you all a bunch of money as quickly as we can and for you to be enthusiastic about making this additional investment soon.”

They closed the deal in March 2021, for up to $2 billion. This was not disclosed publicly until January 2023, when Microsoft revealed it as part of a larger investment announcement.

By 2022, the pressure to commercialize was explicit.

According to a transcript of her deposition, Mira Murati, then OpenAI’s vice president of applied AI and partnerships, had written in contemporaneous notes that the most-cited goal inside the company that year was a $100 million revenue target. Altman had told employees that Nadella and Scott said this needed to be hit to justify the next investment, as much as $10 billion.

Murati testified that Altman told her “it was important to achieve this goal to receive Microsoft’s continued investments.” OpenAI responded by expanding its go-to-market team and building out its enterprise business.

Then everything changed.

The ChatGPT moment

On Nov. 30, 2022, OpenAI announced ChatGPT. The chatbot became the fastest-growing consumer application in history, reaching 100 million users within two months. It was the moment that turned OpenAI from an AI research lab into a household name.

Microsoft’s bet was suddenly looking very different.

OpenAI’s board learned about the launch on Twitter. According to deposition testimony, board members Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley received no advance notice and discovered ChatGPT by seeing screenshots on social media.

McCauley described the fact that a “major release” could happen without the board knowing as “extremely concerning.” Toner testified that she wasn’t surprised — she was “used to the board not being very informed” — but believed it demonstrated that the company’s processes for decisions with “material impact on the mission were inadequate.”

Altman, according to one filing, characterized the release as a “research preview” using existing technology. He said the board “had been talking for months” about building a chat product, but acknowledged that he probably did not send the board an email about the specific release.

As its biggest investor, Microsoft pushed OpenAI to monetize the product’s success.

In mid-January 2023, Nadella texted Altman asking when he planned to activate a paid subscription. “Overall getting this in place sooner is best,” he wrote.

Two weeks later, Nadella checked in again: “Btw …how many subs have you guys added to chatGPT?”

Altman’s answer revealed what they were dealing with. OpenAI had 6 million daily active users — their capacity limit — and had turned away 50 million people who tried to sign up. “Had to delay charging due to legal issues,” he wrote, “but it should go out this coming week.”

ChatGPT Plus launched on Feb. 1, 2023, at $20 a month.

In the meantime, Microsoft invested another $10 billion in OpenAI. The companies had begun negotiating the previous summer, when OpenAI was still building ChatGPT. The product’s viral success validated Microsoft’s bet and foreshadowed a new era of demand for its cloud platform.

Ten months later, it nearly collapsed.

‘Run over by a truck’

On Friday afternoon, Nov. 17, 2023, OpenAI’s nonprofit board fired Altman as CEO, issuing a terse statement that he had not been “consistently candid in his communications with the board.” Greg Brockman, the company’s president and cofounder, was removed from the board the same day. He quit hours later.

Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest investor, was not consulted. Murati, then OpenAI’s chief technology officer and the board’s choice for interim CEO, called Nadella and Kevin Scott to warn them just 10 to 15 minutes before Altman himself was told.

“Mira sounded like she had been run over by a truck as she tells me,” Scott wrote in an email to colleagues that weekend.

The board — Ilya Sutskever, Tasha McCauley, Helen Toner, and Adam D’Angelo — had informed Murati the night before. They had given her less than 24 hours to prepare.

At noon Pacific time, the board delivered the news to Altman. The blog post went live immediately. An all-hands meeting followed at 2 p.m. By Friday night, Brockman had resigned. So had Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI’s head of research, along with a handful of other researchers.

A “whole horde” of employees, Scott wrote, had reached out to Altman and Brockman “expressing loyalty to them, and saying they will resign.”

Microsoft didn’t have a seat on the board. But text messages between Nadella and Altman, revealed in the latest filings, show just how influential it was in the ultimate outcome.

At 7:42 a.m. Pacific on Saturday, Nov. 18, Nadella texted Altman asking if he was free to talk. Altman replied that he was on a board call.

“Good,” Nadella wrote. “Call when done. I have one idea.”

That evening, at 8:25 p.m., Nadella followed up with a detailed message from Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president and top lawyer. In a matter of hours, the trillion-dollar corporation had turned on a dime, establishing a new subsidiary from scratch — legal work done, papers ready to file as soon as the Washington Secretary of State opened Monday morning.

They called it Microsoft RAI Inc., using the acronym for Responsible Artificial Intelligence.

“We can then capitalize the subsidiary and take all the other steps needed to operationalize this and support Sam in whatever way is needed,” Smith wrote. Microsoft was “ready to go if that’s the direction we need to head.”

Altman’s reply: “kk.”

The company calculated the cost of absorbing the OpenAI team at roughly $25 billion, Nadella later confirmed in a deposition — enough to match the compensation and unvested equity of employees who had been promised stakes in a company that now seemed on the verge of collapse.

By Sunday, Emmett Shear, the Twitch co-founder, had replaced Murati as interim CEO. That night, when the board still hadn’t reinstated Altman, Nadella announced publicly that Microsoft was prepared to hire the OpenAI CEO and key members of his team.

“In a world of bad choices,” Nadella said in his deposition, the move “was definitely not my preferred thing.” But it was preferable to the alternative, he added. “The worst outcome would have been all these people leave and they go to our competition.”

‘Strong strong no’

On Tuesday, Nov. 21, the outcome was still uncertain. Altman messaged Nadella and Scott that morning, “can we talk soon? have a positive update, ish.” Later, he said the situation looked “reasonably positive” for a five-member board. Shear was talking to the remaining directors.

Nadella asked about the composition, according to the newly public transcript of the message thread, which redacts the names of people who ultimately weren’t chosen.

“Is this Larry Summers and [redacted] and you three? Is that still the plan?”

Summers was confirmed, Altman replied. The other slots were “still up in air.”

Altman asked, “would [redacted] be ok with you?”

“No,” Nadella wrote.

Scott was more emphatic, giving one unnamed person a “strong no,” and following up for emphasis: “Strong strong no.”

The vetting continued, as Nadella and Scott offered suggestions, all of them redacted in the public version of the thread.

Nadella added Smith to the thread. One candidate, the Microsoft president wrote, was “Solid, thoughtful, calm.” Another was “Incredibly smart, firm, practical, while also a good listener.”

At one point, Scott floated a joke: “I can quit for six months and do it.” He added a grinning emoji and commented, “Ready to be downvoted by Satya on this one, and not really serious.”

Nadella gave that a thumbs down.

The back-and-forth reflected a delicate position. Microsoft had no board seat at OpenAI. Nadella had said publicly that the company didn’t want one. But the texts showed something closer to a shadow veto — a real-time screening of the people who would oversee the nonprofit’s mission.

By evening, a framework emerged. Altman proposed Bret Taylor, Larry Summers, and Adam D’Angelo as the board, with himself restored as CEO. Taylor would handle the investigation into his firing.

Smith raised a concern. “Your future would be decided by Larry [Summers],” he wrote. “He’s smart but so mercurial.” He called it “too risky.” (Summers resigned from the OpenAI board in November 2025, following revelations about his correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein.)

Altman wrote, “id accept it given my conversations with him and where we are right now.” He added, “it’s bullshit but i want to save this … can you guys live with it?”

Nadella asked for Summers’ cell number.

At 2:38 p.m., Altman texted the group: “thank you guys for the partnership and trust. excited to get this all sorted to a long-term configuration you can really depend on.”

Nadella loved the message.

Two minutes later, Smith replied: “Thank you! A tough several days. Let’s build on this and regain momentum.”

Altman loved that one.

Nadella had the last word: “Really looking forward to getting back to building….”

Later that night, OpenAI announced Altman’s return with the newly constituted board.

“We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Nadella posted on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.”

The crisis was resolved, but the underlying tensions remained.

‘Project Watershed’

On December 27, 2024, OpenAI announced it would unwind its capped-profit structure. Internally, this initiative was called “Project Watershed,” the documents reveal.

The mechanics played out through 2025. On September 11, Microsoft and OpenAI executed a memorandum of understanding with a 45-day timeline to finalize terms.

Microsoft’s role was straightforward but powerful. Its approval rights over “Major Decisions” including changes to OpenAI’s structure. Asked in a deposition whether those rights covered a recapitalization of OpenAI’s for‑profit entity into a public benefit corporation, Microsoft corporate development executive Michael Wetter testified that they did.

The company had no board seat. “Zero voting rights,” Wetter testified. “We have no role, to be super clear.” But under the 2019 agreement, the conversion couldn’t happen without them.

The timing mattered. A SoftBank-led financing — internally called Project Sakura — was contingent on the recapitalization closing by year-end. Without the conversion, the funding could not proceed. Without Microsoft’s approval, the conversion could not proceed.

Valuation became a key focus of negotiations. Morgan Stanley, working for Microsoft, estimated OpenAI’s value at $122 billion to $177 billion, according to court filings. Goldman Sachs, advising OpenAI, put it at $353 billion. The MOU set Microsoft’s stake at 32.5 percent. By the time the deal closed after the SoftBank round, dilution brought it to 27 percent.

OpenAI’s implied valuation was $500 billion — a record at the time (until it was surpassed in December by Musk’s SpaceX). As Altman put it in his deposition, “That was the willing buyer-willing seller market price, so I won’t argue with it.”

For Microsoft, it was a give-and-take deal: the tech giant lost its right of first refusal on new cloud workloads, even as OpenAI committed to the $250 billion in future Azure purchases.

At the same time, the agreement defused the clause that had loomed over the partnership: under prior terms, a declaration of artificial general intelligence by OpenAI’s board would have cut Microsoft off from future models. Now any such declaration needs to be made by an independent panel, and Microsoft’s IP rights run through 2032 regardless.

The transaction closed on Oct. 28, 2025. The nonprofit remained (renamed the OpenAI Foundation) but as a minority shareholder in the company it had once controlled.

Six days later, OpenAI signed a seven-year, $38 billion infrastructure deal with Amazon Web Services. The company that had “sneaked in there” at the founding, as Nadella put it in 2015, was back — this time as a major cloud provider for Microsoft’s flagship AI partner.

In a post this weekend, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar made the shift explicit: “Three years ago, we relied on a single compute provider,” she wrote. “Today, we are working with providers across a diversified ecosystem. That shift gives us resilience and, critically, compute certainty.”

Revenue had grown from $2 billion in 2023 to more than $20 billion in 2025. OpenAI was no longer a research lab dependent on Microsoft’s cloud. It was a platform company with leverage.

In December 2015, Nadella had to ask whether Microsoft had been called to participate in the OpenAI launch. A decade later, nothing could happen without the Redmond tech giant.

But OpenAI would no longer be theirs alone.",https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Altman-Satya-3.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 14:02:12.932093

An FIM inspection last week gave positive feedback, and officials said there was no serious reason to doubt the race will go ahead as planned. Another test event will take place from 29 February to 1 March, featuring 300cc, 600cc and 1000cc races behind closed doors to help the circuit receive full approval.

The event will be run by many of the same officials and marshals who will work at the MotoGP race, including some from the Formula 1 Sao Paulo Grand Prix. If the race happens, Brazilian fans will be able to support Diogo Moreira, who will make his MotoGP debut with LCR Honda after becoming the first Brazilian world champion in Moto2.

VR46 rider Franco Morbidelli also has strong Brazilian family roots, which adds to local interest. After more than 20 years away, MotoGP’s return to Brazil could become one of the most exciting moments in the country’s motorsport history.",https://newsgpcdn.vshcdn.net/i/images/4939/honda-brazil_f.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 14:02:05.853675

Adobe empowers everyone everywhere to imagine, create, and bring any digital experience to life. With over 29 billion assets generated using Adobe Firefly and a vast Adobe Stock ecosystem, the ability to search and discover relevant images or videos at scale is critical.

Achieving this at Adobe’s scale comes with complex technical requirements: running AI models that process hundreds of millions of assets, managing thousands of parallel inference jobs, and ensuring GPUs are fully utilized without breaking cost efficiency. Meeting these challenges requires an infrastructure that can handle massive data throughput, scale elastically, and minimize operational overhead.

In this post, we will share how the Adobe SDC team tackled these challenges and why AWS Batch—combined with GPU accelerated Amazon EC2 Instances—became a strong fit for our large-scale distributed inference workloads. More importantly, we’ll highlight the lessons we learned and the practices that helped us make inference very efficient.

The opportunity

Image assets from multiple sources power content retrieval, discovery and recommendations across various Adobe products—such as Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Express, Adobe Firefly and more—and are surfaced through semantic search. Embedding models are constantly evolving, which makes periodic re-computation of the embeddings for such huge data set(s) with hundreds of millions of assets increasingly critical for state-of-the-art search ranking and relevancy. As search features and experiences continue to evolve, with several experiments and evaluations across the development cycle, recomputing and updating embeddings becomes repetitive.

Computing image embeddings is similar to workflows for text, video, and audio and involves loading images into memory, running inference with Adobe’s proprietary machine learning models, and storing the results in internal systems that power semantic search, RAG, and other capabilities. Given the volume of the data, this process can only be implemented as a massively parallel process rather than sequential processing. AWS Batch, a fully managed service that simplifies running batch computing workloads, helped to achieve our goals.

Some of the key challenges included:

Model and data diversity: Different models and dataset sizes require different GPU architectures to maximize performance and speed. So, our pipelines need to be flexible to use different types of EC2 instances

High operational overhead: Building and maintaining our own container orchestration system (such as EKS) to execute these ad hoc inference jobs would involve significant engineering effort, including managing servers, auto-scaling groups, and load balancers. Instead, a simple ephemeral solution is more appropriate.

Failure detection and recovery: Even with complete automation of cluster setup, failure detection and retry mechanisms require additional business logic.

Data sharding complexity: Efficiently partitioning data and assigning work to each node in the data lake becomes increasingly challenging at scale.

Long processing times: Sequential processing can take weeks to complete for large workloads, severely limiting iteration speed.

The solution

When designing solutions, we aimed to achieve:

Immediate access to resources: Provide seamless access to GPUs across multiple instance types (e.g., g6e, g5), selected based on model requirements.

Efficient resource utilization: Ensure resources allocated are efficiently and effectively used.

Consistent job submission: Offer a standardized interface for job execution, regardless of parallelization level or EC2 instance type.

Cost optimization: Leverage a “pay-as-you-go” model and dynamically scale resources up or down based on demand. Minimize per-job costs to deliver the best possible value.

User experience: Democratize massive batch processing through a fully self-serve experience, empowering users to run jobs without deep infrastructure knowledge.

Data Preparation and Distributed Inferencing

Efficient data loading is critical to maximize GPU utilization during large-scale inference. A common bottleneck is that data is either not loaded quickly enough into GPUs, or the pipeline becomes unbalanced, leading to underutilized hardware.

For a different use case, Adobe Research customized the PyTorch Dataloader to stream samples directly from Amazon S3 into AWS Batch containers at a node level. Within each container, CPUs handle preprocessing—such as decoding and converting samples into tensors—before delivering well-formed batches to GPUs for inference. If a node has 8 GPUs, 8 dataloaders are created, each paired with its own model engine. While they all point to the same dataset, each data loader uses its assigned rank and the number of dataloaders the host is spinning up, also known as world rank, to know exactly which shard of the dataset to process, avoiding overlap and ensuring balanced throughput.

When extending the process to multiple distributed nodes, it is important for each node to be given a distinct dataset partition to process. One approach is to download the entire dataset per node and rely on dataloader rank/world size to handle partitioning. However, given the scale of the data, this would require significant extra disk usage. This is where we leveraged AWS Batch: We separated the dataset preparation and converted it into its own AWS Batch job. This preprocessing job runs multiple workers to shard the S3 bucket and compress object addresses into compact binary files.

During inference, each node only needs to download its assigned binary shard—based on its AWS_BATCH_JOB_NODE_INDEX—and to feed that to its data loaders. This reduces disk overhead, eliminates redundant data transfers, and ensures that every node processes a unique subset of the dataset. Together, these techniques keep GPUs well-fed with batches and maintain high efficiency across thousands of concurrent jobs. This stage was also achieved by AWS Batch service, and we leveraged Batch’s EC2 GPU instance type support capability.

How AWS Batch Supports our Solution Goals and Solved Scaling Challenges

AWS Batch provides a managed architecture that removes much of the operational burden of scaling large-scale inference workloads. It enables us to run tens of thousands of concurrent jobs without maintaining complex infrastructure, while benefiting from consistent logging, monitoring, access controls, and file system integration.

The following are some of the elements of the AWS Batch parallel processing.

Compute environment: This is where we define the EC2 instance type, launch template, and the minimum/maximum number of nodes. AWS Batch provisions an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for GPU nodes and deploys containers to these EC2 nodes based on their availability and health. This abstraction means we rarely touch low-level infrastructure. Scaling is automatic—if job volume increases or decreases, the ASG adjusts node count within the defined limits, ensuring we never pay for idle capacity.

Job queue: This determines the order in which jobs are executed against the associated Compute Environment. For example, if queue A is mapped to compute environment (CE) A, jobs in that queue will be dispatched based on available GPU capacity and queue priority. The job queue also enforces high-level execution rules, such as terminating jobs that exceed timeouts, fail due to insufficient GPU availability, or encounter other resource constraints.

Job definition: The job’s execution blueprint, like a docker run command. This specifies the Docker image, required GPU/CPU resources, disk mounts, and any environment variables or runtime configurations needed for the container to run on the EC2 host. It also defines the number of job attempts, or how many times to try to restart the container in case of failure.

Job: The process of submitting a job definition into a job queue. This triggers the provisioning of the required infrastructure. Each node in a multi-node job is automatically assigned two key environment variables—AWS_BATCH_JOB_NODE_INDEX and AWS_BATCH_JOB_NUM_NODES—used to shard data so that each node processes its specific portion of the workload.

When a job is submitted to AWS Batch, every job node receives the same environment variables, including an S3 URI where all data is stored. The EC2 instance from the ASG pulls the Docker image containing our inference model and logic. Once the container is up and healthy, it uses the node’s AWS_BATCH_JOB_NODE_INDEX and AWS_BATCH_JOB_NUM_NODES values to determine exactly which shard of data it should download and process. After the inference step completes, results are immediately stored in the search index. The container then exits with a success code and terminates, freeing the EC2 host. If additional jobs are waiting in the queue, the host picks up the next job; otherwise, the ASG scales down to release unused resources. By default, each job index also creates an AWS CloudWatch log stream, allowing us to observe container activity in real time and debug issues when needed.

Results

By redesigning a sequential workflow into a multi-step sharding and distributed parallel compute pipeline, and by implementing an efficient onload/offload mechanism for data to GPUs, we achieved 10x faster execution. From our monitoring dashboards, we often see our GPUs now consistently run at 100% utilization, delivering extremely high throughput and maximizing hardware efficiency.

AWS Batch allowed us to support this at scale by provisioning ephemeral compute with no fixed infrastructure or standing costs. AWS Batch handles the operational heavy lifting, and its flexibility to support both CPU and GPU workloads has saved us substantial engineering effort while reducing cloud spend.

In one of our largest runs—computing image embeddings for Adobe Stock—we reduced compute time from 30 days to under 20 hours, while realizing a 95%+ reduction in cost, covering not only compute but also engineering investment. This capability empowers our engineering team to accelerate production workloads and run large-scale experiments quickly and cost-effectively.

Lessons Learned

Data Organization

Efficient Data Sharding:

To process a large number of assets efficiently, pre-organizing data into smaller, manageable shards is critical. Without this, even simple operations like listing assets in S3 can take hours or may hang entirely. By organizing the data into smaller shards, we enabled parallel nodes to consume the data more effectively.

Handling S3 Rate Limits:

After organizing the data, parallel downloading by multiple nodes initially resulted in rate limit errors (HTTP 429). To address this:

We collaborated with the AWS S3 team to increase the throughput of the S3 bucket, which significantly reduced the rate limit errors.

Despite these measures, occasional 429 errors persisted. To mitigate this:

We implemented immediate retries within the same processing loop.

We added a final retry mechanism at the end of the processing. By this stage, each node was making fewer calls to S3, reducing the likelihood of 429 errors.

Batch Processing on GPUs:

When working with GPUs, processing data in optimal batches is mandatory. This applies to preprocessing, processing, and post-processing. This optimal batch size varies across applications. We experimented with various batch sizes before the big run and found an optimal size. Batch processing saved significant GPU time and reduced the overall processing time.

Data Localization:

We ensured that the data resided in the same AWS region as the batch computing clusters. This approach:

Avoided cross-region data transfer charges, which can be substantial.

Reduced latency and improved the overall operation time.

Compute

GPU Availability Challenges:

Due to the rising demand for ML computing, obtaining a high number of GPUs on demand is challenging. To address this:

We created compute definitions for various GPU instance families such as G5s, G6es, and G6s.

We leveraged hybrid compute definitions in AWS Batch to maximize flexibility.

Throughput Optimization:

Understanding the throughput of a single pod was essential. Based on this:

We defined the minimum and maximum number of vCPUs/GPUs required.

This ensured that even if the full compute capacity was unavailable, AWS Batch could start processing with the available resources and scale up as more compute became available.

Key Takeaways:

Data Organization: Proper sharding and localization of data are critical for efficient processing and cost optimization.

Error Handling: Implementing robust retry mechanisms helps mitigate rate limit errors.

Batch Processing: Processing data in batches is essential for GPU efficiency.

Compute Flexibility: Adapting to available compute resources ensures uninterrupted processing and scalability.

For established, profitable consumer brands, the P/S ratio is a useful cross check because it relates the share price to the revenue base that supports long term cash generation. Investors usually pay higher or lower P/S multiples depending on what they expect for future growth and how risky they think those cash flows are, so there is no single “right” level for all companies.

Kraft Heinz currently trades on a P/S of 1.11x. That sits above the Food industry average of 0.76x, but below the peer group average of 1.95x. To refine this further, Simply Wall St uses a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 1.33x for Kraft Heinz. This is the P/S level it estimates based on factors such as the company’s earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics.

This Fair Ratio is often more informative than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry because it adjusts for company specific traits rather than assuming all food stocks deserve the same multiple. Comparing the Fair Ratio of 1.33x with the current P/S of 1.11x suggests the shares may be trading at a discount on this metric.

Boston Scientific’s planned $14.5 billion acquisition of Penumbra started off the year with a bang. The two fast-growing, cardiovascular companies complement each other, with Boston Scientific seeing an opportunity to enter new markets, and Penumbra expecting its devices to gain a wider global reach.

Boston Scientific CEO Mike Mahoney explained how they reached a deal, saying there are few companies that can accelerate Boston Scientific’s growth, earnings per share and operating income margins.

“You have basically two companies that are strong independently, and in the combination have the potential to even become much stronger,” Mahoney said on a Thursday investor call.

The acquisition is expected to close in 2026, more likely in the second half of the year, Mahoney said. Boston Scientific will pay $374 per share, funding the acquisition with about $11 billion in cash and the remainder in stock.

Here are three takeaways from the deal:

1. Penumbra is expected to expand Boston Scientific’s presence in a fast-growing market

Penumbra makes thrombectomy devices to remove clots from blood vessels. It also makes embolization devices to stop blood flow and control bleeding. Mahoney said the acquisition could help Boston Scientific enter new, high-growth segments such as neurovascular and mechanical thrombectomy.

Boston Scientific previously had a neurovascular business, but the company sold it to Stryker in 2011.

“We’ve really been looking for a long time on how to become a scaled, market-leading neurovascular company, not one that’s coming from a distance behind the pack and trying to roll up a bunch of companies,” Mahoney said.

Last year, Boston Scientific also acquired Silk Road Medical, which makes minimally invasive products to prevent stroke in patients with carotid artery disease.

Mahoney added that while Boston Scientific sells some products to vascular surgeons, such as Silk Road’s systems, Penumbra works more closely with those physicians, and an acquisition could help with those relationships.

J.P. Morgan analyst Robbie Marcus wrote in a research note that Boston Scientific’s drug eluting stents, drug coated balloons and transcarotid artery revascularization systems could benefit from working more closely with vascular surgeons. At the same time, the analyst thinks Penumbra can benefit from Boston Scientific accelerating its access to international markets.

2. Little product overlap

Boston Scientific is “the most logical acquirer” for Penumbra, Needham analyst Mike Matson wrote in a research note. Penumbra’s products are complementary to Boston Scientific’s cardiology and peripheral intervention businesses, Matson added, with only modest overlap between the companies’ devices.

Because of this, Matson does not expect the deal to run into antitrust issues. He also does not expect Penumbra to receive higher bids from other firms that might face more regulatory hurdles to a deal. Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic and Terumo, for example, all have existing neurovascular businesses.

If the deal falls through, Penumbra would be responsible for paying a break-up fee of $525 million if it enters an agreement for a better proposal or the board changes its recommendation for shareholders to adopt the merger agreement, according to a securities filing.

Boston Scientific would be responsible for a $900 million termination fee if the companies are unable to get the needed regulatory approvals or clearances, but have met the other needed conditions, including shareholder approval.

3. Boston Scientific plans to keep Penumbra as a standalone company and maintain its culture

Mahoney said his number one goal for the acquisition is to keep employees engaged. He said both companies’ cultures are aligned with a focus on innovation and clinical evidence.

“I think you see with Boston Scientific, we have a very highly engaged global workforce,” Mahoney said. “We develop our employees. We have a culture that lets them speak their mind. We care about employees, and that very much matches with Penumbra.”

Two years after the acquisition closes, he expects to retain and grow the commercial workforce and provide additional resources to support Penumbra as needed.

To allow Penumbra the flexibility and speed it needs, Boston Scientific also plans to keep the company as a standalone entity within its cardiovascular group.

Stifel analyst Rick Wise said in a research note that Penumbra works in markets that are “high-growth but also highly competitive,” and that Boston Scientific emphasized protecting Penumbra’s “rapid innovation culture and top-class commercial team.”

As a further show of support for the deal, Penumbra CEO Adam Elsesser said he would take Boston Scientific stock for all of his Penumbra shares, and would be on the combined company’s board of directors.

Il ceo e primo azionista John Bossi ha depositato la lista per il nuovo consiglio di amministrazione, che sarà eletto nell’assemblea dei soci convocata per il 3 febbraio. La novità più rilevante è la candidatura di Marina Natale, ex manager di Unicredit e già amministratore delegato di Amco, come futura presidente della banca.

La lista presentata da Bossi è destinata a ottenere la majority of seats: secondo le previsioni, potrebbe assicurarsi almeno otto posti su nove, rafforzando così la continuità del progetto strategico avviato negli ultimi anni. L’ingresso di Natale al vertice del cda rappresenta un cambio di passo, soprattutto in vista della definizione del nuovo three-year industrial plan che la banca dovrà varare nei prossimi mesi.

Il nuovo piano industriale: wealth management e CIB

Il piano industriale, atteso nei prossimi mesi, sarà incentrato su wealth management e corporate e investment banking. L’obiettivo dichiarato dalla banca è stimolare la crescita organica, puntando su servizi finanziari alle imprese e sulla consulenza patrimoniale per imprenditori e famiglie. In particolare, la divisione wealth management mira a incrementare le masse gestite fino a 4,5 miliardi entro fine 2027, un traguardo ambizioso che richiede una forte integrazione con l’attività corporate. Secondo Bossi, la banca vuole diventare un punto di riferimento per le aziende nel loro percorso di sviluppo, offrendo supporto sia nelle fasi di espansione sia in quelle più delicate, come il passaggio generazionale.

Solidità patrimoniale e ricapitalizzazione

La financial solidity resta un punto di forza per Cherry Bank: a giugno l’istituto ha superato i 4 miliardi di attivo e i 220 milioni di patrimonio, con un CET1 al 17,89%. Questo risultato è stato sostenuto anche dall’aumento di capitale da 15 milioni versato da Bossi, parte di un accordo siglato nel 2021 durante la fusione con il Banco delle Tre Venezie. In vista della ricapitalizzazione, il ceo ha riconosciuto ad alcuni soci il diritto di non diluirsi, una scelta che sarà esercitata entro marzo e porterà la quota di Bossi al 55%, rispetto a oltre il 70% attuale. Una mossa che conferma la volontà di mantenere un controllo stabile, pur favorendo la partecipazione di investitori di rilievo.

Shares of personal computing and printing company HP (NYSE:HPQ) fell 1.7% in the morning session after Morgan Stanley turned more cautious on the U.S. IT hardware sector and lowered its price target on the company's stock.

The investment bank cut its view on the North American IT Hardware industry to “cautious” from “in-line,” warning of a potential 'perfect storm.' The analysts pointed to slowing demand from businesses, rising costs for components, and high stock valuations as reasons for the more defensive stance.

Specifically for HP, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring kept an ""Underweight"" rating on the stock but cut the price target by 10% from $20.00 to $18.00. The negative sentiment impacted the broader sector, with shares of Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise also falling.

What Is The Market Telling Us

HP’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 11 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 8 months ago when the stock dropped 8.2% on the news that the company reported weak first-quarter 2025 results: its EPS and EBITDA missed, and it lowered its full-year EPS guidance, pointing to an uncertain macro backdrop and uneven recovery in printing and consumer tech spending. On the other hand, HP narrowly topped analysts' revenue expectations. Still, this was a softer quarter.

HP is down 10% since the beginning of the year, and at $19.91 per share, it is trading 42.7% below its 52-week high of $34.72 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of HP’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $789.88.",https://news-assets.stockstory.org/cover-images/hp-cover-image-220e9e9be02c_2025-03-04-164456_dhwo.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 12:04:56.443113

10 stocks we like better than IonQ ›

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has seen success that few companies could dream of. It's at the center of one of the most important technological revolutions humankind has ever experienced, and it holds an impressive market share in its sector. Furthermore, Nvidia is producing margins that are unheard of for hardware companies, and any company that can replicate Nvidia's business model will likely be a successful investment.

One area where investors are looking for the next Nvidia is in quantum computing. It's a natural progression from the accelerated computing Nvidia excels at, and Nvidia isn't pursuing a quantum processing unit. So, there could be a new winner on the block for this innovative and exciting technology.

One stock investors point toward that could achieve Nvidia-like status is IonQ (NYSE: IONQ). IonQ is a pure-play quantum computing investment that is solely focused on bringing its quantum computing solution to the market. But can it replicate Nvidia's dominance?

Nvidia is a high standard to live up to

Nvidia's competition in the accelerated computing market is fairly slim. Advanced Micro Devices is an obvious competitor, but so are companies like Broadcom that partner directly with AI hyperscalers to make custom AI chips. Still, Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are at the top of the option list when outfitting a data center with computing hardware. However, that's pretty much it for competition.

Quantum computing is vastly different. Because we're in the early stages of quantum computing development, there are countless companies competing for market share. There are other pure plays, like Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum, as well as some legacy players like Alphabet and Microsoft. All of these companies are striving to reach viable quantum computing status as fast as they can, and whoever gets there first will carve out a first-mover advantage, similar to what OpenAI has done with ChatGPT in generative AI.

The beginnings of IonQ and Nvidia offer a stark contrast, as Nvidia created its GPU to process gaming graphics -- a fairly uncontested field. This allowed Nvidia's first product to flop, then it iterated to make a better solution. Eventually, Nvidia's GPUs became good enough to be used for other computing tasks, like engineering simulations and cryptocurrency mining. IonQ doesn't have that luxury. Its first products need to be its best, as there is no room for error in this fierce competitive landscape.

Another facet of Nvidia's business is its dominance. One estimate points to Nvidia's share of data center GPUs hovering around 90%. That dominance level, especially when you consider that Nvidia's products have a premium over their rivals, is absolutely incredible. It will be very hard for IonQ to achieve that level of dominance, especially with the fierce competition it's facing between scrappy start-ups and legacy tech companies with nearly unlimited resources.

The reality is, IonQ will have a very difficult time duplicating Nvidia's business model. However, there is one path that could make it possible.

IonQ is pursuing a unique quantum computing technology

There isn't just one way to perform a quantum calculation. There are multiple avenues that companies can pursue in quantum technology, but not all of them will work out in the end. The most popular strategy, by far, is superconducting. This technique is used by a few pure plays and by many of the legacy tech companies. There are benefits and drawbacks of this technique, but one of the biggest hurdles superconducting is tackling is accuracy. Right now, quantum computers aren't that accurate, and superconducting methods haven't proven to be largely successful by this measure.

IonQ uses a trapped-ion technique, which yields far superior accuracy. IonQ holds the world record for the most accurate quantum computer, and it's over 10 times as accurate as the best superconducting quantum computer. That may be an impossible challenge for its competition to overcome, which could allow it to match Nvidia's business model.

IonQ becoming the next Nvidia is far from a surefire bet. However, if IonQ can produce a superior computing system and reach an acceptable accuracy threshold, it's possible that IonQ could become the Nvidia of quantum computing. If it does, then the stock could skyrocket higher over the next decade.

Shares of computer hardware and IT solutions company Dell (NYSE:DELL) fell 5.3% in the morning session after Morgan Stanley downgraded its view on the IT hardware industry to 'cautious' and an analyst from the firm lowered the price target on Dell's stock.

The investment bank warned of a 'perfect storm' for the sector, citing slowing enterprise demand, rising component costs, and rich valuations. According to a Morgan Stanley survey, corporate hardware spending budgets were expected to see minimal growth. Specifically for Dell, an analyst at the firm maintained an 'Underweight' rating but cut the price target to $111 from $113. The negative sentiment was widespread, with other hardware stocks like HP Inc and Hewlett Packard Enterprise also falling. Broader market weakness also added to the pressure, as investors reacted to new tariff threats.

The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Dell? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.

What Is The Market Telling Us

Dell’s shares are very volatile and have had 21 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago when the stock gained 2.9% on the news that analyst firm Barclays upgraded its rating on the stock to Overweight from Equal Weight, pointing to strong orders for the company's Artificial Intelligence (AI) servers.

The bank expressed growing confidence in Dell's position in the AI server space and noted improving opportunities in enterprise server and storage markets. The upgrade was driven primarily by stronger-than-expected demand for its AI-focused hardware. Barclays kept its price target on the shares at $148.

Dell is down 10.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $114.12 per share, it is trading 30.8% below its 52-week high of $164.88 from October 2025.

IBM’s The Enterprise in 2030 study finds quantum computing is expected to reshape industry by the end of the decade, but most enterprises are not preparing for its adoption, creating a strategic gap that could leave even AI-advanced organizations exposed.

While 59% of surveyed executives believe quantum-enabled AI will transform their industry by 2030, only 27% expect their organizations to be using quantum computing, a disconnect IBM describes as a strategic miscalculation rather than a timing issue.

The report positions quantum as a complementary technology that will integrate gradually into hybrid classical-AI workflows, with early enterprise use cases already emerging in areas such as drug discovery and financial optimization.

IBM expects quantum computing to reshape industry by 2030, yet most enterprises are not preparing to use it — a gap that the company’s experts warn could leave even AI-advanced organizations exposed to the next major computing shift.

That warning sits at the center of The Enterprise in 2030, a study from the IBM Institute for Business Value, which surveyed more than 2,000 senior executives across 33 geographies and 23 industries in late 2025. The report’s central finding is not that quantum computing is imminent, but that it is inevitable — and that corporate strategy is lagging that reality.

According to the study, 59% of executives believe quantum-enabled artificial intelligence (AI) will transform their industry by the end of the decade. Yet only 27% expect their organizations to be using quantum computing in any capacity by that time. IBM characterizes the gap as a strategic miscalculation rather than a technology timing issue, arguing that companies focused narrowly on AI risk missing a deeper shift in how computation itself evolves.

“Quantum will never stand alone,” said Dr. Thomas Eckl, chief expert at Bosch, in the report. Classical computing, AI and quantum must work together in connected workflows.”

The study positions quantum computing not as a replacement for today’s systems, but as a complementary tool designed to handle classes of problems that strain even the most advanced classical computers — particularly optimization, simulation and probabilistic analysis. Those capabilities, IBM argues, will increasingly matter as AI systems grow more complex and data-hungry.

Readiness Gap — Strategic Consequences

IBM’s researchers frame quantum computing as the fifth and most underappreciated of five forces shaping the enterprise by 2030, following competitive pressure, productivity reinvestment, tailored AI models and the limits of automation. Unlike earlier waves of enterprise technology, the report suggests quantum’s impact will be indirect at first, most likely appearing inside hybrid workflows rather than as standalone systems.

However, the survey data show a disconnect with many executives treating quantum as a distant research topic rather than a planning priority. While nearly six in 10 respondents expect quantum-enabled AI to reshape their industry, fewer than three in 10 expect to deploy quantum tools themselves.

IBM describes that mismatch as unusual compared with prior technology transitions. In areas such as cloud computing and cybersecurity, adoption expectations and readiness tended to move together. With quantum, belief has outpaced preparation, according to the report.

The risk is not that companies will miss an early advantage, but that they will fail to adapt when quantum capabilities begin affecting markets indirectly — through supply chains, financial systems, drug discovery pipelines and national infrastructure.

“Quantum has the potential to accelerate computing — and to unlock use cases beyond the abilities of even today’s most powerful high-performance computers,” the study states.

IBM does not predict a single moment when quantum computing “arrives.” Instead, it describes a gradual integration process similar to how GPUs and specialized AI chips entered enterprise systems. IBM sees quantum arriving first as accelerators for narrow tasks, then as core components of broader platforms.

From Lab to Enterprise

To counter skepticism that quantum computing remains purely theoretical, the report covers several real-world deployments already underway inside large organizations.

One of the most detailed examples comes from Moderna, which has been applying quantum algorithms to problems in mRNA design. The challenge, according to the study, lies in predicting how strands of messenger RNA fold, a problem with an astronomically large number of possible configurations.

“Our goal is to improve human health,” said Alexey Galda, associate scientific director of quantum algorithms and applications at Moderna. “We believe it’s critical to explore every available tool — including quantum computing — to scale our progress today, rather than wait for the technology to fully mature.”

IBM reports that Moderna has used quantum systems involving up to 80 qubits to model mRNA secondary structures, surpassing prior limits in the field. The company also applied its approach to larger optimization problems using as many as 156 qubits and 950 non-local gates, with results matching those of commercial classical solvers.

The IBM team reports that the significance is not that quantum outperformed classical methods, but that it performed comparably on problems previously considered impractical for quantum systems. That parity suggests quantum computing is beginning to move from academic experimentation toward targeted enterprise workloads.

The report also cites early quantum experimentation in financial services, including a quantum-enabled algorithmic trading demonstration conducted by HSBC. In finance, where optimization and risk assessment are central, IBM suggests quantum tools may be adopted earlier than in sectors focused primarily on transactional processing.

To be clear, these examples are presented as signals rather than proof. IBM repeats throughout the report that quantum computing will not replace classical systems, nor will it deliver broad productivity gains on its own. Its value lies in addressing narrow bottlenecks that compound across complex systems.

AI Strategy not Enough

IBM calls particular attention in the report to organizations that view AI investment as sufficient preparation for the next decade. While AI dominates executive agendas — with 79% of respondents saying it will significantly contribute to revenue by 2030 — IBM argues that AI’s growth will increase demand for new forms of computation rather than reduce it.

As AI models become larger and more specialized, they generate optimization problems that classical systems struggle to solve efficiently. Quantum computing, IBM suggests, offers a way to handle those challenges without relying solely on brute-force scaling.

“By 2030, insight will be everywhere,” said Chad Gates, managing director at Pronto Software, in the report. “Interfaces will be radically different and AI will act as the business intelligence system, decision engine and a participant in operations.”

IBM’s analysis suggests that quantum computing’s most immediate role will be as an accelerator for AI-driven workflows. In other words, quantum will improve training, optimization and simulation rather than replacing existing infrastructure. That framing positions quantum readiness as part of AI governance and architecture decisions being made today.

The report also links quantum preparedness to cybersecurity, particularly as post-quantum cryptography standards move closer to adoption. While cybersecurity does not rank as a top executive priority for 2030 in the survey, IBM describes it as a “table stakes” capability that must evolve alongside emerging technologies.

In that context, quantum computing becomes less about competitive advantage and more about systemic resilience.

Plan for Inevitability, not Immediacy

IBM stops short of urging companies to deploy quantum hardware immediately. Instead, it argues that enterprises should treat quantum the way they once treated cloud computing before mass adoption. It should begin building skills, partnerships and governance frameworks sooner, rather than later.

The study calls for organizations to experiment with hybrid workflows that combine classical computing, AI and quantum tools, even if those quantum components remain small. It also urges leaders to monitor quantum developments as part of strategic risk management rather than innovation scouting.

This framing reflects the report’s broader thesis: that the enterprise of 2030 will be defined less by any single technology than by how organizations integrate multiple systems into adaptable architectures.

Competitive advantage in 2030 will come from innovation rather than resource optimization, a statement in the report that most — 64% — of the experts who were polled .

IBM’s researchers conclude that quantum computing fits that pattern. According to IBM, its impact will likely emerge unevenly, first benefiting organizations that have already mapped where advanced computation could unlock value.

According to the report, those that wait for clarity may find that the shift arrives embedded in markets and supply chains rather than announced in product launches.",https://thequantuminsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-9.59.57-AM-1.png,N,,2026-01-20 12:05:07.697488

Cyber risks vary and can be discussed in several sections within 10-K filings, including risk factors and management’s discussion and analysis.
Companies should also steer away from “AI washing,” a concern that businesses’ disclosures don’t actually match their use or risks, he added.","Companies are gearing up to disclose emerging cyber risks in upcoming financial reports to the Trump administration’s SEC as rapidly evolving artificial intelligence spawns new threats.

While Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins has shifted the agency away from Biden-era climate and environmental, social, and governance initiatives, lawyers still are bracing for the Wall Street regulator’s continued scrutiny of corporate cybersecurity as it stresses disclosure of material information that could affect investors’ decision-making.

Publicly-traded companies crafting their approach for SEC filings—from Form 10-K annual reports to breach disclosures—face a new challenge: providing specific details about cyber threats tied to AI in real time as they work to understand emerging tools’ risks. They’re also on high alert for how the SEC will tackle cyber enforcement after the agency in November dropped a case against business software firm SolarWinds Corp. that cyber executives and attorneys broadly criticized as an overreach by the Biden administration.

“It wasn’t a complete retreat, but through that action and some of the other actions that the SEC has taken, it seems like they’re taking a step back from being ‘cyber auditor,’ but not taking a step back from being the enforcer of accurate disclosures around cybersecurity,” said Ilona Cohen, chief legal and policy officer at HackerOne, a security solutions provider.

Ahead of March deadlines for many companies to file their 10-Ks, businesses will juggle spelling out new AI risks with the SEC’s emphasis on materiality. The agency on Jan. 13 called for recommendations on how corporate disclosures could be curtailed to focus on details reasonable investors deem important.

The SEC signals that “you have to get your house in order and understand these risks so that you can articulate them and talk about them if they are material to you,” said Frank Esposito, partner at Squire Patton Boggs who advises boards of directors and in-house legal teams on governance and securities issues.

The SEC declined to comment on what the agency is looking for from companies when reviewing disclosures related to AI and cybersecurity in 10-Ks covering 2025.

10-K Strategy

The use of AI is growing so ubiquitous that, for many companies, it’s worth considering SEC disclosure, said Michelle Reed, co-chair of Paul Hastings LLP’s data privacy and cybersecurity group. How they’re using it internally or leveraging it as part of their cyber defense shapes those details.

“There’s no question that that is a huge discussion point on every 10-K that we’ve done so far this year,” Reed said.

Cyber risks vary and can be discussed in several sections within 10-K filings, including risk factors and management’s discussion and analysis. In its 10-K, information technology company HP Inc. said it was bracing for an increase in sophisticated cyber attacks because of AI. Broadcom Inc., which supplies infrastructure software solutions, in December flagged AI-powered cyber attacks relying on deep fakes as an area of risk for the company.

The companies didn’t respond to requests to comment on their SEC filings.

Tailoring the disclosure to the specific company and the systems it uses will provide useful information for investors and mitigate the risk of comment letters from SEC staff seeking further information, according to Debevoise & Plimpton LLP corporate partner Eric Juergens.

“You could easily draft a risk factor or some disclosure that would apply to 95% of the companies out there—but that doesn’t really tell an investor all that much,” Juergens said.

Companies should also steer away from “AI washing,” a concern that businesses’ disclosures don’t actually match their use or risks, he added.

As companies enter the final stretch of 10-K preparation, Anthony Bonaguro, partner in Grant Thornton Advisors LLC’s CFO advisory services, said he expects to see some “waiting a bit” to file their reports closer to deadline to see how others are approaching disclosures.

Talking Cyber

While cybersecurity lawyers say they expect less aggressive enforcement from Atkins’ SEC, they still advise companies to be on watch for enforcement of accurate and timely disclosures of material cyber incidents, which companies are supposed to report in 8-K filings for material events. The SEC hasn’t rolled back Biden-era 2023 cyber incident disclosure rules, which aim to give investors timely disclosure of hacks.

Determining the materiality of cyber incidents as they unfold will be a core focus for companies this year.

A ransomware attack, for example, may not always be material depending on a company’s size, balance sheet, and ability to withstand it, Paul Hastings’ Reed said. This means businesses should be documenting how they assessed an incident’s materiality ahead of regulatory probes.

“The SEC will be focused on what I call and what many commentators call ‘bread-and-butter’ securities enforcement issues and a failure to disclose a material cyber incident entirely is always going to be seen as ‘bread-and-butter,’” said Haimavathi Marlier, co-chair of Morrison & Foerster LLP’s fintech and securities enforcement practices and former SEC senior trial counsel.

The agency formed the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit in February 2025 to ferret out cyber-related misconduct and monitor companies’ compliance with cyber regulations, among other priorities.

It’s unclear where the 2023 disclosure rules rank in the unit’s priorities. The group is leveraging its staff’s “substantial fintech and cyber-related experience” to combat fraud and protect investors, the SEC said when it formed the unit.

“Again another signal that they’re primarily focused on accurate disclosures,” HackerOne’s Cohen said of the new unit. “And I will be paying attention to what they’re up to and what their plans are.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/85fa8d6/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4c%2F14%2Fe84c8bf04bc7a2328c2829ce89ba%2Fbli-hp-and-broadcom-tear-away-cover.png,N,,2026-01-20 12:05:03.698659

Under the definitive agreement, Adobe will pay $12 per share, representing a premium of roughly 77.5 percent over Semrush’s last closing price before the announcement.

Adobe plans to fold Semrush into its Digital Experience business, alongside Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Analytics, and to connect it to the recently introduced Adobe Brand Concierge. The company says this combination will help marketers understand how their brands appear across owned channels, large language models, traditional search and the wider web.

As generative AI becomes a new interface between customers and brands, marketers are beginning to treat generative engine optimisation (GEO) as a complement to search engine optimisation (SEO).

“Brand visibility is being reshaped by gen AI, and brands that do not embrace this new opportunity risk losing relevance and revenue,” said Anil Chakravarthy, president of Adobe’s Digital Experience Business. “With Semrush, we are unlocking GEO for marketers as a new growth channel alongside their SEO, driving more visibility, customer engagement and conversions across the ecosystem.”

The two boards have approved the transaction. Adobe has also secured voting commitments from Semrush’s founders and other shareholders representing more than 75 percent of Semrush’s voting power to support the deal.

A Semrush shareholder meeting to vote on the merger has been scheduled for 3 February 2026. If approved and regulatory clearances are obtained, closing is expected in the first half of 2026.

Semrush’s platform is widely used for SEO, competitive research and online visibility tracking. In its most recent quarter, the company reported enterprise annual recurring revenue growth of 33 percent year on year, and it counts Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and TikTok among its customers.

“Adobe is an industry leader in helping marketers create personalised customer experiences at scale,” said Bill Wagner, chief executive of Semrush. “With the advent of LLMs and AI-driven search, brands need to understand where and how their customers are engaging in these new channels.”

Adobe says most Fortune 100 companies rely on its software to apply AI within their workflows, naming The Coca-Cola Company, General Motors and IBM among customers. It argues that integrating Semrush’s GEO and SEO capabilities will provide marketers with a single view of brand visibility across search, LLMs and owned channels.

Regulatory assessment will include review under the US Hart-Scott-Rodino process and scrutiny in other jurisdictions, including the UK and EU, given Adobe’s scale in digital experience software. Both parties said the merger remains subject to customary conditions. Adobe abandoned a proposed Figma acquisition in 2023 following regulatory opposition, which makes the timetable for this transaction a focus for investors.

Adobe has positioned Brand Concierge at the centre of its agentic AI strategy, describing it as an application that turns brand content into conversational experiences across digital touchpoints. The company has pointed to Adobe Analytics data showing a sharp rise in traffic to US retail sites from generative AI sources, underscoring why discoverability beyond traditional search is now a priority.

Cash consideration will be funded from Adobe’s balance sheet and operating cash flow.

Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is acting as legal adviser to Adobe. Centerview Partners LLC is serving as exclusive financial adviser to Semrush, and Davis Polk & Wardwell is its legal adviser.

Mr Wagner concluded: “The combination of Adobe and Semrush provides marketers more insights and capabilities to increase their discoverability across today’s evolving digital landscape.”

In addition, higher R&D and restructuring spend may constrain earnings leverage, raising the risk that dividend growth slows if operational momentum does not improve.","Medtech is in an exciting place right now.

Artificial intelligence (AI), predictive monitoring, digital twin simulations and robotics are all driving rapid innovation across the sector.

R&D activity is set to expand, both at established firms and startups with potentially disruptive technologies, particularly those leveraging complex data, real-time analytics, edge computing and edge AI.

Regulatory frameworks are also evolving. In February 2026, the FDA will replace its decades-old Quality System Regulation with a modernized Quality Management System Regulation.

In Europe, meanwhile, the EU’s AI Act and European Health Data Space Regulation will push the sector toward greater transparency.

Medtronic [MDT] is at the forefront of many of these developments.

Founded in 1949 as a medical electronics repair shop in Minnesota, it pioneered cardiac pacemakers, insulin pumps and advanced surgical systems, expanding through innovation and acquisitions. Over decades, Medtronic has grown into a diversified healthcare giant, spanning cardiovascular, diabetes, neurological and surgical technologies worldwide.

The firm’s Q2 results, released in November 2025, beat expectations.

Revenue rose 6.6% to $9bn, led by a 10.8%% surge in cardiovascular sales — the firm’s best outside the Covid-19 pandemic in over a decade. Cardiac ablation grew 71% year-over-year, with the Affera pulsed field ablation system doubling its install base.

The company raised full-year guidance, lifting revenue growth to 5.5% and EPS to $5.62–5.66.

MDT stock climbed steeply following the results, although it has dipped since then. It is up 16.02% over the past 12 months as of the January 16 close.

Going into 2026, commentators and investors alike are buoyant about Medtronic’s prospects.

Medium-term Tailwinds for MDT Stock

In May 2025, Medtronic said it would spin off its diabetes unit into a standalone, publicly listed company, with the deal expected to close by year-end 2026 based on management’s guidance.

The rationale for this move is compelling, and a number of commentators have expressed approval.

Principally, Medtronic has struggled to keep up with rivals in key areas of diabetes care, notably continuous glucose monitoring, while facing intensifying competition in insulin pumps. In addition, diabetes is also the group’s only direct-to-consumer business and delivers materially lower operating margins than its other divisions.

Exiting the unit will sharpen Medtronic’s focus on higher-margin B2B segments and could help unlock more profitable, sustainable growth.

Elsewhere, in December 2025, Medtronic secured US regulatory clearance for Hugo, its robotic-assisted surgery system, initially for urologic procedures. While the approval is unlikely to drive near-term revenue growth, it opens a significant long-term opportunity. Robotic surgery remains underpenetrated despite clear advantages in minimally invasive care. Although competition is intense, growing shipments and expanded indications should allow Hugo to become a meaningful contributor over time.

The company has also announced it will be making acquisitions as it looks to expand and diversify its portfolio.

At the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco earlier in January, executives said the firm has “significant firepower” to pursue acquisitions.

The company is focused on tuck-in deals, particularly in cardiology and neuroscience, with a preference for assets that are early stage or close to commercialization, according to CEO Geoff Martha.

CFO Thierry Piéton said Medtronic’s balance sheet provides ample flexibility to complete a “meaningful number” of transactions without putting pressure on its finances. He added that the company is re-accelerating its M&A activity after a quieter period, while stressing that Medtronic’s dividend policy remains unchanged.

Management is targeting acquisitions in the low- to mid-single-digit billions of dollars, Reuters reported, aiming to complement internal R&D rather than replace it. To speed execution, Medtronic has also established a new board-level committee focused on dealmaking.

In parallel to this, the company has pursued various collaborations, including a recently announced partnership with Precision Neuroscience to integrate its StealthStation surgical platform with Precision’s Layer 7 brain-computer interface.

Medtech Leaders: MDT vs BSX vs SYK

Let’s see how Medtronic measures up against two leading peers in the space.

Boston Scientific [BSX] specializes in minimally invasive interventional devices across cardiovascular, neurovascular, urology and endoscopy segments. The company has delivered double-digit organic revenue growth and expanded margins through innovation and strategic acquisitions, including a recent $14.5bn deal for Penumbra [PEN] to bolster its cardiovascular portfolio. Boston Scientific focuses on high-growth procedural markets rather than broad device categories and, with a $130.61bn market cap, slightly outstrips Medtronic in terms of size.

Stryker Corporation [SYK], meanwhile, leads in orthopedics and surgical systems, including robotic-assisted surgery with its Mako platform, as well as neurotechnology and emergency care equipment. Its revenue growth and profitability are underpinned by strong product demand, recurring implant volumes and innovation in surgical tools. Stryker also offers a dividend, appealing to income-oriented investors. At $139.12bn, its market cap is the largest of the three.

Here go the three firms’ current fundamentals.

Source: Yahoo Finance

Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Stryker represent a scale spectrum within medtech.

Medtronic stands at the broadest end, with diversified revenue streams across chronic care, surgical and device segments, generating scale, steady cash flows and resilience to cyclicality. Its extensive portfolio and global reach position it as a core medtech holding with moderate growth and strong fundamentals.

Boston Scientific sits in the mid-growth tier, with a sharper focus on procedural and interventional devices. It has delivered robust organic growth and margin expansion through innovation and bolt-on acquisitions, though its earnings are somewhat more sensitive to procedure volumes and integration risk from recent deals.

Stryker excels in orthopedics and surgical robotics, combining above-average growth with attractive margins and shareholder returns including dividends. Its fundamentals reflect strong product demand and pricing power in elective and trauma procedures.

Collectively, the three offer diversified exposure across medtech’s core growth drivers with varying risk-return profiles.

Conclusion: The Investment Case for MDT Stock

The Bull Case for Medtronic

Medtronic stands out as a compelling option for income-focused investors. The healthcare group has raised its dividend for 48 consecutive years and currently offers a forward yield of around 3%. It is on course to achieve Dividend King status — defined as 50 straight years of dividend growth — within the next few years, with a strong likelihood of sustaining dividend increases well beyond that milestone. This income appeal is reinforced by Medtronic’s resilient free cash flow generation, investment-grade balance sheet and diversified end markets, which collectively underpin dividend durability across economic cycles.

The Bear Case for Medtronic

Despite its defensive appeal, Medtronic faces several headwinds. Organic growth has lagged faster-growing medtech peers, while execution challenges in diabetes and cardiac devices have weighed on margins. Ongoing pricing pressure, rising input costs and regulatory scrutiny could limit near-term profitability. In addition, higher R&D and restructuring spend may constrain earnings leverage, raising the risk that dividend growth slows if operational momentum does not improve.",https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/med_2225143489_1200px.jpg_medium.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 11:11:56.303388

Company Overview

With roots dating back to 1863 and a presence across 26 states primarily in the Midwest and West, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) is one of America's largest banks providing lending, deposit services, wealth management, payment processing, and merchant services to individuals and businesses.

Sales Growth

From lending activities to service fees, most banks build their revenue model around two income sources. Interest rate spreads between loans and deposits create the first stream, with the second coming from charges on everything from basic bank accounts to complex investment banking transactions. Regrettably, U.S. Bancorp’s revenue grew at a sluggish 4.4% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This fell short of our benchmark for the banking sector and is a rough starting point for our analysis.

We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within financials, a half-decade historical view may miss recent interest rate changes, market returns, and industry trends. U.S. Bancorp’s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its revenue was flat over the last two years. Note: Quarters not shown were determined to be outliers, impacted by outsized investment gains/losses that are not indicative of the recurring fundamentals of the business.

This quarter, U.S. Bancorp reported year-on-year revenue growth of 5.1%, and its $7.37 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 0.6%.

Net interest income made up 58.6% of the company’s total revenue during the last five years, meaning U.S. Bancorp’s growth drivers strike a balance between lending and non-lending activities.

Our experience and research show the market cares primarily about a bank’s net interest income growth as non-interest income is considered a lower-quality and non-recurring revenue source.

Tangible Book Value Per Share (TBVPS)

Banks are balance sheet-driven businesses because they generate earnings primarily through borrowing and lending. They’re also valued based on their balance sheet strength and ability to compound book value (another name for shareholders’ equity) over time.

When analyzing banks, tangible book value per share (TBVPS) takes precedence over many other metrics. This measure isolates genuine per-share value by removing intangible assets of debatable liquidation worth. Traditional metrics like EPS are helpful but face distortion from M&A activity and loan loss accounting rules.

U.S. Bancorp’s TBVPS grew at a tepid 3.7% annual clip over the last five years. However, TBVPS growth has accelerated recently, growing by 16.7% annually over the last two years from $21.37 to $29.12 per share.

Over the next 12 months, Consensus estimates call for U.S. Bancorp’s TBVPS to grow by 8.7% to $31.67, paltry growth rate.

Key Takeaways from U.S. Bancorp’s Q4 Results

It was encouraging to see U.S. Bancorp beat analysts’ tangible book value per share expectations this quarter. We were also happy its net interest income narrowly outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this print had some key positives.

PE Deals data is for announced or completed deals where a Canadian company is the target, as of December 31, 2025.","The private equity industry went in a number of different directions in 2025. Global dealmaking value picked up in the second half of the year but the number of deals decreased. PE exits declined year-over-year, boosting growth in alternative strategies to generate liquidity. Investors remain committed to PE according to Preqin's latest investor survey, despite exercising greater caution in short-term commitments. Macroeconomic conditions improved markedly as the year went on, after a turbulent and unexpected start.

In this edition of the Bennett Jones PE Briefing, we look at the full-year data on private equity activity in Canada in 2025 as well as:

how 2025 unfolded and what to look for in the coming year

PE exit activity and what to expect in 2026

trends in GP-stakes investing

The PE Market in 2025 and Looking Ahead

Private equity dealmakers are looking ahead to renewed growth in activity following an upswing in global transaction values during H2 2025. The third quarter was particularly buoyant with US$376.3 billion in aggregate deal value, according to Preqin. This was the best three-month tally since Q1 2022. In November, the CVCA reported the Canadian private equity market had a record-setting third quarter in 2025.

Several segments of private equity stood out with highly active years in 2025, including secondaries. The global secondary market volume now exceeds US$160 billion and fundraising is headed for another banner year. This is driven in large part by a soft PE exit environment. The flow of capital into secondaries stands in contrast to a weak fundraising environment overall in the PE industry.

The private credit market in Canada has grown to become a core allocation for institutional investors and has been a sharp area of focus in 2025. Private credit strategies have delivered outsized returns and the asset class is expected to continue growing—as deals become structurally more complex.

Leveraged buyouts were on the rise in 2025, spurred by private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds, and this is expected to continue into the new year. S&P Global data shows that PE's share of leveraged buyouts has been increasing since 2023.

The pace of exits continues to be one of the biggest challenges for PE firms. As the Wall Street Journal describes it, ""Private equity has more housecleaning to do in 2026. Recent deals boosted optimism for the new year, but firms are still sitting on a glut of portfolio companies.""

What to Expect in Exit Activity

Globally, private equity exit volume remains subdued, but average exit size increased in 2025, according to Preqin data. In Canada, PE exits continued to decline in 2025 by deal count. The aggregate value of announced or completed deals decreased in 2025, after rising from 2022-2024.

The outlook for PE exits in 2026 remains cautiously balanced between optimism and restraint. Reasons for optimism in 2026 include lower interest rates, continued pressure for exits from LPs and a reopening of the IPO window (as well as a renewed bullish sentiment in the capital markets generally), in the United States. Globally, the IPO market had its best year since 2022, according to Dealogic. The IPO market in Canada remains in a drought, however, with de-listings and companies taken private continuing to outpace IPOs on the TSX and TSXV.

Although high-quality assets are in demand for exits, valuation gaps continue to persist for many companies. PE assets nearing maturity are expected to exit at a slower pace. While the global economic picture has improved, uneven growth and ""K-shaped"" recoveries for certain sectors compared to others may continue. All of this could lead to a patchy recovery across the PE landscape. Preqin says that for now, it sees only tentative signs of a recovery in exit volumes.

GP-Stakes Investing

GP-stakes investing involves the sale of a minority, generally non-voting ownership interest in a GP entity by an asset manager to another investor. Historically, such transactions were undertaken almost exclusively by existing LPs seeking deeper alignment with the asset manager. A notable early example is the CalPERS 2001 acquisition of a minority interest in The Carlyle Group for approximately US$175 million.

Over the past decade, the buyer landscape has shifted. Specialized investment vehicles, commonly known as GP‑stakes funds, have emerged as the dominant acquirers of these interests. While a GP‑stakes investor may, in certain cases, be required to fund its pro rata share of the GP’s capital commitment and receive a corresponding limited partnership interest, the primary objective of GP-stakes funds is to capture returns linked to their share of GP economics, principally management fees and, when realized, carried interest. An early illustration of this evolution occurred when Affiliated Managers Group, a publicly traded asset manager known for acquiring GP-stakes, purchased a minority equity position from Goldman Sachs’ Petershill Fund I for approximately US$800 million. Since then, the strategy has continued to accelerate. There were US$3.4 billion of GP-stakes deals globally in 2024, the highest level since the record year of 2021, according to PitchBook data.

Although Canada has yet to see the emergence of funds dedicated exclusively to GP stakes investing, the model offers compelling opportunities for both GPs and LPs. For GPs, selling a minority, non voting stake can provide long awaited liquidity for employees, and some GPs also use the sale proceeds to strengthen their management team or facilitate succession planning. GP-stakes opportunities may also serve as incentives used to attract lead LPs. For LPs, acquiring a stake in the GP enhances alignment with the manager, and any carried interest realized can meaningfully offset overall fee expenses associated with investing in the fund. In this sense, GP stakes continues to evolve from a niche structuring solution into a recognized asset class, joining the ranks of private equity, real estate, secondaries, infrastructure, and other established alternatives.

Canadian PE Activity

Total Canadian private equity deal value was up and deal count was down in the final quarter of 2025. Fewer deals were done last year than in 2024 and the total value for announced or completed transactions declined from US$59.8 billion to US$48.3 billion in 2025.

Add-ons were the most common type of transactions—156 Canadian PE deals used this strategy in 2025. Buyouts (27), growth (26) and LP direct (21) rounded out the top five. LP direct deals and corporate carve-outs saw more deals in 2025 than the previous year.

Looking Ahead

The mood of the Canadian and global private equity markets improved as we moved through 2025. Growing sectors such as technology (including the burgeoning AI and AI-adjacent sectors) and defense will continue to create dealmaking opportunities. The AI boom has been one of the biggest stories in years, with tens of billions of dollars being invested in data centres, large-scale energy and industrial infrastructure, and the sector’s picks-and-shovels suppliers.

Challenges remain for private equity in 2026. Delayed exits, aging assets and slower fundraising may hold the industry back from a full recovery. On the buy-side specifically, add-ons and roll-ups into existing portfolios should continue to improve as sponsors look for EBITDA expansion.

ID18,Eli Lilly,2026-01-20 15:11:19+00:00,BioSpace,"JPM26: After a Tough 2025, Biohaven is Gearing Up to Challenge Goliath—Lilly - BioSpace","Dan Samorodnitsky, www.biospace.com, dan-samorodnitsky",,,,,https://www.biospace.com/business/jpm26-after-a-tough-2025-biohaven-is-gearing-up-to-challenge-goliath-lilly,"We’re not seeing the side effects that Lilly ran into.” Notably, Lilly did not report a reason for pausing the bimagrumab trial in September.
While the pivot is significant and the competition fierce, Coric appears undaunted.
Coric took a pipeline of experimental products from what remained and spun out a second company, Biohaven Ltd., trading under Biohaven Pharma’s original stock ticker.
Then, on January 7 just ahead of JPM, the investment firm Janus Henderson bought $125 million in shares of Biohaven.
“That’s 10% of the company” Coric said.","Vlad Coric seems unfazed by the crowd of people milling around Union Square in San Francisco. This is apparently Coric’s default demeanor, as the Biohaven CEO also appears largely unbothered by the myriad setbacks that have hit his company in recent months.

That includes a recent mid-stage miss in major depressive disorder, a November 2025 FDA rejection in a rare neurodegenerative disease and a corresponding $150 million capital opportunity lost.

Instead, he tells me about the company’s plans to repurpose its spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) drug taldefgrobep alfa, which flunked a Phase III trial in late 2024, as a muscle-sparing drug for use alongside GLP-1s like Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy or Eli Lilly’s Zepbound. He specifically points to bimagrumab, for which Lilly paused a clinical trial last September.

“A lot of folks who don’t want to take GLP-1s are concerned about the muscle loss and the bone density effects,” Coric told BioSpace on the sidelines of the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. “The only thing that I think limited Lilly’s bimagrumab was the side effects. They had very high rates of side effects. We’re not seeing the side effects that Lilly ran into.” Notably, Lilly did not report a reason for pausing the bimagrumab trial in September.

Biohaven made a serendipitous discovery following the trial of taldefgrobep alfa for SMA—a neuromuscular disease that causes destruction of motor neurons; participants saw reduced weight and preservation of lean muscle and bone density while on the drug. Biohaven Is recruiting patients living with obesity or who are overweight for a Phase II study, which is set to complete in September 2026.

While the pivot is significant and the competition fierce, Coric appears undaunted. In fact, he seems only to see an opportunity.

Bimagrumab is an inhibitor that blocks activin type II receptors, preventing its inhibitory action on muscle growth while potentially causing side effects, Coric said, while taldefgrobep alfa uses a different mechanism of action to inhibit a different protein, myostatin, which itself regulates muscle size. “So we think we could deliver bimagrumab-like efficacy without the side effects. That’s a winning profile for a monotherapy.”

The Biohaven brand has had its successes. In 2022 Pfizer bought Biohaven Pharmaceutical for $11.6 billion, largely to acquire its successful migraine treatment program. Coric took a pipeline of experimental products from what remained and spun out a second company, Biohaven Ltd., trading under Biohaven Pharma’s original stock ticker.

The new company hasn’t yet been able to reproduce the original’s commercial achievements. When Biohaven’s spinocerebellar ataxia treatment troriluzole was rejected by the FDA in November 2025, the company also missed out on a $150 million payment from investment firm Oberland Capital. But Biohaven is resilient. The company went to Wall Street to raise more funds, seeking a $150 million public offering but ending up with $200 million.

Then, on January 7 just ahead of JPM, the investment firm Janus Henderson bought $125 million in shares of Biohaven. “That’s 10% of the company” Coric said. “We’re well capitalized.”

Coric’s confidence appears to stem from Biohaven’s diverse pipeline. He pointed repeatedly to BHV-1300, a protein degrader therapy for autoimmune conditions. That drug scored in March 2025 when it showed a deep reduction in IgG proteins after a four-week Phase I trial.

For all of this swagger, however, it seems Coric and Biohaven came to the conference with something to prove to the rest of the biopharma world. “I think coming into [JPM26], we wanted to make sure we were well-funded, we could show people our exciting data and focus on the degrader platform as the future.”

Despite the rollercoaster trajectory of the second iteration of Biohaven, Coric seems intent to keep the company running as its own entity—for the time being—although he is open to a potential buyout.

“I’m a firm believer you should run your company like you’re going to own it forever,” he said, “but if somebody comes in and gives you a good offer, you’ll always consider that, as we did for [Pfizer].”",https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/bb92b8c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4011x2256+201+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F9d%2F0c656e304f4ca2b8e793e50768ad%2Fistock-648692064.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:11:31.384536

The fourth quarter provision was $6 million (1.1%) higher than the third quarter of 2025 and $17 million (3%) higher than the fourth quarter of 2024.

USB Price Action: U.S. Bancorp shares were down 3.25% at $52.63 during premarket trading on Tuesday.","U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) stock fell on Tuesday after the lender reported fourth-quarter 2025 results.

The company reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, beating the analyst consensus estimate of $1.19. Quarterly sales of $7.337 billion outpaced the Street view of $7.308 billion.

The company’s provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter was $577 million, compared with $571 million in the third quarter of 2025 and $560 million in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The fourth quarter provision was $6 million (1.1%) higher than the third quarter of 2025 and $17 million (3%) higher than the fourth quarter of 2024.

The increase in provision expense year over year was primarily driven by loan portfolio growth, partially offset by lower net charge-offs.

Other Metrics

Net income rose 23.0% year over year to $2.045 billion.

Return on tangible common equity rose to 18.4%, while return on average assets increased to 1.19%. The efficiency ratio improved to 57.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2024.

The company delivered 440 basis points of positive operating leverage, adjusted for prior notable items. Net interest margin rose to 2.77%, up 6 basis points year over year and 2 basis points sequentially.

Noninterest expense remained relatively stable compared to the prior-year period. The CET1 capital ratio stood at 10.8% as of Dec. 31, 2025.

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis rose to $4.31 billion, up from $4.25 billion in the prior quarter and $4.18 billion a year earlier.

Average deposits rose to $515.1 billion from $511.8 billion in the third quarter, while average total loans increased to $384.3 billion from $379.2 billion in the prior quarter.

“Record consumer deposits this quarter and effective balance sheet remixing contributed to net interest income growth and margin expansion. Fee income exceeded our mid-single-digit growth target and was supported by broad strength across our diversified fee businesses,” said CEO Gunjan Kedia.

Important Highlights

U.S. Bancorp signed a definitive deal to buy BTIG, LLC, expanding its investment banking and trading platform. BTIG’s roughly 700 employees across 20 locations will join U.S. Bancorp, and current leadership will stay.

The company expects the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approvals.

U.S. Bank also completed a cross-border stablecoin pilot, signaling readiness for future compliant commercial offerings.

Outlook

U.S. Bancorp forecast fiscal 2026 revenue of $29.85 billion to $30.42 billion, compared with Wall Street expectations of $30.04 billion.

“Looking ahead to 2026, we remain committed to our strategic priorities and medium-term targets as these measures will continue to drive sustainable EPS growth and industry-leading returns,” Kedia added.

USB Price Action: U.S. Bancorp shares were down 3.25% at $52.63 during premarket trading on Tuesday. The stock is approaching its 52-week high of $56.19, according to Benzinga Pro data.

Quick Insights

Underperformance was mainly due to the fund's higher exposure to growth stocks and lower exposure to value, as value outperformed growth significantly during the quarter.

I maintain a constructive outlook but anticipate investors will favor cash-generative companies with sustainable earnings and durable competitive advantages after a year of strong returns.

Absence from the aerospace & defense industry and lagging healthcare holdings were key detractors, while technology and AI-related names contributed positively.

The marriage between Wingify and AB Tasty represents something of a Silicon Valley paradox.
The new company will operate under both the Wingify VWO and AB Tasty brands initially, maintaining separate product lines before gradually consolidating the platform over time.
Everstone will retain majority control and hold majority board rights, with a board structure of five to six seats including representation from Everstone, Gupta, and three to four independent directors.
Everstone's merger of Wingify and AB Tasty signals a clear bet that the future of digital optimization belongs to consolidated, AI-ready platforms rather than point solutions.","Private equity firm Everstone Capital just closed a major consolidation play in the digital optimization space, merging India's Wingify and France's AB Tasty into a single $100 million-plus revenue company. The move comes just one year after Everstone acquired a controlling stake in Wingify for $200 million, signaling an aggressive platform-building strategy aimed at competing head-to-head with players like Optimizely and Adobe.

The marriage between Wingify and AB Tasty represents something of a Silicon Valley paradox. Two rivals that have long operated in the same space - helping enterprises improve digital experiences through testing and personalization - are now joining forces under Everstone Capital's umbrella. It's a move that tells you a lot about where the market's heading and why pure-play startups are increasingly finding it hard to go alone.

Sparsh Gupta, Wingify's co-founder, will lead the combined entity as CEO. The new company will operate under both the Wingify VWO and AB Tasty brands initially, maintaining separate product lines before gradually consolidating the platform over time. Both businesses are profitable, a detail Gupta emphasized to underscore that this isn't a desperate fire sale but rather a calculated play to build something bigger.

""Both the businesses have been operating as friendly competition,"" Gupta told TechCrunch. The framing matters here - this is positioned as natural alignment rather than acquisition by necessity. The merger reflects what enterprises actually want: integrated, holistic platforms that don't require stitching together multiple vendors to cover testing, personalization, and feature delivery all in one place.

The numbers underscore the scale Everstone is assembling. The combined business will serve more than 4,000 customers globally, with roughly 90 percent of revenue coming from the US and Europe. We're talking about brands like Forbes, Walt Disney, Amway, L'Oréal, and Samsonite - enterprises across e-commerce, SaaS, travel, and media. Close to 800 employees will operate across 11 offices globally, with roughly 350 staff based outside India. The merged company will be headquartered in New Delhi.

Everstone is injecting ""significant additional capital"" into the deal beyond what was already committed when it acquired a majority stake in Wingify for $200 million in January 2025. Gupta described the fresh capital as primarily aimed at ""cleaning up"" AB Tasty's cap table - translation: paying off existing investors - and enabling the two businesses to operate as one. Financial terms weren't disclosed, though the structure includes cash and some equity rollover for existing leadership.

The executive team reflects the merging of two orgs. Alongside Gupta as CEO, Wingify co-founder Ankit Jain takes on Chief Product and Technology Officer duties. AB Tasty's co-founders - Rémi Aubert and Alix de Sagazan - become Chief Customer and Strategy Officer and Chief Revenue Officer respectively. Everstone will retain majority control and hold majority board rights, with a board structure of five to six seats including representation from Everstone, Gupta, and three to four independent directors.

Here's what's particularly noteworthy: there are no layoffs planned. Gupta framed this as ""value creation"" rather than cost-cutting, which is unusual for private equity deals but increasingly common in high-growth tech consolidations where scaling product matters more than cutting overhead.

The timing reflects a larger market shift. Enterprise SaaS M&A is on a tear. According to PitchBook data, the sector saw 270 deals worth $65 billion in Q3 alone, with deal volumes up 26.2 percent quarter-over-quarter and private equity accounting for 66.7 percent of those deals. Private equity firms have identified consolidation as a key value-creation strategy, and enterprise customers are increasingly demanding AI-ready, integrated platforms that can handle everything from A/B testing to personalization to feature flagging without vendor fragmentation.

This deal also positions Everstone to compete more directly against Optimizely, Adobe's experience cloud offerings, and other established players dominating the digital optimization category. By combining Wingify's 3,000-plus customer base with AB Tasty's 1,000-plus, Everstone gets instant scale and a deeper product suite. The focus now shifts to investing in AI capabilities - both companies have flagged this as a priority going forward - while maintaining the customer experience in the near term.

The deal is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, but expect this to close relatively quickly. Everstone's backing suggests it has a clear roadmap for the combined company, likely involving further bolt-on acquisitions, deeper AI integration, and aggressive expansion in specific verticals where the merged platform can offer unique value.

Everstone's merger of Wingify and AB Tasty signals a clear bet that the future of digital optimization belongs to consolidated, AI-ready platforms rather than point solutions. For enterprise customers tired of integrating multiple vendors, this deal means fewer technical headaches and more comprehensive capabilities. For the broader SaaS market, it's another data point confirming that private equity sees consolidation as the path to building defensible, scaled businesses that can compete against entrenched players like Adobe. Watch for Everstone to announce additional acquisitions or partnerships as it works to cement this new platform's position at the center of enterprise digital transformation.",https://charming-card-d91ad3487b.media.strapiapp.com/file_c47186ef9a.png,N,,2026-01-20 11:11:47.803926

If the case reaches trial, it would become the first non-settlement lawsuit targeting pharma with the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) pathway, normally reserved for mobsters.
Takeda previously agreed to a roughly $2.4 billion settlement with patients allegedly harmed by the drug.
Takeda declined to comment on the active litigation, and Lilly did not respond to an inquiry by the time of publication.
“I feel like it will induce a more open honest conversation with FDA [so drug companies can’t] be accused of any sort of deception,” James said.","A potentially paradigm-changing lawsuit targeting Eli Lilly and Takeda Pharmaceuticals has cleared a major hurdle and could wind up being decided in a courtroom. If the case reaches trial, it would become the first non-settlement lawsuit targeting pharma with the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) pathway, normally reserved for mobsters.

Wisner Baum, which filed the case, is chasing damages as high as $7 billion, alleging that the companies conspired to hide evidence their diabetes drug Actos was linked to a higher risk of bladder cancer to maintain blockbuster profits.

Takeda previously agreed to a roughly $2.4 billion settlement with patients allegedly harmed by the drug. But the law firm is leveraging a financial angle to seek more.

The key allegation being levied by a Minnesota-based union health fund, along with consumers in four states, is that the companies concealed evidence of adverse health risks from the public and the FDA. After the cancer link came to light and the FDA slapped a warning label on Actos in 2011, sales dropped by as much as 80%. Thus, prescriptions received — and paid for — before the warning label was attached led the plaintiffs to pay for more doses than they would have otherwise, said Harrison James, a senior associate attorney at Wisner Baum.

Takeda declined to comment on the active litigation, and Lilly did not respond to an inquiry by the time of publication.

The lawsuit, originally filed in 2014, cleared a major hurdle in November when a federal appeals court allowed the nationwide class action against Takeda and Lilly to move forward. But there are other barriers to clear before it makes it to trial.

The companies recently asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case, which could halt the litigation. An answer is expected this spring, James said. If the Supreme Court declines to hear it, the companies could still attempt to convince a lower court to decertify the case by presenting additional evidence, he said. The case could get a trial date as early as next year. The companies could also decide to settle, but James thinks it’s unlikely.

A broader impact?

If this case goes to trial, the legal fallout could have industrywide implications.

Some experts believe that using the RICO statute substantially increases the risks to drugmakers. In this case, attorneys are seeking what are known as treble damages, allowed under RICO, which triple the amount of compensatory damages.

But while some predicted the case would fling open the floodgates to similar lawsuits against pharma, that hasn’t happened yet, and probably won’t, James said.

“It’s not easy to win under this statute,” he explained.

Part of what could help the plaintiffs succeed in the case is that the alleged fraud was well documented, James added. Among the evidence presented so far were internal company documents and testimony from a safety consultant who said the companies were aware of cancer-related safety signals but didn’t disclose the information publicly.

“It’s a pretty high burden to succeed here. The facts were very, very strong to meet all the elements that we needed,” James said. “It’s not every day that a case like that falls into your lap.”

Even though the outcome may not expose pharma to a high risk of similar lawsuits, James hopes the case will encourage drug companies to be more transparent about risks.

“I feel like it will induce a more open honest conversation with FDA [so drug companies can’t] be accused of any sort of deception,” James said.

In this case, the companies allegedly participated in systemic concealment of risk.

“In my opinion, using the RICO tool is another avenue for redress when you do have really severe fraud like this to deter this sort of conduct from continuing to take place,” James said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/RVZV-bxihYYaJYdavQ1cZOPu9uFOMRDqsfoGt0pGNBE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS90YWtlZGFfRmoxZjg5by5qcGc=.webp,N,,2026-01-20 10:03:14.415816

""Folate receptor alpha in ovarian cancer tissue and patient serum is associated with disease burden and treatment outcomes.""","INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 20, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to sofetabart mipitecan (LY4170156) for the treatment of adult patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have received prior bevacizumab and mirvetuximab soravtansine, if eligible. Sofetabart mipitecan is a novel folate receptor alpha (FRα) antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that uses proprietary linker technology and an exatecan payload.

Breakthrough Therapy designation aims to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s).

""Platinum-resistant ovarian cancer remains one of the most challenging settings in gynecologic oncology, with limited treatment options and poor outcomes for patients,"" said Bhavana Pothuri, M.D., professor of Obstetrics/Gynecology and Medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health and director of Clinical Trials Office at the Perlmutter Cancer Center. ""The Breakthrough Therapy designation and preliminary clinical data for sofetabart mipitecan across all levels of FRα expression are encouraging and point to its potential as a meaningful treatment option for patients.""

""We are pleased the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for sofetabart mipitecan, reflecting the significant unmet need in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and the promising initial results shown in our Phase 1 study,"" said Jacob Van Naarden, executive vice president, and president of Lilly Oncology and head of corporate business development. ""Building on compelling results generated to date, we've initiated our Phase 3 FRAmework-01 trial with the goal of bringing a potential therapeutic option to patients with advanced ovarian cancer, across all levels of folate receptor expression.""

The FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation is based on encouraging preliminary results from the Phase 1a/b study. Lilly presented initial Phase 1 results at the 2025 ASCO Annual Meeting in June and updated data at the 2025 ESMO Congress in October, showing responses at all dose levels and across all FRα expression levels, including in patients who progressed on prior mirvetuximab soravtansine. These initial data also indicate a promising tolerability profile with low rates of interstitial lung disease, peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia, and no significant ocular toxicity.

Sofetabart mipitecan recently advanced into the Phase 3 FRAmework-01 study (NCT07213804), a global trial investigating the treatment as a monotherapy in patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer (PROC), and in combination with bevacizumab in patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (PSOC). Lilly is conducting the FRAmework-01 study in partnership with the European Network for Gynaecological Oncological Trial groups (ENGOT - lead groups GINECO/NOGGO e.V.), the GOG Foundation (GOG), and the Asia-Pacific Gynecologic Oncology Trials Group (APGOT)

About Ovarian Cancer

Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. While most patients initially respond to platinum-based chemotherapy, approximately 70% will experience recurrence, leading to progressively shorter remission periods with each subsequent treatment. When cancer recurs during or within six months of platinum therapy, known as platinum-resistant disease, patients face limited treatment options.

About Sofetabart Mipitecan

Sofetabart mipitecan (LY4170156) is composed of an Fc-silent, folate receptor alpha (FRα) specific humanized monoclonal antibody linked to exatecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, via a proprietary cleavable polysarcosine linker (PSARlink™). Sofetabart mipitecan was designed to target FRα across all expression levels with improved therapeutic index. FRα is a cell-surface glycoprotein encoded by the gene FOLR1 that binds to the essential nutrients folic acid and reduced folates, bringing them into cells to facilitate cell division and growth.1,2 FRα is overexpressed in many solid tumors such as ovarian, non-small cell lung, and colorectal cancers.1,3,4 Sofetabart mipitecan is currently being studied in patients with ovarian cancer as well as other FRα-expressing solid tumors, NCT06400472 and NCT07213804.

Wilson, who still owns about 4.3% of the company's shares, began a proxy campaign in December to nominate three independent directors. Though he isn't seeking a seat himself, he's made it clear that any compromise would require the departure of two long-serving directors including chair David Mussafer, who represents Advent.

For Wilson, the push appears personal as well as strategic. Advent has been tied to Lululemon since its early days, but Wilson has reportedly grown frustrated with the firm's influence and what he views as an uneven record in consumer-focused investments.

A sensitive time for corporate conflicts. Elliott Management, which bought a $1 billion stake in Lululemon, is also courting former Ralph Lauren CEO Jane Nielsen for a leadership post. This has sparked expectations of top-level company changes.

Enterprise Advantage is based on Consulting Advantage, IBM’s internal AI-powered delivery platform, which in turn combines the company’s consulting expertise and workflows used to transform its internal operations.
Consulting Advantage also includes a marketplace that houses industry‑specific AI agents and applications, which has been rolled into Enterprise Advantage.
Caution for CIOs The flexibility offered by Enterprise Advantage could have its own set of tradeoffs for CIOs.
“If clients simply deploy Enterprise Advantage without building internal muscle, they’ll end up reliant on IBM’s platform for updates, extensions, and compliance maintenance.","IBM has launched a new consulting service named Enterprise Advantage, designed to help CIOs take their agentic and other AI applications from experimentation to large-scale production.

Enterprise Advantage is based on Consulting Advantage, IBM’s internal AI-powered delivery platform, which in turn combines the company’s consulting expertise and workflows used to transform its internal operations.

Consulting Advantage also includes a marketplace that houses industry‑specific AI agents and applications, which has been rolled into Enterprise Advantage.

Analysts say Enterprise Advantage could help enterprises more effectively build and scale agentic and other AI applications across complex, multi-cloud environments because the service is designed to operate independently of specific cloud providers, AI models, or underlying infrastructure.

This approach aligns with the fragmented and heterogeneous IT landscapes most large enterprises already run, as they need to be able to scale AI applications within the constraints of their current IT estates without having to rip and replace any layer or infrastructure, Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst at Greyhound Research.

Echoing Gogia’s views, Pareekh Jain, principal analyst at Pareekh Consulting, pointed out that large enterprises already have sunk costs in multiple clouds and multiple model choices.

In fact, Jain sees the new service helping enterprises reduce hyperscaler lock-in and offering more flexibility of choice when it comes to choosing a specific cloud vendor or their AI stack for building an agentic or AI application.

Caution for CIOs

The flexibility offered by Enterprise Advantage could have its own set of tradeoffs for CIOs.

While Enterprise Advantage’s cloud‑agnostic pitch does help enterprises avoid getting locked into hyperscaler‑specific agent platforms like AWS Bedrock Agents or Microsoft Copilot Studio, the dependency might shift to the orchestration layer, Jain pointed out.

“If companies build their agent workflows, governance rules, and orchestration logic entirely on IBM’s Enterprise Advantage framework, migrating to another provider later could become just as difficult,” Jain added.

Rather, CIOs should internally evaluate whether their enterprise has the talent and expertise to operate the frameworks and workflows that Enterprise Advantage provides because that’s the only way that they can avoid lock-in at the orchestration and service level, Gogia said.

“If clients simply deploy Enterprise Advantage without building internal muscle, they’ll end up reliant on IBM’s platform for updates, extensions, and compliance maintenance. This could replicate the same old outsourcing trap we’ve seen before,” Gogia added.

In fact, Jain pointed out that enterprises with at least some level of AI maturity should look at adopting the new service.

While firms with very limited AI talent may find a framework-led approach too complex and instead prefer fully managed SaaS solutions, highly tech-native companies tend to build their own orchestration layers to avoid service dependency and retain control, the analyst said.

Ecolab Financial Analysis

Key Takeaways

Ecolab (ECL, Financial) has partnered with CDP to launch the Water Use Efficiency Index, enhancing corporate water usage evaluation.

The company maintains a strong market position in the chemicals industry with a market cap of $78.48 billion.

Financial metrics indicate robust profitability and growth, with a focus on expanding operating margins.

Strategic Alliance and Company Overview

Ecolab (ECL) has entered into a strategic alliance with CDP to introduce the Water Use Efficiency Index. This new benchmark aims to assist companies in evaluating, comparing, and enhancing their water usage performance. By utilizing this index, organizations can gain insights into operational efficiencies and undertake informed measures to improve their environmental impact.

Ecolab Inc. is a global leader in the production and marketing of cleaning and sanitation products for various sectors, including industrial manufacturing, hospitality, healthcare, and life sciences. The company offers a comprehensive range of products and services, such as dish and laundry washing systems, pest control, and infection control products. Ecolab also provides customized water management solutions, reinforcing its stronghold in the U.S. market while expanding internationally.

With a market capitalization of $78.48 billion, Ecolab operates within the Basic Materials sector, specifically in the Chemicals industry. The company's strategic initiatives and robust product offerings position it as a dominant player in its field.

Financial Health Analysis

Ecolab's financial performance reflects its strong market position and operational efficiency. The company reported a revenue of $15.89 billion, with a 3-year revenue growth rate of 7.6%. This growth is supported by a 17.57% operating margin and a 12.49% net margin, indicating effective cost management and profitability.

On the balance sheet front, Ecolab maintains a current ratio of 1.7 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.91, reflecting a stable financial structure. The company's return on equity stands at 21.94%, showcasing its ability to generate returns on shareholder investments.

However, there are warning signs to consider. The Altman Z-Score of 5.25 indicates strong financial health, but insider activity shows mixed signals with recent insider selling.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

Ecolab's valuation metrics suggest a premium market position. The company's P/E ratio is 39.81, while the P/S ratio is 4.98, both near historical highs. The P/B ratio of 8.07 also reflects a valuation close to its 3-year high.

Analyst sentiment remains positive, with a target price of $295.13 and a recommendation score of 2.2, indicating a ""Buy"" consensus. Technical indicators such as the RSI of 66.04 suggest the stock is approaching overbought territory.

Institutional ownership is robust at 80.66%, indicating strong confidence from large investors, while insider ownership is relatively low at 1.18%.

Risk Assessment

Ecolab's financial health is supported by a high Piotroski F-Score of 7, indicating a very healthy situation. The Beneish M-Score of -2.51 suggests the company is unlikely to be a manipulator.

Sector-specific risks include potential volatility in raw material prices and regulatory changes impacting the chemicals industry. The company's beta of 1.02 indicates moderate market volatility.

While Ecolab's strategic initiatives and financial metrics are strong, investors should remain vigilant of market conditions and sector-specific risks that could impact future performance.

why don’t i just take a day off?

it’s probably the mix between the love of tapping keys & hijacking minds...

and potential of helping young guys find value they need.

it’s a mix of both.

...which brings me to this...

obsession...

what is obsession...?

sure. everything could go right for you.

why wouldn’t it?

all you do is work/train/study

so, why do you still break promises to yourself?

because you don’t entirely believe it will work out.

you want to be rich, but you don’t believe you can.

honestly, you really don’t.

if you did, nothing could stop you from becoming that.

the mirror only smiles, when you do.

i smile. because i want to.

i really do.

that’s why i wake up with a grin on my face.

because i know it means i get to work on things i take deep interest in.

another day of being the best at everything i do.

& i love it.

thoroughly enjoying every second of the delusional belief that I’m better than my competition.

that’s what i wake up for.

never taking a day off...

there is still so much to get done.

the thought of not having a fully specced out mercedes, a plethora of divine females & a body of a greek god...

brings a spike of anxiety and stress...

yet... most guys won’t achieve it... until 65.

that is... if there are not dead yet.

hellish.

so, what am I so anxious about?

it doesn’t mean i won’t fail.

if i put brakes on. take a slow & steady approach.

they’ll be plenty of mfers who would love to take my spot.

business is a never ending game.

and the number of guys who want to compete with me... only grows.

but, i don’t understand it anymore...

who can compete with someone who treats life as art. obsessed with how every brush stroke brings something new to life...

i simply don’t think you can.

& this is still the reality...

you plant a seed...

the fruit doesn’t flourish overnight.

it only happens after you water it enough, consistently, for a long enough time.

for me, I have to be wired deeply every waking hour.

because I know there is a bunch of hungry pussyboys ready to rise above me...

success might float into the wrong hands. enough said.

listen to this...

if you are anything like me... hellbent to making this work, otherwise what’s the point?

then realistically... what could go wrong?

let me rephrase that...

what could go right?

everything you put in enough effort & time starts working out.

what can you gain?

financial & time freedom, peace beyond understanding, power.

why not you?

you’re a compulsively obsessed artist wired to make it work...

i mean, i don’t see why it can’t be you.

what is the best possible outcome?

i’ll leave this one to you.

but delusion & obsession in itself ain’t enough.

you have to back it up with hard work and consistency.

that’s all it takes...

if you do, your life with chance in the best possible way.

you can have everything you want, and more.

by being obsessed with what you love doing...

you’re totally in. or not.

if you don’t find your fun in being the best at everything possible.

then I guess you’re just not meant for it.

it all comes down to you.

her uber pulled up. tinted black tesla. she is wearing a dark red little sexy dress & black kitten heels. there is something artistic about it...

that’s what I will leave you with...

take it as you will.

stay schizo.

p.s you take 100 men. 1 of them is destined for success.

if you follow the right rulesets. certain principles. mindset shifts. business lessons. delusionally obsessed with progress & winning.

Revenue model

Chief executive Sam Altman, who in the past called adverts a “last resort”, said he was “hopeful a business model like this can work”.

The adverts are to appear in a banner-like form at the bottom of the chatbot’s responses, and will be clearly labelled.

The ads are to be related to a user’s prompt, for instance showing an ad about holidays after a query about the topic.

The start-up said it would learn from feedback and refine its ad strategy over time, while allowing users to learn more about why they’re seeing a specific ad, dismiss ads, and submit feedback.

OpenAI currently relies on continuous rounds of private investment to fund its operations, with the Financial Times reporting that it operated at a loss of about $8 billion (£5.98bn) in the first six months of 2025.",https://www.silicon.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/OpenAI-logo-displayed-on-a-smartphone.-Image-credit-Unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:12:06.556429

After a long weekend for US investors, attention is back on tariffs, with US President Donald Trump threatening European allies with 10% levies over their refusal to support his desire to take over Greenland.

Trump’s threats, and the possibility of European nations having to retaliate, rattled markets on the other side of the Atlantic Monday. “Higher tariffs from the US and Europe are a destructive way forward,” says Robert Bergqvist, Senior Economist at SEB.

The Greenland dispute adds to the geopolitical noise investors are having to navigate at the start of 2026. At the same time, investors are still waiting for the Supreme Court to weigh in on whether Trump’s use of tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act is legal.

“The new tariffs presumably would rely on IEEPA authority, which is what the Supreme Court is reviewing,” says Preston Caldwell, Morningstar’s senior US economist. “If the Supreme Court strikes down IEEPA tariffs, the Trump administration will have to rely on statutory authority, which historically has entailed lengthy process and paperwork. Hence, it would become likely much harder to slap countrywide tariffs on and off for arbitrary reasons.”

Speaking of the Supreme Court, Wednesday will bring oral arguments over whether Trump can remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from the central bank. This at a time when investors have grown increasingly wary about Trump’s efforts to influence monetary policy and erode the Fed’s independence.

Big Bank Bumps

Fourth-quarter earnings season is now in full swing, and as investors await earnings from Big Tech in coming weeks, big banks have been in the spotlight. It was a bumpy start, as JPMorgan JPM and BankAmerica BAC stocks took a hit, while Citigroup C shares seesawed.

But it wasn’t necessarily earnings news that was driving the market. Again, it was news out of the White House as Trump proposed a 10% cap on credit card interest rates. As we wrote last week, bank executives and analysts panned the idea, saying it would limit credit availability to lower quality borrowers and hurt profits. As for the key takeaways from the actual earnings reports, the outlook looks pretty decent according to Sean Dunlop, a director at Morningstar who follows the big banks.

Here’s what Dunlop has to say:

2026 is setting up to be another solid year for banks if the current backdrop holds. Asset prices remain high. Interest rates are set to decline modestly, with Morningstar senior US economist Preston Caldwell forecasting two rate cuts in his December outlook, in line with CME estimates. And we expect still-solid 4.4% nominal gross domestic product growth … which in conjunction with a labor market that is weaker (but not dramatically so) looks like a decent setup for banks.

Consumer health looks solid. Credit and debit card spending was up 6%-7% in nominal terms basically across the board for the banks, and consumer health, proxied by charge-offs, was very strong. Barring significant deterioration in the labor market, we’re looking at an environment where sentiment and spending continue to diverge sharply.

Things might really be better at Citi. The bank reported sharply stronger results across segments, with particular improvement in wealth management and the retail bank, but every segment saw returns improve by more than 2.5 percentage points.

Key Earnings This Week

For many investors, the big earnings news is still a week off, when the likes of Microsoft MSFT, Tesla TSLA, and Apple AAPL report. In the meantime, the focus will be on regional banks and other key names.

Regional Banks: Throughout the week, regional banks will report. That includes Zions ZION and US Bancorp USB reporting Tuesday, and Truist TFC on Wednesday. Morningstar equity analyst Maoyuan Chen has this to say about what she will be watching:

Consumer health looks solid. The money center banks that have already reported have shown credit and debit card spending up 6%-7% in nominal terms across the board. Credit costs were mostly stable.

Regional banks’ net interest income will face some headwinds in 2026 from two or three rate cuts from the Fed. How much growth the regional banks can achieve will depend on balance sheet growth. We currently forecast around 3%-4% growth, but we could see bank lending growing faster from more commercial real estate loan growth (a headwind in the past three years) or higher commercial lending growth from a pickup in middle-market M&A deal activity.

2025 was a busy year for bank acquisitions, including deal announcements from PNC-FirstBank, Fifth Third-Comerica, Huntington-Cadence, and Huntington-Veritex. We will be watching out for execution updates on these deals and other regional banks’ appetite for inorganic opportunities.

Airlines: United Airlines UAL reports Wednesday. “With Delta having already reported and showing some softness among the leisure market in the fourth quarter, I’ll be watching how that played out for the other airlines and certainly listening for how their bookings are stacking up so far this year,” says Nicolas Owens, equity analyst at Morningstar. “The industry has returned to a low single-digit growth mode after several big rebound years postpandemic.”

GE Aerospace: Thursday will bring fourth-quarter earnings from GE Aerospace GE, which is up some 77% over the past year, thanks to a rally that began in the spring of 2025. For Owens, “the biggest question is just how their supply chain is holding up, as they have so much demand to meet from Airbus for new engines and from existing engine operators for parts.”

Stock Market Rotation or Another Head Fake?

As we alluded to earlier this month, stock market strategists have predicted 10 of the last two rotations out of tech stocks. Will those forecasts be wrong yet again? So far, 2026 has started off in rotation mode for stocks. It’s visible at the sector level, with tech stocks performing the worst while basic materials are out in front. The rotation can also be seen on a market capitalization basis, as small caps have jumped ahead of large caps.

The firm expressed confidence in Eli Lilly’s growing leadership in the obesity treatment market, projecting strength into 2026 and beyond.
These developments indicate Eli Lilly’s active engagement in strategic growth and competitive positioning within the pharmaceutical sector.","Investing.com - Morgan Stanley has reiterated an Overweight rating and $1,290.00 price target on ahead of upcoming REDEFINE-4 Phase 3 obesity trial data. The pharmaceutical giant, currently trading at $1,038.40 with a market cap of nearly $930 billion, has delivered impressive 44% returns over the past year and maintains a PEG ratio of just 0.42, indicating attractive valuation relative to growth.

The REDEFINE-4 trial is a head-to-head comparison of ’s CagriSema versus Eli Lilly’s Zepbound in obese patients without diabetes. The 84-week trial features a flexible dosing design allowing physicians to adjust dosage based on tolerability and weight loss outcomes.

Morgan Stanley outlines three potential scenarios from the trial results. In their base case, CagriSema shows similar efficacy and tolerability to Zepbound, which would likely have limited impact on Eli Lilly shares. According to InvestingPro data, analysts maintain a bullish consensus on LLY with a rating of 1.7 (where 1 is Strong Buy), with targets ranging from $770 to $1,500.

A bull case for Novo Nordisk would involve CagriSema demonstrating statistical superiority with similar tolerability, potentially causing a low-to-mid single-digit percentage decline in Eli Lilly shares. However, Morgan Stanley notes mitigating factors including Eli Lilly’s broad diabesity portfolio with next-generation options Eloralintide and Retatrutide, and potential supply chain limitations for CagriSema.

A bull case for Eli Lilly would emerge if CagriSema shows inferior efficacy or worse tolerability compared to Zepbound, which could drive Eli Lilly shares up by a low single-digit percentage.

In other recent news, Eli Lilly’s earnings and revenue results have not been highlighted, but the company is making significant moves in the industry. Eli Lilly is reportedly preparing a €15 billion offer to acquire French biotech company , although a formal offer has yet to be submitted to Abivax’s board. This potential acquisition could bolster Eli Lilly’s portfolio. Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has delayed its decision on Eli Lilly’s weight-loss pill until April 10, pushing back from the expected late-March timeline. This drug was part of the FDA’s fast-track review program, intended for drugs critical to public health or national security.

In terms of analyst activity, BMO Capital has reiterated its Outperform rating on Eli Lilly, maintaining a price target of $1,200. The firm expressed confidence in Eli Lilly’s growing leadership in the obesity treatment market, projecting strength into 2026 and beyond. Additionally, ’s CEO has commented on the competitive landscape, suggesting that Biogen’s new at-home Alzheimer’s drug could provide an edge over Eli Lilly’s Kisunla. Despite Kisunla’s significant market share, Biogen is positioning its at-home injection as a key differentiator. These developments indicate Eli Lilly’s active engagement in strategic growth and competitive positioning within the pharmaceutical sector.

10 stocks we like better than Walmart ›

Economists aren't sure what will happen with the U.S. and global economies. Certain prognosticators see a weakening domestic labor market as an indicator that economic growth will slow, and forecast a recession will soon be upon us.

However, even if it doesn't occur in 2026, at some point, the U.S. will enter a recession. That will undoubtedly hurt stock prices.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

But not all companies, and hence stock prices, will be affected the same way during a slowdown. While many retailers' sales have already been hurt by consumers stressed by higher prices and an uncertain job market, how will venerable retailer Walmart (NASDAQ: WMT) fare?

Understanding the business

Walmart consists of its namesake stores around the world and a membership warehouse club, Sam's Club. The U.S. Walmart business makes up most of the company's revenue.

Opening its first retail store in the early 1960s, Walmart has mastered the art of charging low prices to customers. In fact, shoppers would be hard-pressed to find lower prices. Walmart does this by keeping an extremely tight rein on costs.

It also makes technology investments to keep up with competitors, including behemoth online retailer Amazon. These tend to focus on making shopping at Walmart more convenient, such as same-day pickup and delivery. Most of this year's capital expenditures went toward supply chain, customer-facing initiatives, and other technology.

Management's focus on low prices and convenience continues to resonate with customers. The Walmart U.S. division's fiscal third-quarter same-store sales (comps) increased 4.5%. Higher traffic contributed 1.8 percentage points, and increased spending accounted for the balance. The period ended on Oct. 31, 2025.

Management stated that it drew higher-income consumers during the quarter. This also happened during the Great Recession as the wealthier demographic sought bargains. I believe Walmart's low prices will continue to drive shoppers during the next economic downturn.

Rich valuation

Shareholders have done well by investing in Walmart's stock. The shares gained 31.2% over the past year through Jan. 14, outpacing the S&P 500 index's 19%.

The company's past success has created high expectations for future growth. Walmart's stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 42, compared to 37 a year ago. It also sells at a richer valuation than the overall market, with the S&P 500 trading at a P/E multiple of 31.

However, given the company's success, ability to succeed in all kinds of economic environments, including recessions, and its investment to keep it ahead of the competition, I believe a higher multiple is warranted.

That's why I'd be willing to pay up for Walmart's shares.

Its requirements are forcing a reckoning with enterprise architecture that supply chain leaders can no longer ignore.

Moving past the hype cycle, agentic AI is entering widespread adoption. According to the 2025 Gartner “Market Guide for PLM Software in Discrete Manufacturing Industries,” this year, more than 80% of PLM vendors will incorporate AI capabilities into their platforms, compared with less than 40% in 2025. Here’s what that stat doesn’t capture: agentic AI doesn’t just add features to existing systems. It fundamentally changes what software delivers.

Why standalone systems can't compete

Consider a typical scenario facing supply chain executives today. A critical component supplier announces a 30% tariff-driven price increase. Someone manually pulls procurement data, cross-references engineering specs in PLM, checks ERP inventory, reviews CRM customer commitments, and attempts to reconcile everything in spreadsheets. Days turn to weeks. Margins erode while leadership has to wait to see the complete picture.

No amount of better workflows or skilled analysts solves this. It's an architecture problem. Standalone systems rarely communicate in real time. They create data islands requiring human intermediaries to bridge gaps. Implementing Agentic AI exposes this limitation with brutal clarity.

Unlike generative AI that responds to prompts, agentic AI can take autonomous action within defined parameters. An agent optimizing supply chain decisions needs simultaneous access to engineering data, quality records, supplier performance, customer commitments, and financial constraints. If that data lives in five disconnected systems, the agent’s ability to function is compromised. It's like hiring an expert operations manager but only allowing them to look at one system per day.

The connected intelligence requirement

This coming generation of AI agents won't live inside individual applications. They'll coordinate across entire ecosystems, turning fragmented processes into intelligent networks. Software platforms extending data across enterprises will dominate while isolated tools fade.

Consider predictive inventory management. An effective agent, or group of agents across apps analyze demand patterns, component availability, supplier lead times, quality results, and customer forecasts. When shortages appear, it triggers procurement workflows, alerts production planning, notifies affected customers, and recommends alternative sourcing.

This orchestration requires connected data and integrated workflows across the supply chain and tech stack which standalone software can’t deliver. Manufacturers with integrated data significantly reduce development cycles because agents access comprehensive, connected data rather than siloed information. When systems no longer operate in isolation, time-to-market improvements scale with agents automatically cross-referencing engineering changes with supplier capacity, regulatory requirements, production schedules, and customer delivery commitments.

The infrastructure mistake executives make

However, this connected intelligence creates a dangerous misconception. Some executives see AI agents performing sophisticated analysis and assume the agents themselves are the solution, that powerful AI can simply work around fragmented systems. If the agent is smart enough, why invest in expensive platform integration?

Here's why that thinking fails.

Having implemented legacy systems for manufacturers during my Accenture years, I've seen what happens when companies chase technology without infrastructure foundations. Agents without structured systems are like a Formula 1 car with no track to race on. The car is impressive, but without guardrails, you're headed for disaster.

The platform provides those guardrails, enforcing the business rules, compliance requirements, and process controls that agents need to operate safely. This is especially critical in supply chain operations where regulatory compliance and audit trails aren't optional. Consider a manufacturer with a decade of supplier quality inspection records. An agent analyzing historical data might notice a compliance field completed less than 50% of the time without business impact. Based on this pattern, the agent determines the field is unimportant and stops prompting for completion.

But what if that field is an FDA reporting requirement that hasn't been audited yet? The moment inspection occurs, missing data becomes a compliance violation shutting down your entire supply chain. A proper platform enforces which fields are mandatory for agents, regardless of historical patterns. The agent becomes incredibly effective once it understands which processes are non-negotiable.

The governance reality

Can your current systems automatically control which AI agents access proprietary supplier agreements or customer pricing? If not, you're not ready for agentic AI at scale. Just as companies have focused on user access, least privilege and protecting confidential and PII data for their employees, the same regimen needs to be applied for agents.

Enterprise platforms provide the governance structure agents desperately need. Without it, you face two bad options: you can't enforce permissions at all, or you spend enormous effort manually recreating permissions in AI models. When permissions inevitably change, agents access data they shouldn't, or make decisions based on outdated rules.

When an auditor asks for the decision trail on a supplier change that impacted customer deliveries, you need more than ""the AI agent handled it."" You need documented processes, approval workflows, and clear accountability. This is what robust platforms deliver, and it's non-negotiable in supply chain operations.

Real business value emerges when supply chain data flows seamlessly across PLM, ERP, procurement, and logistics through a unified backbone. Agents can then conduct the predictive analysis and autonomous coordination that supply chain executives expect, identifying which products tariffs affect before margins erode, determining which parts need alternate sourcing before shortages hit, and adjusting production schedules when supplier capacity shifts.

The partnership imperative

Successful agentic AI demands a partnership between intelligence and infrastructure. Agents, guided by humans, provide the decision-making layer; enterprise platforms provide the operational foundation. Neither works effectively without the other in supply chain environments where speed, accuracy, and compliance determine success.

The manufacturers and supply chain organizations that recognize this interdependence now will build sustainable competitive advantages. Those that chase AI without addressing their fragmented system architecture will watch competitors pull ahead while they manage unreliable automation built on unstable foundations.

Longevity is no longer just a buzzword in 2025: it’s the beauty industry’s most radical shift in branding. The era of conventional anti-ageing fixes has given way to a new generation of consumers seeking precision skincare powered by biotechnology and wellness science. From AI-driven personalisation to next-generation delivery systems, these are the breakthroughs shaping a new wave of skin-longevity products.

When Estée Lauder shared its latest skin-longevity science at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) last year, the focus wasn’t only on showcasing a single product launch, amazing as the Platinum 6D Black Diamond Eye Cream was. The company was signalling a new era in science-backed rejuvenation – and in this case, the science was in sirtuin age-reversal technology.

The company spent more than 15 years researching sirtuin proteins, the skin’s essential longevity regulators that activate key restorative pathways to delay and even reverse visible signs of ageing in as little as 14 days. Since 2023, the brand has supported a multi-year programme with the Stanford Center on Longevity, using cross-disciplinary research on aesthetics, vitality and ageing to inform its broader skin-longevity platform. In Asia, it’s also rolled out education initiatives to familiarise consumers with the science of skin longevity.

This age-reversal technology now anchors Estée Lauder’s prestigious Re-Nutriv collection, infused with the brand’s patented SIRTIVITY-LP complex. Featured in hero products such as the Ultimate Diamond Transformative Brilliance Soft Crème and the Ultimate Diamond Age Reversal Eye Crème, SIRTIVITY-LP targets a novel longevity pathway through NF-κB inhibition, curbing the cellular cascade of oxidative stress, protein degradation and damage that leads to loss of elasticity and firmness. The result: skin that not only appears revitalised but operates with the resilience of youth.

L’Oréal, too, is staking a bold claim on the skin-longevity frontier. At last year’s Viva Technology conference in Paris, the group presented its latest breakthroughs as part of a new Longevity Integrative Science blueprint, positioning itself less as a cosmetics house and more as a beauty-tech powerhouse that’s now strongly invested in how skin behaves over time.

Moving away from corrective anti-ageing care to proactive longevity care is part of L’Oréal’s master framework. At Viva Technology, L’Oréal debuted its Wheel of Longevity, which decodes skin biological ageing, identifies nine interconnected hallmarks of ageing and, using its proprietary Longevity AI Cloud, translates the data into actionable care.

L’Oréal’s biggest breakthrough is probably in the Cell BioPrint, a “lab-on-a-chip” device that was created with NanoEntek, using microfluidics and proteomics to read skin biomarkers from a simple tape strip to calculate biological skin age, inflammation, skin moisture levels and sensitivity to actives such as retinol in five minutes. Marketed under its luxury brand Lancôme, the device can effectively bring longevity analytics to the beauty counter and offer consumers essential information about their own skin needs.

Beyond the store, Lancôme’s Rénergie Nano-ResurfacER 400 Booster is billed as the next generation tech-powered device developed for at-home use. The device, which is powered by patented nanochip technology, is designed to boost topical penetration into the stratum corneum, the skin’s outermost layer, amplifying the Rénergie H.C.F. Triple Serum’s performance to its fullest. It’s a tool inspired by micro- needling, but designed to be perfectly safe Shiseido’s Future Solution FX line for at-home use with no pain and no down-time at all.

Shiseido’s use of its LonGenevity Complex and the Enmei Herb in its Future Solution LX line is irrefutable proof that the group also belongs in the skin-longevity conversation. LonGenevity Complex is Shiseido’s core technology, and is an exclusive blend of four key elements including the Enmei Herb, vitamin C, green tea and Skingenecell 1P, a proprietary amino- acid derivative. Shiseido had spent decades studying the Enmei Herb, found only on sacred mountains, such as Japan’s mounts Ibuki and Koya, and has historically been linked with longevity and healing. The resulting complex enables skin to be optimised at any age by reinforcing its barrier function, improving brightness, plumpness and smoothness so that skin behaves more like younger skin over time.

Moreover, Shiseido’s broader research and development emphasises health-span science, resulting in the Beauty Alive Circulation Check to uncover our true skin health. Without contacting the skin, the device uses dual cameras to analyse both its surface and the micro-circulation underneath, capturing RGB images and thermal data to evaluate the overall balance of radiance, resilience and smoothness. For its innovation and inclusivity, the device won Shiseido the CES Innovation Award last year.

Taking inspiration from fitness trackers, AmorePacific is claiming its place in the realm of skin longevity with Skinsight, which tracks the micro-shifts in the skin’s health, anticipating problems before they even surface. Co-developed with researchers at MIT, the sensor patch can detect micrometre-level changes in skin tightness, while also measuring UV and blue-light exposure, temperature and moisture, turning skin science into a live data field instead of a static snapshot. The data is then fed and analysed by an AI engine, with the results readily accessible through an AI-powered mobile app. In an era when skincare routines are increasingly becoming personalised, this innovation is truly game-changing – which is why it’s winning an Innovation Award at the forthcoming CES 2026. And while the technology hasn’t yet arrived on the market, it’s being utilised internally, with the research already being used to substantiate the efficacy of Amorepacific’s luxury-brand products, including Sulwhasoo’s signature First Care Activating Serum.

La Prairie has talked about cellular rejuvenation long before skin longevity was a thing. The Swiss brand isn’t just into longevity, but haute longevity science. In recent years, La Prairie and Clinique La Prairie have effectively built a closed ecosystem in which the clinic develops medical-rate lifespan science, while the skincare house translates its research into products such as the new Life Matrix collection, tying daily skincare back to the brand’s original cellular-therapy heritage on Lake Geneva.

Powered by the Exclusive Matrix Complex, the Life Matrix Haute Rejuvenation Cream nurtures skin longevity from the core, working on four levels of the Skin Longevity Matrix to amplify youth, balance optimisation, make the skin resilient and improve the skin’s appearance. La Prairie’s scientists were able to identify more than 18,000 biomolecules in young and aged epidermal cells and successfully reset 394 of them with its Exclusive Matrix Complex, restoring them to a younger state and proving the cream’s potency. Science has never been more fascinating – and in the hands of the world’s leading beauty titans, it’s rapidly rewriting what skin longevity looks like, one breakthrough bottle and biometric at a time.",https://images.prestigeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2026/01/08155652/forever-young.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:11:51.836627

Markets are now looking for clues as to whether the ~50% rally in the USB stock price off April’s low will be supported by operational performance, rather than multiple expansion.

Trading at $54.50 leading in to the print, USB is positioned at a pivotal level, with a potential breakout above resistance, or a breakdown to support on the cards.

Wall Street consensus for the print sits at $1.12 EPS and $7.18B revenue, representing 8.7% and 5.1% year-over-year growth respectively. The setup creates asymmetric risk: the stock now trades at 12.5x earnings, a full valuation that leaves little room for disappointment on either reported results or forward guidance.

The quarter also marks the first reporting period following USB’s completion of the BTIG acquisition, adding capital markets capabilities but introducing integration risk that the market has viewed skeptically. With estimates revised upward by $0.01 over the past 30 days and four analysts raising projections in the past week, the Street is incrementally believing the improved run-rate signaled by third-quarter results. The question is whether management can articulate a path to sustaining earnings growth in 2026 that supports current valuation levels.

What the result will determine is whether USB’s transition from defensive cost-cutting to growth-oriented strategy can deliver on elevated expectations. The bank’s third-quarter beat, driven by record net revenue of $7.33B and EPS of $1.22, established a higher baseline. Fourth-quarter execution at or slightly above consensus may not be sufficient if guidance or commentary suggests the third-quarter strength represented peak performance rather than a sustainable trajectory.

Consensus EPS of $1.12 sits at the midpoint of the $1.09 to $1.16 range, with estimate momentum turning positive over the past 30 days. Eight analysts raised projections in the past month, contributing to a $0.01 upward revision. Revenue expectations of $7.18B imply sequential deceleration from third-quarter’s $7.33B record, though year-over-year growth of 5.1% would still exceed the company’s full-year guidance midpoint of 4%. The estimate distribution suggests the Street is modeling modest sequential pullback from third-quarter strength rather than sustained acceleration.

The gap between consensus and management’s full-year revenue growth target of 3–5% is narrowing. Fourth-quarter revenue at $7.18B would imply full-year growth near the upper end of guidance, assuming prior quarters’ results hold. The key risk is whether management reaffirms or tightens this range for 2026, as any signal of deceleration below 4% growth could pressure the stock despite a fourth-quarter beat.

Management Guidance and Commentary

“We are focused on delivering sustainable revenue growth of 3 to 5 percent annually while maintaining our commitment to operating leverage and efficiency improvements.”

Management’s full-year revenue growth target of 3–5%, reiterated through the first three quarters of 2025, established a framework that consensus has consistently tested. The midpoint of 4% annual growth implies quarterly revenue in the $7.0B to $7.3B range, depending on seasonality. Fourth-quarter consensus of $7.18B sits comfortably within this band, but the market is now looking for confirmation that 2026 can sustain similar growth without relying on one-time tailwinds.

The third-quarter commentary highlighted fee revenue growth and positive operating leverage as core drivers, with management emphasizing the durability of the payments, wealth, and capital markets businesses. The BTIG acquisition, completed in late 2025, was framed as a strategic addition to fee-generating capabilities rather than a transformative deal. Investor skepticism around the acquisition centers on whether integration costs will offset near-term earnings accretion and whether the capital deployed could have generated higher returns through buybacks.

The gap between guidance and consensus is minimal on revenue but undefined on EPS, as management has not provided quarterly EPS targets. The Street’s $1.12 EPS estimate implies margin expansion and operating leverage, which aligns with management’s stated priorities. The risk is that deposit pricing pressures or BTIG integration costs compress margins, causing EPS to undershoot even if revenue meets expectations. Management’s tone on net interest margin trajectory and expense run-rate will be as important as the reported numbers.

Analyst Price Targets & Ratings

Wall Street maintains a constructive view with 82% of analysts rating shares a Buy or Strong Buy. The consensus target of $60.80 implies 11.6% upside from current levels, though this reflects the stock’s recent rally compressing the upside potential. The absence of any Sell ratings suggests analysts view the current valuation as supportable, though the concentration in Hold ratings indicates some caution about near-term momentum.

Sector & Peer Comparison

U.S. Bancorp trades at 12.5x trailing earnings and 11.1x forward earnings, positioning it near the middle of its regional bank peer group. The forward multiple sits between PNC Financial’s 11.8x and Truist’s 10.7x, suggesting the market is pricing USB at a modest premium to lower-quality peers but below PNC’s valuation. The 27.6% profit margin leads most regional peers and trails only Fifth Third’s 28.4%, reflecting USB’s historical focus on operational efficiency.

Earnings Track Record

U.S. Bancorp has beaten EPS estimates in 14 of the past 15 quarters, establishing a 93.3% beat rate with an average surprise of 3.4%. The third-quarter 2025 result represented the strongest upside in the period, with a 9.9% beat driven by record revenue and margin expansion. The pattern shows consistent execution on profitability even when top-line results have occasionally disappointed the Street, as in second-quarter 2025 when revenue came in below expectations despite an EPS beat.

Post-Earnings Price Movement History

Historical post-earnings price movement shows an average next-day decline of 0.6%, with the same negative average on beats. The pattern reveals that EPS beats alone have not been sufficient to drive positive reactions, particularly when revenue or guidance disappoints. Third-quarter 2025’s 9.9% EPS beat was followed by a 2.3% stock decline, likely due to concerns about sustainability of the record revenue print or lack of explicit upward guidance revision.

Expected Move & Implied Volatility

The options market is pricing an expected move of approximately 3.2%, or a range of $52.76 to $56.24, based on at-the-money straddle pricing. Implied volatility of roughly 22% sits modestly above 30-day historical volatility of 19%, suggesting the market sees slightly elevated uncertainty around the event but not extreme risk. The implied move aligns with USB’s historical average absolute post-earnings move, indicating options traders are not pricing for a major surprise in either direction.

Expert Predictions & What to Watch

Key Outlook: Guidance Will Drive the Trade

The fourth-quarter setup presents balanced risk. On one hand, USB’s consistent beat record and positive estimate revisions suggest the company is likely to exceed $1.12 EPS. On the other, the stock’s valuation expansion means the bar for a positive reaction is higher than the bar for simply beating estimates. The market is no longer rewarding small beats without forward confirmation of earnings power, as evidenced by the third-quarter result where a 9.9% EPS beat still produced a 2.3% stock decline.

Key Metrics to Watch

The five metrics above represent the critical data points that will determine whether USB can sustain its valuation premium. Net interest margin and fee income are the primary drivers of top-line performance, while credit provisions signal asset quality trends. BTIG integration progress addresses the market’s skepticism around capital allocation, and 2026 guidance provides the forward visibility necessary to support a 12.5x earnings multiple.

Investors should focus on the interplay between these metrics rather than any single number. A scenario where NIM expands but fee income disappoints would raise questions about business mix quality. Similarly, strong reported results paired with cautious 2026 guidance would likely produce a negative reaction despite a fourth-quarter beat. The market is demanding both execution and confidence in forward trajectory.",https://www.asktraders.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Depositphotos_69820815_s-2019.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 08:59:56.335458

Recent data highlights the urgency of this shift. According to research from the Interactive Advertising Bureau, attribution accuracy has plummeted by approximately 40% since the introduction of Apple’s iOS 14.5 update, with roughly 75% of users opting out of tracking.

This ‘measurement gap’ is not merely a technical glitch; it represents a fundamental breakdown in the performance-heavy media models that have dominated corporate strategy. As Google prepares for the eventual deprecation of third-party cookies, the mechanisms that once powered digital advertising are vanishing.

Building sustainable brand equity

For many years, brand building was dismissed on quarterly earnings calls as ‘unmeasurable’ or ‘old-fashioned,’ in favour of the immediate gratification of cost-per-acquisition (CPA) metrics. Yet, evidence is mounting that branding is the only sustainable path forward in a privacy-first world.

A longitudinal study of e-commerce brands found that companies that maintained a balanced approach, investing in both brand and performance, achieved a 23% higher customer lifetime value (CLV) than those focused solely on short-term activation.

While performance marketing is effective at harvesting existing demand, brand marketing creates the demand in the first place. Without the latter, the addressable market shrinks, and the cost of ""harvesting"" through performance channels becomes unsustainably expensive.

The 60:40 rule

The question for the modern executive is no longer if they should invest in brand, but how much. Influential analysis of the IPA Databank suggests a ‘60:40’ rule: 60% of the budget should be allocated to long-term brand building, and 40% to short-term performance activation.

However, global research from firms like Kantar suggests that this ratio must be nuanced by industry:

FMCG and high frequency: Brands with short purchase cycles often skew toward performance (roughly 55:45) to capture immediate intent.

Considered purchases: In sectors such as financial services and automotive, the ratio often swings toward 70:30 in favour of the brand. In these categories, a brand must remain in the ""consideration set"" for months or years before a purchase intent ever emerges.

Mass media returns

As digital attribution becomes less reliable, traditional mass media, television, radio, and out-of-home (OOH), are seeing a strategic resurgence. Research from Yellowwood across dozens of brands indicates that these channels consistently deliver more substantial long-term ROI than previously credited through digital-only measurement. While digital channels remain excellent for short-term activation, their impact on long-term brand equity is often negligible.

This shift requires a change in executive mindset. Strategic judgement must once again take precedence over ""precision"" data that is increasingly flawed. Marketing departments built entirely around last-click attribution and immediate conversion metrics must now restructure to value metrics that unfold over quarters and years, rather than weeks.

The ‘pendulum’ is not swinging back to brand because performance marketing has failed, but because the ecosystem that allowed performance-only strategies to thrive is collapsing.

Get C-Suite buy-in

For CMOs to drive genuine business revenue and contribute to broader economic growth, they must secure board-level buy-in for three critical shifts:

Accepting imperfection: Recognise that 100% measurement precision is a myth in the current privacy landscape.

Lengthening horizons: Secure permission to measure success over years, ensuring the brand is ""planted"" well before it is ""harvested.""

Future-proofing infrastructure: Invest in first-party data and measurement tools that will survive the death of the cookie and the rise of privacy-first operating systems.

If implemented, US brands could see their European retail prices rise by 15 to 20 percent almost overnight.","As if the European fashion industry did not have enough on its plate already in view of rapid geopolitical shifts, impending regulation and environmental unpredictability, US president Donald Trump added to its woes this weekend: Eight countries supporting Greenland’s sovereignty - Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and UK - are facing an additional 10 percent tariff on “any and all goods” from 1st February, to be raised to 25 percent on 1st June.

The fashion industry has reacted with a mix of alarm and strategic exhaustion. While some executives are simply waiting for another TACO moment (Trump Always Chickens Out) and a subsequent U-turn, others are hoping for a favourable ruling from the US Supreme Court on the tariff’s legality. Retailers have warned of an immediate 10 to 15 percent price hike on European imports like French leather, Italian silk or British wool.

Industry voices between ‘wait and watch’ and worry

“While luxury giants may be able to overcome another seismic shift, there is a fear that smaller independent designers will not survive... Aspirational shoppers are expected to be priced out,” commented Helen Brocklebank, CEO of the UK’s official body for luxury goods, Walpole, according to The Guardian.

“These tariffs will be yet another burden for businesses across our country... The use of tariffs against allies is completely wrong,” stated UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer when asked about the sentiment of British heritage brands and the UK’s luxury sector according to Yahoo News.

“European designers could end up selling mostly in Europe; American designers could sell mostly in America. This could set the industry back 50 years,” said industry analyst and CEO of Tomorrow London Limited Stefano Martinetto when commenting on the potential for a complete breakdown of transatlantic fashion trade according to The Guardian.

How are luxury groups adjusting?

Luxury giant LVMH is taking a cautious, multi-tiered approach due to its 23 percent revenue exposure to the US market. According to analysts from Morgan Stanley, while LVMH usually has high pricing power, the luxury conglomerate that is home to brands such as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Bulgari and others can only partially offset these tariffs. In line with the fear voiced by Brocklebank, there is a risk of squeezing middle-income (aspirational) consumers who have already been hit by the inflation.

Throughout January, LVMH has been rushing shipments of leather goods and perfumes to US warehouses to beat the deadline of 1st February. Experts suggest there could be selective price hikes of 8 to 12 percent on core items like the Louis Vuitton Speedy or Dior Lady Bag toward the end of the first quarter.

French luxury group Kering, owner of brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta and others, is in a more vulnerable position as it works to turnaround the Gucci brand. Unlike LVMH, Kering is more likely to absorb a portion of the tariff cost rather than passing 100 percent of it to the consumer, fearing that a price spike could stall Gucci's recovery.

The luxury giant is reportedly looking at harmonising global prices — raising prices in Europe and Asia slightly while keeping US increases moderate — to discourage US tourists from doing all their shopping in European metropolises to avoid tariff-inflated domestic prices.

French luxury brand Hermès has signalled that it would likely pass the full cost of the tariffs directly to its US clientele, thus banking on ultra-high-net-worth individuals who are on waitlists for Kelly and Birkin bags to accept a 10 to 25 percent “Greenland Surcharge.”

Many CEOs of luxury brands are currently at the World Economic Forum in Davos, attempting to lobby for a “Luxury Exemption” similar to those granted in previous trade disputes. However, if no deal is reached by 1st February, the first wave of price increases would likely appear on US e-commerce sites by mid-month.

What does this mean for US brands?

In view of the European Union currently favouring a “tit-for-tat” escalation and moving away from its usual diplomatic restraint, a subsequent “Trade Bazooka” could mean the EU retaliating with a package of measures targeting US-made clothing and denim and thus iconic American brands such as Nike, Ralph Lauren, Levi Strauss and others.

If implemented, US brands could see their European retail prices rise by 15 to 20 percent almost overnight. This would likely lead to a re-routing strategy, where they attempt to ship goods through non-targeted EU countries like Spain or Italy.",https://r.fashionunited.com/w-nu7ix2QLPDBb4SAcpCLJPAJ7MGCUClsEmLJuDyXsU/resize:fit:1200:630:0/gravity:ce/quality:70/aHR0cHM6Ly9mYXNoaW9udW5pdGVkLmNvbS9pbWcvdXBsb2FkLzIwMjYvMDEvMjAvZWFnbGUtdnMtYnVsbC1haS02YjVqeW9jbi0yMDI2LTAxLTIwLnBuZw.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 05:01:36.463598

Phoenix said probable maximum losses of up to £50m would now be available on a case-by-case basis for both annual and single project risks in the UK.

In addition, Phoenix has secured Lloyd’s capacity support on a prior submit basis, for erection all risks business within Lloyd’s of London-approved territories.

Tim James, CEO of Phoenix Specialty, said: “This is a significant milestone for Phoenix and gives us further opportunity to expand our offering and better support our broker partners.

Finally, the long-awaited day is almost here.

After years of hedging and will-they-won’t-they speculation regarding the launch of a ChatGPT ads model, OpenAI announced on Friday that it’s going to begin testing ads within its main AI chatbot for users in the US. The ads will only appear in ChatGPT’s free and Go tiers (the latter being its lowest-cost subscription option, introduced as an option for US customers the same day).

Fidji Simo, CEO of Applications at OpenAI, is adamant that paid ads won’t affect product recommendations that ChatGPT deems “objectively useful,” nor will users’ data and conversations be sold to advertisers, per the announcement.

Simply put, OpenAI wants to assure users that “ads do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives [them].”

There’s a lot of certainty about what the ad business won’t look like.

But what, exactly, it will look like isn’t set in stone. (And we all know Sam Altman’s take on ads is famously inconsistent.)

For now, ads will exist at the bottom of ChatGPT feed and be clearly identified and separate from the organic recommendation. And the first ads will be part of a test, not a national rollout.

Still, whether you frame it as OpenAI stepping aboard its rocket ship or beginning a descent down the world’s slipperiest slope, it’s the beginning of something important.

Riding The Tube

OpenAI isn’t the only company with earth-moving advertising news from late last week.

Soon, the BBC will announce a content deal with YouTube to produce bespoke programs for the Google platform, the Financial Times reports. According to the FT, the content BBC will be producing for YouTube will counter misinformation and disinformation on the platform.

But the announcement (when it comes) is a major departure for the BBC, which in the UK does not collect ad revenue, even from content it distributes on third-party platforms.

The broadcaster also has a reputation for prioritizing its first-party assets, the iPlayer streaming platform and two traditional TV channels.

Some older BBC series may be available now on YouTube, too, though that wasn’t central to the deal, one source tells the FT.

On Principal

The times, they are a-changing.

Because ways of doing business that once would have crossed a line in the sand for marketers are now standard, accepted ways of working together.

For one, there’s the old marketing mantra that an agency or media company shouldn’t “grade its own homework.”

Some marketers still repeat the line. But when they speak with their budgets, which accrue to walled gardens, it’s clearly an antiquated notion.

Last week, the CPG data seller SPINS, which has in-store sales and share-of-shelf info, acquired the commerce-focused ad tech company MikMak. Not so long ago, these marketing functions were supposed to be separate. Now, marketers want those functions under one roof.

Another example is principal-based buying, which involves agencies buying and repackaging inventory to clients at undisclosed margins. Principal-based buying has in a few short years gone from an illicit practice discussed in hushed, abashed whispers to a de facto part of how big agencies operate.

“Marketers are looking for cost relief, agencies are looking for margin, and publishers are looking for sales and revenue,” Forrester’s VP and senior agency analyst Jay Pattisall tells Digiday. “The mechanism of arbitrage and principal media enables you to meet all of those considerations.”

It’s within this context that the 8th Annual Shopper, Retailer & Category Insights Conference returns to London on 12th February, offering a focused look at the trends, technologies and behaviours shaping the year ahead.

This year’s event gathers senior voices from Diageo, Deliveroo, The Coca-Cola Company, Sainsbury’s, Holland & Barrett, Kraft Heinz, AO, Barilla Group, Church & Dwight, Medik8, and others, offering a clear, practical lens on how brands can preserve value, build relevance and deliver growth in a price sensitive market.

Inflation, loyalty pressure and the value equation

The morning opens with sessions addressing the economic pressures driving 2026 strategy. With shoppers increasingly switching to private labels, cutting basket sizes and prioritising value over loyalty, Diageo’s Diego Infante will outline how brands can balance affordability with margin protection while sustaining trust.

His emphasis on “smart promotions, not more promotions” is likely to resonate. As promotional fatigue grows and activation budgets tighten, precision and timing are emerging as critical capability gaps.

Central Co-op’s Charlotte Castille builds on this by examining how brands can set price points that protect equity while limiting down-trading. The discussion includes which segments are most vulnerable and how pack formats, innovation and sustainability now influence retention.

Influence, hybrid journeys and non-linear behaviour

The Consumer Behaviours panel - featuring Deliveroo, Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz and AO - explores how shoppers now navigate fragmented, non-linear journeys. Influence -led discovery continues to shape purchase decisions, creating a new competitive environment where credibility must be established instantly.

RTIH readers will recognise the relevance of this shift. With journeys spanning social platforms, marketplaces, brand sites and physical stores, the panel looks at how brands can maintain consistent value messaging and ensure personalisation stays helpful rather than intrusive.

AI moves from theory to operational reality

AI underpins much of this year’s programme. Holland & Barrett CFO Vineta Bajaj will highlight how AI can decode behaviour, forecast category shifts and unify data previously siloed across CRM, e-commerce, loyalty and in-store systems.

The focus is firmly on practical application — how to shift AI from insight generation to activation. With just under half of purchases expected to be influenced by AI agents by 2030*, organisational capability, governance and privacy safeguards are becoming increasingly central.

Retailer collaboration: from legacy KPIs to performance led ecosystems

Diageo’s Efrain Rosario leads the discussion on modern retailer-supplier partnerships, exploring how physical experiences, real-time orchestration and shared data are reshaping value creation. As the sector moves beyond impressions and traditional volume KPIs, outcome-led collaboration is becoming the new standard.

Private label dynamics and brand defence strategies

Private label penetration continues to accelerate. The conference offers two perspectives - from Church & Dwight and AO - on how national brands can defend their position through innovation, trust-building and clear communication.

Rather than treating private label purely as a threat, the discussion examines how national brands can complement retailer value strategies while maintaining distinctive equity.

Retail media, omnichannel performance and measurable ROI

The Retail Media panel - featuring TRIP and Barilla Group - tackles fragmentation across RMNs, TikTok Shop, YouTube and emerging formats. Measurement, duplication and incrementality remain friction points, and the session promises grounded guidance on what effective investment looks like in 2026.

Later sessions delve into omnichannel performance, sustainability and scalable personalisation, with contributions from Sainsbury’s, Medik8, Currys, Objkts Jewelry, The INKEY List and flaconi. Together, they highlight the operational realities of delivering consistency across channels, managing regulatory shifts and applying AI to unify shopper views.

A strategic snapshot of retail’s next chapter

Across inflation, consumer behaviour, AI, retail media, category innovation, convenience and sustainability, the conference provides a concise yet comprehensive view of how brands can build resilience in a fast-changing landscape. For senior commercial, digital and retail leaders, it serves as a timely checkpoint on where the sector is heading - and where competitive advantage will be won in 2026.

He says he got promotion after promotion by doing his very best in the role he was in — even those junior ones.","Gen Z might groan at the idea of fetching their boss’s flat white. And who can blame them? They’ve entered the workforce in an era where optics matter, and they know that being the person who always grabs the coffee, takes notes, or organizes the lunch (also known as “office housework”) can make you look more junior and hurt progression over time.

But Stephanie Kramer, the CHRO of L’Oréal U.S., says those small tasks are often where opportunity begins — and they played a surprisingly big role in her own career to the corner office at the world’s largest beauty company.

Quest fragrances, where she worked closely with perfumers early in her career

Before joining the Fortune 500 firm, L’Oreal, Kramer’s first job out of university was at Quest fragrances. It was also the first time the value of a simple coffee run stood out.

“I really wanted to have time to get to meet this incredibly cool perfumer,” she recalls to Fortune, adding that she went early to the meeting with the mindset that she simply wanted to support her team. But she soon discovered that “something positive comes out of those little things too.”

Instead of being wrapped up in being seen as the most junior person in the room, she quickly noted it gets you access.

“If you’re the one that is going to capture the actions from the meeting and the next steps, and you’re listening and you’re observing that isn’t that isn’t necessarily a negative,” Kramer explains. “You are in the room and you are absorbing how those points are coming to be. You’re developing the skills of inference.”

“So just make sure, when you’re discrediting some of those more small tasks, that you’re not discrediting their value they bring to you and your learning. I think about that all the time.”

Take whatever you can now, be strategic later

Kramer’s résumé spans Chanel, Kiehl’s, and L’Oréal’s corner offices — but it’s the middle-school roles and the odd, early-career errands she remembers most clearly.

“Those ones stick with you,” she says. That first job probably won’t be your dream role, it certainly wasn’t hers. But over time, it will have a snowball effect on your career.

“I don’t know if those are the ones where I ever wanted to be, you know, in my whole life.” Yet, she insists, every experience adds up. “It does. It makes a big difference.”

Her message to young workers facing a freezing job market: take the role, take the task, take the coffee run — because the value will only compound over time.

“You just have to start,” Kramer insists. “I guarantee that someday, that’s what you’re going to talk about in your interview.”

“It might not be the job that you have, or that you’re not necessarily sure that you should take. Right now, maybe it’s a paycheck, or maybe it’s a platform for you to connect with other people so that you can discover what you want to do.”

“When people ask me how I ended up in HR, I tell them it’s from middle school, because in middle school I was a lifeguard, I was a Girl Scout, I was a cross country runner, which means that you have to run through the woods alone, but you’re still making points as a team….Those jobs are part of what my job is today.”

The promotions will come later — but first, focus on

As the adage goes: If you look after the pennies, the pounds will look after themselves. The same goes for your career. Kramer is far from the first exec to tell young workers that if they excel in the small tasks today, the promotions will follow.

Cisco’s U.K. chief spent 25 years climbing the ranks at the Fortune 500 Europe telecommunications giant BT, before joining Cisco in 2022 as managing director and being promoted lead its U.K. and Ireland arm just two years later.

She previously told Fortune that both Gen Z new hires and millennial middle managers need to be more “patient” in their quest for success. The promotions will come, but young aspirational workers should focus on building their skills over rushing to nab any new snazzy title to update their LinkedIn.

Pret A Manger’s CEO Pano Christou, went from working at McDonald’s for $3 an hour to earning millions as the boss of the British sandwich chain. He says he got promotion after promotion by doing his very best in the role he was in — even those junior ones.

“I’ve watched people that have been so fixated on the next role that they really take their eye off the current job they’re doing,” Christou told Fortune. “My philosophy has always been if you do a great job, people will notice you.”

Likewise, Shaid Shah, one of the most senior execs at Mars — the powerhouse behind household brands like Dolmio — said the best career hack is to stop obsessing over getting that promotion or dream job title, and embrace the many steps in between that get you there.

“It’s about acquiring the experiences that you need to realize your ambition, to realize what makes you happy, what makes you tick, what inspires you to get out of bed every day,” Shah explained. “Because career success is more than just hierarchy.”",https://allwork.space/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gen-Z-Career-Advice-From-A-CHRO-Getting-The-Coffee-Is-Strategic-Not-Pathetic.png,N,,2026-01-20 02:58:55.150290

What’s new with oral semaglutide approval and market availability?
Oral semaglutide was approved by the FDA in December 2025 as a once-daily pill (25 mg), intended to limit excess body weight and help with weight maintenance.
BoomRx Introduces Oral Semaglutide and Tirzepatide for Healthcare Providers Nationwide.","BoomRx, a pharmaceutical technology platform that simplifies prescription sourcing and fulfillment by providing healthcare professionals (HCPs) with access to weight management therapies, has now made both oral semaglutide and tirzepatide options available via its platform.1 The options will be using advanced nanoemulsion delivery, for use by medical clinics, telemedicine providers, wellness facilities, and med spas.

What is nanoemulsion technology and how does it improve drug absorption?

According to a report published in Scientifica,2 “Nanoemulsions, also known as nanometric-sized emulsions, are fine water-in-oil (w/o) and oil-in-water (o/w) dispersions of two immiscible fluids, as opposed to the milky-white hue concomitant with coarse dispersion. These 20–200 nm droplets are stabilized by adding the appropriate amphiphilic emulsifiers or emulsifiers.”

Why does delivery format matter for semaglutide and tirzepatide?

By utilizing nanoemulsion technology, the formulations convert each dose into ultra-small particles that promote uniform distribution and enhanced bioavailability. The needle-free delivery format supports greater treatment flexibility and reliability as weight-management care expands into sustained, scalable models.

""Semaglutide and tirzepatide have become foundational therapies in weight management, and how they're delivered matters,"" noted Kurt Lunkwitz, BoomRx’s founder and president in a company news release.1 ""On the clinical side, nanoemulsion delivery provides an injection-free option designed for consistency and predictability—eliminating the performance peaks and troughs that come with using these products. On the distribution side, BoomRx ensures healthcare providers nationwide can quickly and easily fulfill prescriptions for these therapies through one streamlined portal.""

As the industry knows, demand for medical weight loss therapies is on the rise. Keeping that in mind, HCPs are prioritizing delivery formats that help address patient adherence and dosing challenges. By condensing particle sizes at the molecular level, the active ingredients are not only more evenly distributed, but more readily absorbed.

What’s new with oral semaglutide approval and market availability?

Oral semaglutide was approved by the FDA in December 2025 as a once-daily pill (25 mg), intended to limit excess body weight and help with weight maintenance. It officially hit the market earlier this month, and has since been added to both the Amazon Pharmacy and GoodRx networks.

This new version of Wegovy in pill form represents the first ever oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist therapy that’s been approved for weight management. It also now marks the third formulation of Wegovy, expanding its available options.

The GLP-1 agonist was initially approved in June 2021 for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or overweight who have at least one related condition, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol, alongside diet and exercise. In 2024, its label was further expanded to include adults with cardiovascular disease.

Tirzepatide—often known under the brand names Mounjaro and Zepbound—is yet to be approved orally, but is available as an injection.

How does BoomRx’s platform simplify prescribing and fulfillment for providers?

As for BoomRx's platform, HCPs are reportedly1 able to:

Compare formulations using one centralized dashboard

Simplify ordering and fulfillment via one secure login

Scale weight-management programs across both in-office and virtual care environments

""Our role is to remove friction from how healthcare providers source and manage therapies,"" Lunkwitz added. ""As delivery options evolve, BoomRx ensures access stays simple, efficient, and built for growth.""

Weekend AI News Briefs

Guest Post: Three GTM Challenges Killing Vertical AI Startups in 2026—And Why Market Shaping GTM Solves All of Them

As AI startup funding surges while enterprise IT budgets grow only marginally, most vertical AI startups face extinction not because of weak technology but because outdated SaaS go-to-market strategies no longer align with how enterprise buyers choose vendors. The guest post argues that in 2026, only startups that abandon volume-driven SaaS tactics and adopt “market shaping” approaches — focused on narrative control, third-party validation, and early proof — will survive enterprise budget consolidation.

OpenAI Addresses ‘Capactity Overhang’ — What AI Can Do and How It’s Being Used

OpenAI argues that as AI capabilities advance faster than their real-world adoption, the central challenge for the Intelligence Age will be managing the growing “capability overhang” between what AI can do and the value society captures at scale. The company outlines principles focused on transparency, broad access to compute and tools, and user self-empowerment, contending that widespread, practical use of frontier AI is key to unlocking productivity gains, economic growth, and shared opportunity. (OpenAI)

Power, Connectivity and the Next Phase of the AI Supercycle

Today’s AI agents mark an early phase of a much longer AI supercycle that will ultimately push intelligence out of screens and into the physical world, requiring fundamentally new infrastructure, according to the World Economic Forum. As AI workloads strain power grids and outgrow internet-era architectures, the Forum argues that distributed compute and AI-native networks — capable of moving intelligence securely and reliably across data centres, metro regions, and the edge — will become the foundation for the next wave of real-world, physical AI. (World Economic Forum)

The Next AI Revolution Could Start with World Models

As AI systems increasingly falter by predicting what looks plausible rather than understanding how the world actually works, researchers are turning to “world models” that maintain a continuous, internal representation of space and time, Scientific American reports. Advances in 4D modeling — combining three-dimensional structure with temporal change — could stabilize AI-generated video, improve augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous systems, and may be a necessary building block toward more humanlike intelligence and eventual artificial general intelligence.

Moxie Marlinspike Has a Privacy-Conscious Alternative to ChatGPT

As concerns grow that AI assistants will mirror the data-harvesting models of ad-driven platforms, Signal co-founder Moxie Marlinspike has launched Confer, a privacy-first chatbot designed so user conversations cannot be accessed, stored, or monetized, TechCrunch reports. The service uses end-to-end encryption, trusted execution environments, and open-weight models to block data collection by design, offering a higher-priced alternative for users willing to pay a premium to keep sensitive AI interactions private.

AI’s Future: Plotting a Path to Competitiveness and Digital Sovereignty

Europe’s push for digital sovereignty is colliding with a rapidly concentrating cloud and AI market dominated by a handful of U.S. hyperscalers, but the two goals need not be at odds, according to the World Economic Forum. The organization argues that a shift toward distributed, hybrid AI architectures — combining centralized model training with regional infrastructure and edge deployment — can allow countries and companies to capture economic value while preserving control over data, security, and strategic dependencies.

The initiative was unveiled during the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos and positions e& to move beyond traditional NLP-based chatbots toward governed, action-oriented AI embedded directly into core enterprise systems.

At the center of the deployment is IBM watsonx Orchestrate, which e& and IBM said can power domain-specific AI agents that reason, orchestrate tasks, and integrate with enterprise platforms under governance controls. The companies said the solution is designed to help employees and auditors access, interpret and trace legal, regulatory and compliance information more quickly, while producing responses aligned with enterprise governance requirements.

The agentic AI capability has been integrated with IBM OpenPages and the broader watsonx portfolio. e& said the deployment is intended to streamline compliance-related tasks, reduce response times and provide 24/7 self-service access across the organization, while maintaining explainability and auditability suitable for governance, risk and compliance environments.

IBM’s Client Engineering team led the design and integration work, while GBM supported delivery through project coordination and its familiarity with e&’s existing OpenPages and watsonx Assistant environment. The proof of concept was positioned as a demonstration of agentic AI operating at enterprise scale under real-world conditions and within an established governance framework.

IBM noted that the initiative aligns with watsonx.governance, which is already in use at e&, and highlighted a hybrid deployment approach that allows large language models to run across hybrid environments, including customer-managed infrastructure, while remaining governed under enterprise controls. e& described the collaboration as a milestone in its enterprise AI journey and a foundation for broader agentic AI adoption across the organization.

Just the Beginning As we look ahead, our commitment to San Francisco remains unwavering.","San Francisco has shaped our creativity and values at Levi Strauss & Co. for more than 170 years. Last year, we built off of our efforts to continue energizing and giving back to the city we call home — mobilizing employees, investing in public art and partnering with local nonprofits that meet pressing community needs across the city.

Read on to revisit highlights from 2025.

Rallying Companies to Volunteer Together

When we helped launch the Downtown Volunteer Coalition (DVC) with four other companies in 2024, the goal was simple: bring people back to our sidewalks through regular, hands‑on service. In 2025, that coalition more than doubled in size as six additional employers joined — Citizens, Crusoe Energy, FleishmanHillard, Google, the Golden State Warriors and the San Francisco Giants. All participating companies contributed to four cross‑company service days, 30 projects and more than 700 volunteers in the downtown area.

Painting the City With ‘These City Walls’

To mark the 25th anniversary of Community Day — and to add beauty, culture and color across our neighborhoods — we collaborated with 1AM Projects and local partners to commission 25 new murals citywide, including “Beneath the Bay,” completed down the street from our San Francisco headquarters in November. From Potrero Hill to Union Square, these murals are showing up across the city to bring energy to the neighborhoods that make our city thrive.

25 Years of Community Day

We marked LS&Co.’s 25th Community Day with nearly 600 San Francisco-based employees volunteering with 20 nonprofits in one day, alongside more than $150,000 in local grants. This annual day of service was a powerful snapshot of our commitment to our values, with employees working with long-time nonprofit partners across the city like AIDS Memorial Grove and the Homeless Prenatal Program, as well as new nonprofits like Booker T. Washington and San Francisco’s Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Showing Up for Pride in Our Hometown

Our employees showed up in a big way for San Francisco Pride, supporting programming and volunteer activations that celebrate the LGBTQ+ community and the culture that makes the city thrive. We were proud to once again sponsor the San Francisco Pride parade and show up for the community through city-wide pop-ups and events.

St. Anthony’s Partnership

To meet immediate clothing needs in the Tenderloin neighborhood and beyond, we formalized an ongoing donation cadence with St. Anthony’s Free Clothing Program to match supply with demand. St. Anthony’s Foundation provides essential services like meals, medical care, free clothing and pathways to stability for individuals and families in need. Programs such as the Free Clothing Program support thousands of people each year, helping to meet immediate needs and foster long-term well-being.

The donations have been warmly received, and we’ve continued to collaborate on volunteer opportunities for our employees.

Deepening Ties With Longstanding Partners

Throughout the year, we continued to support cultural institutions like the SF MOMA, Academy of Sciences, Fine Arts Museums and the Exploratorium, as well as became a proud sponsor of the annual Stern Grove festival. After the successful inaugural year of Downtown First Thursdays (DFT) in 2024 — of which LS&Co. was a key funder — we continued our support of DFT’s expansion to Front Street as well as the Downtown Development Corporation’s launch. We also kept up our engagement with organizations that are vital to San Francisco families and youth, including Larkin Street Youth Services and the Homeless Prenatal Program, helping their missions through grants and employee volunteering on Community Day and throughout the year.

Just the Beginning

As we look ahead, our commitment to San Francisco remains unwavering. Every mural, every volunteer hour, every partnership reflects our belief that thriving communities start with showing up — again and again. We’ve believed in this city for more than 170 years, and we look forward to continuing to show up.",https://www.levistrauss.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260120_LevisSanFranciscoHometown-700x424.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 02:59:01.121018

The acquisition follows an initial investment made 15 months ago and is part of Gushcloud’s broader strategy to scale its global creator management and monetisation platform, particularly in high-growth markets.

As part of the deal, TalentPlus will rebrand as Gushcloud TalentPlus, focusing on managing MENA creators for global representation while also representing and monetising international creators and intellectual property in the region.

Don't miss: Is the influencer agency space ripe for acquisitions?

Michel Chahda will continue as CEO of Gushcloud TalentPlus and will be appointed partner at Gushcloud International. In a statement, the company said the move strengthens its capabilities across reserved media, creator IP development and cross-border monetisation, supporting creators and brands looking to scale across Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, Europe and the United States.

Gay Carr, chief of staff at Gushcloud International, has also relocated to the UAE to co-lead the unit. She will continue overseeing Gushcloud’s multi-year partnership with the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO), which supports the establishment of Gushcloud’s regional headquarters for EMEA and India in Abu Dhabi.

The company said the partnership aligns with ADIO’s economic diversification goals, including building Abu Dhabi into a regional media and entertainment hub while supporting job creation and the growth of the digital creator ecosystem.

Gushcloud’s expansion comes amid strong growth in digital consumption across the region. According to Strategy&, digital content is projected to account for 46% of the region’s estimated US$22 billion media spend, while data from GlobalWebIndex shows MENA users maintain an average of 8.4 social media accounts and spend more than three hours daily on social platforms.

The acquisition strengthens Gushcloud’s footprint in MENA as competition intensifies among global creator management firms seeking scale, monetisation depth and cross-market reach.

“The UAE has done a great job in recent years marketing itself to creators and is becoming one of the most strategic markets globally for creators to live, work, play and build their businesses and family offices out of. Hence, this majority acquisition is a strategic step forward for us at Gushcloud to have more control in this large growing market that great adds value to the creator ecosystem that Gushcloud is building,” said Althea Lim, co-founder and group CEO of Gushcloud International.

She noted that Gushcloud’s earlier investment in TalentPlus laid the groundwork for a close working relationship with Chahda and his team, citing their deep regional experience, strong local relationships and creator-first approach. Lim added that bringing TalentPlus under majority ownership and appointing Chahda as a partner supports Gushcloud’s long-term ambition to scale its operations and deliver value for creators, brand partners and stakeholders across markets.

In tandem, Michael Chahda, CEO of Gushcloud TalentPlus said, ""Combining our local insights with Gushcloud’s global network, Gushcloud TalentPlus will enable us to create a global path and more monetisable opportunities for the creators we manage and represent exclusively.""

""With Gushcloud’s growing online media inventory , extensive marketing services, and proprietary AI and data tools and platforms, we can now provide accuracy for brands to connect more effectively to their audiences via the creators, allowing more ROI for the brands,"" he added.

The acquisition builds on Gushcloud’s earlier push into the region. In August last year, the company unveiled plans to expand into MENA with the launch of its regional headquarters in Abu Dhabi, backed by a multi-year partnership with the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO).

At the time, Gushcloud said the move would strengthen its presence in one of the world’s fastest-growing creator economies while supporting Abu Dhabi’s ambition to become a global media and entertainment hub. The partnership is aimed at scaling operations across the region, fostering innovation and supporting talent development, as the global creator economy continues its rapid growth.",https://marketing-interactive-assets.b-cdn.net/article_images/gushcloud-acquires-dubai-based-talent-and-influencer-firm-talentplus/1768868860_gushcloud.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 22:59:19.618790

A few months ago, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the company's backlog was in the range of $500 billion.
Taking this one step further, many of the hyperscalers are entering into multiyear agreements for their data center projects.
How much will Nvidia be worth by year-end?
By the end of 2026, I'm predicting that Nvidia could be worth anywhere between $7 trillion and $9 trillion.","When OpenAI commercially launched ChatGPT in November 2022, Nvidia (NVDA 0.29%) was worth about $345 billion. A little more than three years later, the semiconductor powerhouse is now worth $4.5 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world.

While Nvidia has emerged as the king of the generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom thus far, what if I told you the company's epic run was just getting started?

Below, I'll explore a number of catalysts it has for 2026 and break down how the company could notch its next trillion-dollar milestone by year-end.

Why 2026 could be another huge year for Nvidia

According to reporting from FactSet Research and Goldman Sachs, AI hyperscalers, including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and OpenAI could have up to $527 billion in capital expenditures (capex) this year.

A few months ago, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the company's backlog was in the range of $500 billion. However, management was quick to clarify his statement by saying that a portion of this backlog had already been recognized.

Nevertheless, the company's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, recently told investors that the order backlog is growing exponentially. This sounds reasonable considering that Nvidia recently signed a major deal with Anthropic, which will be using the company's new Vera Rubin chip architecture.

Also, Amazon Web Services (AWS) signed a $38 billion deal with OpenAI, which will be renting clusters of Nvidia's GPUs from the cloud provider. And the chipmaker just inked a $20 billion licensing deal with start-up Groq to bolster its inference offerings.

Precise figures are not known, but Wall Street's optimistic view suggests that Nvidia could generate between $320 billion and $330 billion in data center revenue in 2026.

Using that data center business as a proxy for broader AI capex budgets, it's not unreasonable to forecast the company capturing upward of 60% of big tech's infrastructure spending this year.

Taking this one step further, many of the hyperscalers are entering into multiyear agreements for their data center projects. Against this backdrop, Nvidia is positioned for long-term growth in the AI infrastructure era, gaining further revenue and profit visibility with each new deal signed.

Nvidia's valuation profile looks interesting

The chart below illustrates trends across Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) and forward P/S ratios throughout the AI revolution. As it indicates, both multiples have compressed over the last year and are hovering well below prior peaks seen over the last three years.

To me, this could suggest the market is beginning to value Nvidia like a maturing business as opposed to a hypergrowth stock. Below, I'll explain how the company can attain further valuation expansion even as its multiples continue to tighten.

How much will Nvidia be worth by year-end?

Although Nvidia is a diversified business, Wall Street analysts tend to dial in on just one segment: data centers. Over the last 12 months, it has generated $167 billion in data center revenue.

At its current market value, the company is valued at roughly 27 times its trailing-12-month data center sales. Should it execute on its growth plan this year and essentially double those sales, it would be worth almost $9 trillion, assuming its valuation profile stays the same.

Just for argument's sake, let's say the company's ratio between market cap and data center sales compresses closer to its overall forward P/S of 21. At this multiple, the business would be worth about $7 trillion.

The exercise above is simply a fun math exercise, but the key takeaway is that Nvidia is in position to generate further gains this year and beyond, even with its valuation multiples normalizing.

When you measure its growth and influence relative to other contributors to the AI boom in areas such as enterprise software or cloud computing, the company begins to look absurdly cheap.

By the end of 2026, I'm predicting that Nvidia could be worth anywhere between $7 trillion and $9 trillion. At the midpoint of this range, it could be trading for roughly $330 per share, implying more than 70% upside from current levels.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F851501%2Fnvidia-headquarters-with-nvidia-sign-in-front-11.png&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-19 21:00:30.244096

The shares declined by approximately 2.9% to €155.88 in Frankfurt. The downturn reflects a dual burden: fresh complications in the critical Chinese market and a broader deterioration in trade policy sentiment affecting the technology sector. This raises questions about the impact of these short-term headwinds on the company's powerful long-term growth narrative.

The negative sentiment in Europe was compounded by a rougher geopolitical climate. Reports of renewed U.S. tariff threats against European nations this morning triggered declines across the technology sector in Frankfurt and London. Nvidia's move was in sync with other major tech equities, with stocks like Microsoft and Alphabet also retreating by more than 2% during European sessions.

Despite the immediate negative price reaction, major financial institutions have recently reaffirmed or raised their longer-term assessments.

Jefferies: On January 16, analyst Blayne Curtis increased his price target from $250 to $275, maintaining a ""Buy"" rating. He cited an exceptionally strong product roadmap through 2028, featuring the Blackwell and Rubin platforms, which he believes will overshadow near-term disruptions.

Goldman Sachs: The firm maintains a $250 price target. It reiterated its positive view in November, underpinned by Nvidia's leading position in data centers and the persistently high demand for AI infrastructure.

Based on a recent U.S. closing price near $186, the Jefferies target of $275 implies an upside potential of roughly 47%. This suggests that a segment of institutional investors may view the current pullback as a temporary obstacle rather than a fundamental break in the company's trajectory.

Key Business Metrics and Market Context

Trading Environment: U.S. exchanges closed for holiday; European trading active.

Share Price: Approximately €155.88 in Frankfurt, down ~2.9%.

Financial Performance: Q3 revenue reached $57 billion, a 62% year-over-year increase, with a gross margin of 73.4%.

Valuation: The company commands a market capitalization exceeding $4.5 trillion and trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 46.

China Market Hurdle: H200 Production Paused

A primary driver of the current weakness is the halted production of the H200 chip for the Chinese market. Reports late last week indicated that suppliers suspended manufacturing after Chinese customs blocked deliveries of these high-performance semiconductors.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Nvidia?

Significant revenue is at stake. Current data suggests over 1 million orders from Chinese clients are now in limbo. While the U.S. government had previously approved exports subject to a 25% tariff, the new blockade from Beijing creates an additional hurdle and disrupts short-term delivery plans in a crucial growth region.

Insider and Institutional Activity Shows Mixed Signals

Recent filings reveal varied signals from corporate insiders and major investors. The last quarter saw notable insider selling: CEO Jensen Huang disposed of 75,000 shares worth approximately $13.9 million, while Executive Vice President Ajay Puri sold 200,000 shares valued at about $37.6 million. In total, insiders have sold around 1.66 million shares over the past 90 days.

Concurrently, institutional investors are adjusting their stakes. OLD Second National Bank of Aurora reduced its holding by 3.0%, and WESPAC Advisors SoCal LLC cut its position by 9.4%. These moves occur against the backdrop of Nvidia's massive valuation and high earnings multiple, which appear to be prompting selective profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing.

Outlook: Volatility Amid Structural Strength

Nvidia is navigating a period of elevated volatility heavily influenced by political factors. The suspension of H200 deliveries to China and heated trade rhetoric are applying short-term pressure on revenue prospects and market sentiment. However, these developments do not fundamentally challenge the company's structural positioning within the AI sector.

The combination of a premium valuation, robust growth (62% revenue increase last quarter), and geopolitical risks is likely to keep the share price susceptible to swings in the coming weeks. A key focus will be whether and how quickly a resolution emerges regarding exports to China, and if the analysts' raised medium-term price targets can hold firm given the evolving political landscape.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2436611_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 07:00:22.135016

That said, investors should still tread carefully. When a stock gets caught in a sustained downtrend or “freefall,” even solid fundamentals don’t always provide immediate support, and volatility can stay elevated longer than expected.

Because of that, this may be a smart time to start with a small position and scale in gradually as momentum improves and the price action begins to stabilize and recover. Overall, I’m moderately bullish on ADBE, but I think disciplined position sizing and patience are key here.

ADBE Offers Rare Value Against the Crowded AI Trade

It’s definitely tempting to try a short-term trade in Adobe right now—especially with the 14-day RSI sitting at an extremely oversold 23. A sharp rebound could easily deliver something like a 20% move within a month. But I’m not a technical trader, and I’d rather frame this opportunity through a medium-term, fundamentals-driven lens.

From a valuation standpoint, Adobe is starting to look unusually cheap. Its forward PEG ratio is roughly 40% below the sector median, which suggests the market may be pricing in a lot of pessimism. At the 2021 peak, using the all-time high close of $688.37 and FY2021 diluted EPS of $10.02, Adobe was trading around ~69x GAAP earnings.

Today, the setup looks very different. Based on management’s FY2026 midpoint guidance, EPS is implied to be roughly $18.00 GAAP and $23.40 non-GAAP, which puts Adobe at approximately ~17x forward GAAP earnings or ~13x forward non-GAAP earnings at the current price.

With consensus forecasts still calling for roughly 10% normalized EPS growth per year over the next several years, it’s hard to argue this kind of valuation discount will persist indefinitely. Yes, the software landscape is evolving quickly—AI is reshaping competition, raising new threats, and pressuring market share expectations. But that’s also exactly the kind of environment where value investors tend to step in, when sentiment gets too negative, and the downside risks look increasingly priced in.

Value Investors Pounce When Market Share Is at Risk

AI is rapidly changing the creative software landscape. Adobe has historically relied on a subscription model anchored to professional, repeatable workflows—but AI is now pushing the industry toward more usage-based economics, where value is increasingly tied to consumption rather than seats. Over time, that shift can put pressure on Adobe’s average revenue per user (ARPU), even as overall content creation volume continues to expand.

In Fiscal 2025, subscriptions accounted for roughly $22.9B of $23.8B in total revenue—about 96%—highlighting Adobe’s continued reliance on recurring revenue. Management has also pointed to the growing role of generative credits, including pay-per-use layers on top of subscriptions, which is an important evolution in the monetization model.

Meanwhile, Adobe’s annualized revenue run rate ended at $25.2B, up 11.5% year-over-year, suggesting the business remains fundamentally stable rather than weakening. The market, however, appears to be discounting a much more pessimistic long-term outcome well in advance.

At today’s valuation—under 13x free cash flow, based on FY2025 operating cash flow of roughly $10B minus capex of about $180 million—the downside case really hinges on clear, sustained evidence of ARPU deterioration. On the other hand, the upside doesn’t require a dramatic reacceleration—simple stability could be enough to rerate the stock. That’s why I increasingly see Adobe as an asymmetric setup, and it’s also why I remain moderately bullish on ADBE.

Why the Expensive Macroeconomy Is Punishing Adobe

Adobe is a classic long-term compounder with durable cash flows, which means the market tends to value it on earnings expected far into the future. In a pricey macro backdrop like today’s AI-driven boom, investors can often find acceptable returns in much safer assets.

As a result, predictable “steady growers” like ADBE frequently take the biggest hit because they were previously priced for “bond-like” growth. In other words, investors either rotate into genuinely low-risk bonds, or they move further out on the risk curve as valuations stretch—until the market ultimately forces a macro valuation reset.

Is ADBE a Good Buy Right Now?

On Wall Street, Adobe has a consensus Moderate Buy rating based on 16 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell. The average ADBE price target of $450.17 indicates a 52% upside potential over the next 12 months.

This is an extremely bullish outlook, but it’s important to note that consensus price targets have been revised downward as the stock has been declining over the past two years. Calling a bottom on this stock is tough, but it’s fair to say the value is great if investors are willing to tolerate some more downside before the tide shifts in the bulls’ favor.

ADBE is a Value Investment for the Brave

Adobe’s selloff is really a valuation reset without a fundamental breakdown, and that always spells opportunity. It’s a highly-profitable business that’s cash-generative and deeply embedded in professional creative workflows. Even as AI introduces real competitive pressure at the margin, Adobe is adapting to usage-based pricing dynamics and is likely to stay dominant.

At about 13x forward non-GAAP earnings and under 13x free cash flow, the market is already discounting a prolonged period of pressure on average revenue per user from strategic disruption. Thankfully, for value investors, that means the bar is low for upside. We only need to see durable evidence that revenue stability and margins are holding.

Fair enough, an expensive macro environment can punish boring, durable compounders like Adobe, but the stock is now priced for skepticism, and there’s clearly a large margin of safety in the valuation. Disciplined value investors can make money here, but staging a position rather than timing the precise bottom is wise, because it won’t be a straight line to the upside.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2543899675-750x406.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 20:59:42.579245

With no single headline event driving attention, U.S. Bancorp (USB) is drawing investor interest based on its recent performance, its value score of 4, and its core banking operations focused on U.S. consumers and institutions.

See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp.

The share price at $54.40 has largely treaded water in the very short term, while a 14.26% 90 day share price return and 17.45% 1 year total shareholder return indicate gradually improving momentum for U.S. Bancorp.

If this kind of steady banking performance interests you, it can be worth widening your research to other healthcare stocks that may respond differently to economic and interest rate trends.

With U.S. Bancorp trading at $54.40, a value score of 4 and an estimated intrinsic discount of 40.25% raise a clear question for investors: is this an undervalued bank stock, or is the market already pricing in future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 10.6% Undervalued

The widely followed narrative places U.S. Bancorp’s fair value at about US$60.84, above the last close of US$54.40, framing the current set up as moderately discounted.

The analysts have a consensus price target of $53.604 for U.S. Bancorp based on their expectations of its future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors. However, there is a degree of disagreement amongst analysts, with the most bullish reporting a price target of $67.0, and the most bearish reporting a price target of just $47.0.

Read the complete narrative.

Curious what sits behind that fair value gap? Revenue growth assumptions, margin shifts and a higher future P/E all play a part, but the exact mix might surprise you.

Walmart is No. 2 in the Top 2000. The database is Digital Commerce 360’s ranking of North America’s online retailers by their annual ecommerce sales.

In addition, Walmart is No. 8 in the Global Online Marketplaces. That database ranks the top such marketplaces by third-party gross merchandise value (GMV).

Who are the new Walmart U.S. CEO and other executives?

Walmart credited Guggina with leading efforts to improve its delivery capabilities that expand serving to “95% of U.S. households in under three hours,” the retailer announced in a Jan. 16 press release. The company noted that his experience with ecommerce, as well as supply chain operations, were among his qualifications to take on the chief executive position for Walmart U.S.

“Over my 32 years with Walmart, I’ve seen that our people are our greatest competitive advantage,” Furner said in a released statement. “These internal promotions reflect our culture of opportunity and the depth of our leadership bench.”

Among those promotions, Seth Dallaire, the executive vice president and chief growth officer for Walmart U.S., was named as the new executive vice president and chief growth officer at Walmart Inc.

Walmart detailed his new responsibilities as including global enterprise platforms, which encompass Walmart Connect and digital advertising, Walmart+, Walmart Data Ventures, Vizio, Sam’s Club MAP and the Walmart Marketplace platform.

At Sam’s Club U.S., Chris Nicholas will leave his role as president and CEO to take over as president and CEO of Walmart International. In doing so, Nicholas will replace Kath McLay, who is leaving the company.

Meanwhile, Latriece Watkins will take on Nicholas’s previous duties as president and CEO of Sam’s Club U.S. Most recently, she has been executive vice president and chief merchandising officer at Walmart U.S.

Why is Walmart making changes to its executive team?

“These leadership changes also mark a key step in how we organize for the future,” Furner said.

Furner, who is scheduled to become president and CEO of Walmart on Feb. 1, described the changes as necessary for Walmart to be competitive. Moreover, he tied them to how Walmart is using artificial intelligence (AI) to update its operations and workforce. The new titles and responsibilities will be effective on the same day he takes over.

“Even the best teams need the right structure to win,” he stated. “As AI rapidly reshapes retail, we are centralizing our platforms to accelerate shared capabilities, freeing up our operating segments to be more focused on and closer to our customers and members.”

Dario Arfelli leads global marketing for Imaging Informatics at Philips, where cloud imaging is being framed less as an infrastructure shift and more as an operational correction. In conversations with clients and prospects, the discussion is more about time saved and access gained rather than the IT benefits of moving to the cloud.

Cloud Imaging, Workforce Pressure, and Time Back for Care

Radiology is becoming untethered…in a good way. More radiologists are reading remotely, freeing up valuable space in healthcare facilities.

As Arfelli puts it, “Before, radiologists were locked to the physical radiology department,” but now they have the freedom to operate from anywhere – a remote office, from home or in a different state. This is only possible with...

Rainer M. Blair, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""We are encouraged by our third quarter results.
It was a softer quarter as it posted a slight miss of analysts’ revenue estimates and a miss of analysts’ organic revenue estimates.

It was a strong quarter as it also produced an impressive beat of analysts’ organic revenue estimates and a narrow beat of analysts’ revenue estimates.","The end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Let’s take a look at how research tools & consumables stocks fared in Q3, starting with Danaher (NYSE:DHR).

The life sciences subsector specializing in research tools and consumables enables scientific discoveries across academia, biotechnology, and pharmaceuticals. These firms supply a wide range of essential laboratory products, ensuring a recurring revenue stream through repeat purchases and replenishment. Their business models benefit from strong customer loyalty, a diversified product portfolio, and exposure to both the research and clinical markets. However, challenges include high R&D investment to maintain technological leadership, pricing pressures from budget-conscious institutions, and vulnerability to fluctuations in research funding cycles. Looking ahead, this subsector stands to benefit from tailwinds such as growing demand for tools supporting emerging fields like synthetic biology and personalized medicine. There is also a rise in automation and AI-driven solutions in laboratories that could create new opportunities to sell tools and consumables. Nevertheless, headwinds exist. These companies tend to be at the mercy of supply chain disruptions and sensitivity to macroeconomic conditions that impact funding for research initiatives.

The 10 research tools & consumables stocks we track reported a mixed Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 1.1% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 1.3% below.

Thankfully, share prices of the companies have been resilient as they are up 7.3% on average since the latest earnings results.

Danaher (NYSE:DHR)

Born from a real estate investment trust that transformed into a manufacturing powerhouse, Danaher (NYSE:DHR) is a global science and technology company that provides specialized equipment, software, and services for biotechnology, life sciences, and diagnostics.

Despite the top-line beat, it was still a mixed quarter for the company with a beat of analysts’ EPS estimates but revenue guidance for next quarter missing analysts’ expectations significantly.

Rainer M. Blair, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""We are encouraged by our third quarter results. DBS-driven execution paired with continued momentum in our bioprocessing business and better-than-anticipated respiratory revenue at Cepheid enabled us to exceed our revenue, earnings and cash flow expectations.""

Key Takeaways

The Swedish krona gained 20.2% against the U.S. dollar in 2025, marking its biggest year of appreciation in decades.

Many major currencies appreciated against the dollar last year given steep policy uncertainty and increasing central bank reserve diversification.

Donald Trump’s trade war was a major driver of U.S. dollar weakness in 2025, pushing trade policy uncertainty to historic levels.

At the same time, U.S. dollars held in foreign central bank reserves fell to 20-year lows. Given these dynamics, several major currencies, from the Swedish krona to the Brazilian real saw double-digit gains against the U.S. dollar amid lower global demand.

This graphic shows the appreciation of major currencies against the greenback in 2025, based on data from Bloomberg via The Bulwark.

The Performance of Major Currencies Against the U.S. Dollar

Below, we show how numerous currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar in 2025:

CurrencyAppreciation in 2025 🇸🇪 Swedish Krona20.2% 🇲🇽 Mexican Peso15.6% 🇨🇭 Swiss Franc14.5% 🇿🇦 South African Rand13.8% 🇪🇺 Euro13.5% 🇩🇰 Danish Krone13.3% 🇳🇴 Norwegian Krone12.9% 🇧🇷 Brazilian Real12.8% 🇦🇺 Australian Dollar7.8% 🇬🇧 British Pound7.7% 🇸🇬 Singapore Dollar6.2% 🇨🇦 Canadian Dollar4.8% 🇹🇼 Taiwanese Dollar4.4% 🇳🇿 New Zealand Dollar2.8% 🇰🇷 South Korean Won2.2% 🇯🇵 Japanese Yen0.3%

With 20.2% gains, the Swedish krona saw its strongest performance against the dollar in decades.

The U.S. dollar weakened on softer economic data and policy expectations, and investors rebalanced into currencies like the krona amid relatively stronger Swedish growth prospects and economic fundamentals.

The Mexican peso had the second highest gains, strengthening 15.6% in 2025. This marked the best year since 1994, defying expectations given U.S. trade tensions. Among the factors underpinning the peso’s rise are resilient growth and macroeconomic stability.

Meanwhile, the South African rand rose 13.8% and the Brazilian real appreciated 12.8%.

Across Asian countries, the Singapore dollar increased 6.1%, serving as a “quasi safe haven” across the region. The global financial hub is known for its institutional strength and significant current account surplus, further supporting demand.

Charted: Asset Class Returns Across Eras (1990–2025)

See visuals like this from many other data creators on our Voronoi app. Download it for free on iOS or Android and discover incredible data-driven charts from a variety of trusted sources.

Key Takeaways

Private markets delivered the strongest long-term returns since 1990, but with the highest volatility.

Since 2020, gold has been the best-performing asset with an 18.4% annualized return.

Bonds have struggled in recent years as higher interest rates and inflation weigh on fixed-income returns.

Investment performance can vary widely depending on the time period analyzed. While equities and gold have delivered strong returns in recent years, bonds and some alternative assets have lagged, especially in the post-pandemic era of rising interest rates.

This graphic breaks down annualized returns and volatility across major asset classes over three distinct periods: long-term (1990–2025), mid-term (2010–2025), and the most recent cycle (2020–2025), using data from Goldman Sachs. Global equities and private markets exclude real estate, and data is as of September 2025.

ℹ️ Understanding volatility: Volatility measures how much an investment’s returns fluctuate year to year. For example, a volatility of 10% implies that returns typically move about 10 percentage points above or below the average in a given year. While higher volatility often accompanies higher returns, it also increases the risk of short-term losses.

Long-Term Returns by Asset Class: 1990–2025

Over the past 35 years, risk assets have significantly outperformed safer alternatives.

Private markets delivered the strongest annualized returns at 10.5%, although this came with substantial volatility of over 21%. Global equities also performed well, averaging just over 8% annually.

Bonds offered more modest but stable returns, while gold provided diversification benefits with mid-range returns and high volatility.

Post-Global Financial Crisis Asset Performance: 2010–2025

The period following the Global Financial Crisis was marked by low interest rates and strong equity performance.

Global equities saw annualized returns rise to 10.5%, while private markets continued to outperform public assets.

In contrast, sovereign bonds struggled as yields compressed, delivering less than 1% annual returns. Gold remained resilient during this era, with prices rising sharply from 2009 to 2012, before falling and stabilizing.

Post-Pandemic Asset Class Returns: 2020–2025

The most recent five-year period highlights a sharp divergence across asset classes.

Global equities delivered strong returns following the 2020 crash, despite market volatility.

Meanwhile, gold has been the best-performing asset amid rising inflation, geopolitical risks, and elevated interest rates, with prices hitting all-time highs twice since 2020.

Bonds experienced negative real and nominal performance as rapid interest rate hikes eroded prices. Rising inflation and high sovereign debt levels have put downward pressure on sovereign bond prices.

Furthermore, real estate has seen relatively low returns relative to medium- and long-term periods, with high mortgage rates dampening the demand for housing in many major markets.

Early progress was visible in the fiscal third quarter, as the availability of the company’s top-selling SKUs improved by more than 150 basis points year over year.

Store presentation will follow suit. Target plans its most significant floor pad transformation in 10 years, with resets in Home, Baby, Beauty and Fun 101. These changes are intended to elevate discretionary storytelling and reassert design-led merchandising, areas that have historically distinguished the brand.

To support the new model, headquarters staffing has been reduced by roughly 1,800 roles, streamlining decision-making and accelerating the merchant workflow. If executed effectively, TGT’s 2026 investments could restore discretionary momentum and position the company for a more competitive cycle, defined by improved availability, stronger store experience and tighter merchandising discipline.

These enhancements reinforced Best Buy’s position as a leading tech-focused omnichannel retailer.

Andy Beshear and a delegation from Team Kentucky will travel to Europe this week to Finland and Sweden and to attend the World Economic Forum in Switzerland to support future investment, job-creation and economic development opportunities in the commonwealth.

The trip comes just after the announcement that Kentucky scored its second-best year on record for new private sector investments in 2025 — $10.5 billion in projects from 185 new-location and expansion announcements projected to create nearly 9,600 full-time jobs. Last year also saw rising wages across the state, as the average incentivized hourly wage was $29.58 in 2025, the highest on record, and topped $26 in four consecutive years for the first time.

“The commonwealth’s economy is as strong as it has ever been, and that momentum is carrying over into 2026 as we continue to work toward our goal of building a brighter future for all Kentuckians,” said Gov. Andy Beshear. “The World Economic Forum presents a unique opportunity to meet with business leaders from around the world at one location – an opportunity that otherwise would not be possible. I am excited to show the world that our New Kentucky Home is the best place to invest, do business, live and work as we build on our record-breaking success.”

The World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2026 will center on the theme “A Spirit of Dialogue,” with primary topics focusing on collaboration, economic resilience and competitiveness, ethics and workforce disruption, sustainability, and deployment of transformative technologies. The annual invitation-only event, established in 1973, has grown to become a major international networking opportunity and one of the world’s largest assemblies of global decision-makers, with thousands of government, business and civic leaders representing over 125 countries participating.

Team Kentucky’s participation provides an opportunity to build on Kentucky’s extensive international presence, which currently includes 524 foreign-owned facilities that employ over 110,000 Kentuckians. The commonwealth ranks third nationally for Foreign Direct Investment employment as a percentage of total employment.

The Governor and his team are currently scheduled to meet with about 260 business leaders, as well as 16 companies with existing Kentucky facilities that employ over 13,600 workers as well as eight prospective companies with projects that include nearly 650 proposed jobs.

Gov. Beshear will also visit with leadership from various overseas companies during the trip, including DHL Group, a global leader in mail, delivery and logistics. In 2024, its company DHL Express announced the groundbreaking of a new state-of-the-art aviation maintenance facility at CVG Airport in Northern Kentucky, a $292 million investment creating 300 new, full-time jobs.

The governor’s visit to Europe will build on the best six-year period for economic growth in state history.

Since the beginning of his administration, Gov. Beshear has announced more than 1,300 private-sector new-location and expansion projects totaling over $45 billion in announced investments, creating more than 68,000 jobs. This is the highest investment figure secured during the tenure of any governor in the commonwealth’s history and $24 billion more than the next highest total.

Gov. Beshear has announced some of the largest economic development projects in state history, which have solidified Kentucky as the battery capital of the United States: AESC’s $2 billion, 2,000-job gigafactory project in Warren County; Ford Motor Co.’s $2 billion, 2,200-job commitment in Louisville, as well as its $2 billion, 2,100-job project at the Kentucky 1 plant in Hardin County; Shelbyville Battery Manufacturing’s $712 million investment, creating 1,572 jobs in Shelby County; and Toyota’s $1.3 billion investment in Scott County, among others.

The Governor’s administration also secured the largest General Fund budget surplus and Rainy Day Fund. In 2023, Kentucky recorded over 2 million jobs filled for the first time ever and has stayed above that number ever since.

Kentucky also secured rating increases from major credit rating agencies Fitch Ratings, S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service.

Last year, Site Selection magazine ranked Kentucky in the top five nationally and second in the South Central region for economic development projects per capita in its 2024 Governor’s Cup rankings.

Bentonville-based retail giant Walmart announced on Jan. 16 that Latriece Watkins, EVP and chief merchandising officer for Walmart U.S., was named president and CEO of Sam’s Club U.S.

A native of McGehee, Watkins started her career with Walmart as an intern in 1997. Among her many successes, she reshaped the Walmart U.S. assortment strategy, drove operational excellence and ensured a consistent, trusted shopping experience. Watkins has held a wide range of leadership roles across Sam’s Club, Walmart U.S. merchandising, people and U.S. store operations.

Watkins has been widely recognized for her leadership and influence in the retail industry. She has been featured in Essence Magazine, named to FORTUNE Magazine’s “Ones to Watch” list and Mass Market Retailer’s Most Influential Women in Retail, and received the inaugural Madam C.J. Walker Award for Excellence in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. She was also inducted into the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame in 2025.

The change is part of a leadership shuffle in the wake of last year’s announcement that John Furner would take over as president and chief executive officer of Walmart Inc. Via a release, Furner said the new executive leaders would help fuel innovation and drive a new era of retail.

“Over my 32 years with Walmart, I’ve seen that our people are our greatest competitive advantage. These internal promotions reflect our culture of opportunity and the depth of our leadership bench,” he said.

“These leadership changes also mark a key step in how we organize for the future. Even the best teams need the right structure to win. As AI rapidly reshapes retail, we are centralizing our platforms to accelerate shared capabilities, freeing up our operating segments to be more focused on and closer to our customers and members.”

Watkins will take over in her new role Feb. 1. Other executive changes announced Jan. 16 include:

Seth Dallaire, EVP and chief growth officer for Walmart U.S., is being named EVP and chief growth officer for Walmart Inc.

David Guggina, EVP and chief ecommerce officer for Walmart U.S., will become president and CEO of Walmart U.S.

A US district judge ruled in 2024 that the technology company had monopolised online search and text advertising through exclusive distribution agreements that made Google the default option for users.

Responding to the ruling on Friday, Google said it “ignored the reality that people use Google because they want to, not because they’re forced to.” The company also argued that the judgment failed to reflect the competitive nature of the market.

“The decision failed to account for the rapid pace of innovation and intense competition we face from established players and well-funded start-ups,” Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs, wrote in a blog post.

As part of the appeal process, Google has asked District Court Judge Amit Mehta to pause an order requiring the company to share certain data with competitors, a measure intended to create more balance in the online search market. In a court filing, Google said complying with the data-sharing requirement before the appeal is resolved could result in the loss of trade secrets.

The data-sharing order was issued alongside the judge’s rejection of a request from the US government that Google be required to sell its Chrome web browser. At the time, the judge said Google must make available to “qualified competitors” search index data and user interaction information that rivals could use to improve their services.

Google said it is not seeking to delay other elements of the court’s earlier orders, including those related to privacy and security safeguards for user data. “Although Google believes that these remedies are unwarranted and should never have been imposed, it is prepared to do everything short of turning over its data or providing syndicated results and ads while its appeal is pending,” the company said.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/bmi/media/media_files/GxJKjHWNl8xtNTuEkqd2.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 00:00:33.010437

Penumbra’s portfolio includes mechanical thrombectomy devices, such as the Lightning Bolt and Lightning Flash systems, designed to remove blood clots in arterial, venous, and pulmonary vessels.
“Penumbra is a strong strategic, financial and cultural fit with Boston Scientific,” the spokesperson said.","Under the terms of the deal, Penumbra stockholders can elect to receive $374 per share in cash or 3.8721 shares of Boston Scientific common stock, subject to proration, with approximately 73% of the total consideration paid in cash and 27% in stock.

Penumbra’s financial performance highlights its growth potential. Its Q4 2025 revenue growth projected at 21.4 –22% and full-year revenue of approximately $1.4 billion, representing a 17.3–17.5% increase over the prior year.

This acquisition positions Boston Scientific to expand its cardiovascular portfolio and segments within the vascular and neurovascular space. Penumbra’s portfolio includes mechanical thrombectomy devices, such as the Lightning Bolt and Lightning Flash systems, designed to remove blood clots in arterial, venous, and pulmonary vessels. The company also offers minimally invasive embolization systems to control bleeding and neurovascular solutions for stroke revascularization and neuro embolization.

“Penumbra is a strong strategic, financial and cultural fit with Boston Scientific,” the spokesperson said. “The acquisition will enable us to enter into new key segments of mechanical thrombectomy and neurovascular, which are large, underserved, high-growth spaces.

Once a steady, century-old stalwart known for its dominance in the insulin market, Lilly has undergone a metamorphosis, evolving into a $1 trillion cardiometabolic powerhouse. The company’s trajectory has been propelled by a class of drugs known as GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists, specifically tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for obesity.

Today, Lilly sits at the center of a global health revolution. With obesity now recognized as a chronic, treatable disease rather than a lifestyle choice, the demand for its medications has outstripped even the most optimistic projections. This deep dive explores how Lilly is not just riding a wave of demand but is fundamentally rebuilding its supply chain and R&D engine to maintain its lead in what analysts expect to be a $150 billion obesity market by 2030.

Historical Background

Founded in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical chemist and American Civil War veteran, the company was built on a foundation of quality and innovation. Based in Indianapolis, Indiana, Lilly’s early years were marked by being the first company to mass-produce the polio vaccine and, more pivotally, the first to commercialize insulin in the 1920s.

Throughout the 20th century, Lilly solidified its ""Big Pharma"" status with blockbuster psychiatric medications like Prozac (fluoxetine), which transformed the treatment of depression in the 1980s. However, the 2010s were a period of ""patent cliff"" anxiety, as the company faced the loss of exclusivity for major earners like Cymbalta and Zyprexa. Under the leadership of David Ricks, who became CEO in 2017, the company pivoted sharply back toward high-science, high-risk R&D in oncology, immunology, and metabolic health, setting the stage for its current dominance.

Business Model

Eli Lilly operates as a pure-play, innovation-driven pharmaceutical company. Unlike some peers that have diversified into consumer health (like Johnson & Johnson) or animal health, Lilly is focused entirely on human medicine across four core pillars:

Metabolic Health: The largest segment, encompassing the incretin franchise (Mounjaro/Zepbound) and its legacy insulin business (Humalog/Jardiance).

Oncology: Driven by Verzenio, a breast cancer drug, and a growing pipeline of targeted therapies.

Immunology: Centered around Taltz and Olumiant for autoimmune conditions.

Neuroscience: A resurgent sector following the approval of Kisunla (donanemab) for Alzheimer’s disease.

The company’s model is predicated on high R&D reinvestment (typically over 25% of revenue) to create proprietary, high-margin biologics that provide significant clinical benefits over existing standards of care.

Stock Performance Overview

Lilly’s stock performance over the last five years has been nothing short of historic. As of early 2026, the stock trades in the $1,030 – $1,080 range, reflecting a staggering transformation in valuation.

1-Year Performance: LLY is up approximately 38%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. This growth was driven by the resolution of supply chain bottlenecks and clinical trial successes for its next-generation obesity drugs.

5-Year Performance: Investors have seen returns exceeding 500%. In 2021, LLY was trading around $160; by late 2025, it became the first pharmaceutical company to cross the $1 trillion market cap threshold.

10-Year Performance: Long-term shareholders have enjoyed a ""ten-bagger"" return, as the stock grew from roughly $80 in 2016 to over $1,000 today, fueled by the strategic shift initiated by CEO David Ricks.

Financial Performance

In the preliminary data for FY 2025, Eli Lilly has demonstrated the financial profile of a high-growth tech stock rather than a traditional drugmaker.

Revenue: Projected at $63.0 – $63.5 billion for 2025, a massive increase from the $34 billion reported in 2023.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): Estimated at $23.00 – $23.70 (non-GAAP) for the full year 2025.

Margins: Operating margins have expanded significantly as manufacturing scale-up began to drive down per-unit costs for tirzepatide.

Valuation: With a trailing P/E ratio hovering near 50x, the market is pricing in sustained 20%+ annual growth, a rarity for a company of its size.

Cash Flow: Operating cash flow has been redirected into a $55 billion multi-year capital expenditure program to build ""the most advanced bio-manufacturing network in the world.""

Leadership and Management

David A. Ricks, Chairman and CEO, is widely credited with Lilly’s current success. His strategy has been twofold: ruthlessly prioritizing the pipeline and aggressively investing in manufacturing. Ricks is supported by a seasoned executive team, including CFO Anat Ashkenazi, who has managed the company’s massive capital deployments with surgical precision.

The board of directors and management team have earned a reputation for being ""long-term greedy""—willing to sacrifice short-term earnings to build the capacity needed to serve hundreds of millions of patients. This is evidenced by their decision to continue investing in Alzheimer's research for three decades despite multiple failures, eventually resulting in the approval of Kisunla.

Products, Services, and Innovations

Lilly’s innovation engine is currently the envy of the industry.

The Incretin Franchise

Mounjaro/Zepbound (Tirzepatide): A dual GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonist. As of early 2026, this franchise is on track for a $40 billion annual run rate.

Retatrutide (""Triple G""): A triple agonist (GLP-1, GIP, and Glucagon) currently in Phase 3. Data from late 2025 showed weight loss approaching 29%—a figure previously only achievable through bariatric surgery.

Orforglipron: A non-peptide, oral GLP-1. This ""obesity pill"" is expected to receive FDA approval by April 2026. Because it is a small molecule, it can be manufactured more cheaply and at higher volumes than injectable biologics.

Beyond Obesity

Kisunla (Donanemab): A cornerstone of Lilly’s neuroscience portfolio, targeting amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s.

LillyDirect: A first-of-its-kind direct-to-consumer digital health platform that allows patients to obtain prescriptions and medications directly from the manufacturer, bypassing traditional pharmacy middle-men.

Competitive Landscape

Lilly’s primary rival is the Danish firm Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO), the maker of Wegovy and Ozempic. The two companies currently operate as a duopoly in the GLP-1 space. However, the landscape is shifting in 2026:

The Challenger Group: Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) and Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) are advancing ""me-too"" or ""next-gen"" injectables.

The Oral Entrants: Roche (OTC: RHHBY) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) are racing to bring oral obesity pills to market, though Lilly’s Orforglipron is currently the frontrunner in the oral small-molecule race.

Lilly's Edge: Lilly’s dual and triple agonist approach (Tirzepatide/Retatrutide) has consistently shown superior weight loss efficacy compared to Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide.

Industry and Market Trends

The ""Metabolic Supercycle"" is the defining trend of 2026. Obesity is now being treated as the ""gateway condition"" for dozens of other diseases, including sleep apnea, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis).

Supply chain resilience has also become a major competitive moat. After two years of shortages, Lilly’s decision to build its own API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) plants in Indiana and Ireland has given it a ""volume advantage"" over competitors who rely more heavily on contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) like Catalent.

Risks and Challenges

Despite the euphoria, Lilly faces several headwinds:

Pricing Legislation: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the U.S. remains a threat, with Medicare price negotiations for top-selling drugs potentially impacting Mounjaro by late 2027.

Manufacturing Complexity: Building $50 billion worth of factories is prone to delays and cost overruns. Any contamination or regulatory citation (Form 483) at a major site could stall growth.

Long-term Safety: While GLP-1s are generally safe, the ""mass-exposure"" of hundreds of millions of people to these drugs means that even a rare side effect could become a major liability.

Competition and Commoditization: As more oral pills enter the market, pricing for the obesity category may experience a ""race to the bottom"" in the late 2020s.

Opportunities and Catalysts

Orforglipron Approval (April 2026): This is the most significant near-term catalyst. If approved, it opens the door to the primary care market and emerging economies where cold-chain injection infrastructure is lacking.

New Indications: Expect 2026 to bring Phase 3 data for tirzepatide in treating obstructive sleep apnea and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

M&A Potential: With a massive cash pile, Lilly is expected to acquire small-cap biotech firms specializing in ""next-next-gen"" therapies, such as muscle-sparing obesity drugs.

Investor Sentiment and Analyst Coverage

Wall Street remains overwhelmingly bullish. Institutional ownership is high, with major firms like BlackRock and Vanguard treating LLY as a ""must-own"" growth-at-any-price asset. Retail sentiment is equally strong, fueled by the ""LillyDirect"" consumer-facing brand and the undeniable physical results seen by millions of patients.

Recent analyst notes from firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have raised price targets to the $1,300 range, citing the ""unlimited"" TAM (Total Addressable Market) for metabolic health.

Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

Regulatory focus in 2026 is centered on the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act (TROA), which aims to expand Medicare coverage for obesity medications. If fully passed, it would unlock a massive demographic of patients currently paying out-of-pocket.

Geopolitically, Lilly is diversifying away from Chinese manufacturing. Its massive investments in Germany and the U.S. (""Lilly in America"") are designed to insulate the company from potential trade conflicts or supply chain disruptions in Asia.

Conclusion

Eli Lilly has transitioned from a traditional pharmaceutical company into a generational growth story. By the start of 2026, it has successfully addressed the supply shortages that plagued its 2024 launch and is now pivoting toward a high-volume, multi-platform strategy involving both injectables and oral pills.

While the $1 trillion valuation brings increased scrutiny and higher stakes, Lilly’s aggressive capital expenditure and ""best-in-class"" pipeline data suggest it is well-positioned to remain the dominant force in healthcare. Investors should closely watch the April 2026 FDA decision on Orforglipron and the speed at which the Indiana manufacturing complex comes online. In the long run, Lilly is not just selling a drug; it is selling a solution to one of the most pressing health crises of the 21st century.

Otros simplemente es pura curiosidad. Y algunos, los más interesantes, van de confiar. De esto último iba precisamente el que le propusieron a la periodista y presentadora María Casado desde L’Oréal Paris. El punto de partida: probar durante dos meses la crema de día Revitalift Laser y comprobar, desde la transparencia y el rigor científico, hasta dónde puede llegar una fórmula antiedad bien diseñada. Y sí: también de confiar en la ciencia.

Casado no solo aceptó el desafío, sino que lo hizo desde el corazón de la investigación científica: los propios laboratorios de L’Oréal Paris en París. Y lo hizo para poder entender y después, vivir en su propia piel, todo lo que hay detrás de uno de los tratamientos antiedad más icónicos de la marca.

De la mano de Elisabeth Bouhadana, directora científica global de L’Oréal Paris, María Casado pasó primero por un diagnóstico avanzado del estado de su piel antes de empezar el tratamiento. El objetivo era documentar de forma objetiva el antes y el después.

Durante las ocho semanas posteriores, su rutina fue constante: la crema de día Revitalift Laser. Le acompañó durante la experiencia la tecnología de análisis dérmico Visia, un sistema de alta precisión capaz de evaluar arrugas, textura, firmeza y luminosidad. El reto no iba de documentar opiniones o percepciones subjetivas, sino de documentarlo a través de imágenes, datos y mucha ciencia.

Revitalift Laser

Además de María Casado, el otro protagonista de esta historia es un producto que lleva años reinventando el cuidado antiedad. La icónica crema de día Revitalift Laser es el corazón de la gama de L’Oréal que está inspirada en los procedimientos de medicina estética y pensada para actuar de forma intensiva pero accesible sobre los signos visibles del envejecimiento.

Su fórmula combina Pro-Retinol, Ácido Hialurónico, Vitamina Cg y Pro-Xylane, que son activos de referencia en dermatología cosmética y que trabajan juntos para ofrecer una triple acción antiedad. Por un lado, corrige arrugas gracias a la adenosina y al ácido hialurónico fragmentado; retexturiza y redensifica la piel, mejorando visiblemente su calidad tras su uso y además, remodela el rostro, ya que redefine el contorno facial y devuelve la firmeza en las zonas donde más se necesita.

Los resultados

Según los estudios clínicos de la marca* (y la experiencia de María Casado) los efectos son progresivos pero claros desde el primer uso. Se nota la piel más hidratada al momento y la textura, mejorada. Arrugas y líneas de expresión comienzan a reducirse en una semana y tras cuatro semanas de uso, la piel se ve más luminosa y firme. A las 8 semanas, los resultados que ya se ven en el espejo, son confirmados también por la tecnología.

Y es que cuando la innovación se une a una rutina diaria y constante que además está bien formulada, hay traducción directa en la piel.

As a result, the actual first-week sales performance could be meaningfully higher, underscoring the potential strength of the oral Wegovy launch trajectory.
It has priced oral Wegovy at $149 per month (without insurance).
Against this backdrop, Novo Nordisk’s launch of oral Wegovy gives it a first-mover advantage in the oral GLP-1 segment, positioning the company to regain market share from Lilly and drive incremental revenues.
During the same time frame, Novo Nordisk’s 2026 earnings estimates have declined from $3.65 to $3.52.","Shares of Novo Nordisk NVO rose 9.1% on Friday after the company reportedly recorded strong early prescription trends just one week following the early-January U.S. launch of the oral version of its blockbuster GLP-1 therapy, Wegovy (semaglutide). The pill, approved in late December for obesity and cardiovascular risk reduction, is reportedly seeing robust initial demand, signaling an encouraging early uptake in the U.S. market.

The available prescription data reportedly reflects only retail channel activity and excludes volumes from Novo Nordisk’s direct-to-consumer online pharmacy, NovoCare. As a result, the actual first-week sales performance could be meaningfully higher, underscoring the potential strength of the oral Wegovy launch trajectory.

Please note that the Wegovy pill is the first oral GLP-1 drug to be approved in the United States, ushering in a new era of obesity treatment. The pill includes the same active ingredient — semaglutide — contained in NVO’s Wegovy and Ozempic injections (for type II diabetes). It has priced oral Wegovy at $149 per month (without insurance).

Eli Lilly LLY is Novo Nordisk’s arch-rival in the obesity space, which markets its tirzepatide (GLP-1) injections as Mounjaro (for type II diabetes) and Zepbound (for obesity). LLY has also filed a regulatory application seeking FDA approval for its oral GLP-1 drug, called orforglipron, for obesity. However, last week, the FDA reportedly delayed its decision on orforglipron to April 10 from the prior expectation of late March.

Daily oral obesity pills are expected to emerge as a more convenient and potentially lower-cost alternative to once-weekly injectables, such as Lilly’s Zepbound and Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy, lowering treatment burden and expanding patient adoption. With scalable manufacturing and broader appeal, Goldman Sachs estimates oral GLP-1 pills could generate about $22 billion in sales by 2030, or roughly 25% of a projected $95 billion global obesity drug market. Against this backdrop, Novo Nordisk’s launch of oral Wegovy gives it a first-mover advantage in the oral GLP-1 segment, positioning the company to regain market share from Lilly and drive incremental revenues. While analysts had expected Eli Lilly to close the gap quickly following a potential FDA approval of orforglipron in 2026, the latest delay puts LLY a step behind in the obesity pill race and gives Novo Nordisk additional time to strengthen its foothold in the oral obesity market.

Additionally, the regulatory body in the United Kingdom announced on Friday the approval of a 7.2 mg dose of Wegovy injection, which Novo Nordisk claims provides an option for “greater weight loss potential” than what is being offered by the available doses. This also likely contributed to the stock price gain as the improved efficacy profile could prompt physicians and patients to reconsider treatment choices, potentially shifting demand away from Lilly’s Zepbound toward the higher-dose Wegovy. Similar filings are also currently being reviewed in the United States and the EU. Favorable outcomes could improve NVO’s growth trajectory in the injectable treatment franchise.

Competition Heating Up in the Obesity Space

Eli Lilly is Novo Nordisk’s fierce competitor in the obesity space. Like NVO, Lilly is investing broadly in obesity and has several new molecules currently in clinical development with a range of oral and injectable medications with different mechanisms of action. Apart from orforglipron, LLY’s late-stage pipeline includes retatrutide, a GGG triagonist, as well as mid-stage candidates, including bimagrumab, eloralintide and mazdutide.

The obesity space has garnered much of the spotlight over the past year due to the sizeable and still underpenetrated market opportunity. Smaller biotech firms, like Viking Therapeutics VKTX, are also advancing GLP-1–based therapies to challenge the incumbents. Viking Therapeutics is developing its dual GIP/GLP-1 RA, VK2735, both as oral and subcutaneous formulations for the treatment of obesity. Last year, VKTX started two late-stage studies evaluating the subcutaneous formulation of VK2735. While one of these studies completed enrolment in November 2025 at a rapid pace, Viking Therapeutics expects to complete enrolment in the other study by the end of this quarter.

NVO Stock’s Price, Valuation & Estimates

In the past six months, Novo Nordisk shares have lost 4% against the industry’s 23.6% growth. The company has also underperformed the sector and the S&P 500 during the same time frame, as seen in the chart below.

HyperX will now serve as HP’s end-to-end gaming brand, spanning laptops, monitors, controllers and software, the company said.

The move brings together two names HP has spent years building — OMEN for gaming PCs and displays, and HyperX for accessories — under one banner as rivals such as Lenovo Group Ltd.’s Legion and Dell Technologies Inc.’s Alienware expand tightly integrated ecosystems.

“Gamers deserve a seamless experience that matches their passion, from the systems that power their worlds to the gear that connects them,” Josephine Tan, senior vice president and division president of personal systems gaming solutions at HP, said in a statement.

At the center of HP’s CES lineup is the HyperX OMEN MAX 16, a new flagship gaming laptop that the company says is its most powerful to date. The machine is designed to deliver up to 300 watts of total platform power, a jump from the previous generation, using Intel’s Core Ultra 200HX processors or next-generation AMD Ryzen AI chips paired with Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 5090 laptop GPU.

HP said the device relies on a fully internal cooling system, including a redesigned OMEN Tempest Cooling Pro architecture with a third fan, to sustain performance during extended gaming sessions.

The laptop also features a high-polling-rate keyboard aimed at reducing input lag and an OLED display option with a 240-hertz refresh rate.

Artificial intelligence plays a bigger role this generation. HP is positioning its OMEN AI software as a one-click optimisation tool that automatically tunes operating system, hardware and in-game settings to boost frame rates, removing the need for manual configuration.

The company also expanded its display portfolio with the HyperX OMEN OLED 34, a 34-inch ultrawide monitor built on next-generation V-stripe QD-OLED panel technology.

The monitor offers a 360-hertz refresh rate and near-instant response times, targeting competitive players as well as creators who need accurate color reproduction. Features such as USB-C power delivery and a built-in KVM switch are aimed at users juggling multiple devices.

On the peripherals side, HP introduced the HyperX Clutch Tachi, its first Xbox-licensed arcade-style controller. The leverless controller uses magnetic switches and supports extensive customization through HP’s NGENUITY software, including user-designed modifications produced via 3D printing.

HP also previewed a more experimental product: an in-development HyperX gaming headset created with neurotechnology startup Neurable.

The headset uses electroencephalography sensors and AI to interpret brain activity in real time, with the goal of helping players improve focus and accuracy — an early signal of how HP sees neuroscience intersecting with gaming.

The new products are expected to be available in the spring through HP’s website, with pricing to be announced closer to launch.

For HP, which has been working to revive demand in a sluggish PC market, gaming remains one of the more resilient segments.",https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Untitled-design-2025-10-22T132600.062-1.png,N,,2026-01-19 11:08:40.729385

Conclusion As we move through 2026, Johnson & Johnson is a company in the final stages of a profound metamorphosis.","As of January 19, 2026, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) stands as a radically different enterprise than the one most investors recognized just three years ago. Following the successful spin-off of its consumer health division, Kenvue, JNJ has fully transitioned into a high-growth, pure-play healthcare powerhouse focused exclusively on Innovative Medicine and Medical Technology (MedTech).

Today, the company is in the spotlight not for Band-Aids or Tylenol, but for its aggressive pivot into high-complexity surgical robotics, life-saving cardiovascular devices, and a pharmaceutical pipeline that is successfully navigating a historic ""patent cliff."" With its recent acquisitions of Abiomed and Shockwave Medical now fully integrated, and the highly anticipated Ottava robotic system nearing the final stages of regulatory approval, JNJ is positioned to define the next decade of healthcare delivery. This article explores how JNJ is balancing legacy litigation risks with a bold 2026 growth strategy.

Historical Background

Founded in 1886 by three brothers in New Brunswick, New Jersey, Johnson & Johnson’s early identity was forged in the development of sterile surgical dressings and the first commercial first-aid kits. For over a century, the company functioned as a decentralized conglomerate, often referred to as a ""broad-based"" healthcare giant.

The 20th century saw JNJ expand into pharmaceuticals (founding Janssen Pharmaceutica) and medical devices (acquiring DePuy and Ethicon). However, the most significant transformation in the company’s history occurred in August 2023, when JNJ finalized the separation of its Consumer Health business. This maneuver allowed the ""New J&J"" to shed its slower-growing retail segments to focus capital and R&D on the high-margin, high-innovation sectors of biologics and specialized medical hardware. This evolution marks a return to the company’s high-science roots while maintaining the operational discipline that has made it one of the few AAA-rated corporations in the world.

Business Model

Johnson & Johnson operates through two primary segments, having streamlined its operations to maximize agility and returns:

Innovative Medicine (formerly Pharmaceuticals): This segment generates approximately 65% of total revenue. It focuses on six core therapeutic areas: Oncology, Immunology, Neuroscience, Cardiovascular/Metabolism, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Infectious Diseases. The model relies on ""blockbuster"" biologics and a robust R&D engine to replace revenues lost to patent expirations.

Medical Technology (MedTech): Accounting for the remaining 35% of revenue, this segment is a global leader in Surgery, Orthopaedics, Vision, and Interventional Solutions. Following a string of multi-billion dollar acquisitions, MedTech is now heavily weighted toward cardiovascular care and digital/robotic surgery, which offer higher growth rates and stickier hospital relationships than traditional mechanical instruments.

The company's customer base is global, selling primarily to hospitals, healthcare providers, and wholesalers, with a growing emphasis on value-based care partnerships where JNJ products are integrated into hospital workflows to improve patient outcomes.

Stock Performance Overview

Over the past decade, JNJ has traditionally been viewed as a ""defensive"" stock—a core holding for income-seeking investors due to its status as a Dividend King. However, its price action has been a tale of two eras:

10-Year Horizon: JNJ has delivered steady, albeit market-trailing, returns as it navigated the litigation-heavy 2010s. The stock has been a reliable source of capital preservation, with dividends reinvested significantly boosting total returns.

5-Year Horizon: Performance was marked by the volatility of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent restructuring. The 2023 Kenvue split provided a ""special dividend"" in the form of shares, but the core JNJ ticker saw sideways movement as the market weighed the talc litigation against the new growth profile.

1-Year Horizon (2025–2026): Over the last twelve months, JNJ has begun to outperform the broader healthcare sector (XLV). As of January 2026, the market has started to reward the company for its double-digit growth in oncology and the successful integration of Shockwave Medical.

Financial Performance

Johnson & Johnson enters 2026 with a formidable balance sheet. Preliminary 2025 results indicate a resilient fiscal year:

Revenue: 2025 revenue is projected at approximately $93.2 billion, a 5.5% increase year-over-year.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): Adjusted operational EPS for 2025 is estimated at $10.85, reflecting the company’s ability to manage costs despite the biosimilar competition for its top-selling drug, Stelara.

Margins and Cash Flow: Operating margins remain healthy at nearly 30%, supported by the higher-margin pharmaceutical mix. The company generates roughly $20 billion in annual free cash flow, which powers its aggressive M&A strategy and dividend increases.

Valuation: Trading at approximately 15.5x forward earnings, JNJ continues to trade at a discount compared to peers like Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) or Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO), largely due to the ""litigation discount"" applied by institutional investors regarding talc liabilities.

Leadership and Management

CEO Joaquin Duato, who took the helm in early 2022, has been the primary architect of the ""New J&J."" His leadership is characterized by a ""MedTech-First"" investment philosophy and a decisive move to modernize the company's pharmaceutical portfolio.

Under Duato, the management team has become more aggressive in capital allocation. The board of directors, known for its conservative governance, has supported Duato’s shift toward high-risk, high-reward acquisitions like Abiomed ($16.6B) and Shockwave Medical ($13.1B). This leadership team is currently focused on two critical execution targets for 2026: the successful FDA submission of the Ottava robotic system and the ongoing spinoff of the slower-growing DePuy Synthes orthopaedics business.

Products, Services, and Innovations

Innovation is the lifeblood of the 2026 JNJ investment thesis. The company currently boasts 11 ""priority platforms"" that each generate over $1 billion in annual sales.

Oncology Dominance: Darzalex (for multiple myeloma) has become the crown jewel of the portfolio, surpassing $3 billion in quarterly sales in 2025. Meanwhile, Carvykti, a CAR-T cell therapy, is seeing nearly 90% growth as manufacturing scales and it moves into earlier-line treatments.

Cardiovascular MedTech: The acquisition of Shockwave Medical has introduced Intravascular Lithotripsy (IVL) to the JNJ portfolio—a game-changing technology that uses sonic pressure waves to crack calcified plaque in heart arteries. This, alongside Abiomed’s Impella heart pumps, makes JNJ a leader in interventional cardiology.

Robotics (Ottava): In January 2026, JNJ submitted its Ottava robotic surgery system for FDA De Novo classification. Unlike existing systems, Ottava features six arms integrated into a standard operating table, promising to save space and increase surgical flexibility.

Competitive Landscape

JNJ competes in a bifurcated landscape:

In Pharma: It faces intense competition from Merck (NYSE: MRK) in oncology and AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) in immunology. While JNJ lost exclusivity for Stelara in late 2024, its newer oral IL-23 peptide, Icotrokinra, is positioned to recapture market share in 2026.

In MedTech: Its primary rival in the robotic space is Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG). While Intuitive’s Da Vinci 5 remains the market leader, JNJ’s strategy is to leverage its deep relationships with hospitals (via its Ethicon surgical tools) to bundle the Ottava system, potentially disrupting Intuitive's dominance.

Industry and Market Trends

The healthcare sector in 2026 is being shaped by three macro drivers:

AI and Digital Surgery: JNJ is integrating AI into its Polyphonic digital ecosystem, which provides surgeons with real-time data and video analytics during procedures.

Consolidation of Care: Hospitals are increasingly looking for ""single-source"" partners. JNJ’s broad MedTech portfolio allows it to offer comprehensive solutions that smaller niche players cannot match.

The ""Patent Cliff"" Cycle: As large-cap pharma companies face losses of exclusivity, there is a sector-wide rush toward M&A. JNJ is a leader in this trend, having spent over $30 billion on acquisitions in the last three years.

Risks and Challenges

Despite its strengths, JNJ faces significant headwinds:

Talc Litigation: This remains the ""elephant in the room."" As of January 2026, over 67,000 cases remain in the federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL). Despite attempts to use the ""Texas Two-Step"" bankruptcy strategy, the courts have forced JNJ back into mediation. Recent multi-billion dollar verdicts in California and Maryland continue to worry shareholders.

Inflation Reduction Act (IRA): In 2026, the first wave of Medicare price negotiations takes effect. JNJ’s Stelara is among the impacted drugs, which may pressure margins even as biosimilar competition intensifies.

Execution Risk: The integration of Shockwave and the launch of Ottava are high-stakes maneuvers. Any regulatory delay in the Ottava approval could allow competitors to further entrench their market share.

Opportunities and Catalysts

Looking ahead at 2026, several catalysts could re-rate the stock:

2026 Earnings Guidance: During the January 2026 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, management targeted a 5% to 7% operational sales CAGR through 2030. If the company hits the high end of this range in its Q1 and Q2 reports, it could trigger a significant valuation multiple expansion.

DePuy Synthes Spinoff: The plan to spin off the orthopaedics business by late 2026 will further refine JNJ into a high-growth entity, potentially attracting a new class of ""growth"" investors.

Icotrokinra Launch: The expected 2026 launch of the first oral biologic-like treatment for psoriasis could be a multi-billion dollar catalyst for the Innovative Medicine segment.

Investor Sentiment and Analyst Coverage

Wall Street sentiment toward JNJ is currently ""Cautiously Bullish.""

Institutional Support: Large asset managers like Vanguard and BlackRock remain the largest holders, attracted by the 3% dividend yield and the AAA credit rating.

Analyst Views: Many analysts have moved JNJ to a ""Buy"" rating in late 2025, citing that the Stelara patent cliff is now ""baked in"" and that the MedTech growth is being undervalued.

Hedge Fund Interest: There has been a notable uptick in ""event-driven"" hedge fund interest, with some betting on a final global settlement of the talc litigation in 2026, which would remove the primary obstacle to the stock's appreciation.

Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

JNJ’s global footprint makes it sensitive to geopolitical shifts.

U.S. Policy: The 2026 implementation of the IRA is the most significant domestic policy shift. JNJ is actively lobbying for reforms while simultaneously pivoting its pipeline toward ""small molecule"" drugs that may be less impacted by certain IRA provisions.

China Market: JNJ continues to see China as a critical growth market for MedTech, though trade tensions and localized ""buy Chinese"" policies for medical devices present ongoing challenges for the Ethicon and DePuy units.

Conclusion

As we move through 2026, Johnson & Johnson is a company in the final stages of a profound metamorphosis. By divesting its consumer roots and doubling down on high-science pharma and interventional MedTech, it has positioned itself for a new era of growth.

Investors should watch two things closely in 2026: the regulatory progress of the Ottava robotic system and any definitive legal resolution to the talc litigation. If JNJ can clear its legal hurdles while executing its ambitious MedTech integration, it may finally break out of its defensive shell and reclaim its status as a premier growth-and-income engine in the healthcare sector. For the Finterra investor, JNJ represents a calculated bet on the future of medical innovation, underpinned by one of the strongest balance sheets in corporate history.

Lilly sells tirzepatide, sold under the name Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss.
In fact, my prediction is that 2026 will be the year of Eli Lilly.
Because the company may soon launch a key product: a weight loss pill.
Rival Novo recently won approval for its weight loss pill, but I'm confident Lilly's potential pill would win market share.","Eli Lilly (LLY +0.52%) has behaved more like a tech stock in recent years than like a pharma stock. Tech players are known to soar in the double and triple digits when the environment and corporate news are supportive. Pharmaceutical companies generally take a slower but steady path, and this is due to the fact that patients always need their medicines -- this supports revenue stability over time.

So, why has Lilly become a growth stock? The company has established leadership in an area of high demand: the weight loss drug market. Lilly sells tirzepatide, sold under the name Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss. Together, these drugs delivered more than $10 billion in revenue in the latest quarter and helped the company's overall revenue soar in the double digits.

I think this momentum is far from over. In fact, my prediction is that 2026 will be the year of Eli Lilly. And this is for one specific reason...

Lilly's blockbuster revenue

As mentioned, Lilly has generated blockbuster revenue thanks to its weight loss portfolio. Doctors have prescribed either of the injectable drugs for weight control, and demand has been high. It even resulted in drug shortages a couple of years ago until Lilly expanded its manufacturing capacity.

Demand continues to march on, and analysts predict that the obesity drug market will approach $100 billion by the end of this decade.

Right now, Lilly shares the market with Novo Nordisk, maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, but Lilly has advanced due to the efficacy of its drugs and its aggressive buildout of manufacturing infrastructure to meet demand.

A potential new launch

Why do I expect this year to be a big one for Lilly? Because the company may soon launch a key product: a weight loss pill. Lilly applied for the regulatory review of orforglipron late last year, and trial results have been solid. A pill could be a significant product for two reasons: It's more convenient for patients to take on the go and avoids a needle stick -- something many aren't too fond of. And for Lilly, a pill is cheaper and easier to manufacture than an injectable in pen format.

Rival Novo recently won approval for its weight loss pill, but I'm confident Lilly's potential pill would win market share. After taking Novo's Wegovy pill, patients must avoid food and drink for half an hour; Lilly's doesn't involve any dietary restrictions, making it extremely easy to fit into a daily routine.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F851055%2Fgettyimages-1320686310.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-19 11:08:36.783515

Chicago, IL – January 19, 2026 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses C.H. Robinson Worldwide CHRW, J.B. Hunt Transport Services JBHT, Saia SAIA and ArcBest Corp. ARCB.

Industry: Transportation - Trucking

Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2818625/3-truck-stocks-positioned-to-navigate-industry-challenges

The Zacks Transportation-Truck industry continues to face supply-chain disruptions, a weak freight scenario and a difficult macroeconomic backdrop marked by geopolitical tensions, still-high inflation levels and a shortage of truck drivers. The freight downturn is hurting players in other corners of the broader Zacks Transportation sector as well. For example, C.H. Robinson Worldwide is also hurt by this prolonged freight recession.

Despite these headwinds and the resulting demand uncertainty, the truck industry has demonstrated resilience, particularly among companies that focus on growth strategies and operational efficiency. Notable players expected to withstand these challenges include J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Saia and ArcBest Corp.

Industry Description

The Zacks Transportation - Truck industry houses truck operators transporting freight to diverse customers, mainly across North America. These companies provide full-truckload or less-than-truckload (“LTL”) services over the short, medium or long haul. The range of trucking services these companies provide includes dry-van, dedicated, refrigerated, flatbed and expedited. Some companies have an extensive fleet of company-owned tractors and trucks, and independent contractor trucks.

Besides trucking, most entities offer logistics and intermodal services as well as value-added services like container drayage, truckload brokerage, supply-chain consulting and warehousing. A few also offer asset-light services to other third-party logistics companies in the transportation sector.

3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Trucking Industry

Prolonged Freight Downturn Remains Worrisome: Although economic activities picked up from the pandemic gloom, lingering supply-chain disruptions continue to dent stocks in the industry. Below-par freight rates are also hurting the industry’s prospects. Highlighting weak freight demand, the Cass Freight Shipments Index declined 7.6% year over year in November 2025. This measure has deteriorated year over year each of the past nine months, which confirms the overall declining trend.

Cost Cuts to Boost Margins: The industry is facing input cost inflation, transport and logistics costs, and the impact of tariffs. Industry players are constantly implementing cost-reduction actions, which are likely to help sustain margins in this scenario. The companies are focused on streamlining their operations and realigning around high-growth key markets or customer segments to enhance performance.

Prolonged Truck-Driver Shortage: The persistent driver crisis in the trucking industry is worsening supply-chain challenges across the United States. Driver scarcity issues limit trucking capacity, making it difficult for trucking companies to meet increased freight demand. American Trucking Associations’ chief economist, Bob Costello, expects the trucking industry to be short of more than 160,000 drivers by 2030.

Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospects

The Zacks Transportation - Truck industry is a 12-stock group. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #234, which places it in the bottom 2% of 243 Zacks industries.

The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates murky near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimate for 2026 has decreased 30.9% on a year-over-year basis.

Before we present a few stocks from the industry that you may want to hold on to, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and the valuation picture.

Truck Industry Underperforms the SP 500 and the Sector

The Zacks Transportation-Truck industry has lagged the Zacks S&P 500 composite as well as the Transportation sector over the past year.

The industry has declined 3.7% over this period compared with the S&P 500's appreciation of 18.1% and the broader sector’s uptick of 1.4%.

Truck Industry's Current Valuation

Based on the trailing 12-month EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), a commonly used multiple for valuing trucking stocks, the industry is currently trading at 14.37X compared with the S&P 500’s 18.99X. The figure is above the sector’s EV/EBITDA of 10.83X.

Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 16.3X and as low as 7.83X, with the median being 12.31X.

Davos, Switzerland — Water.org, Gap Inc., Amazon, Starbucks, and Ecolab today announced the launch of Get Blue™. The global initiative is designed to accelerate access to safe water and sanitation by aligning business leadership, consumer engagement, and capital behind Water.org’s proven, market-driven solutions, reaching families and communities in need around the world.

Today, 2.1 billion people—nearly one in four worldwide—still lack access to safe water, while 3.4 billion people lack access to safe sanitation. When families have access to safe water and sanitation at home, the benefits are immediate and lasting–supporting improved health, time gained for education and income, and opportunity.

Get Blue is designed to be a long-term platform that enables companies across consumer and business- to-business sectors to treat water as a core operating and market issue. By recognizing water as a growing business imperative, the campaign gives enterprises a way to turn leadership, collaboration, and customer participation into sustained investment in solutions that Bring Water Home™.

“At Gap Inc., we bridge gaps to create a better world — and the gap between people who lack access to water, let alone clean water, is far too big. We believe everyone should have access to clean water,” said Richard Dickson, president and CEO of Gap Inc. “Through the launch of Get Blue, we’re uniting some of the world’s most influential brands behind a shared mission. As an industry, we have both an opportunity and a responsibility to lead—using our scale, creativity, and influence to turn awareness into action. By coming together, we can help make safe water accessible to every person on the planet and demonstrate what’s possible when our industry steps up as a force for good.”

Water is foundational to business performance, underpinning the systems and supply chains companies rely on and the communities they serve. As the water crisis intensifies, more companies are advancing water stewardship, reducing operational water use, managing supply-chain risk, investing in access and conservation projects, and supporting community education.

“Solving the global water crisis is possible if the business community comes together and focuses on measurable change. Water sits at the center of opportunity in the global economy. Get Blue gives companies a way to lead on an issue their industries depend on, and to help scale solutions that are already reaching millions of people who need them. This is the kind of leadership required to end the water crisis within our lifetimes,” said Gary White, CEO and co-founder of Water.org.

Water.org was founded by Gary White and Matt Damon with a shared belief that access to safe water and sanitation is foundational to health and opportunity. Through the organization’s WaterCredit solution, families use small, affordable loans to access safe water and sanitation at home. To date, Water.org has reached 85 million people with lasting access to safe water or sanitation, working toward an ambitious goal of reaching 200 million people by 2030. The Get Blue campaign will help Water.org extend its reach as part of a broader portfolio of strategies.

Get Blue will mobilize scalable, partner-enabled capital through corporate brands, enterprise partnerships, and integrated business and consumer activations. A portion of proceeds will drive funding support to Water.org’s market-driven solutions, helping families finance, maintain, and sustain their own long-term water and sanitation solutions.

The launch to consumers and commercial customers is planned for later in 2026, with Gap Inc., Amazon, Starbucks, and Ecolab already developing activations across fashion, food and beverage, and technology—demonstrating the initiative’s scale, cross-sector collaboration and cultural reach.

""I've been fortunate to work with Gary and Matt for years and have seen firsthand the transformative impact of their work,"" said Kara Hurst, chief sustainability officer at Amazon. ""Access to safe water is foundational to healthy communities and building a more sustainable business. Through Get Blue, we're using Amazon's scale and innovation to show what's possible when companies work together toward a common good.""

“The water crisis requires sustained, meaningful action, and Get Blue is an example of what the private sector can do to help raise awareness and work together to drive solutions and impact. This approach builds on Amazon's aim to be a responsible water steward in communities—and water stressed regions— where it operates, as it works to reduce water use across its operations through investment, innovation and implementation. Globally, Amazon has announced more than 40 water replenishment projects that are expected to return upwards of 18 billion liters of water annually, once complete. As part of that work, Amazon set a goal to return more water to communities than it uses across its data centers by 2030, and is already more than halfway to meeting that goal—and the company set a goal to return more water than it uses across its entire operations in India by 2027,” Hurst added.

Each of the founding partner companies has prioritized water as an issue that is important to their business, their stakeholders, and their communities. Each also brings a distinct value proposition and perspective to helping everyone, everywhere gain access to safe water.

“Clean water is essential to healthy families and communities,” said Marika McCauley Sine, chief sustainability officer, The Starbucks Coffee Company. “In some coffee, tea, and cocoa farming regions, people lack access to clean water and sanitation. For Starbucks, helping these communities thrive is both the right thing to do and strengthens our business and supply chain. By partnering with Water.org and investing $50 million in WaterEquity, we’re helping bring clean water and sanitation to those who need it most. So far, we’ve proudly helped more than 700,000 people. And by teaming up with Get Blue, with other companies we can make a meaningful difference for more people and the planet, together.”

“Ecolab is built on the belief that when we help our customers use water smarter, we unlock both business growth, value and social impact,” said Christophe Beck, chairman and CEO, Ecolab. “Through Get Blue, we’re joining forces with global leaders to expand access to safe water and strengthen the communities where we all operate.”

“Get Blue is already starting to bring together a community that recognizes everyone’s individual roles in helping end the global water crisis. When brands especially use their influence this way, progress proliferates — and that’s exactly what this movement is designed to do,” said Matt Damon, co-founder of Water.org.

Water.org is inviting companies across industries to join Get Blue and help tackle the water crisis. To learn more about partnership opportunities, contact Ben Albert at balbert@water.org.

“The future is on the cloud,” Arfelli concluded.","Dario Arfelli leads global marketing for Imaging Informatics at Philips, where cloud imaging is being framed less as an infrastructure shift and more as an operational correction. In conversations with clients and prospects, the discussion is more about time saved and access gained rather than the IT benefits of moving to the cloud.

Cloud Imaging, Workforce Pressure, and Time Back for Care

Radiology is becoming untethered…in a good way. More radiologists are reading remotely, freeing up valuable space in healthcare facilities.

As Arfelli puts it, “Before, radiologists were locked to the physical radiology department,” but now they have the freedom to operate from anywhere – a remote office, from home or in a different state. This is only possible with secure, reliable, cloud enterprise imaging.

The reliability of cloud infrastructure is one of the reasons Arfelli says the theme of conversations with prospects and clients has changed. “It’s all about time,” Arfelli said. “Radiologists don’t have time. IT departments don’t have time. Philips cloud imaging is giving back time to both.” It is also giving provider organizations the freedom to operate in a manner that optimizes access for patients without burning out radiologists.

“We need a revolution,” claims Arfelli. “We need to change the way we are working in cardiology, radiology…any ‘ology’. So we need to give the tools to our clients to get to the next level. We listen to all our customers and they told us that what they need most is flexibility. They need to work from home, they need to have all the tools available that they would have in the office.”

Philips is continuing to add to its cloud capabilities to ensure radiologists can operate as efficiently as possible. “The future is on the cloud,” Arfelli concluded.

By selecting SabreMosaic Travel Marketplace, these companies are responding to the growing demand for unified access to modern airline content, including NDC. Sabre now offers the industry's broadest NDC airline coverage, with recent global launches including British Airways, Iberia, Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, Emirates, and a pipeline of more than 60 additional carriers coming online. This breadth allows agencies and corporates using these five leading travel technology providers to access NDC offers, continuous pricing, bundled fares, and new ancillaries in the same environment as traditional and low-cost carrier content, without the need for separate direct connections or custom integrations for each airline. Each of the five providers will enable SabreMosaic Travel Marketplace content progressively, following their own roadmaps, creating flexibility while opening the pathway for future activations.

The technical foundation for this expansion is Sabre's structured approach to NDC integrations, which standardizes airline-specific nuances. Rather than building and maintaining one-off connections to individual airlines, these providers use Sabre's harmonized APIs to present multi-source content, including NDC, consistently. The capabilities span end-to-end workflows, and enable execution of all post-booking actions, cancellation, void, refund, exchange, seat selection, and ancillary management, regardless of the airline.

For agencies and buyers, the result is a significant reduction in manual workarounds, fewer errors, and faster onboarding of new airline content. NDC content sits alongside traditional and low-cost carrier options in unified displays, allowing agents to compare options like-for-like and select the offer that best fits traveler needs and program rules. Corporate buyers retain their policy controls and duty-of-care visibility when their online booking tools are powered through Sabre. They also gain access to airline features such as continuous pricing and exclusive promotions without introducing parallel systems or retraining teams.

""Lleego, Vibe, TPConnects, Ypsilon.net, and Mesh have gone beyond connectivity to deliver the book-and-service depth agencies expect,"" said Miguel Gonzalez, Senior Director Global Commercial Planning, Management Consulting and Partner Solutions at Sabre. ""Their customers can use NDC from carriers we've launched across the marketplace, and they can do it inside the same agent and corporate tools they trust today. That is how you scale NDC, pairing coverage leadership with workflows that protect efficiency.""

By expanding their NDC connection through Sabre, these partners help agencies and corporates to adopt modern airline content without adding systems. The technical lift shifts from bespoke, airline-by-airline builds to a unified implementation that preserves servicing parity, compliance, and reporting. The result is faster activation, fewer workarounds, and better traveler outcomes.

Global technology group e& and IBM announced a strategic collaboration to advance towards an enterprise-grade agentic AI foundation at e&, starting with policy, risk, and compliance. Unveiled at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, the initiative reflects e&’s move beyond traditional natural language processing (NLP)-based chatbots toward governed, action-oriented AI embedded in core enterprise systems.

e& and IBM have introduced an agentic AI solution built on IBM watsonx Orchestrate – a product offering more than 500 tools and customizable, domain-specific agents from IBM and its partners – to help employees and auditors quickly access and interpret legal, regulatory, and compliance information. Integrated with IBM OpenPages and the broader watsonx portfolio, the solution delivers clear, traceable responses aligned with enterprise governance requirements.

A joint proof of concept delivered by IBM, GBM (Gulf Business Machines) and e& within eight weeks demonstrated how agentic AI can operate at enterprise scale under real-world conditions.

Marketing Technology News: MarTech Interview with Miguel Lopes, CPO @ TrafficGuard

IBM’s Client Engineering team led the design and integration of the agentic AI solution, with GBM supporting delivery through project coordination and deep familiarity with e&’s OpenPages and watsonx Assistant environment. The work showcased AI capabilities that move beyond traditional question-and-answer tools, enabling reasoning and action while remaining aligned with e&’s governance, risk, and compliance framework.

“Our ambition is to move beyond isolated AI use cases toward enterprise-scale agentic AI that is trusted, governed, and deeply integrated into how the organization operates,” said Hatem Dowidar, Group CEO, e&. “By collaborating with IBM, we are embedding intelligence directly into our risk and compliance processes, enabling faster decisions, consistent policy interpretation, and a foundation for broader agentic AI adoption across the enterprise.”

IBM watsonx Orchestrate enables agentic AI that goes beyond chat-based interactions, allowing AI agents to reason, orchestrate tasks, and integrate with enterprise systems under governance controls. For e&, it provides a foundation for trusted, explainable AI that can scale across compliance and other enterprise domains. It helps to streamline compliance tasks, reduce response times, and enable 24/7 self-service access across the organization.

The initiative also aligns natively with watsonx.governance, already in use at e&, providing a strong foundation for AI governance, explainability, and compliance by design. By embedding agentic AI directly into the OpenPages governance, risk, and compliance platform, this represents one of the early enterprise-grade agentic AI implementations in the region, demonstrating how AI can support trusted, human-led decision-making under regulatory and operational requirements.

The deployment also demonstrates the flexibility of IBM’s AI and model gateway approach, enabling large language models to run across hybrid environments, including customer-managed infrastructure, while remaining governed under enterprise controls.

During that time, your company agrees to pay you three-fourths of your salary, every single year, until you retire.
He went to court because he hadn't received a pay raise during those 15 years away.
Ian Clifford, a software employee in the UK, went on sick leave from IBM in September 2008 due to mental health reasons.
The judge stated that the lifelong payment plan itself was a ""very substantial benefit""—a form of ""favourable treatment"" that only a disabled employee in his situation could get.","Imagine being on sick leave from your job. Now, imagine that leave lasts for 15 years. During that time, your company agrees to pay you three-fourths of your salary, every single year, until you retire. For most, this would be an unexpected safety net.

But for one IT employee, it wasn't enough. He went to court because he hadn't received a pay raise during those 15 years away.

This is the unusual true story of Ian Clifford and the tech giant IBM.

Ian Clifford, a software employee in the UK, went on sick leave from IBM in September 2008 due to mental health reasons. His absence continued, and he was later diagnosed with a serious illness.

By 2013, after being off work for five full years, Clifford did something surprising. He filed a formal complaint against IBM. His main issue? In all those years of not working, his salary had remained frozen. He had not been given a single increment or pay rise.

Later in 2013, IBM and Clifford reached a settlement. He was placed on the company's Sickness and Accident Plan. This was a major deal. The plan guaranteed he would receive 75% of his last drawn salary every year until he turned 65.

Based on his salary then, this meant a steady yearly payment of over £54,000 (roughly Rs 54 lakh at the time). Newspapers calculated that from 2008 until his retirement, he could receive over £1.5 million (multiple crores of rupees) without working another day. He was even paid extra to settle holiday pay claims. In return, he agreed to close the matter.

Most would see this as a secure, lifelong arrangement. But nearly ten years later, in 2022, Clifford sued IBM again. He took them to an employment tribunal, this time claiming disability discrimination.

His argument? By not increasing his fixed yearly payments for inflation since 2013, IBM was treating him unfairly because of his disability. He said his income's value was shrinking as prices rose.

In 2023, the tribunal judge dismissed his case. The court's reasoning was straightforward.

The judge stated that the lifelong payment plan itself was a ""very substantial benefit""—a form of ""favourable treatment"" that only a disabled employee in his situation could get. Other, non-disabled employees did not have access to such a plan.

A key line from the ruling explains it simply: You cannot claim discrimination for not getting extra benefits on top of a special benefit created just for you.

The court saw the guaranteed annual payment not as a frozen salary, but as a protected financial support system, which was in itself a privilege.

For any working professional, especially in India's competitive IT sector where appraisals are keenly awaited, this story seems almost unbelievable. It shows how the lines between a company's support, an employee's rights, and a sense of fairness can sometimes lead to the most unexpected courtroom battles.",https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2026/01/20260119071614_Man-on-Sick-Leave-for-15-Years.png,N,,2026-01-19 11:09:03.920638

Media reports have recently speculated about interactions between Delfin and UniCredit concerning Delfin’s stake in Monte Paschi, following the latter’s acquisition of Mediobanca.

This follows UniCredit’s withdrawal from its plan to purchase Banco BPM over unmet conditions related to the golden power authorisation.

In a statement to Bloomberg, a spokesperson from Delfin said: “Delfin’s board of directors announces that it has never discussed the possibility of divesting its financial stake” in Monte de Paschi.

“Delfin denies that negotiations are underway with UniCredit or other operators aimed at the total or partial sale of its stake” in the Italian bank.

In a statement, Delfin reiterated its “full support” for Monte Paschi’s current leadership.

Monte de Paschi completed its acquisition of Mediobanca in September, with Delfin’s holdings in Mediobanca exchanged for shares in Monte Paschi.

However, Italian prosecutors are probing Monte de Paschi CEO Luigi Lovaglio and major shareholders Delfin & Caltagirone for alleged market manipulation and regulatory obstruction in the Mediobanca takeover.

The actions of Lovaglio and Delfin chairman Francesco Milleri are under review by authorities in Milan amid allegations that they masked coordinated efforts to secure control over Mediobanca.

Monte Paschi said it “is confident it can provide all the necessary information to clarify the correctness of its actions”, added Bloomberg.

Meanwhile, Delfin maintained its board “always acted in full compliance with market rules and laws.”

OTR appoints Oscar Torres as Chief Executive Officer

OTR has appointed Oscar Torres as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective 5 January 2026, marking a key leadership transition as the company positions itself for its next phase of development. The appointment brings to OTR a senior executive with more than 25 years of leadership experience in private equity–backed businesses and a strong track record in the global aerospace aftermarket.

Torres has spent the majority of his career at Kellstrom Aerospace, a major distributor and technical services provider to the aviation industry. During his time at the company, he progressed through a series of senior leadership roles, including Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and ultimately Chief Executive Officer. This breadth of experience across finance, operations and executive management has given him a comprehensive understanding of the commercial and operational drivers of the aerospace aftermarket.

While at Kellstrom Aerospace, Torres led a range of initiatives aimed at improving operational performance and delivering sustainable, long-term growth. He was closely involved in shaping the company’s strategic direction and played a central role in multiple acquisitions and divestitures, helping to strengthen Kellstrom’s market position and expand its global footprint. Under his leadership, the business further established itself as a key supply-chain solutions provider to airlines, original equipment manufacturers, maintenance, repair and overhaul organisations, and aircraft lessors around the world.

Torres’ appointment is seen as a strategic move that aligns with OTR’s ambitions within the aerospace aftermarket, particularly as the sector continues to adapt to changing customer demands and supply-chain dynamics. His experience working in private equity–backed environments is expected to be especially relevant as OTR pursues growth opportunities while maintaining operational discipline.

But as we enter 2026, a palpable shift is underway. Companies are moving beyond the initial excitement, demanding tangible results from their AI investments rather than riding on promises alone. This transition marks a critical juncture where hype gives way to scrutiny, with businesses prioritizing measurable outcomes over speculative potential.

Recent reports highlight this evolution. According to a study by the Capgemini Research Institute, featured in TechRadar, AI adoption has matured from broad experimentation to targeted implementation. The research, based on surveys of over 1,000 executives, reveals that while 80% of organizations have deployed AI in at least one function, the focus now is on scaling these initiatives to deliver real value. Gone are the days of pouring billions into unproven pilots; instead, firms are honing in on applications that boost efficiency, cut costs, and drive revenue.

This pivot isn’t isolated. Industry observers note that the initial wave of AI enthusiasm, sparked by breakthroughs like ChatGPT in 2022, led to inflated expectations. Millions flocked to interactive tools, enchanting users and sparking economic ripples. Yet, as MIT Technology Review detailed in its analysis of 2025’s reckoning, disillusionment was inevitable. The publication outlined four key ways to frame this correction, emphasizing that while AI’s capabilities are real, the overhyping created a bubble ripe for bursting.

The Investment Reckoning

Investors, once eager to fund any AI-related venture, are now exercising caution. Posts on X from financial analysts, such as those warning of a potential bubble pop, underscore a growing sentiment that the sector’s spending—estimated at $400 billion annually—far outpaces its $60 billion in returns. One prominent thread highlighted Forrester’s prediction of a 2026 market correction, with companies delaying 25% of planned AI expenditures by a year due to underwhelming profit margins.

This caution is echoed in broader market trends. TechCrunch forecasts that 2026 will see AI transition to pragmatism, with advancements in smaller models, reliable agents, and physical AI designed for practical use. The article points to new architectures and world models as harbingers of more grounded progress, moving away from the grandiose visions that dominated headlines.

Moreover, big investors are redirecting focus toward infrastructure rather than flashy applications. A Forbes survey revealed that institutional players see opportunities in robotics and supporting tech, even amid bubbles, signaling a preference for stable, long-term bets over volatile hype cycles.

Challenges in Scaling AI

Despite the optimism for pragmatic AI, scaling remains a formidable hurdle. Many enterprises report that only a fraction of their AI projects yield widespread value. BCG’s findings, referenced in various X discussions, indicate just 5% of executives have seen significant returns, prompting a reevaluation of strategies. This mirrors the experiences during past tech frenzies, like the blockchain boom, where initial fervor gave way to plateauing interest.

The Conversation draws parallels, noting that AI, much like blockchain, will likely stabilize rather than fizzle out entirely. The piece argues that while hype dies, underlying utility persists, provided companies adapt to realistic timelines and applications.

On the ground, firms are grappling with integration issues. Executives fear committing to the “wrong model,” leading to hesitation in deployments. X posts from industry insiders describe a “stall mode” in enterprise AI, with budget scrutiny and risk aversion reminiscent of post-2008 caution in digital advertising. This environment demands not just technological prowess but also robust governance to ensure trust and accountability.

Governance and Global Pressures

As AI moves into widespread use, governance emerges as a linchpin for success. Council on Foreign Relations warns that 2026 could be decisive, with policymakers under pressure to address adoption, strategic competition, and ethical concerns. The analysis stresses that AI’s future hinges on balancing innovation with regulation, especially in critical sectors.

Internationally, paradoxes abound. The World Economic Forum explores how human factors—idiosyncrasies in expectations and economics—will shape AI’s trajectory. As expectations outpace reality, the forum suggests that technical capability alone won’t suffice; societal and economic viability must align.

Investment hype often lags behind research by three to five years, according to experts cited in WebProNews. This disconnect leads to overvaluation of outdated technologies like large language models, while emerging areas like agentic AI are overlooked, potentially missing key opportunities.

Market Signals and Stock Movements

Stock performances are telling indicators of this shift. Microsoft’s shares dipped 10% recently, attributed to ballooning infrastructure costs and shrinking AI enthusiasm, as reported by Windows Central. Executives offloading stock underscores a murky outlook, with competition from players like Google adding pressure.

Conversely, some voices on X remain bullish. Influential figures predict massive valuations and daily investments reaching $3 billion, painting a picture of AI as an unstoppable force despite current headwinds. Yet, these optimistic takes contrast with warnings of mass layoffs and chatbot fatigue, as detailed in satirical yet pointed X threads envisioning a 2026 fraught with frustration.

Predictions from academic sources, such as Johns Hopkins, outline what policymakers should anticipate, emphasizing scalable production over pilots. The university’s experts stress industry-specific implementations to bridge the gap between hype and value.

Pathways to Pragmatic Progress

To navigate this new phase, companies are advised to reset expectations. MIT Technology Review, in a follow-up piece, calls for an “antidote” to overwhelming hype, advocating for measured approaches that prioritize real-world impact over spectacle.

Trends for 2026, as per iTnews, include a focus on cost-effective, trustworthy agents and tailored solutions. This shift promises to move AI from a buzzword to a business essential, provided organizations invest in the right areas.

X sentiment reflects a mixed bag: while some decry an impending bubble burst with creditors demanding returns on trillions invested, others highlight AI’s infancy and potential for “AI or die” scenarios where adaptation is key to survival. One thread notes that 95% of generative AI projects fail to scale, backing the “AI or die” reality for S&P 500 companies facing shortened lifespans.

Emerging Opportunities Amid Caution

Amid the caution, opportunities emerge in niche areas. Infrastructure investments, as Forbes previously noted, attract institutional money betting on long-term stability. Robotics and physical AI, highlighted in TechCrunch’s outlook, could redefine manufacturing and services, offering concrete returns.

Podcasts and discussions, like those from Marathon Asset Management shared on X, emphasize the unprecedented scale of AI investments but question uncertain returns. Key points include the need for clear monetization paths and the risks of over-reliance on energy-intensive data centers.

Experts warn that without proving ROI, many initiatives will falter. Capgemini Research Institute’s findings in TechRadar reinforce that maturity in AI means prioritizing strategic realism over unchecked enthusiasm, a lesson drawn from years of trial and error.

Human Elements in AI’s Evolution

Ultimately, AI’s path forward depends on human ingenuity as much as algorithms. The World Economic Forum’s paradoxes remind us that economic viability and technical prowess must converge with societal needs.

In educational circles, Johns Hopkins’ predictions urge a focus on policy automation and business processes, where AI’s strengths shine. X users debating AI’s power in enterprise settings argue that beyond consumer interfaces, its impact on systems and efficiency is profound.

As 2026 unfolds, the technology sector stands at a crossroads. Balancing innovation with pragmatism will determine whether AI fulfills its promise or joins the ranks of overhyped trends. Industry insiders must heed these signals, investing wisely to harness AI’s true potential while sidestepping the pitfalls of past bubbles. With governance strengthening and markets demanding proof, the era of blind faith in AI is closing, ushering in one defined by results.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/article-6708-1768800264.jpeg,N,,2026-01-19 09:01:32.150991

It is also forecast to contribute approximately 2% in inorganic revenue growth to IBM's software segment.
For context, IBM's third-quarter 2025 results surpassed expectations, with earnings per share of $2.65 beating the consensus estimate of $2.45.
Launch of ""IBM Sovereign Core"" Platform On January 15, IBM introduced ""IBM Sovereign Core,"" described by the company as its first ""AI-ready"" software platform focused on digital sovereignty.","IBM shares are entering a decisive period marked by regulatory progress on a major acquisition, a series of analyst upgrades, and the imminent release of its fourth-quarter 2025 financial results. Despite a recent consolidation phase since the start of the year, the stock remains up approximately 2.35%, building on a substantial gain of around 39% throughout 2025.

Market experts have shown increased confidence in IBM's trajectory at the start of the year, with several prominent institutions raising their price targets.

Jefferies upgraded its rating on IBM from ""Hold"" to ""Buy"" on January 5, lifting its price objective from $300 to $360. The firm cited improved visibility for software growth and sustained momentum in the Red Hat business.

RBC Capital Markets reaffirmed its ""Outperform"" rating on the same day, increasing its target from $300 to $350.

Bank of America maintained its ""Buy"" recommendation on January 13, raising its target price from $315 to $335, driven primarily by an enhanced free cash flow outlook.

According to consensus data from MarketBeat, the average analyst rating currently stands at ""Moderate Buy,"" with a mean price target of $301.85. IBM shares are trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of roughly 36.4, with a market capitalization of approximately $284.5 billion.

Confluent Acquisition Advances Past Key Hurdle

A significant milestone has been reached in IBM's planned $11 billion all-cash acquisition of Confluent. The mandatory waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act expired on January 12, clearing a major U.S. regulatory hurdle for the deal, which offers $31 per share for the data-streaming specialist.

The next critical step is Confluent's special shareholder meeting scheduled for February 12, where investors will vote on the transaction. Final proxy materials were distributed to Confluent stockholders on January 9. IBM anticipates closing the acquisition around mid-2026.

Strategically, the purchase is designed to bolster IBM's data-streaming capabilities and complement its existing software portfolio, including Red Hat, watsonx, and HashiCorp. Analysts project the deal will positively impact EBITDA and free cash flow through scale benefits and higher margins. It is also forecast to contribute approximately 2% in inorganic revenue growth to IBM's software segment.

Quarterly Earnings and 2026 Guidance in Focus

All eyes are on IBM's upcoming fourth-quarter 2025 report, scheduled for release on January 28 at 5:00 PM Eastern Time. The presentation is expected to provide formal guidance for the full year 2026, details on the Confluent integration timeline, and updates on software segment performance.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying IBM?

Bank of America anticipates slightly weaker pre-tax margins for Q4, as IBM is likely to book a charge of around $400 million related to a ""workforce rebalancing"" initiative. Nevertheless, the bank forecasts a full-year 2025 margin improvement of 70 basis points compared to the prior year, though this would be below the company's own guidance of more than 100 basis points.

For context, IBM's third-quarter 2025 results surpassed expectations, with earnings per share of $2.65 beating the consensus estimate of $2.45. Revenue reached $16.33 billion, a 9.1% year-over-year increase.

Bank of America's 2026 Projections

Analyst Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America expects IBM to project roughly 10% constant-currency growth in software for fiscal 2026, low single-digit percentage growth in consulting, and largely stable infrastructure segment performance. This translates to an estimated total revenue growth of 5%, with 4% being organic.

For the current 2025 fiscal year, Bank of America models a free cash flow of $14.0 billion, targeting approximately $15 billion for 2026.

Launch of ""IBM Sovereign Core"" Platform

On January 15, IBM introduced ""IBM Sovereign Core,"" described by the company as its first ""AI-ready"" software platform focused on digital sovereignty. The offering targets organizations that need to run AI workloads under their own control and within specific legal jurisdictions.

Built on a Red Hat open-source foundation, a tech preview of the platform is slated for February 2026, with general availability planned for mid-year. For the launch, IBM is partnering with European IT service providers Cegeka (Belgium, Netherlands) and Computacenter (Germany).

Davos, Switzerland — Water.org, Gap Inc., Amazon, Starbucks, and Ecolab today announced the launch of Get Blue™. The global initiative is designed to accelerate access to safe water and sanitation by aligning business leadership, consumer engagement, and capital behind Water.org’s proven, market-driven solutions, reaching families and communities in need around the world.

Today, 2.1 billion people—nearly one in four worldwide—still lack access to safe water, while 3.4 billion people lack access to safe sanitation. When families have access to safe water and sanitation at home, the benefits are immediate and lasting–supporting improved health, time gained for education and income, and opportunity.

Get Blue is designed to be a long-term platform that enables companies across consumer and business- to-business sectors to treat water as a core operating and market issue. By recognizing water as a growing business imperative, the campaign gives enterprises a way to turn leadership, collaboration, and customer participation into sustained investment in solutions that Bring Water Home™.

“At Gap Inc., we bridge gaps to create a better world — and the gap between people who lack access to water, let alone clean water, is far too big. We believe everyone should have access to clean water,” said Richard Dickson, president and CEO of Gap Inc. “Through the launch of Get Blue, we’re uniting some of the world’s most influential brands behind a shared mission. As an industry, we have both an opportunity and a responsibility to lead—using our scale, creativity, and influence to turn awareness into action. By coming together, we can help make safe water accessible to every person on the planet and demonstrate what’s possible when our industry steps up as a force for good.”

Water is foundational to business performance, underpinning the systems and supply chains companies rely on and the communities they serve. As the water crisis intensifies, more companies are advancing water stewardship, reducing operational water use, managing supply-chain risk, investing in access and conservation projects, and supporting community education.

“Solving the global water crisis is possible if the business community comes together and focuses on measurable change. Water sits at the center of opportunity in the global economy. Get Blue gives companies a way to lead on an issue their industries depend on, and to help scale solutions that are already reaching millions of people who need them. This is the kind of leadership required to end the water crisis within our lifetimes,” said Gary White, CEO and co-founder of Water.org.

Water.org was founded by Gary White and Matt Damon with a shared belief that access to safe water and sanitation is foundational to health and opportunity. Through the organization’s WaterCredit solution, families use small, affordable loans to access safe water and sanitation at home. To date, Water.org has reached 85 million people with lasting access to safe water or sanitation, working toward an ambitious goal of reaching 200 million people by 2030. The Get Blue campaign will help Water.org extend its reach as part of a broader portfolio of strategies.

Get Blue will mobilize scalable, partner-enabled capital through corporate brands, enterprise partnerships, and integrated business and consumer activations. A portion of proceeds will drive funding support to Water.org’s market-driven solutions, helping families finance, maintain, and sustain their own long-term water and sanitation solutions.

The launch to consumers and commercial customers is planned for later in 2026, with Gap Inc., Amazon, Starbucks, and Ecolab already developing activations across fashion, food and beverage, and technology—demonstrating the initiative’s scale, cross-sector collaboration and cultural reach.

""I've been fortunate to work with Gary and Matt for years and have seen firsthand the transformative impact of their work,"" said Kara Hurst, chief sustainability officer at Amazon. ""Access to safe water is foundational to healthy communities and building a more sustainable business. Through Get Blue, we're using Amazon's scale and innovation to show what's possible when companies work together toward a common good.""

“The water crisis requires sustained, meaningful action, and Get Blue is an example of what the private sector can do to help raise awareness and work together to drive solutions and impact. This approach builds on Amazon's aim to be a responsible water steward in communities—and water stressed regions— where it operates, as it works to reduce water use across its operations through investment, innovation and implementation. Globally, Amazon has announced more than 40 water replenishment projects that are expected to return upwards of 18 billion liters of water annually, once complete. As part of that work, Amazon set a goal to return more water to communities than it uses across its data centers by 2030, and is already more than halfway to meeting that goal—and the company set a goal to return more water than it uses across its entire operations in India by 2027,” Hurst added.

Each of the founding partner companies has prioritized water as an issue that is important to their business, their stakeholders, and their communities. Each also brings a distinct value proposition and perspective to helping everyone, everywhere gain access to safe water.

“Clean water is essential to healthy families and communities,” said Marika McCauley Sine, chief sustainability officer, The Starbucks Coffee Company. “In some coffee, tea, and cocoa farming regions, people lack access to clean water and sanitation. For Starbucks, helping these communities thrive is both the right thing to do and strengthens our business and supply chain. By partnering with Water.org and investing $50 million in WaterEquity, we’re helping bring clean water and sanitation to those who need it most. So far, we’ve proudly helped more than 700,000 people. And by teaming up with Get Blue, with other companies we can make a meaningful difference for more people and the planet, together.”

“Ecolab is built on the belief that when we help our customers use water smarter, we unlock both business growth, value and social impact,” said Christophe Beck, chairman and CEO, Ecolab. “Through Get Blue, we’re joining forces with global leaders to expand access to safe water and strengthen the communities where we all operate.”

“Get Blue is already starting to bring together a community that recognizes everyone’s individual roles in helping end the global water crisis. When brands especially use their influence this way, progress proliferates — and that’s exactly what this movement is designed to do,” said Matt Damon, co-founder of Water.org.

Water.org is inviting companies across industries to join Get Blue and help tackle the water crisis. To learn more about partnership opportunities, contact Ben Albert at balbert@water.org.

The company is slated to announce its fiscal Q4 2025 earnings results before market open on Feb. 10. Ahead of this event, analysts expect Ecolab to report an EPS of $2.06, a 13.8% rise from $1.81 in the year-ago quarter.

The measures aim to encourage greater use of public transport, shared mobility, and electric vehicles, reducing reliance on private cars as pollution mitigation remains a key priority for the city.

To support increased adoption of the Delhi Metro, Uber is offering a first free Metro ride worth up to ₹25 for users booking Metro tickets through the Uber app for the first time. This offer will be available until January 21. By integrating Metro ticketing into its app, Uber aims to simplify access to public transport, reduce queues at stations, and make daily commuting more seamless.

In addition, Uber is strengthening first- and last-mile connectivity to Metro stations by offering discounts of up to 30% on bike trips, capped at ₹20, until February 11. These discounts apply to rides taken to and from Metro stations, helping commuters complete their journeys without depending on personal vehicles.

For longer trips, Uber is promoting cleaner and shared mobility alternatives. With nearly 1,000 electric vehicles operating in Delhi, Uber Electric is offering a 10% discount, up to ₹50, until February 11, providing a lower-emission travel option. The company is also highlighting Uber Shuttle, a high-capacity shared transport service designed to reduce the number of individual vehicles on the road and support more efficient commuting.

Together, these offerings are intended to complement Delhi’s public transport network and make sustainable travel choices more practical for everyday use.

Manjinder Singh Sirsa, Hon’ble Minister for Environment, Forest & Wildlife, Government of NCT of Delhi, said, “Under the leadership of Hon’ble Chief Minister Smt. Rekha Gupta, the Delhi Government has announced a series of initiatives to curb air pollution. However, Delhi’s air quality challenge cannot be addressed without reducing the number of private vehicles on our roads. We appreciate efforts by shared mobility platforms such as Uber that encourage greater use of public transport, shared travel, and cleaner mobility options. Initiatives that provide viable alternatives to private cars support the Delhi Government’s broader strategy to improve air quality and ease congestion.”

Amit Deshpande, Head – City Operations, Uber India, said, “Tackling air quality challenges requires collective action and coordinated solutions. We’re proud to support the Delhi Government’s efforts by making it easier for people to choose public transit and sustainable mobility options. Whether it’s discounted Metro tickets, reliable first- and last-mile rides, electric vehicles or shared high capacity vehicles - our focus is on enabling smarter and sustainable choices for daily travel.”

Uber said it will continue working with transport authorities and city stakeholders to scale solutions that support cleaner air and more efficient urban mobility across Delhi.",https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/Uber.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 11:09:23.446506

This is a new unit within the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT), led by Tristan Thomas, formerly of Monzo, and Greg Jackson, CEO of Octopus Energy. It aims to bring together the best civil service operators alongside leading private sector disruptors and transformation specialists. The plan is to use CustomerFirst expertise to rewire government services, making use of AI and best practices from the private sector.

The Blueprint for modern digital government report, published last year, set out six steps to achieve a digital state. At the time, the government also recognised major challenges that were preventing digital government from progressing.

Although the government spends over £26bn annually on digital technology and employs a workforce of nearly 100,000 digital and data professionals, institutionalised fragmentation is holding back digital government services. Problem areas include persistent legacy, cyber and resilience risk; siloed data; under-digitisation; inconsistent leadership; a skills shortfall; diffused buying power; and outdated funding models.

A year later, the government has published its Roadmap for a modern digital government. The roadmap states that public services are being redesigned to be quicker, more accessible and easier to use, while also being cheaper to run and costing less to the taxpayer. The roadmap includes digitisation of the planning system to accelerate house building and a goal to simplify how people manage their benefits and taxes online.

CustomerFirst is being positioned as one of the initiatives the government will use to deliver savings for taxpayers through end‑to‑end reform and smarter use of technology by departments. There is a potential £4bn saving from moving service processing online, rather than by phone, post or in-person.

Discussing the need to streamline how people interact with government departments, the minister for digital government, Ian Murray, said: “Too often, people are put off from interacting with the services they need by the frustration that comes with waiting on hold, filling in endless forms, and jumping through hoop after hoop.”

He said the government would redesign services so they meet the demands of modern life.

Technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) will be deployed to achieve this objective. Greg Jackson, founder and CEO of Octopus Energy, said: “With modern technology, including AI, and even more importantly empowered teams whose job it is to help citizens, we can improve service without increasing costs.”

The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is the first government department to work with CustomerFirst. It aims to improve how the DVLA handles millions of customer interactions each year related to driving licences, vehicle registration and other motoring services.

DSIT said the DVLA will become a blueprint for improving services across government departments. DVLA CEO Tim Moss said: “DVLA has a track record of delivering great digital services, and we are keen to build on this and further develop the next generation of high-quality services that citizens should expect.”

As part of its roadmap for modern digital government, DSIT said it was looking for senior and experienced talent with expertise in service design, solutions architecture and product management.",https://www.computerweekly.com/visuals/German/article/human-groups-data-analysis-adobe.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 11:08:20.399917

On Sunday, several users said they received a text message from Uber stating that their subscriptions had been impacted due to a “route change.” The message read:

“Uber Shuttle Subscription Update: Your subscription has been impacted due to a route change. A refund for remaining trips has been processed, and 2 free trips have been added to your account. We apologize for the inconvenience caused.”

However, many commuters claim that refunds have either not been received yet or are stuck in processing, with some alleging their money is blocked in the Uber cash despite the company indicating the refund has been initiated.

The sudden disruption has sparked speculation online about whether Uber is quietly scaling down or even shutting down its Shuttle service in certain markets, especially as affected users claim they were given little to no prior heads-up. As of Monday, Uber India has not issued a detailed public statement explaining the extent of the route changes, the reason behind the sudden service disruption, or a clear timeline for refunds.

Over the past 24–48 hours, frustrated commuters have flooded social media with complaints, sharing screenshots of the message, route unavailability, and refund-related issues. Several users also questioned how subscription-based mobility services can be altered overnight without advance notice to paying customers.

For daily office commuters, the impact has been immediate. Many users said Uber Shuttle had become their preferred option for predictable pricing and fixed routes, and the sudden disruption has forced them to scramble for alternatives at short notice, often at higher costs.

The controversy has also revived uncomfortable memories of BluSmart’s sudden operational collapse earlier this year. BluSmart ceased operations in April 2025 amid founder fraud allegations and SEBI investigations, leaving many users with stuck wallet balances and limited clarity on refunds. While Uber is far larger and operationally different from BluSmart, the current uncertainty around refunds has triggered anxiety among commuters who fear being left in limbo again.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/bmi/media/media_files/2026/01/19/uber-shuttle-shutting-down-2026-01-19-15-42-39.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 09:01:42.087997

“Delta is building the fleet for the future, enhancing the customer experience, driving operational improvements and providing steady replacements for less efficient, older aircraft in the decade to come,” said Ed Bastian, Delta’s chief executive officer. “Most importantly, these aircraft will be operated by the best aviation professionals in the industry, providing Delta’s welcoming, elevated and caring service to travelers worldwide.”

With capacity for up to 336 passengers and 25% lower fuel use than the airplanes it replaces, the 787-10 offers the lowest operating cost per seat of any widebody airplane. Delivering superior comfort for passengers, the 787 Dreamliner features the largest windows of any widebody airplane flying today and air that is pressurized at a lower cabin altitude, which will help Delta’s customers arrive at their destinations feeling more refreshed.

“We are excited that Delta Air Lines has selected the 787-10 to join its fleet of the future. The 787 Dreamliner’s unmatched efficiency, range, and passenger comfort make it a perfect fit for Delta’s international expansion and fleet modernization,” said Stephanie Pope, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “Our team looks forward to delivering new Dreamliners to Delta and supporting their commitments to provide an exceptional passenger experience and advance sustainability in aviation.”

With more than 460 Boeing airplanes currently in service, Delta has flown most Boeing single-aisle and widebody models across its domestic and international networks over the decades. This new widebody order further strengthens that partnership and supports U.S. aerospace manufacturing jobs across Boeing’s production system and supply chain.

This purchase brings Delta’s firm order book to 130 Boeing airplanes, including the airline’s order for 100 737-10 jets(opens in a new tab). The efficiency and flexibility of the 787-10 and 737-10 will enable Delta to fly more passengers on more routes as the airline expands and diversifies its network.

A leading global aerospace company and top U.S. exporter, Boeing develops, manufactures and services commercial airplanes, defense products and space systems for customers in more than 150 countries. Our U.S. and global workforce and supplier base drive innovation, economic opportunity, sustainability and community impact.

With draws beginning to shape the narrative around our season, Virgil van Dijk is expected to hold a players’ meeting at the AXA Training Centre following the 1–1 with Burnley.

The report, via Sky Sports, points to leadership rather than panic, with the Netherlands international determined to confront standards internally rather than allow frustration to linger.

This is not about one result, but about how we respond collectively.

Van Dijk leadership comes to the fore at Liverpool again

According to Sky Sports, the centre-back was unhappy with the sloppiness that crept in after the hour mark against Burnley, particularly given how dominant we were for long spells.

“I’m frustrated that after 60 minutes we started to become sloppy and it’s not the first time,” the 34-year-old said.

That frustration carried weight because it followed a performance where we generated chances at volume but failed to turn control into victory.

Liverpool registered 15 shots in the first half alone, with Florian Wirtz continuing his fine run after being teed up by Curtis Jones, yet one lapse proved costly.

This is not the first time the captain has intervened this season either.

After defeat to Manchester United in October, Van Dijk called a similar meeting during a difficult run, underlining how seriously he takes responsibility for direction within the group.

That sense of accountability has been reflected in his public words too, where he admitted there was “something lacking” while also stressing the need for unity during a demanding spell – after the draw with Burnley.

Why Van Dijk meeting matters before Marseille test

Timing matters.

We now head to Marseille in the Champions League knowing that small margins can quickly become defining ones, particularly away from home against a Roberto De Zerbi side.

Van Dijk referenced that challenge directly, saying: “Monday will be a big one for it because Wednesday will be a very difficult game over there.”

The Dutch defender was also clear that solutions must be collective.

“It’s not about me addressing it, it is about how can we solve it because we all want to win games,” he added.

That mindset aligns with what Jeremie Frimpong has already said about Van Dijk’s influence, describing him as both a leader and a presence players naturally respond to.

It also reinforces why he remains the right man to wear the armband during a period of transition under our head coach in his second season.

With the squad given Sunday off, highlighted by Van Dijk attending the NBA in London, the reset begins now.

Jan 19, 2026 Share

Phoenix Specialty, a construction-focused managing general agent (MGA), has announced it has secured additional A+ (S&P) rated capacity to complement its existing AA- (S&P) rated backing from AXA Insurance UK.

The London-based MGA said the move strengthens its ability to support brokers across its UK contractors' all risks (CAR) and contractors' plant & equipment (CPE) propositions. The expanded capacity increases Phoenix Specialty's underwriting appetite and flexibility, with probable maximum losses of up to £50 million now available on a case-by-case basis for both annual and single project risks.

The capacity expansion comes amid shifting dynamics in the UK construction insurance market. Standard four-walls CAR premiums declined by around 20% in mid-2025, according to Aon's UK Insurance Market Outlook, a trend attributed to growing underwriting capacity entering the market.

Complex engineering risks, however, have been priced flat, with underwriters exercising greater caution. The increased competition has encouraged product innovation and customisation, particularly in segments such as SME construction.

In addition to the UK capacity expansion, Phoenix Specialty has secured Lloyd's capacity support on a prior submit basis. This enables the MGA to consider Erection All Risks (EAR) business globally within Lloyd's of London-approved territories.

The EAR proposition will offer capacity of up to US$27 million in total insurable value. Appetite spans multiple sectors, including steel, cement, mineral processing, breweries, bottling plants, dairies, semiconductor and pharmaceutical facilities, and data centres.

These developments follow the launch of Phoenix Specialty's Global CPE proposition in mid-2025. That offering focuses on annual renewable business and is available on both a direct insurance and facultative reinsurance basis.

Tim James (pictured above), CEO of Phoenix Specialty, said the additional capacity represents a milestone for the company.

""This is a significant milestone for Phoenix and gives us further opportunity to expand our offering and better support our broker partners,"" James said.

James added that the company has had a strong start to 2026, with several projects in development. He noted that the team remains focused on working closely with broker partners to grow mutual accounts.

Around 150 million cubic feet of gas is reportedly lost from the grid every day due to leaks, technical losses, and mismanagement.
Two floating LNG terminals currently supply the grid, together capable of handling about one billion cubic feet per day.
Without that, the country risks running its economy on empty, sustained by imports, vulnerable to shocks, and perpetually one crisis away from paralysis.","Bangladesh’s gas crisis did not arrive as a sudden shock; it crept in quietly, disguised as policy pragmatism and short-term fixes, until it became a structural threat to the economy.

What is unfolding now is not merely a seasonal shortage or a logistical hiccup, but the cumulative consequence of years of strategic neglect, compounded by global volatility and domestic inertia.

The numbers alone tell a story of exhaustion. The country currently demands around 3.8 billion cubic feet of gas per day, while supply lingers at roughly 2.58 billion cubic feet, leaving a daily deficit of 1.22 billion cubic feet. Even compared to the same period last year, supply has fallen by 176 million cubic feet per day.

For an economy whose industrial backbone, power generation, and fertilizer production depend overwhelmingly on gas, this gap is not technical; it is existential.

The roots of this imbalance lie in a policy choice made years ago: To manage scarcity through imports rather than confront it through exploration.

During the previous government’s tenure, liquefied natural gas was elevated from a stopgap solution to a structural pillar of energy policy. Instead of aggressively investing in onshore and offshore exploration, Bangladesh chose the predictability of foreign cargoes, even as global energy markets grew more volatile and geopolitics more intrusive.

The financial cost of this choice is staggering. Since the 2018–19 fiscal year, the country has spent or committed to spend more than Tk 2.56 trillion on LNG imports.

In the current fiscal year alone, plans are in place to import 115 cargoes at an estimated cost of Tk 51,540 crore, significantly higher than the previous year.

These figures reflect not only rising volumes, but also the growing price of dependency.

Meanwhile, domestic production has been quietly eroding. Four of the five companies extracting gas in Bangladesh have recorded declines over the past year.

Bangladesh Gas Fields Company Limited saw production fall by more than 500 million cubic metres year-on-year. Bapex’s output dropped by around 14%. Even Chevron, which supplies nearly half of the country’s gas through its three onshore fields, experienced a decline of over one billion cubic metres in a single year.

Only one operator showed a marginal increase, insufficient to offset the broader trend. This is not a coincidence; it is what depletion looks like when exploration stagnates and development lags behind demand growth.

Adding to this fragility is inefficiency within the system itself. Around 150 million cubic feet of gas is reportedly lost from the grid every day due to leaks, technical losses, and mismanagement.

In such a scenario, drilling new wells without fixing transmission and distribution inefficiencies is akin to pouring water into a cracked vessel. The result is predictable: New supply fails to translate into meaningful relief, while costs continue to rise.

The interim government inherited this crisis with high public expectations. As a caretaker authority overseeing a critical political transition, it was seen as uniquely positioned to take difficult, long-term decisions insulated from electoral pressures.

Energy, the lifeblood of the economy, was expected to be an early priority. Yet more than a year into its tenure, the crisis appears deeper, not eased.

Import dependence remains entrenched, local production continues to decline, and infrastructure expansion has barely moved beyond announcements.

Two floating LNG terminals currently supply the grid, together capable of handling about one billion cubic feet per day. This capacity is already insufficient, yet tangible progress on new terminals remains elusive.

Building another floating terminal, even if approved today, would take at least three years to become operational. By then, the interim government will be long gone, and the political cost deferred to an elected successor.

This pattern of postponement, where today’s inaction becomes tomorrow’s inherited problem, has become a recurring feature of Bangladesh’s energy governance.

The risks of this approach extend beyond balance sheets. Global energy markets are increasingly shaped by sanctions, conflicts, and strategic rivalries. Recent disruptions in LPG supply, triggered by sanctions affecting shipping and trading routes, offer a glimpse of how external events can suddenly constrict access to fuel.

For a country that imports a growing share of its primary energy, such shocks can quickly cascade through the economy, shutting down factories, reducing export capacity, and straining foreign exchange reserves.

Bangladesh is discovering, belatedly, that energy security is inseparable from national security.

The industrial impact is already visible. Many factories operate for months without adequate gas pressure; others have shut down entirely.

Power plants built at great cost sit underutilized for lack of fuel. Export-oriented industries, particularly those competing on thin margins, face rising production costs and declining reliability.

At a time when Bangladesh seeks to attract foreign investment and diversify its economy, persistent energy shortages send a deeply discouraging signal. Investors may tolerate policy uncertainty; they rarely tolerate unreliable energy.

To be fair, plans do exist. An integrated energy roadmap stretching from 2026 to 2050 envisions phased reforms and investments worth an estimated $70-80 billion. There are promises of drilling 100 wells by 2028, purchasing new rigs, updating production-sharing contracts, and reducing reliance on spot LNG through short-term agreements.

These are not trivial measures. Yet plans, in the absence of urgency and coordination, risk becoming another layer of deferred responsibility. Energy systems do not respond to intent; they respond to execution.

What is most troubling is the continued absence of a clear exit strategy from LNG dependency. Importing LNG can stabilize supply in the short run, but it cannot anchor an economy indefinitely, especially one vulnerable to currency pressure and external shocks.

Without a defined timeline to reduce imports and replace them with domestic production, LNG risks becoming a permanent crutch, draining public finances while crowding out investment in exploration.

The opportunity cost is immense. Every taka spent on expensive spot cargoes is a taka not invested in seismic surveys, offshore drilling, or modern grid management.

Bangladesh’s gas story is ultimately a lesson in policy time horizons. Exploration does not yield immediate political dividends; imports do.

Infrastructure takes years; cargoes arrive in weeks. But nations that prioritize convenience over capacity eventually pay a higher price. The current crisis is not merely about gas shortages; it is about the erosion of strategic autonomy.

An economy that cannot fuel its factories without navigating sanctions regimes and shipping constraints is an economy exposed to forces beyond its control.

The interim government still has limited time to shape the contours of what comes next. Even if it cannot deliver immediate relief, it can establish credibility by locking in irreversible steps toward exploration, efficiency, and diversification.

Failing that, the burden will fall on the next elected government, which will inherit not only depleted fields and expensive contracts, but also public frustration and industrial fatigue.

Bangladesh once built its growth narrative on affordable energy. That advantage is slipping away. Reclaiming it will require more than cargoes and committees; it will require a decisive break from the politics of postponement.

Without that, the country risks running its economy on empty, sustained by imports, vulnerable to shocks, and perpetually one crisis away from paralysis.",https://ecdn.dhakatribune.net/contents/cache/images/600x315x1/uploads/media/2026/01/19/9020c84e6d1e2f39edbc929110979331-696dc091da111.jpg?jadewits_media_id=58381,N,,2026-01-19 04:59:21.072811

U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), a major player in the financial services sector, is scheduled to release its earnings report this Tuesday before the market opens. Here’s a look at what the market is anticipating.

In the previous quarter, U.S. Bancorp surpassed Wall Street’s revenue projections by 2.2%, posting $7.34 billion in revenue—a 5.1% increase compared to the same period last year. The company not only exceeded revenue expectations but also delivered a notable outperformance in net interest income.

Current Quarter Expectations

Analysts are forecasting that U.S. Bancorp’s revenue will climb 4.5% year-over-year to reach $7.32 billion this quarter, marking an improvement from the 1.9% growth seen in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings per share are projected to be $1.19.

U.S. Bancorp Total Revenue

Over the past month, analysts have largely maintained their forecasts for the company, indicating confidence in U.S. Bancorp’s performance as earnings approach. However, it’s worth noting that the company has fallen short of revenue expectations twice in the last two years.

Peer Performance in Diversified Banking

Some of U.S. Bancorp’s competitors in the diversified banking sector have already released their fourth-quarter results, offering some context for what to expect. PNC Financial Services Group reported a 6% year-over-year revenue increase but missed analyst estimates by 0.7%. Meanwhile, Bank of America saw its revenue rise by 7.1%, beating forecasts by 3.5%. Following its results, Bank of America’s stock surged by 309%.

Market Sentiment and Stock Performance

Investors in the diversified banking sector have shown resilience ahead of earnings, with the average share price rising 1.4% over the past month. U.S. Bancorp’s stock price has remained steady during this period and is currently trading at $54.57, with analysts setting an average price target of $60.80.

Profound Logic is rolling out a new AI-powered development tool that it says will increase the productivity of individual developers by five to 10 times. Dubbed CoderFlow, the software coordinates the work of multiple AI agents to assist with the development new IBM i applications or the maintenance and modernization of existing ones.

Existing AI copilots provide some productivity gains for developers working in an IDE, somewhere around 20 percent, according to Profound Logic chief executive officer Alex Roytman. But CoderFlow is a different type of product. It is not a coding co-pilot, he said. Instead it is a framework for spinning up autonomous agents that can accomplish a range of tasks, from converting code to new languages and compiling the code to testing code in a 5250 or Web environment and even resolving errors.

“What we’re seeing with this new approach is it’s truly agentic and it’s like five to ten times the productivity,” Roytman told IT Jungle. “I always feel like if I say something like this, the person on the other side is like, that sounds like BS.”

But CoderFlow is the real deal, Roytman insists.

One of the product’s advantages over traditional GenAI copilots is its multi-agent framework. Once the customer submits a given task to CoderFlow, such as converting an RPG subprocedure from RPG III to free-form RPG IV, the software will spin up multiple agents automatically to tackle the task. The software will run a competition among the agents – each of which may be using a different language model, such as Anthropic’s Claude or OpenAI’s GPT 5 – to see which one will produce the best results.

“There’s another agent that will look at all of those and say, out of all of these, here’s how I rate them,” Roytman said. “It’ll produce a little rubric and say: ‘This one got the functionality right, but the code is not as well organized as it could be, whereas this one’s got the code well organized.’ Because they’re competing, the winning solution will come to the front.”

The agents have their own containerized environments to work in, which gives them autonomy and also limits the damage they can do if they do something wrong, Roytman said. If an agent brings up a 5250 session to test a change, it’s a virtual emulator, not a real one.

CoderFlow understands and can generate a variety of languages common the IBM i platform, including various flavors of RPG, COBOL, CL, DDS, SQL, Java, and Node.JS; it hasn’t been tested in C on IBM i. Whereas the mainstream LLMs like Claude and GPT struggled with RPG just a year ago, they have made rapid improvements and now display a solid of RPG, Roytman said.

Those improvements mean that any IBM i shop can go out and use Claude or GPT 5.0 to understand and generate RPG on their own. What CoderFlow brings to the table is something different, Roytman said.

“These models do understand the RPG fairly well,” he said. “We provide the scaffolding, the parts that will say, well, in order for me to understand more about this RPG program, in addition to just reading the code, I have to be able to understand the context. It’s going to go out and understand the data, the database tables that I’m working with, what the layout is. The agent can’t really make decisions on how to edit the RPG without knowing the right context.”

Like many GenAI sessions, a CoderFlow session starts with a prompt. A human developer may tell the software to build something, such as an order processing module, along with validation, error handling and API support. CoderFlow will then analyze the command, break it down into individual tasks, and then spin up AI agents to execute those tasks.

Interaction between the human developer and the software is critical for getting it right. The first set of results may be throw-away work and in need of improvement, Roytman said. The software allows customers to deliver feedback in a couple of different ways, including by circling elements on the screen or by explaining the errors in typed input, he said.

“It is kind of like a chat, where you say ‘You got this almost right, but can you adjust this part or can you adjust this piece,’ and it will make the adjustments for you,” Roytman said. “Once it’s edited the code, it then moves on to saying, well, let’s see if it compiles. It resolves all the compilation issues; let’s see if it runs. If it’s a 5250 application, it spins up a 5250 session on its on its own, runs through the application, test everything that it’s built. If there are runtime errors, it resolves them. If something doesn’t appear right on the screen, it resolves them. And it can do that with both browsers and 5250 screens.”

Instead of staring at an IDE all day, the developer is now coordinating the work of multiple agents. Having multiple agents compete to create the best solution bumps up the success rate, Roytman said. All told, CoderFlow can significantly improve the amount of work, whether its new development, maintenance of existing code, or modernizing older software.

You don’t have to be a coding genius to use CoderFlow, but it does require someone with moderate RPG skills, as well as an understanding of the database layout. There is a bit of setup required to use CoderFlow, with the biggest requirement being that a customer must be storing their source code in Git, and managing changes in Git as well, Roytman said. Setup and implementation will typically take a couple of weeks, potentially longer if the customer is not yet using Git.

CoderFlow is a component in Profound App Dev, the company’s flagship application development suite, which encompasses a variety of other products, including Profound UI, Profound.js, Genie, and Atrium. In addition to the Web interface, Profound is offering command line and VS Code extensions.

Roytman is confident that progress in agentic AI is going to provide big productivity gains for IBM i shops in 2026.

“That doesn’t mean, oh, let’s just start getting rid of people. I think companies are going to become more ambitious and start doing projects that they thought were out of reach,” he said. “You can do it much faster than you did before. You’re going to be taking on more work.”

Today, Walmart Fashion is home to “six brands that are a billion dollars or bigger,” Incandela said.
It was important, she said, “to change perception of Walmart fashion” — beginning with a fresher assortment.
Elevating Walmart’s fashion offerings “started with the customer,” Incandela said.
“We were covering the bottom of their closet.” This was particularly true when it came to Walmart’s “growth” customer, Incandela said.","Walmart, whose tagline is “Save money, live better,” is typically known for groceries, gadgets and household essentials. But the company is trying to be a more trend-focused fashion player as it looks to compete with national brands, Amazon and department stores. In addition to hiring Incandela — who once launched Saks Fifth Avenue’s website and assumed her current role in 2021 — Walmart brought on celebrity fashion designer Brandon Maxwell as the creative director of Scoop and Free Assembly in 2021. All the while, Walmart has built brands with higher prices, partnered with influencers like Athena Roberts and Lori & Leslie on Instagram videos, and set up shop at New York Fashion Week. It has also overhauled its store displays to group items like handbags and installed QR codes that link to additional colors and sizes on its website.

The strategy appears to be working, especially with higher-income households, executives shared. In November, Walmart revealed that its apparel business grew “over 5%” every month of its third quarter. “We see more and more customers choosing Walmart for their source of fashion,” incoming CEO John Furner said on a Nov. 20 earnings call. Over half (60%) of Walmart Fashion customers are women, and 40% belong to a $100K-plus household, per data shared at NRF. About a third (35%) are ages 25-44.

Today, Walmart Fashion is home to “six brands that are a billion dollars or bigger,” Incandela said. “We’re assertively taking market share, our total performance scores are improving dramatically, [and] we’re capturing new customers,” she added. “Our $100K-plus household income customers are increasing dramatically, because they’re looking at Walmart for the first time for fashion.”

Refining and revamping Walmart’s closet

About half of the U.S., or 145 million people, visit Walmart’s website and stores every week, Incandela said. When Incandela joined Walmart in 2017, the company was doing well with boosting traffic. But, she said, it wasn’t known for playing a credible role in fashion. It was important, she said, “to change perception of Walmart fashion” — beginning with a fresher assortment.

Elevating Walmart’s fashion offerings “started with the customer,” Incandela said. The company found that when a typical Walmart customer shopped in Walmart, 60% of her spending was at an opening price point of $15 average unit retail, or less. However, when that customer left Walmart and shopped elsewhere, 80% of her spending was on higher AUR items. “It show[ed] that we were not supporting our customers’ closet,” Incandela said. “We were covering the bottom of their closet.”

This was particularly true when it came to Walmart’s “growth” customer, Incandela said. That’s a shopper who is Gen Z or a millennial, lives in an urban area, and has more discretionary income. “While we were winning on price, price alone does not make value,” Incandela said. “We were not winning on quality, aesthetic and style, so that’s where we’ve been pursuing this opportunity.”

The store experience has also been important to refine, Incandela said. Today, Walmart has remodeled about 1,000 of its 4,000 stores to help fashion offerings “stand tall,” she shared. As part of this, Walmart created distinct areas for denim and handbags. It also eliminated some 10% of its racks to open up the space. “We wanted the product to be the hero,” Incandela said.

The brand equation

Walmart’s fashion expansion covers three avenues: national brands, opening-price-point brands and what it calls “elevated brands.” Its national brands include names like Reebok, Wrangler and Michael Kors. Its OPP brands include Terra Sky, No Boundaries and Weekend Academy. Its “elevated brands” — or ones with AURs from $15-$40 — are Scoop, Free Assembly and Avia.

Initially, Walmart received pushback for wanting to sell brands at higher prices, Incandela recalled. When Walmart first developed Scoop and Free Assembly, Incandela said, “Our store operators said, ‘No way. We will never be able to sell this.'” Now, she said, Free Assembly is in all Walmart stores. Scoop — a once-shuttered boutique brand that Walmart brought back in 2019 — is in half of Walmart stores. It’s all proof that consumers are willing to opt into higher-priced, trendy styles, Incandela said.

Incandela also described how Walmart changed the look of two brands — No Boundaries and Joyspun — to better service today’s shoppers. No Boundaries is a young-adult brand, but a few years ago, it was “packaging to a customer who was 55-plus,” Incandela said. “That was a $2 billion brand, but … we were missing the mark,” she said. In 2024, Walmart completely overhauled the brand, from its logo to its assortment, to resonate with Gen Z. Its most popular products include joggers, sweatshirts and wide-leg pants.

Meanwhile, Joyspun used to be called Secret Treasures, but as an intimates brand, it did not connect with the modern consumer. “We said, ‘It’s time to retire this. There’s no saving this name,'” Incandela said. Joyspun, the new iteration, replaced Secret Treasures in 2022. “This is one of those things where you have to have a lot of courage, right?” Incandela said. “Because you know it’s not right, it’s not modern, [and] it’s not going to enable you to win.”

Neil Saunders, managing director for GlobalData Retail, has been monitoring Walmart’s progression in apparel, footwear and luxury closely. The company wants to be a “destination for fashion, especially among younger consumers,” he told Modern Retail. But, Saunders said, “This has been quite a tall order as, traditionally, Walmart has been seen as rather frumpy and basic in apparel.”

However, Saunders said, Walmart has “moved the dial” in the last few years by launching new brands, improving product design and making store environments “more attractive through better merchandising.” “I’d say that Walmart is early on in this process, but it has a lot more confidence in fashion now than it has [had] in the past,” he added.

Walmart, too, knows it will take time to accomplish all of its fashion goals — but it’s also eager to keep going. “Frankly, we are just scratching the surface,” Incandela said. “There’s a lot more to come. But I feel like we have momentum, and I’m excited about it.”",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/01/Free-assembly-Walmart.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 02:59:37.823270

In 2024, the CCPA issued comprehensive guidelines to curb misleading coaching advertisements.
Why misleading ads persist According to Prof. Keyoor Purani, Vice Chancellor, Prestige University Indore, misleading advertising survives because economics continues to reward exaggeration more than honesty.
Kapoor warns that persistent misleading advertising erodes trust in legitimate offerings.","India’s coaching and edtech sector has repeatedly landed in regulatory crosshairs over misleading advertisements, with 2023 marking a turning point.

In 2023, edtech major Byju’s was penalised by the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) for allegedly publishing misleading advertisements related to its online IAS coaching programme. The regulator imposed a fine of Rs 10 lakh, ordered the company to discontinue the advertisements, and directed it to submit a compliance report within 15 days.

According to the CCPA’s order, Byju’s failed to substantiate its claims regarding the number of successful UPSC candidates trained through its programmes. The authority noted that Think & Learn, Byju’s parent company, did not provide evidence to support its assertion that 62 out of 1,228 candidates who appeared for the civil services examination in 2013 were trained by the platform. Consent forms and fee receipts of the selected candidates were also missing. Byju’s had contested the order and said it would appeal.

This episode was not an outlier.

Over the past few years, the CCPA has consistently flagged misleading claims across coaching and edtech players. In 2023 alone, notices were sent to 20 IAS coaching institutes for deceptive advertising. That same year, successful civil services candidates were barred from endorsing coaching institutes after selection, with regulators classifying such promotions as misleading and unfair trade practices.

A pattern, not an exception

The numbers underline the scale of the issue. According to an Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) report, education has consistently been the most violative advertising sector. In 2022, 27 percent of all advertising complaints received by ASCI were related to education, with 22 percent coming from classical education and five percent from edtech.

The trend persisted in 2025, when education once again topped the violation charts. Significantly, 45 percent of violative advertisements were withdrawn voluntarily after ASCI intervention, highlighting both the prevalence of exaggerated claims and the growing scrutiny they now face.

Regulatory action has intensified. In 2024, the CCPA issued comprehensive guidelines to curb misleading coaching advertisements. That year, it issued 45 notices to coaching centres and fined 19 institutes a cumulative Rs 61.6 lakh. Penalties were also imposed on Vajirao & Reddy Institute, StudyIQ IAS and Edge IAS for misrepresenting success rates by highlighting toppers without disclosing that most had only enrolled in interview guidance or short-term programmes.

In December 2025, Vision IAS became the first institute to face a higher penalty—Rs 11 lakh—for a repeat offence. The CCPA found that while Vision IAS’s advertisements claimed dozens of top-ranking UPSC candidates, only three of the 119 showcased had actually enrolled in its foundation courses; the rest had availed limited services such as test series or mock interviews.

Recently, Manisha Kapoor, CEO and Secretary General, ASCI highlighted a case involving an edtech advertisement that promised a “minimum 3x salary hike” after course completion, supported by a handful of success stories. While individual outcomes were genuine, ASCI found no evidence to prove that such results were typical, directly attributable to the course, or achievable for most learners. The claim was upheld as misleading for creating an impression of certainty, despite outcomes being influenced by multiple variables such as prior experience, skills and market conditions.

Why misleading ads persist

According to Prof. Keyoor Purani, Vice Chancellor, Prestige University Indore, misleading advertising survives because economics continues to reward exaggeration more than honesty. “Education suffers from information asymmetry. Parents and students cannot easily verify claims, and grey areas with fine-print disclaimers make it easy to mislead while remaining technically compliant,” he says.

KV Sridhar, Global Chief Creative Officer at Nihilent Limited and Hypercollective, notes that education is among the top three categories for misleading advertising complaints in India. “The core problem is that education advertisers sell results, not learning. No one can guarantee marks, ranks, placements or success, yet these claims function as emotional guarantees for a child’s future,” he explains.

Sridhar argues that this amounts to emotional manipulation. “Parents are locked into years of coaching, driven by fear rather than aptitude or interest. Even universities advertise ‘90 percent placements’ or headline salaries without disclosing medians or full context,” he says.

A systemic distortion

Purani believes recent regulatory action should be seen as a symptom of a deeper distortion. “Education is a purpose-first sector, but its advertising is beginning to resemble hard-sell consumer categories. When rankings and placements become marketing targets, institutions start optimising for numbers rather than learning,” he says, citing Goodhart’s Law.

This distortion has intensified as coaching, edtech and test-prep businesses—operating with low entry barriers and high margins—apply performance-marketing logic to education. “When outcomes are probabilistic but marketing promises certainty, ethical lines blur,” Purani adds.

Investor pressure and credibility loss

ASCI's Kapoor says COVID-19 accelerated the edtech boom and, with it, violations. “Digital platforms and influencer-led campaigns amplified both reach and risk. Many edtech companies are VC-funded, and the pressure to show growth often leads to aggressive, non-compliant marketing,” she says.

Kapoor warns that persistent misleading advertising erodes trust in legitimate offerings. “Education touches every household. When exaggeration becomes the norm, skepticism grows—and that damages the sector’s long-term credibility.”

Vibhor Yadav, Regional Creative Officer and Founding Partner at TGTHR, is blunt: “This isn’t accidental—it’s strategic. When a Rs 4–5 lakh penalty delivers enrolments worth crores, institutions factor penalties into their cost of acquisition.”

According to Yadav, enforcement is reactive, not preventive. “By the time action is taken, the business objective is already achieved. But what’s changing now is scrutiny—ads don’t disappear anymore. They’re archived, shared and challenged in real time.”

The cost of broken trust

The cumulative effect is a credibility deficit across the category. “Parents today aren’t asking which institute is best, but which claim is least exaggerated,” Yadav says. This has driven some students toward self-study and alternative learning models.

Sridhar believes the issue goes beyond advertising. “Education has become over-commercialised. Many institutions are now run like real estate ventures. Making money isn’t wrong—but exploiting fear is,” he says, warning that the sector is increasingly fuelled by “bad money” rather than long-term value creation.

The way forward

Experts agree that reform cannot rely on regulation alone. Ethical advertising must focus on inputs, not guaranteed outcomes—faculty quality, curriculum design, mentoring and learning processes. “If a claim needs a disclaimer to undo its implication, the claim itself needs rethinking,” Purani argues.

As ASCI’s Kapoor notes, advertising can amplify credibility but cannot replace it. “Education marketing must build trust, not trade on vulnerability.”",https://images.storyboard18.com/storyboard18/2026/01/Copy-of-CXO-5-2026-01-dce531d629cd875cc065b8377f114bbb-1019x573.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 00:00:02.979852

FIVE THINGS I LEARNED FROM BREAKINGVIEWS THIS WEEK

RISK AND RESOLVE

One of this newsletter’s recurring themes is the extraordinary resilience of economies and financial markets in the face of geopolitical turmoil. Imagine if, at the beginning of 2025, investors had perfect foresight about everything happening in the next twelve months. They would have braced for a tariff-induced recession and sustained selloff - neither of which materialised. The U.S. economy probably expanded by around 2% last year, and the S&P 500 Index ended 2025 up 16%.

The disconnect has become even starker in the past two weeks. Donald Trump has arrested the president of Venezuela and started selling the country’s oil, undermined the transatlantic alliance by reviving his interest in Greenland, and advocated for a change of government in Iran. His administration then threatened Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell with a criminal indictment. The president has expressed his desire to cap credit card interest rates, impose a 25% tariff on countries that do business with Iran, and restrict defence contractors from returning cash to shareholders. Oh, and he threatened to send troops into U.S. cities.

Despite all this, investors have barely blinked. The S&P 500 Index (.SPX), opens new tab is up just over 1% this year, yields on 10-year U.S. government bonds are pretty much unchanged, and the VIX index (.VIX), opens new tab of stock market volatility remains low. Meanwhile speculators are piling into silver (up 24% this year) and bitcoin (up 9%).

There are three broad explanations. The first is that money managers think none of the things Trump is threatening will actually happen. Congress and the Supreme Court will restrain him, or he will back down when reality proves more complicated. Yet this theory doesn’t really hold up. For example, U.S. bank stocks sold off following Trump’s credit card comments, even though a cap would be hard to implement.

The second explanation is that none of this will meaningfully change the direction of inflation, interest rates, or corporate earnings. Venezuela produces less than a million barrels of oil a day, a rounding error in the global market. The stock market’s dependence on a small number of giant tech companies means its future is more tightly tied to the fate of artificial intelligence than to broader economic shifts. But this theory, too, has holes. It’s hard to conceive of a more consequential action for markets than the U.S. president bullying the central bank into lowering interest rates. Yet investors have shrugged off Trump’s assault on the Fed.

The third explanation is that big shifts take time. They require investors to fundamentally rethink how and where to allocate assets. And few will talk about it publicly. It was therefore striking that Dan Ivascyn, the chief investment officer of Pimco, this week told the Financial Times that the giant bond fund manager is diversifying away, opens new tab from the United States. Sometimes the connection between different events is not as strong as we thought. Or it may just take time for the link to reveal itself.

CHART OF THE WEEK

Wall Street banks often complain that they’re held back by excessive regulation, allowing less restrained rivals to push into trading or private credit. So it’s striking that both Morgan Stanley (MS.N), opens new tab and Goldman Sachs (GS.N), opens new tab now trade at a higher multiple of book value than in 2007, when the Global Financial Crisis kicked off. Yet as Stephen Gandel observes, their reported return on equity is still much lower than in those heady days.

THE WEEK IN PODCASTS

Over on The Big View, opens new tab, I talked inflation, artificial intelligence and investors’ buy-the-dip mentality with Anna Szymanski, Editor-in-Chief of Reuters Open Interest and co-host of Morning Bid, Reuters’ new daily markets podcast.

PARTING SHOT

I was sad to hear that David Webb had died at the age of 60. Hong Kong’s most prominent corporate gadfly spent decades pursuing a lonely but important campaign for better transparency and against poor corporate governance in the Asian financial hub. His encyclopedic memory, clarity of thought, and strongly held views made him a valuable resource for other investors - and for financial journalists. Hudson Lockett’s obituary is a fitting tribute to the man, who would doubtless have appreciated its sharp conclusion.

The theme for the 2025 Eli Lilly Korea GDOS was ""A Better World Made Together,"" centered on two pillars: environmental improvement and support for underprivileged children.

GDOS demonstrates that these values are not merely slogans, but a platform where employees can personally practice them within the community and reaffirm the company's reason for existence.""

On September 25 last year, Eli Lilly Korea held a volunteer activity attended by all employees to celebrate the 'Global Day of Service (GDOS).' GDOS is a global volunteer program launched by Lilly in 2008, which has accumulated over 1.2 million volunteer hours across 65 countries to date. Eli Lilly Korea has participated since 2010, contributing more than 20,000 hours of service.

The Global Day of Service is a day when organizations and individuals worldwide volunteer for local communities and global issues. Lilly operates this day annually as its own GDOS, effectively establishing it as ""the volunteering day for Lilly employees worldwide.""

The theme for the 2025 Eli Lilly Korea GDOS was ""A Better World Made Together,"" centered on two pillars: environmental improvement and support for underprivileged children. Approximately 250 employees were divided into groups to conduct plogging in Jung-gu and Seodaemun, and to create donation kits for child support. The donations were delivered through Save the Children, in cooperation with the Community Chest of Korea. They provided necessary items to children at the Manan District Social Welfare Center in Anyang.

Notably, they introduced 'GDOS Night; for the first time last year, featuring a charity performance by the in-house band and a donation program. A new attempt was made to expand the post-volunteer interaction into another act of sharing by accumulating the entire proceeds from food and beverages purchased by employees as donation funds.

GDOS aligns with Lilly's global sustainability strategy, which includes: ▲ expanding access to medicines ▲ improving environments with limited medical infrastructure ▲ strengthening community resilience ▲ minimizing environmental footprints ▲ fostering innovation grounded in inclusion and diversity.

We met with Minju Kang, Medical Director of Eli Lilly Korea, who managed last year's GDOS, and the TF team (Joohee Lee, Yu Seok Kang , and Hyung-min Kim) to discuss preparations, operations, achievements, and future directions.

Q. Please describe your roles in last year's GDOS.

Minju Kang (Medical): I am Minju Kang, head of the Medical Department and the sponsor for GDOS. Each year, a different department takes turns sponsoring GDOS, and since the Medical Department was in charge last year, I took on the role of sponsor.

Hyung-min Kim (Regulatory Affairs): I am Hyung-min Kim from the Regulatory Affairs team. For this GDOS, I established the overall program plan, selected volunteer activities, and managed group assignments.

Joohee Lee (Medical): I am Joohee Lee from the Medical Department. This program was led by three 'Champion Leaders' centered around Vice President Minju Kang. My role involved planning the program, encouraging employee participation, and setting the direction for which values we should focus on.

Yu Seok Kang (ENC): I am Yu Seok Kang from the ENC team. Since GDOS is a long-standing event, my primary role was to ensure that the company's regulations and procedures were strictly followed throughout the support process.

Q. What kind of event is GDOS?

Minju Kang: GDOS is a global corporate social responsibility program in which all Lilly branches worldwide, including the U.S. headquarters and Korea, participate. It has continued for nearly 20 years since its 2008 launch, and Eli Lilly Korea has participated consistently since 2010.

It is highly significant because it goes beyond a simple annual event; it is a time for us, as members of a pharmaceutical company, to reconnect with our fundamental purpose asking 'Why do we do this work?'

GDOS is operated as a volunteer-based activity involving all employees, and each year the TF Champions plan the program. The format changes annually. In some years, we conduct plogging to improve community environmental health, and other years we assemble donation kits for the underprivileged.

Last year, we conducted plogging and kit production simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduced GDOS Night, aiming to extend the lasting impact of volunteer work into a time for sharing and interaction.

Q. Compared to other CSR activities, what makes Lilly's program special?

Hyung-min Kim (Regulatory Affairs): Generally, many volunteer programs rely on external vendors to handle the event's composition and operation. However, at Lilly, employees form their own TF to take the lead in the entire process—from planning and execution to reporting results.

Members experience creating the program as protagonists rather than mere participants, gaining a sense of belonging and achievement. I believe this is the fundamental differentiator of Lilly's CSR activities.

Joohee Lee: Having worked at other pharmaceutical companies, I found it particularly impressive that Lilly employees worldwide participate in volunteer work on the same day.

It is rare to find CSR activities in which employees from every country, including the U.S. headquarters, work toward a common goal with a consistent identity as 'Team Lilly.'

Additionally, not only the domestic TF but also TF Champions from each country meet in advance to discuss the planning direction and implementation methods for the GDOS program, and share the results after the event. This systematic approach, in which we learn from and spread the activities of different countries, sets GDOS apart as a sophisticated global volunteer program rather than a simple local activity.

Q. We heard the 2025 theme was 'A Better World Made Together.' What were the central messages you focused on?

Yu Seok Kang : The first pillar was 'Environmental Improvement.' To this end, we collaborated with the 1365 Volunteer Center to conduct plogging activities that could directly improve the local community's environment. The second pillar was 'Child Support.' In the past, we focused on visiting orphanages to improve their facilities. Last year, during discussions with the Community Chest of Korea, we explored ways to provide more practical help to children.

As a result, we agreed that an approach of personally creating and delivering items that children need and would enjoy was more meaningful. By structuring the program around these two core pillars (environment and children), we prepared for the theme of ""A Better World Made Together"" to be portrayed through the activities.

Q. Could you explain what ""GDOS Night"" was?

Joohee Lee: In the past, after the volunteer work was completed, employees typically went their separate ways.Last year, we introduced GDOS Night to strengthen GDOS's communal values further.

Many employees voluntarily attended the event even after the official activities ended, continuing the interaction and sharing. I believe this experience catalyzed GDOS to naturally expand its purpose.

Minju Kang: GDOS Night was an event planned around the 'Lilly Band,' an in-house club.

Employees who participate in the band as a hobby held a charity concert. We expanded the traditional 'one-day cafe' format by renting an external club space, selling food and drinks, and raising funds.

It was meaningful because it provided a direct platform for employees to participate and spread a culture of donation beyond just a concert.

Q. What is the meaning behind Lilly's core value, 'To unite caring with discovery to make life better for people'?

Yu Seok Kang : We thought deeply about how to integrate caring and discovery into our activities harmoniously. In particular, introducing the unprecedented GDOS Night was meaningful because it expanded the event from a mere gathering of Lilly members into a festival where we could share and personally experience the values the company pursues.

Furthermore, we interpreted the purpose of GDOS differently by introducing a structure that converted the program's proceeds into donations. I believe this series of processes was an attempt to meld the corporate purpose of caring and innovation into overall activities, and a case of seeking new ways through new methods.

Minju Kang: Lilly holds 'Respect for People' as one of its core values, which is based on fundamental respect for human dignity and life. Caring, stemming from this value, has a practical meaning for a pharmaceutical company: providing patients with treatment opportunities and improving their quality of life. At the same time, for such caring to be realized in reality, innovative discovery and continuous R&D investment are essential.

Therefore, Lilly simultaneously pursues a people-centered perspective and the discovery that realizes it. The discovery mentioned here refers to the development of new medicines, which directly links to our corporate purpose, as only innovative treatments can provide substantial benefits to patients. From this perspective, GDOS is not an event separate from the company's daily operations, but an extension of the process where caring and discovery for a better life are connected through activities.

Q. Is there a message you would like to send to the TF preparing for this year's GDOS?

Yu Seok Kang: Last year, we made various attempts based on collaborations with several volunteer organizations. However, since most volunteer groups operate with small numbers, there were constraints on schedules and operational methods during the coordination process for GDOS, which requires large-scale participation.

In the future, we can enhance efficiency and meaning further if collaboration schedules are coordinated and prepared at an even earlier stage. Although there was some trial and error, the process itself, including discussing with TF members and brainstorming ways to maximize employee participation, was very valuable, and I am satisfied with the overall results.

Joohee Lee: The feedback left by CEO after last year's GDOS was also memorable. The suggestion was to consider activities that can deliver hope to patients, caregivers, and the community, aligned with a pharmaceutical company's identity and role. From this perspective, I believe programs that create direct touchpoints with patients, such as the Lilly Band holding a concert for patients, are directions worth considering for the future.

Kim Hyung-min: GDOS is not an activity directly linked to performance metrics, but it is an event we must participate in with a sense of mission, personally practicing the company's values as Lilly employees. Since it required preparation outside of working hours, personal motivation was necessary, and being able to provide momentum to each other while working as a team was a great help. I believe a TF involving members who can voluntarily offer opinions is a crucial element for the future success of GDOS.",https://www.dailypharm.com/image/en_og.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 21:00:12.245127

Those were among the findings of a Royal College of Occupational Therapists (RCOT) survey of the workforce, which was conducted from November 2024 to January 2025 but whose findings were released this week.

The research received responses from 321 local authority OTs, a large majority of whom (80%) reported working in social care.

Most OTs face increasing demand

Over four in five respondents (83%) said there had been an increase in demand for their services over the previous 12 months, above the rate for all OTs who answered the survey (67%).

Also, just over half of councils OTs (52%) reported being ""unable to provide equipment or adaptions when needed"", which was also higher than the average for the whole sample (33%).

They also highlighted relatively high waiting times for their services, with 15% saying these were 12 months or more and the most common response being 3-6 months, compared to less than 12 weeks for the full cohort of survey respondents.

£50m boost to disabled facilities grant funding

The news followed the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) announcing a £50m boost to disabled facilities grant (DFG) funding, taking the total for 2025-26 to £761m.

DFGs fund home adaptations for disabled people, such as widening doors, installing ramps or putting in stairlifts, up to a maximum cost of £30,000, on a means-tested basis. OTs generally assess people for DFGs and determine eligibility.

Care minister Stephen Kinnock said the funding boost ""could support around 5,000 more people to make these vital changes to their homes so they can remain independent and comfortable rather than face a hospital stay or a move into residential care"".

Investment in OTs urged

However, while welcoming the increase, both the RCOT and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) warned that its impact would be limited without additional investment in OTs.

For the college, director of practice and innovation Karin Orman said: ""Without urgent investment in occupational therapists too, people risk waiting longer for expert assessments, which means people can get the changes they need to make their homes safe and accessible. Without occupational therapists, the right support can’t reach the people who need it most, when they need it.""

ADASS chief executive Sally Burlington said: ""Our members tell us that occupational therapy services who are administering the grant still face multiple challenges such as increasing demand, lengthy administration processes including unnecessarily lengthy paperwork, restrictions on what the money can be spent on, and limits to how much can be spent per person meaning local authorities can’t support people quickly enough with this grant.""

As well as boosting investment in OTs, Burlington called on the government to urgently complete and publish a review of the £30,000 funding limit, which has been in place since 2008.

Coris enters Cape Verde banking market

The deal gives Coris full ownership of BCA following the purchase of a 59.81 percent stake previously held by Portugal’s state-owned Caixa Geral de Depósitos. Portugal’s Council of Ministers approved the sale. Financial terms were not disclosed. Coris said the acquisition marks its entry into Cape Verde and is intended to support local businesses, widen access to credit and strengthen trade links between the island nation and other African economies.

After completing the takeover, Coris launched a mandatory public offer to acquire remaining shares from minority investors, in line with Cape Verde’s capital market rules. BCA is listed on the Cape Verde Stock Exchange. Market participants said the move could streamline ownership and give the new owner more room to move on operational changes and expansion plans.

From local lender to regional group

Founded in 2008, Coris Bank International has expanded steadily across West and Central Africa. The group operates in Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal, Togo, Benin, Mali, Guinea and Chad, with branches in Niger and Guinea-Bissau.

Under Nassa, Coris has used acquisitions to broaden its footprint. It opened Coris Bank Guinea in 2021, bought Standard Chartered’s retail operations in Côte d’Ivoire in 2023, and acquired Société Générale’s units in Chad and Mauritania in 2024. Company figures show the group’s assets now exceed $9 billion, up from initial capital of about $3 million at launch.

Fresh capital backs expansion

Coris recently secured a €10 million ($11.6 million) investment from Dutch development finance institution FMO. The funding forms part of a €102 million ($118.43 million) round led by Mediterrania Capital Partners and backed by development lenders including BII, BIO and IFU.

The Burkina Faso-based banking group initially declared its intention to acquire BCA in March 2024, following its designation as the preferred bidder for the Portuguese state's stake. Now that the deal has closed, Cape Verde joins the group as its 11th African market, bolstering its presence in Portuguese-speaking countries.",https://www.billionaires.africa/content/images/2026/01/Idrissa-Nassa-1--1--1.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 16:00:13.009870

AI data centers have been growing rapidly and are undoubtedly reshaping the global data center demand.
Whereas a normal data center uses around 5,000 to 15,000 tons of copper, an AI data center uses around 50,000 tons of copper per facility, more than 3 times the amount of a normal center.
Copper is clearly a metal that is desired in all major growth changes around the world, from sustainable energy production to AI centers and more.
America may already be improving copper rush production, as should the other major nations across the globe.","This digital age of technology and electrification has its perks. It has truly changed how the world lives, works, and connects, offering easy access to anything imaginable. However, this age of technology has also brought with it some heightened demand for certain resources like copper, which might soon reach a pace that production is not able to keep up with.

The dark side of the rise in our digital age

Digitisation and technological advancement certainly have their perks, with improved communication, easy access to information, advancements in healthcare, productivity, efficiency, and economic growth, and job creation, amongst numerous other benefits. While all of these are greatly helpful to the world, they have an unfortunate downside that can go unnoticed.

Increased reliance on digitization and technology means an increase in the need for electricity. This heightened power demand relies heavily on copper, as it is one of the best conductors and essential for wiring. This element is a pretty crucial infrastructure element used in power grids and data centers, as well as for electronic devices, and even renewable energy technology like solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles.

Carlos Pascual, Senior Vice President, Geopolitics and International Affairs, S&P Global Energy, explains the importance of copper:

“Several countries have deemed copper a ‘critical metal’ over the past half decade, including, in 2025, the United States. And with good reason. Copper is the connective artery linking physical machinery, digital intelligence, mobility, infrastructure, communication and security systems; the future availability of copper has become a matter of strategic importance.”

While the demand for copper isn’t an issue right now, it is the predicted increase in demand over the next few years that the world won’t be able to keep up with. One key technological development is going to cause a drastic increase, and it might surprise you.

AI data centers may be to blame for the projected increase in copper demand

It can’t have gone unnoticed by anyone that the AI industry has skyrocketed. AI data centers have been growing rapidly and are undoubtedly reshaping the global data center demand. The market is expanding hugely, and along with it is the use of electricity and its associated copper.

Whereas a normal data center uses around 5,000 to 15,000 tons of copper, an AI data center uses around 50,000 tons of copper per facility, more than 3 times the amount of a normal center.

Daniel Yergin, Vice Chairman, S&P Global, talks about the projected demand:

“Here, in short, is the quandary: copper is the great enabler of electrification, but the accelerating pace of electrification is an increasing challenge for copper. Economic demand, grid expansion, renewable generation, AI computation, digital industries, electric vehicles and defense are scaling all at once—and supply is not on track to keep pace. At stake is whether copper remains an enabler of progress or becomes a bottleneck to growth and innovation.”

This copper demand could lead to a great deficit by 2030

It’s all good and well for the demand of copper to increase, but if the supply cannot keep up, that’s when trouble hits. The IEA has predicted that copper could be in a 30% deficit by 2035, less than a decade away. This would make the metal extremely vulnerable. Copper mining in areas like the Morenci copper mine, as well as brand new locations, will need to increase drastically to avoid such a deficit and turn the supply trajectory around.

Copper is clearly a metal that is desired in all major growth changes around the world, from sustainable energy production to AI centers and more. Primary production of copper is the very foundation of the supply that needs to be reconsidered in light of the future trajectory. America may already be improving copper rush production, as should the other major nations across the globe.

The results that should make investors in airline stocks think again

Delta (NYSE:DAL), one of America’s Big 3 airlines and headquartered in Atlanta, released its Q4 and annual results last week. The other 2 of the ‘Big 3’ are American Airlines and United, although increasingly it is the case that American is trailing Delta and United because while it has an enormous domestic network, it lacks the penetration in the premium travellers market. Sorry for the spoiler alert for what we will soon reveal.

Let’s look at Delta’s Q4 revenue from ‘main cabins’ (i.e. economy) and ‘premium cabins’ (i.e. first class, business class and premium economy). It is common knowledge that airlines make higher margins from premium cabins, although it has still been the case that more revenue overall has been made from economy (even if there are lower margins on each passenger). This is no longer the case. Delta’s main cabin revenue was US$5.62bn and its premium cabin revenue was $5.7bn – these were down 7% and up 9% respectively.

Turning to the full year results and main cabin revenue does exceed premium cabin revenue – $23.39bn to $22.1bn. But again, the former was in decline (by 5%) and the former is in the other direction (up 7%). Overall, passenger revenues were $12.9bn for Q4 (up 1%) and annual revenues were $51.8bn (up 2%). The balance of revenue is made up from loyalty travel awards and travel-related services, $1.6bn in Q4 and $6.3bn for the full year.

The two speed economy

It is common knowledge in any business that it is better to make more money from less people than less money from more people and that is true in the airline business with such high capex and low margins. That is why we are seeing airlines invest so much in premium travel (i.e. cabins and reward programs) rather than economy travel. Look at how ‘premium-heavy’ Qantas’ current 787s are (i.e. the proportion of premium class seats and how much space they take up) and also how the future A350s will be.

But also that while premium travel demand keeps going up and up with no end in sight whilst economy travel demand keeps decreasing due to the two-speed economy that has existed since early 2022. Now, you could say Delta is just one airline…but look at the entire industry and you’ll see the same thing. Spirit Airlines has been in administration for over a year now, JetBlue has not turned a profit since the pandemic, Allegient just snapped up boutique airline Sun Country, and Frontier is struggling too (looking at a merger with Spirit).

What does it mean?

Arguably the key consideration for investors in any airline stock is to what extent it goes after premium travellers, or everyone else. Because if all else goes well (i.e. there are no fleet issues, market disruptions like pandemics and oil prices are reasonable and stable), then that will be the key factor in determining whether or not the airline goes well.",https://stocksdownunder.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/passenger-airplane-flying-in-blue-sky-travel-and-2026-01-11-08-46-35-utc-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 14:59:53.824590

Earnings season intensifies with a diverse lineup spanning financials, industrials, technology, and consumer staples, highlighted by Netflix (NFLX) Tuesday testing streaming economics, Intel (INTC) Thursday providing crucial semiconductor perspectives, and blue-chip stalwarts Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Wednesday and Procter & Gamble (PG) Friday offering consumer health insights.

Wednesday's presidential address takes on heightened market significance as investors seek clarity on economic policy priorities, trade agenda, regulatory approaches, and fiscal plans that will shape the business environment throughout Trump's term. The compressed four-day trading week packs an extraordinary amount of market-moving information into a condensed period, creating potential for significant volatility as participants digest political developments, economic data, and corporate fundamentals simultaneously.

Here are 5 things to watch this week in the Market.

Trump's Economic Policy Address

Wednesday's speech by President Trump at 8:30am represents a critical market catalyst as he outlines economic priorities and policy initiatives for the year ahead. Investors will scrutinize the address for insights into potential tax policy changes, infrastructure spending proposals, regulatory approaches, and crucially, any evolution in trade policy that could impact multinational corporations and global supply chains. Trump's commentary on China relations will be particularly important given ongoing tensions over rare-earth exports, technology restrictions, and trade imbalances that have created market volatility. Any discussion about tariff adjustments, trade agreement modifications, or protectionist measures could trigger immediate sector-specific reactions, particularly in technology, manufacturing, and industrial stocks with significant international exposure. The speech may also address energy policy, healthcare initiatives, and government spending priorities that influence different market sectors. Trump's tone regarding Federal Reserve policy and his relationship with Chair Powell could impact rate-sensitive assets and the dollar. The timing amid earnings season and ahead of Thursday's critical economic data creates a complex backdrop where political rhetoric, corporate results, and economic fundamentals will compete for investor attention and potentially amplify market reactions.

Thursday's Economic Data Convergence

Thursday delivers an unprecedented convergence with both the Q3 GDP revision and November Core PCE Price Index releasing simultaneously at 8:30am, creating potential for significant market volatility as participants digest growth and inflation data together. The GDP revision will provide final perspectives on third-quarter economic expansion, with particular focus on consumer spending contributions, business investment patterns, and net export dynamics. Any material revisions to previous estimates could influence perceptions about economic momentum entering 2026. The Core PCE Price Index represents the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure and will be crucial for assessing whether price pressures moderated through year-end or remained stubbornly elevated. The dual release creates complex interpretation challenges as markets must simultaneously weigh growth strength against inflation concerns to determine appropriate Fed policy expectations. Strong GDP combined with elevated inflation could pressure rate-sensitive sectors by reducing accommodation expectations, while weak growth with moderating inflation could support dovish positioning. Friday's Manufacturing and Services PMI data will provide forward-looking perspectives on business conditions entering 2026.

Netflix and Streaming Economics Reality Check

Tuesday's Netflix (NFLX) earnings will provide critical insights into streaming industry economics, subscriber growth sustainability, and content investment return on investment as competition intensifies from Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and other platforms. The results will be scrutinized for subscriber additions across different regions, average revenue per user trends, and crucially, the success of password-sharing crackdowns and advertising tier adoption. Netflix's commentary about content spending levels, churn rates, and pricing power will help determine whether the streaming model can deliver consistent profitability or faces structural challenges from content cost inflation and subscriber saturation. The company's guidance about 2026 subscriber growth and margin expansion will be particularly important given recent stock strength. Netflix represents a bellwether for digital media transformation and consumer discretionary spending on entertainment, making its results relevant beyond just streaming stocks. Strong results could validate premium valuations for technology platform businesses, while disappointments could raise questions about growth sustainability in maturing digital markets.

Industrial and Technology Crossroads

Thursday's earnings convergence from Intel (INTC), GE Aerospace (GE), and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) will provide diverse perspectives on semiconductor turnaround efforts, aerospace demand, and commodity market dynamics. Intel's results represent a critical test of the company's manufacturing transformation and competitive positioning against Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung in advanced chipmaking. Intel's foundry business progress, government subsidy utilization, and data center chip competitiveness will be closely watched following years of market share losses to AMD and Arm-based alternatives. GE Aerospace will offer insights into commercial aviation demand, defense spending trends, and jet engine maintenance cycles that serve as leading indicators for industrial activity. Freeport's results will provide copper market perspectives relevant for infrastructure investment and clean energy transition themes. Tuesday's 3M (MMM) and Fastenal (FAST) earnings will add industrial distribution and manufacturing supply perspectives.

Consumer Staples and Financial Services Health

The week features several blue-chip consumer and financial companies providing foundational economic insights. Wednesday's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) earnings will offer perspectives on pharmaceutical demand, medical device markets, and healthcare spending trends, while Friday's Procter & Gamble (PG) results will provide comprehensive consumer staples insights across personal care, household products, and beauty categories. P&G's pricing power, volume trends, and emerging market performance will help assess consumer resilience amid economic uncertainties. Wednesday's Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Truist Financial (TFC) earnings will complement last week's major bank results with perspectives on wealth management, retail banking, and regional financial institution health. Tuesday's U.S. Bancorp (USB) will add Midwestern banking perspectives. Friday's Schlumberger (SLB) results will provide energy services insights about oil and gas exploration activity and international drilling demand. The diversity of sectors reporting creates opportunities to assess which areas of the economy are showing strength versus weakness as 2026 begins.

In December 2024, I predicted that Nvidia would be a better Dow stock to buy than Amazon because of its reasonable valuation and superior business model. The recommendation was intended for long-term investors, not those seeking to make a quick profit on a one-year time horizon.

Still, the call has been right so far, with Nvidia gaining 38.9% in 2025 compared to just 5.2% for Amazon. In fact, Amazon was the worst ""Magnificent Seven"" stock in 2025 -- underperforming Nvidia, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Tesla.

Even after Nvidia's big 2025 gain, it remains a better buy than Amazon. Here's why.

Amazon's success is largely tied to AWS

In its most recent quarter, Amazon achieved an operating margin of just 4.1% on its non-Amazon Web Services (AWS) business, which encompasses its online and physical stores, advertising, subscription services, third-party commissions, fulfillment, and shipping fees, and its miscellaneous ""other"" category. AWS is so profitable that it made up 60% of Amazon's operating income for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2025, even though it's less than a fifth of total Amazon sales.

With 35.6% operating margins for the nine months ended Sept. 30, AWS is a high-powered cash cow and the crown jewel in Amazon's crown. But AWS growth has slowed in recent years as it faces mounting competition from Microsoft, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and Oracle.

Rubin could open the door to new revenue streams for Nvidia

While AWS helps fuel Amazon's broader business, Nvidia is more of a pure-play artificial intelligence (AI) company. Its data center sales now make up around 90% of total revenue. And the other 10% of the business is also high margin, with end markets like gaming, professional visualization, automation, and robotics.

Nvidia's presentation at CES earlier this month showcased its new Rubin architecture, which consists of six different chips designed for the next stage of AI advancement -- agentic AI, robotics, and autonomous driving. Nvidia is releasing Rubin ahead of schedule, with deployments to hyperscalers -- including AWS -- on track for the second half of 2026.

Despite its size, the law of large numbers hasn't caught up to Nvidia. It continues to grow earnings at a breakneck pace and defends its high margins thanks to its innovation. Rubin goes beyond the graphics processing unit (GPU) with networking, interconnections, and central processing units (CPUs) for rack-scale readiness. With Nvidia playing a bigger role in AI data centers, there's every reason to believe the stock can keep roaring higher.

Nvidia is a better value for long-term investors

Nvidia's high margins and break-even growth rate justify a higher valuation than Amazon. Amazon has become more affordable because its earnings grew faster than its stock price last year. Amazon is cheaper than Nvidia, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 30.1 compared to 39 for Nvidia.

However, I'd still take Nvidia over Amazon because of its growth potential. If Nvidia's data center business does eventually cool off, it could easily more than offset a potential slowdown with new opportunities in other facets of its business. At the same time, Amazon depends heavily on AWS, and there's only so much room for margin expansion in its e-commerce business.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F851458%2Fabstract-rendering-of-light-emerging-from-computer-components-illustrating-the-growing-importance-of-artificial-intelligence-ai.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-18 15:00:02.744295

IBM announced IBM Sovereign Core, which is AI-ready, sovereign-enabled software for enterprises, governments, and service providers. The solution is purpose-built software to build, deploy, and manage cloud-native and AI workloads under an organization’s own authority, within chosen jurisdictions, built on Red Hat’s open-source foundation. Unlike approaches that layer sovereignty controls onto existing architectures, Sovereign Core makes sovereignty an inherent property of the software itself. Using it, organizations can gain:

Customer-operated control plane: organizations maintain direct operational authority over software operations, deployment decisions, and system configurations without intermediation from a vendor not in the region.

In-boundary identity and keys: all authentication, authorization, encryption keys, and access management remain within jurisdiction boundaries under customer control.

Ongoing compliance enablement and generated evidence of continuous compliance: comprehensive operational data, system telemetry, and audit trails are generated, stored, and managed within the sovereign boundary, including automated identity.

Governed AI inference: AI model deployment and hosting, local GPU clusters, local inference execution, and agent operations occur under local governance with traceability and oversight, without exporting data to external providers.

ID33,OpenAI,2026-01-18 17:08:37+00:00,RAPPLER,[Tech Thoughts] OpenAI's ChatGPT will test out ads. Here's what to expect. - Rappler,Victor Barreiro Jr,,,,,https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/openai-chatgpt-testing-ads-what-to-know/,"On Friday, January 16, OpenAI announced a number of updates that would be coming to its ChatGPT chatbot.
What ChatGPT with ads is promising OpenAI’s announcement for the eventual introduction of ads to ChatGPT comes with its own mission statement, which feels admirable, if a little off-putting.
According to their announcement, advertising on ChatGPT will also be separated from the actual answers it gives users, and will thus not influence ChatGPT’s responses.
The introduction of ads is a potential starting point of this second stage of enshittification.
It stands to reason that the advertising gambit is the start of OpenAI’s attempts to earn itself more money for sustenance.","On Friday, January 16, OpenAI announced a number of updates that would be coming to its ChatGPT chatbot. In addition to launching ChatGPT Go, its $8-priced subscription tier, worldwide, ChatGPT will also eventually be testing out advertising for its free and Go tiers in the United States in the coming weeks.

According to OpenAI, the move to add advertising to ChatGPT is “so more people can benefit from our tools with fewer usage limits or without having to pay.”

What might users expect from a ChatGPT with advertisements? We can examine the fine print by reading the company’s announcement, but we can also discuss how it might play out in the long run.

What ChatGPT with ads is promising

OpenAI’s announcement for the eventual introduction of ads to ChatGPT comes with its own mission statement, which feels admirable, if a little off-putting.

Said OpenAI, “Our mission is to ensure AGI (artificial general intelligence) benefits all of humanity; our pursuit of advertising is always in support of that mission and making AI more accessible.”

It added that it’s aiming for the long-term value of ChatGPT, with the priority being “user trust and user experience over revenue.” This, despite seeking to put ads into its free and low-cost subscription tiers.

According to their announcement, advertising on ChatGPT will also be separated from the actual answers it gives users, and will thus not influence ChatGPT’s responses. Said OpenAI, “Answers are optimized based on what’s most helpful to you.”

The idea is to show ads after your answers, and, if you’re curious enough, you can ask the ChatGPT interface to tell you more about the advertisement presented.

That said, ChatGPT conversations are also said to be “private from advertisers.” Further, OpenAI promises to “never sell your data to advertisers.”

Users will also have control over their data and the ability to turn off personalization and clear the data users from ads when they want to. OpenAI went on to say the quiet part out loud: “We’ll always offer a way to not see ads in ChatGPT, including a paid tier that’s ad-free,” which can ostensibly be read as, “Subscribe to our higher-tiered service so you can use it without dealing with everything we’ve just written down in this announcement post!”

Enshittification, stage two?

As OpenAI seeks to make money from its artificial intelligence venture, users may have to reckon with actions similar to this moving forward. This is enshittification — the process by which a service or online platform degrades in quality — as it happens.

As Cory Doctorow’s process of enshittification might indicate, we are presumably hovering between its first and second phases, where, after attracting a user base, a given platform will start degrading the user experience to favor business customers.

The introduction of ads is a potential starting point of this second stage of enshittification. Reducing the feature set of a product for users who were previously used to getting everything for free is another indicator of this second stage.

One example of such enshittification that might be relevant to this case would be how Google’s search engine degraded over time. After garnering a large user base (Stage 1) by offering relevant search results and very limited advertising, the site degraded after increasing advertising, enabling search engine optimization and, in some cases, fraud to the advantage of advertising customers (Stage 2).

Stage 3 is when when a company abuses its business customers as it seeks value for shareholders of that company. In Google’s case, it might be argued that its work on inserting AI itself into search is its third stage.

The inevitable?

We must remember that OpenAI, for all its bells and whistles, is a loss-maker.

Fortune, citing HSBC Global Investment Research, projects OpenAI will still not be profitable by 2030, while its user base is estimated to grow to some 44% of the world’s adult population. Adding to this is the need for more cash and resources: at least another estimated $207 billion of computing power to maintain growth plans relative to current realities.

AI needs a lot of money to build infrastructure to support itself, and in a competitive market, there’s only so much to go around. Unfortunately, the introduction of advertising into artificial intelligence chatbots seemed like an all-too-common inevitability, especially given technological history.

How might this play out in the long run? It stands to reason that the advertising gambit is the start of OpenAI’s attempts to earn itself more money for sustenance.",https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2026/01/chatgpt-ads-jan-17-2025.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 13:01:58.166928

You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.
So What Do The Albertsons Companies Insider Transactions Indicate?
An insider sold Albertsons Companies shares recently, but they didn't buy any.
For example - Albertsons Companies has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.","We wouldn't blame Albertsons Companies, Inc. (NYSE:ACI) shareholders if they were a little worried about the fact that Michael Theilmann, the Executive VP and Chief Human Resources Officer recently netted about US$864k selling shares at an average price of US$17.63. That sale reduced their total holding by 14% which is hardly insignificant, but far from the worst we've seen.

Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Albertsons Companies

Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP and Chief Technology & Transformation Officer, Anuj Dhanda, for US$4.4m worth of shares, at about US$19.25 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$17.32. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.

Albertsons Companies insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!

If you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).

Insider Ownership

For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Albertsons Companies insiders own 1.5% of the company, currently worth about US$135m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.

So What Do The Albertsons Companies Insider Transactions Indicate?

An insider sold Albertsons Companies shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example - Albertsons Companies has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.

Of course Albertsons Companies may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.

The 25-per cent tariff, effective Thursday, applies to chips that are ‘transshipped through the United States to other foreign countries,’ White House staff secretary Will Scharf said at an event.
This covers technology like the Nvidia H200 chip and AMD’s MI325X, a government fact sheet added.
‘China wants them, and other people want them, and we’re going to be making 25 per cent on the sale of those chips,’ Trump said at an event on Wednesday.
The order follows an investigation into imports of chips and chip-making equipment launched last year.","President Donald Trump signed an order Wednesday imposing tariffs on imports of certain semiconductors, a necessary step in the White House’s decision to allow Nvidia to sell advanced AI chips to China.

The 25-per cent tariff, effective Thursday, applies to chips that are ‘transshipped through the United States to other foreign countries,’ White House staff secretary Will Scharf said at an event.

This covers technology like the Nvidia H200 chip and AMD’s MI325X, a government fact sheet added.

Trump said last month that he reached an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping to allow US chip giant Nvidia to export the H200s into China, with the US government getting a 25-per cent cut of sales.

The deal was confirmed by the US Commerce Department on Tuesday.

The change will permit Nvidia to sell its powerful H200 chip to Chinese buyers if certain conditions are met — including proof of ‘sufficient’ US supply — while sales of its most advanced processors would still be blocked.

‘China wants them, and other people want them, and we’re going to be making 25 per cent on the sale of those chips,’ Trump said at an event on Wednesday.

However, uncertainty has grown over how much demand there will be from Chinese companies, as Beijing has reportedly been encouraging tech companies to use homegrown chips.

The move marked a significant shift in US export policy for advanced AI chips, which Joe Biden’s administration had heavily restricted over national security concerns about Chinese military applications.

Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle in Congress have criticized the move as a mistake that will help China’s military and economy.

Separately, Wednesday’s order directed US trade officials to continue negotiations relating to the imports of semiconductors and chip-making equipment into the United States, as Washington tries to spur domestic manufacturing in the critical sector.

The order follows an investigation into imports of chips and chip-making equipment launched last year.

The probes were initiated under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, the same legal mechanism that Trump previously used to impose other sector-specific duties.",https://outspoken.newagebd.com/files/img/202601/67ba72466ba1a39941abcfa45889583e_og.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 13:01:37.370623

Lodging stocks were mixed. AHT rose 5%, BHR was down -5%.

In observance of the Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday, there will be no Daily Lodging Report on Monday, January 19th.

Barclays said Hyatt is their most favored lodging name but while lodging stocks have moved up on anticipation of better macro, they expect another soft-ish 4Q and at best, an in-line 2026. Barclays expects incremental hopefulness around a return to industry growth in 2026, driven by easy comps, the calendar and events (World Cup and America250), signs of more supportive domestic macro and tax refunds. Barclays believes a moderate RevPAR acceleration and development momentum are already priced into the stocks. They expect STR/CoStar to update RevPAR projections at ALIS, with a slight uptick in demand/pricing.

Morgan Stanley said their most preferred lodging name is Hyatt and their least preferred are Choice Hotels and Marriott Vacations. They downgraded VAC to Underweight from Equal Weight and Hilton Grand Vacations to Equal Weight from Overweight. They believe consumers should benefit from stimulus and businesses appear poised to increase travel but the cycle is later for services. They remain Overweight Travel+Leisure, Hilton, Marriott, and Wyndham, as well as H.

Wells Fargo reiterated their preference for HLT and MAR as they view NUG and FCF as the means of differentiation in the sector. They remain Equal Weight the C-Corps and Underweight the Timeshare names given ongoing growth concerns. WF said they have never been a big believer in one time events significantly moving stocks so they expect investors to only give credit to ex-World Cup growth levels.

The recent insider purchase and fresh analyst coverage come as Park Hotels & Resorts trades at US$11.42. The 30-day share price return is 4.58% and the year-to-date share price return is 6.04%. Meanwhile, the 1-year total shareholder return shows an 8.02% decline, which contrasts with a 22.71% gain over three years. This suggests that longer term holders have seen stronger overall outcomes than more recent investors.

If insider interest has you looking more closely at REITs and income ideas, it can also be a good moment to broaden your search with .

So with insiders buying, mixed analyst views, a recent one-year decline and a long-term gain, is Park Hotels & Resorts now trading below its underlying value, or is the market already pricing in future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 10% Undervalued

Against the last close of US$11.42, the most followed narrative points to a fair value of about US$12.69, suggesting some upside based on its long term earnings and cash flow outlook under a 11.99% discount rate.

Significant reinvestment and renovations in key resort and urban assets (e.g., Royal Palm South Beach, Hilton Hawaiian Village, Waldorf Astoria Orlando) are expected to drive outsized growth in RevPAR, occupancy, and EBITDA once projects stabilize, leveraging travelers' increasing desire for experiential and high-end accommodations, which is likely to support above-market revenue and net margin expansion.

Curious what has to happen on revenue, margins, and earnings for that valuation to hold up? The narrative leans on specific timelines and profit assumptions. Want the full picture?

Result: Fair Value of $12.69 (UNDERVALUED)

However, there are still meaningful risks here, including the need to refinance over US$1.3b of debt in 2026, as well as pressure on margins from higher labor costs and softer travel demand.

Analyst Consensus and Price Targets The broader analyst sentiment remains favorable.
The consensus price target among these firms stands at $103.12, implying a potential upside of about 8% from recent levels.
Entergy shares are currently trading near the upper end of their 52-week range, which spans from $75.55 to $98.58.","While Barclays reaffirmed its bullish stance on Entergy Corporation (ETR) late last week, a contrasting signal emerged from within the company's own ranks. The financial institution maintained its ""Buy"" recommendation and a $96.00 price target on the utility stock, which was trading near $95.60 at the time. This vote of confidence, however, coincides with regulatory filings showing a company insider selling a portion of their holdings.

The recent activity presents a nuanced picture for investors. On one hand, Barclays' reiterated ""Buy"" rating underscores a continued positive outlook from the analyst community. On the other, a Form 4 filing with the SEC revealed that an Entergy officer, Eliécer Viamontes, disposed of 947 shares for approximately $92,010. This transaction contributes to a broader six-month trend where selling activity has outweighed buying among the company's management.

Entergy's stock demonstrated notable resilience last Friday, holding steady around $95.60. This performance stood in stark contrast to sector peers like Constellation Energy and Vistra, which saw significant declines of roughly 10% and 8%, respectively, following reports concerning potential nationwide grid reforms.

Growth Projects and Premium Valuation

Central to Entergy's investment thesis are two major natural gas-fired power projects underway in Texas: the Legend Power Station in Port Arthur and the Lone Star 9 facility in Cleveland. With an estimated investment of $1.6 billion for the Legend project alone, the combined output of these plants is slated to exceed 1,200 megawatts by mid-2028. This expansion is designed to meet rising industrial demand in the region, which includes a planned $1.3 billion artificial intelligence data center in Port Arthur.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Entergy?

The market appears to be pricing in this anticipated growth. Entergy currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.79, a premium to some utility counterparts such as Exelon, which trades around 15.9 times earnings. Management has targeted earnings-per-share (EPS) growth exceeding 8% through 2028 and recently increased its capital expenditure plan by $3 billion to support an expected industrial growth rate of approximately 13% CAGR.

Analyst Consensus and Price Targets

The broader analyst sentiment remains favorable. Of the 17 analysts currently covering the stock, 76% rate it as a ""Buy"" or ""Strong Buy,"" with the remainder advising ""Hold."" The consensus price target among these firms stands at $103.12, implying a potential upside of about 8% from recent levels. Barclays' more conservative $96.00 target sits below this average. Entergy shares are currently trading near the upper end of their 52-week range, which spans from $75.55 to $98.58.

The Path Forward

The upcoming quarterly earnings report is viewed as the next significant catalyst. Investors will be scrutinizing whether management's raised forecasts are materializing through tangible increases in industrial demand and demonstrable progress on the Texas construction timelines. The successful on-time and on-budget completion of the Legend and Lone Star projects is considered crucial for supporting the projected EPS growth and justifying the stock's current premium valuation. Conversely, any material delays or cost overruns could place downward pressure on the company's valuation multiples.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2435388_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 10:00:04.540482

When you attend CES for the third time in a row since the pandemic, you stop being dazzled by spectacle. You start paying attention to what is actually changing. This year, the change was unmistakable.

Walking through the Venetian, one of CES 2026’s main convention hubs, something felt different. Not louder. Not trendier. More grounded. For the first time, accessibility was not hidden. It was not tucked into side rooms or framed as a specialty topic. The CTA Foundation Accessibility Stage, powered by Verizon, sat front and center inside the Venetian.

The appointment of Johnson and the recent launch of the ARGOS fluids brand come after a mixed stretch for investors. The 30 day share price return is 6.93%, while the 3 year total shareholder return has declined by 68.67%. This suggests that long term momentum has weakened even as shorter term sentiment has improved.

If you are looking beyond Advance Auto Parts for other auto related ideas, this could be a good moment to scan for fresh opportunities across the vehicle value chain.

With a 68.67% three year total shareholder return decline, recent share price gains, and a discount to analyst targets, investors are left asking a simple question: is AAP a reset value opportunity, or is the market already pricing in future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 20.4% Undervalued

Against the last close of US$43.20, the most followed narrative points to a fair value of US$54.30, framing Advance Auto Parts as undervalued on its own assumptions.

Advance Auto Parts is executing a 3-year strategic plan focused on improving profitability. Initiatives such as optimizing its asset base and divesting noncore operations are expected to deliver adjusted operating margins of approximately 7% by 2027, which could enhance net margins and earnings.

Curious how a business with recent losses is modeled to swing back to profits, grow margins, and still carry a modest future P/E? The narrative leans on gradual revenue improvement, margin repair and a valuation multiple that stays below the current industry average. If you want to see how those moving parts combine into that fair value, the full story lays out every assumption.

Result: Fair Value of US$54.30 (UNDERVALUED)

However, you still need to weigh risks such as weaker than expected sales trends and the costs and complexity of closing hundreds of stores, which could pressure margins.

Another View: Our DCF Flags Overvaluation

While the most popular narrative points to a fair value of US$54.30, our DCF model lands in a very different place. On that framework, AAP trades above an estimated fair value of US$6.94, which implies a wide gap that could matter if sentiment cools.

Under the leadership of Carolina Martinoli, this roadmap marks a historic turning point with a major technological transition involving the gradual phasing out of Airbus in favor of a fleet that aims to become 100% Boeing, a choice driven by a quest for homogeneity and absolute operational efficiency.
The first concrete step in this transformation will begin in the last quarter of 2026 with the integration of the first 50 Boeing 737 Max aircraft (versions 8-200 and 10) ordered by IAG, paving the way for a complete renewal of its current fleet of 130 aircraft, subject to achieving profitability targets.

GTT estimates that around 150 new LNG carriers will be needed to transport the volumes produced from LNG projects that have already been approved.

Centered on Liquefied Natural Gas Carrier (LNG carrier) orders, the scope of contracts is expanding to include large gas carriers and tankers.

According to industry sources on the 18th, HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (HDKSOE) recently signed a contract with a shipping company in the Americas to build four LNG carriers worth 1.4993 trillion won. The contract also includes options for four additional vessels, raising expectations for further orders.

Previously, Hanwha Ocean Co., Ltd. won an order last month for seven LNG carriers worth 2.5891 trillion won, and Samsung Heavy Industries also succeeded in securing an order in the same month for two LNG carriers worth 721.1 billion won.

The industry expects orders for LNG carriers to increase this year. Last year, high ship prices and delays in Final Investment Decision (FID) on major LNG projects dampened ordering activity. Annual orders amounted to just 31 LNG carriers: seven for HDKSOE, 13 for Hanwha Ocean Co., Ltd., and 11 for Samsung Heavy Industries.

This year, however, as FID decisions are being finalized one after another, particularly in the United States, expectations are rising for a resumption of ordering. According to Clarksons Research, global orders for LNG carriers are projected to reach 115 vessels this year. It explains that the expansion of new LNG project development, combined with replacement demand for aging vessels, will drive the increase in orders.

French engineering company Gaztransport & Technigaz (GTT) is presenting an even more aggressive outlook. GTT estimates that around 150 new LNG carriers will be needed to transport the volumes produced from LNG projects that have already been approved.

LNG carriers are a vessel type that requires advanced technology and are regarded as a flagship segment for South Korea's shipbuilding industry. The industry believes that if ordering continues this year, a substantial portion of the contracts is highly likely to be captured by Korean shipbuilders.

Although Chinese shipyards are rapidly improving their LNG carrier construction capabilities, global shipowners are still said to prefer Korean shipbuilders. As shipowners place a premium on proven construction track records, the technological prowess and reliability of Korean yards are seen as key competitive advantages.

Byun Yong-jin, an analyst at iM Securities, said, ""China's LNG carrier construction capabilities are improving, but except for Hudong–Zhonghua Shipbuilding (Group) Co., Ltd., other shipyards still face a significant technology gap,"" adding, ""Because it is unlikely that global LNG shipping companies will place many orders in China, we expect South Korea to maintain its dominance in LNG carriers for the time being.""

The order momentum centered on LNG carriers is also spreading to other high value-added vessel types. Since the start of the year, Hanwha Ocean Co., Ltd. has secured an order from a Middle Eastern shipowner for three Very Large Crude Oil Carrier (VLCC) vessels worth 572.2 billion won. With the global VLCC fleet aging rapidly, some observers expect continued newbuilding demand focused on replacing older vessels.

Eom Kyung-ah, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co., Ltd., noted, ""Korean shipbuilders are continuing a strategy of expanding their order portfolios around high value-added vessel types that can be built at their Korean yards,"" and added, ""It is important to secure an early foothold in regions such as the United States where vessel demand is expected to grow over the medium to long term.""

Japanese shipping company Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd. (MOL) and India’s state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) have set up a joint venture to order two Very Large Ethane Carrier (VLEC) vessels and are reportedly in talks with Korean shipbuilders. Canada-based shipowner Seaspan Corporation is also considering placing VLEC orders as it moves into the ethane transport business.

Market research firm Research and Markets forecasts that the global ethane market will reach 21.45 billion dollars by 2035.

The expansion in orders is not limited to major shipbuilders but is also spreading to small and mid-sized yards. Daehan Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. recently won orders this month for four Suezmax-class oil tanker vessels, recording about 500 billion won in contract value and achieving 30% of its annual order target. A Suezmax-class oil tanker is the largest size of crude oil carrier that can transit the Suez Canal when fully loaded.

He argued that, while FP64 emulation certainly warrants further research and experimentation, it's not quite ready for prime time.
In other words, whether or not FP64 emulation makes sense actually depends on the application in question.
One of the major sticking points for AMD is that FP64 emulation isn't exactly IEEE compliant.
Meanwhile, Nvidia has developed supplemental algorithms to detect and mitigate issues like non-numbers, infinite numbers, and inefficient emulation operations.","Double precision floating point computation (aka FP64) is what keeps modern aircraft in the sky, rockets going up, vaccines effective, and, yes, nuclear weapons operational. But rather than building dedicated chips that process this essential data type in hardware, Nvidia is leaning on emulation to increase performance for HPC and scientific computing applications, an area where AMD has had the lead in recent generations.

This emulation, we should note, hasn't replaced hardware FP64 in Nvidia's GPUs. Nvidia's newly unveiled Rubin GPUs still deliver about 33 teraFLOPS of peak FP64 performance, but that's actually one teraFLOP less than the now four-year-old H100.

If you switch on software emulation in Nvidia's CUDA libraries, the chip can purportedly achieve up to 200 teraFLOPS of FP64 matrix performance. That's 4.4x of what its outgoing Blackwell accelerators could muster in hardware.

On paper, Rubin isn't just Nvidia's most powerful AI accelerator ever, but it's the most potent GPU for scientific computing in years.

""What we found is, through many studies with partners and with our own internal investigations, is that the accuracy that we get from emulation is at least as good as what we would get out of a tensor core piece of hardware,"" Dan Ernst, senior director of supercomputing products at Nvidia, told El Reg.

Emulated FP64, which is not exclusive to Nvidia, has the potential to dramatically improve the throughput and efficiency of modern GPUs. But not everyone is convinced.

""It's quite good in some of the benchmarks, it's not obvious it's good in real, physical scientific simulations,"" Nicholas Malaya, an AMD fellow, told us. He argued that, while FP64 emulation certainly warrants further research and experimentation, it's not quite ready for prime time.

Why FP64 still matters in the age of AI

Even as chip designs push for ever lower-precision data types, FP64 remains the gold standard for scientific computing for good reason. FP64 is unmatched in its dynamic range, capable of expressing more than 18.44 quintillion (264) unique values.

To put that in perspective,-modern AI models like DeepSeek R1 are commonly trained at FP8, which can express a paltry 256 unique values. Taking advantage of general homogeneity of neural networks, block-floating-point data types like MXFP8 or MXFP4 can be used to expand their dynamic range.

That's fine for the fuzzy math that defines large language models, but it's no replacement for FP64, particularly when it's the difference between life or death.

Unlike AI workloads, which are highly error-tolerant, HPC simulations rely on fundamental physical principles like conservation of mass and energy. ""As soon as you start incurring errors, these finite errors propagate, and they cause things like blow ups,"" Malaya said.

Emulated FP64 and the Ozaki scheme

The idea of using lower-precision, often integer datatypes, to emulate FP64 isn't a new idea. ""Emulation is old as dirt,"" Ernst said. ""We had emulation in the mid '50s before we had hardware for floating point.""

This process required significantly more operations to complete, and often incurred a stiff performance penalty as a result, but enabled floating point mathematics even when hardware lacked a dedicated floating point unit (FPU).

By the 1980s, FPUs were becoming commonplace and the need for emulation largely disappeared. However, in early 2024, researchers at the Tokyo and Shibaura institutes of technology published a paper reviving the concept by showing that FP64 matrix operations could be decomposed into multiple INT8 operations that, when run on Nvidia's tensor cores, achieved higher-than-native performance.

This approach is commonly referred to as the Ozaki scheme, and it's the foundation for Nvidia's own FP64 emulation libraries, which were released late last year. And, as Ernst was quick to point out, ""it's still FP64. It's not mixed precision. It's just done and constructed in a different way from the hardware perspective.""

Modern GPUs are packed with low-precision tensor cores. Even without the fancy adaptive compression found in Rubin's tensor cores, the chips are capable of 35 petaFLOPS of dense FP4 compute. By comparison, at FP64, the chips are more than 1,000x slower.

These low-precision tensor cores are really efficient to build and run, so the question became why not use them to do FP64, Ernst explained. ""We have the hardware, let's try use it. That's the history of supercomputing.""

But is it actually accurate?

While Nvidia is keen to highlight the capabilities FP64 emulation enables on its Rubin and even its older Blackwell GPUs, rival AMD doesn't believe the approach is quite ready.

According to Malaya, FP64 emulation works best for well-conditioned numerical systems, with the High Performance Linpack (HPL) bench being a prime example. ""But when you look at material science, combustion codes, banded linear algebra systems, things like that, they are much less well conditioned systems, and suddenly it starts to break down,"" he said.

In other words, whether or not FP64 emulation makes sense actually depends on the application in question. For some it's fine, while in others it's not.

One of the major sticking points for AMD is that FP64 emulation isn't exactly IEEE compliant. Nvidia's algorithms don't account for things like positive versus negative zeros, not number errors, or infinite number errors.

Because of this, small errors in the intermediary operations used to emulate the higher precision can result in perturbations that can throw off the final result, Malaya explained.

One way around this is to increase the number of operations used. However, at a certain point, the sheer number of operations required outweighs any advantage emulation might have provided.

All of those operations also take up memory. ""We have data that shows you're using about twice the memory capacity in Ozaki to emulate that FP64 matrices,"" Malaya said.

For these reasons, the House of Zen is focusing its attention on specialized hardware for applications that rely on double and single precision. Its upcoming MI430X takes advantage of AMD's chiplet architecture to bolster double and single precision hardware performance.

Filling the gaps

The challenges facing FP64 emulation algorithms like the Ozaki scheme aren't lost on Ernst, who is well aware of the gaps in Nvidia's implementation.

Ernst contended that, for most HPC practitioners, things like positive negative zeroes aren't that big a deal. Meanwhile, Nvidia has developed supplemental algorithms to detect and mitigate issues like non-numbers, infinite numbers, and inefficient emulation operations.

As for memory consumption, Ernst conceded that it can be a bit higher but emphasized that this overhead is relative to the operation not the application itself. Most of the time, he said, we're talking about matrices that are at most a few gigabytes in size.

So while it's true that FP64 emulation isn't IEEE-compliant, whether this actually matters is heavily dependent on the application in question, Ernst argued. ""Most of the use cases where IEEE compliance ordering rules are in play don't come up in matrix, matrix multiplication cases. There's not a DGEMM that tends to actually follow that rule anyway,"" he said.

Great for matrices, not so much for vectors

Even if Nvidia can overcome the potential pitfalls of FP64 emulation, it doesn't change the fact that the method is only useful for a subset of HPC applications that rely on dense general matrix multiply (DGEMM) operations.

According to Malaya, for somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of HPC workloads, emulation offers little to no benefit.

""In our analysis the vast majority of real HPC workloads rely on vector FMA, not DGEMM,"" he said. ""I wouldn't say it's a tiny fraction of the market, but it's actually a niche piece.""

For vector-heavy workloads, like computational fluid dynamics, Nvidia's Rubin GPUs are forced to run on the slower FP64 vector accelerators in the chip's CUDA cores.

However, as Ernst was quick to point out: more FLOPS doesn't always mean useful FLOPS. The same workloads that tend to run on the FP64 vector engines rarely manage to harness more than a fraction of the chip's theoretical performance, all because the memory can't keep up.

We see this quite clearly on the TOP500's vector-heavy High Performance Conjugate Gradient benchmark where CPUs tend to dominate thanks to the higher ratio of bits per FLOPS afforded by their memory subsystems.

Rubin may not deliver the fastest FP64 vector perf, but with 22 TB/s of HBM4 its real world performance in these workloads, it is likely to be much higher than the spec sheet would suggest.

Ready or not, here FP64 emulation comes

With an influx of new supercomputers powered by Nvidia's Blackwell and Rubin GPUs coming online over the next few years, any questions regarding the viability of FP64 emulation will be put to the test sooner rather than later.

And since this emulation isn't tied to specific hardware, there's the potential for the algorithms to improve over time as researchers uncover scenarios where the technique excels or struggles.

Despite Malaya's concerns, he noted that AMD is also investigating the use of FP64 emulation on chips like the MI355X, through software flags, to see where it may be appropriate.

IEEE compliance, he told us, would go a long way towards validating the approach by ensuring that the results you get from emulation are the same as what you'd get from dedicated silicon.

""If I can go to a partner and say run these two binaries: this one gives you the same answer as the other and is faster, and yeah under the hood we're doing some scheme — think that's a compelling argument that is ready for prime time,"" Malaya said.

It may turn out that, for some applications, emulation is more reliable than others, he noted. ""We should, as a community, build a basket of apps to look at. I think that's the way to progress here."" ®",https://regmedia.co.uk/2026/01/16/shutterstock_376438123.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 07:59:07.541285

In 2026, the GC’s role continues to evolve from reconciling data to integrating operations, keeping complex, multi-party projects aligned through shared information and disciplined execution.","The construction industry has spent years discussing digital transformation while inching away from manual, paper-based processes. That conversation is now outdated. This next phase isn’t about converting paper to pixels but about building a fundamentally new operating model.

Throughout 2026, we predict the performance gap will be stark between organizations that rely solely on experience and those that blend human insight with data-driven intelligence. Leading the charge will be companies that treat data as a core strategic asset, and mold their workflows, systems and decisions around those insights.

Here, I explore several areas that will define the construction and engineering sector in 2026:

The Job Site Learns to Manage Itself

Labor constraints will persist, making automation a practical necessity. In 2026, job sites are expected to become adaptive systems, with computer vision, IoT sensors and geofencing technologies providing on-the-ground truth. Schedules will move from static networks to living plans that adjust to weather, equipment status, deliveries and crew availability. Assignments and lookahead plans will update as conditions change, ensuring the right trades and equipment are positioned at the right time for less manual triage.

Human expertise will remain integral but applied differently. Experienced supervisors will spend more time on validation recommendations, resolving edge cases and mentoring newer workers. Robotics and semi-autonomous equipment take on repetitive and higher-risk tasks – layout, scanning, rebar tying, and certain welds under controlled conditions. With industry estimates suggesting about 500,000 new workers needed to meet demand, a model that pairs human judgment with automated execution is the realistic path to sustained productivity. The GC’s role will include selecting tools, setting guardrails and ensuring that site operations function as a coherent system.

The General Contractor is the New Orchestrator

Increased visibility for owners does not diminish the GC’s role; it elevates their impact. Automated monitoring and analysis now handle routine progress tracking, risk identification and deviation detection. The GC’s highest-value work is orchestration: managing by exception, coordinating trades around timely insights and implementing adjustments quickly.

A weekly workflow looks different under this model. Teams begin by reviewing a concise set of alarms: items with the highest probability of affecting schedule or cost. If a material delivery slips, the system presents resequencing options, resource impacts and downstream effects on dependent activities. The GC convenes stakeholders, validates the options against field realities and implements the preferred path. Judgment is not replaced but applied where it matters most. In 2026, the GC’s role continues to evolve from reconciling data to integrating operations, keeping complex, multi-party projects aligned through shared information and disciplined execution.

Modular Construction Demands a New Kind of Integrator

Factory-built assembly is moving into mainstream practice where it fits the project. Modular delivery introduces a distinct complexity: aligning factory cadence, logistics, and on-site readiness with tighter tolerances and stricter sequence control. Success in 2026 will require a GC capability focused on modular integration.

Serving as the linchpin between manufacturing and installation, this role oversees a complex supply chain and verifies that every modular component’s digital twin mirrors site conditions. GCs who excel will unlock faster schedules, higher quality and lower costs, while those who fall short risk delays and disruptions.

Safety Becomes Your Best Operational Signal

Safety is no longer a siloed compliance function. In 2026, it’s a leading indicator of project health. The same vision systems and sensor data that detect personal protective equipment (PPE) violations and restricted-zone entries also expose workflow friction, sequence conflicts and emerging quality issues. A rise in near misses at a particular elevation may reveal access constraints that will soon reduce installation rates. Recurring violations around one trade can point to schedule compression or unclear workface boundaries.

Treating safety data as an operational signal shifts the focus to root causes. Alerts are tied to remedial actions. Resequencing tasks can avoid trade stacking, adjust delivery windows, add temporary access or rebalance crews. The primary objective is clear: reduce incidents and protect workers. The operational impact follows. Firms applying predictive safety have recorded incident reductions of 30% to 50% in the first year of operations, showing that safe job sites shouldn’t be sacrificed for efficiency and profitability.

The Industry Cloud Becomes the Default Operating System

Fragmented point solutions and custom integrations are no longer viable for complex capital projects. The industry cloud is emerging as the unified operating system for construction — one where advanced technologies like data fabric, semantic models and AI-native architectures are deeply embedded into the platform itself, not just application platforms layered on top of commercially available hosting services.

This intrinsic integration creates construction-specific data standards and codified workflows that deliver true native interoperability across owners, general contractors and trades. A design change automatically flows through to impacts on schedule, cost, procurement and risk — with full traceability and controlled permissions — because the platform is purpose-built for the industry's interconnected nature.

For Construction CIOs evaluating technology strategy, this architectural depth is what will cement the industry cloud as the default OS by 2026. It eliminates chronic waste from reconciling conflicting data sources and delayed reporting, providing a trusted single source of truth that accelerates decisions and reduces disputes.

Most importantly, the deep fusion of technology and application unleashes AI that transforms operations. For example, agentic AI that reasons across live project data can recommend and automate actions. Further, predictive models can leverage clean, connected historical and real-time data for accurate risk forecasting and scenario analysis. This embedded intelligence delivers proactive insights directly at the point of work — whether in the office or the field.

In 2026, data will be foundational, not an afterthought, and AI will evolve from an add-on feature to a core capability that learns from the industry's richest datasets — driving productivity, mitigating risk and improving outcomes at enterprise scale.",https://img.forconstructionpros.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2026/01/prim-adobestock-1844645465.r1sL0IkbWe.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2026-01-18 11:03:38.478421

The owners announced this week that they would be closing the store as part of their retirement plan.

The Wardrobe, located in Cardiff, has been selling classic and designer labels since it first opened in 1987.

On Facebook, the store owners said: “We would like to thank you all and express our gratitude for the support and custom we have received throughout our 38+ years in business.

“Many of our valued customers have supported us throughout the 80s & 90s right up to today. It has been heart warming to see their sons and even grandsons coming to us as regular customers too.

During those early years John Frost Square was thriving with a mixture of independent shops and many other stores of interest.

“The square was a meeting place and our shop a place to come for a chat and a browse.

“The Friars Walk development arrived and many feel that it took away the sense of the retail community spirit and the old feeling of the square.

The Wardrobe is owned by partners Rob Porter and Manuel Lima, who opened their first store in Cardiff in 1987.

They then decided to open another store in Newport, with both stores selling brands like Timberland, Burberry, Thomas Burberry, Chevignon, Aviatic, French Connection, Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, and many others.

In their announcement on Thursday, they spoke about the store’s struggle going through two recessions, a credit crunch, and the lock downs of the shop due to Covid 19.

“All of this took its toll on other independent businesses within Newport city centre, but we were lucky as your continued custom helped ensure we came through all of those events and maintained our place as the successful store it’s always been”, they added.

Talking about the current state of their store, the owners said that they had coped through a tough trading period with the cost of living crisis.

They ended their statement by thanking all of their loyal customers and marking the closure as the “end of an era”.

One customer commented on the announcement saying: “Great shop , but was the owners that made it so good. Really good service and top guys.”

“Bringing back memories of calling in on a Saturday afternoon to get a new shirt for the night out. Made Newport stand out. Sad to see it closing”, he added.

Another shopper said: “One of my favourite menswear shops of all time.

Signify N.V. vs.","The internet is losing it over Signify N.V. – but is it actually worth your money?

You know smart lights. You know RGB, mood scenes, and that one friend whose room looks like a Twitch studio. What most people don’t know? A huge chunk of that universe is powered by Signify N.V. – the company behind Philips Hue and a massive player in global lighting.

But here’s the real talk: while the products are lighting up TikTok and YouTube, the Signify Aktie (stock) has been way more rollercoaster than straight glow-up.

So is this a low-key opportunity… or a walking red flag?

The Hype is Real: Signify N.V. on TikTok and Beyond

On your feed, Signify shows up mostly as Philips Hue and smart lighting setups. It’s the brand people flex when they want that clean, ultra-aesthetic vibe – gaming rigs, cinema rooms, cozy bedrooms, the works.

Creators love it because it’s:

Instant clout: Dynamic scenes, syncing to music, voice control – it looks expensive and futuristic on camera.

Smart-home friendly: Works with Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple Home, and all the usual suspects.

Endlessly remixable: New scenes, automations, and setups mean infinite content ideas.

But while the content is viral, the company name ""Signify N.V."" barely shows up in the captions. That’s where you can get an edge: the products are famous, the ticker still feels under-the-radar.

The Business Side: Signify Aktie

Stock data status: Live intraday quotes can change by the minute. At the time of writing, real-time data from multiple sources could not be reliably fetched, so we’re not showing a specific price. Always check the latest quote yourself before you make a move.

Here’s what you can lock in without guessing:

Ticker: Signify N.V. (often listed as LIGHT on European exchanges)

ISIN: NL0012866412 – that’s your unique ID for the Signify Aktie

Segment: Global lighting leader in both consumer smart lighting and pro/industrial systems

Zooming out, the stock has had a very mixed ride: strong years when smart-home hype and energy-efficiency mandates hit, and painful pullbacks when macro pressure and slower building projects kicked in. Think: not a meme rocket, but not a stable bond either. Volatile. Tradeable. Definitely not boring.

So no fantasy numbers here – just the reality: if you care about this stock, you’ve got to pull the live chart on your own favorite app and watch how it moves day to day.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

Forget the corporate slides. If you’re deciding whether Signify deserves a slot on your watchlist, these are the three pillars that matter.

1. The Smart-Home Flex: Philips Hue and Friends

This is the clout engine. Philips Hue is basically the Apple of smart lighting – not the cheapest, but the one people flex on camera.

Why this matters:

Sticky ecosystem: Once you’ve dropped cash on multiple smart bulbs, strips, and sensors, you’re not switching brands easily.

High-margin accessories: After your first starter kit, it’s all add-ons – more strips, more lamps, more room setups.

Integrations: Works with all the major smart-home ecosystems, which keeps Signify inside any conversation about connected homes.

Is it worth the hype? For creators and tech fans, yes. For investors, it’s one of the strongest product moats in consumer lighting right now.

2. The Boring–But–Huge Side: Pro Lighting, Cities, and Industry

This is where Signify feels less TikTok and more ""massive infrastructure money."" Think:

LED upgrades for offices, factories, and retail

Smart street lighting for cities trying to cut energy bills

Connected systems that track energy use and maintenance

It’s not viral, but it’s real revenue. Governments and big companies are under pressure to cut energy use, and LED + smart controls are one of the easiest wins.

Real talk: this part of the business can be lumpy – big contracts, long sales cycles – but when it hits, it hits heavy.

3. The Risk Factor: Cycles, Competition, and Consumer Squeeze

Here’s the side most promo posts never tell you.

Economic cycles: When building projects slow down or companies cut capex, lighting upgrades get delayed.

Consumer budgets: Smart lights are a ""nice-to-have"" when money is tight. That can mean slower Hue growth when wallets are hurting.

Price pressure: Cheaper smart bulbs and strips from budget brands keep undercutting on price, especially online.

So is Signify a no-brainer at any price? Definitely not. This is a stock you trade with eyes wide open, not with blind fanboy energy.

Signify N.V. vs. The Competition

If you’re going to put money behind lighting, you need to know who else is in the arena.

1. Signify vs. Cheap Smart-Light Brands

On Amazon, you’ll find tons of budget LED strips and bulbs from lesser-known brands. They’re cheaper, they look decent on camera, and for some setups, they’re ""good enough.""

Where Signify wins:

Reliability: Better software, fewer glitches, deeper integrations.

Brand trust: Philips Hue has serious name recognition with mainstream buyers.

Ecosystem depth: Lamps, fixtures, outdoor gear, sensors – not just a few cheap bulbs.

Where budget brands win: Straight-up price. If you’re outfitting a whole room on a tight budget, Hue can feel painful.

2. The Big Rival: Other Lighting Giants

On the pro and infrastructure side, Signify goes head-to-head with other global lighting and electronics players that also chase city projects, building upgrades, and industrial lighting.

Signify’s edge:

Scale in lighting-first tech – it lives and breathes lighting instead of treating it as a tiny side division.

Strong portfolio in both consumer and professional segments, spreading risk.

Brand recognition via the long Philips legacy in lighting.

But the flip side is brutal competition on pricing and specs in big contracts. You don’t win those just by vibes.

So who wins the clout war?

On social clout: Signify (through Philips Hue) takes it. The content is aesthetic, the setups go viral, and the brand looks premium.

On raw budget appeal: Cheaper smart-light brands steal younger, price-sensitive buyers who just want RGB and don’t care about ecosystems.

As an investor, you’re basically betting that the combo of premium smart-home clout + huge pro/industrial deals outweighs the cheap-copycat effect.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

So, should you treat Signify Aktie (ISIN NL0012866412) like a must-cop, or is this just overhyped mood lighting?

Cop – If this sounds like you:

You believe smart homes are still early and lighting will be a core part of that ecosystem.

You like companies with real products, real cash flows, and global reach – not just app-only hype.

You can handle volatility and you’re willing to buy dips instead of chasing peaks.

Drop (or just watch) – If this is you:

You want meme-level upside with zero patience for slow cycles.

You get stressed by choppy charts and cyclical business models.

You think cheaper smart lights and no-name brands will fully eat the premium market.

Real talk: Signify isn’t a ""get rich next week"" play. It’s a bet on:

Smart homes maturing

Cities and companies cutting energy costs long-term

Premium lighting staying relevant even as cheap copies pop up

That makes it more ""quiet compounder with volatility"" than meme rocket. If you’re going in, you do it with a plan: know your entry, know your exit, and always check the live price first.

Not financial advice. This is a breakdown so you’re not flying blind. Before you buy or sell anything tied to Signify N.V. or the Signify Aktie (ISIN NL0012866412), pull up a fresh chart, read the latest earnings, and decide if the risk fits your game.

Because in this market, even the best lights can leave you in the dark if you don’t know what you’re holding.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404993_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 03:58:35.446343

Market concerns revolve around NVIDIA potentially losing market share to Google's in-house TPU and the upcoming chips from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). NVIDIA's stock has shown a consolidating trend over the past three months. However, Pajjuri is optimistic about NVIDIA regaining its growth momentum, initiating coverage with an ""outperform"" rating and a target price of $240.

Pajjuri cites robust capital expenditure among major cloud service providers as a contributory factor. Although the AI accelerator market share for NVIDIA might decline from 80% to 70% by 2027, he doesn't perceive this as significant. While custom ASIC chips and AMD's products could gain share due to supply chain diversification, NVIDIA's performance lead and comprehensive end-to-end solutions mitigate these risks.

The report states that AI adoption is increasing, with one in six CXOs actively using AI in strategic decision-making—a figure set to more than double within three years. Based on a survey of 1,505 executives at large organisations globally, the report finds that 38% of organisations have already operationalised generative AI use cases, while six in ten are exploring agentic AI applications. About half of Chinese organisations are piloting or deploying agentic AI, ahead of their US and European counterparts. Two-thirds of business leaders believe that failing to scale AI as rapidly as competitors could result in missed strategic opportunities and loss of competitive edge.

Other key findings from the report include:

High experimentation: 41% of CEOs are already testing AI—more than any other leadership group.

Visible benefits: Over half of CXOs report significant improvements in cost efficiency, speed, foresight and creativity.

CXO concerns: Despite growing recognition of AI’s potential to augment strategic thinking, CXOs remain concerned about legal risks, explainability and data quality in AI-driven decisions.

To enable confident AI-powered decision-making, the report recommends revamping AI governance and accountability frameworks for the agentic era, building frameworks to assess decision readiness for AI support, and leveraging human–AI collaboration to unlock true competitive advantage.

Organisations view AI as a long-term growth lever

Another Capgemini Research Institute brief, “The multi-year AI advantage: Building the enterprise of tomorrow”, examines how businesses are accelerating AI adoption while balancing near-term priorities with long-term strategy. Based on a global survey of more than 1,500 leaders across 15 countries, key findings include:

Rising AI budgets: Organisations expect to allocate 5% of annual business budgets to AI by 2026, up from 3% in 2025. Leaders recognise that failing to scale AI quickly could lead to missed opportunities and strategic disadvantage.

AI across functions: More than half of organisations prioritise AI investments in sales, marketing and IT operations. Generative AI has moved beyond pilots, with 38% already operationalising use cases. Agentic AI and edge AI are also gaining traction.

Enterprise-wide adoption remains complex: Strong executive sponsorship (67%), external partnerships (59%), governance and ethical frameworks (53%), and scalable data infrastructure (51%) are seen as critical enablers for moving from pilots to full-scale deployment.

Human–AI collaboration matters: AI is amplifying—not replacing—human capabilities. About 66% of organisations report measurable improvements in productivity and decision quality through human–AI collaboration, while six in ten are redefining skills and investing in workforce upskilling.

Sovereignty and trust: Data and AI sovereignty are emerging as strategic priorities, with 54% of organisations prioritising data control. Firms are balancing build-versus-buy strategies to combine speed with differentiation.

“AI has crossed a critical threshold—the question is no longer whether to pursue AI, but how to embed it into the fabric of the enterprise. As we enter 2026, organisations are rightly prioritising strong AI foundations such as data, governance and human–AI collaboration.

Amgen’s Obesity Drug May Crush Novo Nordisk & Lilly With Just Four Shots A Year!

By Baptista Research

Amgen has reignited investor interest in the obesity drug space with its latest update on MariTide, a GLP-1 agonist that could reshape the competitive dynamics currently dominated by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.

In a Phase 2 study, MariTide helped patients maintain 17% to 18% weight loss into the second year—levels on par with current market leaders.

However, Amgen is positioning MariTide as a superior offering with a differentiated edge: the potential for less frequent dosing—monthly or even quarterly—compared to the weekly injections required for Lilly and Novo’s therapies.

Several industry executives anticipate that the market size for tokenized assets could grow to approximately $400 billion by 2026.

Samir Kerbage, Chief Investment Officer of Hashdex, stated that the current size of tokenized assets is approximately $36 billion. He noted that the next phase of growth will stem more from structural reshaping of value transfer methods rather than speculative demand alone. He pointed out that as stablecoins mature as ""on-chain cash,"" capital will naturally flow into investable assets, serving as a bridge between digital currencies and digital capital markets.

According to reports, the scale of tokenized assets is approaching $20 billion in the 2020s, with traditional financial institutions such as BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of New York Mellon deeply involved. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino believes that 2026 will be a pivotal year for banks to move from pilot projects to real-world deployment, especially in emerging markets, where tokenization can help issuers bypass limitations of traditional infrastructure.

In addition, Centrifuge's COO, Jürgen Blumberg, expects that by the end of 2026, the total value locked (TVL) in on-chain real-world assets (RWA) could exceed $100 billion, with more than half of the world's top 20 asset management firms launching tokenized products. Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, noted that natively tokenized stocks and ETFs will gradually replace synthetic asset models and become important high-quality collateral within DeFi.

CoinDesk believes that legal clarity, cross-chain interoperability, and a unified identity system remain key prerequisites for the expansion of the tokenized market.

For Barclays, the analysis starts with a Book Value of £4.50 per share and an Average Return on Equity of 11.36%.
Based on analyst expectations, this translates into a Stable EPS of £0.64 per share, with those EPS figures sourced from weighted future Return on Equity estimates from 10 analysts.
Putting these pieces together gives an estimated intrinsic value of about £8.73 per share, which points to an intrinsic discount of 44.0% relative to the recent £4.89 share price, so the stock screens as materially undervalued on this measure.

The stock recently closed at £4.89, with returns of 0.8% over 7 days, 6.7% over 30 days, 2.0% year to date, 73.5% over 1 year and 208.7% over 3 years, and the 5 year return sits at a very large 305.9%.

Recent news around big UK banks has focused on topics such as interest rate paths, competition in retail and investment banking, and regulatory oversight, all of which can influence how investors think about a bank's earnings power. For Barclays, this backdrop helps explain why the share price has been sensitive to shifts in sentiment on profitability, capital strength and future return on equity.

Simply Wall St currently gives Barclays a . Next, we will look at what different valuation methods say about that score, and then finish with a way to interpret valuation that can give you a fuller picture than the numbers alone.

Approach 1: Barclays Excess Returns Analysis

The Excess Returns model looks at how much profit a company can generate over and above the return that shareholders require, and then works out what that stream of extra profit might be worth per share today.

For Barclays, the analysis starts with a Book Value of £4.50 per share and an Average Return on Equity of 11.36%. Based on analyst expectations, this translates into a Stable EPS of £0.64 per share, with those EPS figures sourced from weighted future Return on Equity estimates from 10 analysts. The model compares this earning power with a Cost of Equity of £0.47 per share, which implies an Excess Return of £0.17 per share.

The Excess Returns approach then extends this earning power over time, using a Stable Book Value of £5.62 per share, sourced from weighted future Book Value estimates from 9 analysts. Putting these pieces together gives an estimated intrinsic value of about £8.73 per share, which points to an intrinsic discount of 44.0% relative to the recent £4.89 share price, so the stock screens as materially undervalued on this measure.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Our Excess Returns analysis suggests Barclays is undervalued by 44.0%. Track this in your or , or discover .

Approach 2: Barclays Price vs Earnings

For profitable companies like Barclays, the P/E ratio is a useful shorthand because it links what you pay today directly to the earnings the bank is already producing. It helps you see how many pounds investors are currently willing to pay for each pound of earnings.

What counts as a “normal” P/E depends on how the market views growth prospects and risk. Higher growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher multiple, while lower growth or higher risk usually points to a lower one.

Barclays currently trades on a P/E of 11.30x, close to the Banks industry average of 11.21x and below the peer average of 14.17x. Simply Wall St also calculates a “Fair Ratio” of 9.88x, which is the P/E it would expect for Barclays given factors such as its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics. This Fair Ratio is designed to be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry because it adjusts for those company specific drivers.

With the current P/E of 11.30x sitting above the Fair Ratio of 9.88x, the stock screens as somewhat expensive on this metric.

Result: OVERVALUED

P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? .

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Barclays Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. On Simply Wall St you can use Narratives, where you set out your story for Barclays in plain language, link that story to assumptions for future revenue, earnings and margins, and the platform turns it into a forecast and fair value. This updates when new information such as earnings or news arrives, allowing you to compare that Fair Value with the current price and decide if it looks like a buy, a hold or a sell for you. Different investors might, for example, plug in a higher Fair Value of £4.55 or a lower one of £3.06 based on their own views, all inside the Community page used by millions of investors.

A pre-eminent expert quantified the value of that,"" Musk's lead trial lawyer Steven Molo said in a statement to Reuters.
OpenAI, in a statement, called it an ""unserious demand"" by Musk and said it was part of his ""harassment campaign"" against OpenAI.
Microsoft ⁠did not respond to a request for comment outside business hours on the amount of compensation Musk is seeking.
The filing says Musk's contributions to OpenAI and Microsoft were calculated by his expert witness, financial economist C. Paul Wazzan.","Elon Musk is seeking up to $134 billion from OpenAI ⁠and Microsoft , saying he deserves the ""wrongful gains"" that they received from his early support, according to a court filing on Friday.

OpenAI gained between $65.5 ‍billion and $109.4 billion from the billionaire entrepreneur's ‍contributions when he was co-founding ‍what was then a startup from 2015, while Microsoft gained between $13.3 billion and $25.1 billion, Musk said in the federal court filing ahead of his trial against the two companies.

""Without Elon Musk, there'd be no OpenAI. He provided the bulk of ‌the ‌seed funding, lent his reputation, and taught them all he knows ​about scaling a business. A pre-eminent expert quantified the value of that,"" Musk's lead trial lawyer Steven Molo said in a statement to Reuters.

OpenAI, in a statement, called it an ""unserious demand"" by Musk and said it was part of his ""harassment campaign"" against OpenAI.

Microsoft ⁠did not respond to a request for comment outside business hours on the amount of compensation Musk is seeking.

During the week, OpenAI called the lawsuit ""baseless"" and part of a ""harassment"" campaign by Musk. A Microsoft lawyer has said there is no evidence that the company ""aided and abetted"" OpenAI.

The two companies challenged Musk's damages claims in a separate filing on Friday.

Musk, who left OpenAI in 2018 and runs xAI, a competitor to ChatGPT, alleges that ChatGPT operator OpenAI violated its founding mission through a high-profile restructuring into a for-profit entity.

A judge in Oakland, California, ruled this month that a jury will hear the trial, expected to start in April.

Musk's filing says he contributed about $38 million, 60% of OpenAI's early seed funding, helped recruit staff, connect the founders with contacts and lend credibility to the project when it was created.

""Just as an early investor in a startup company may realize gains many ‍orders of magnitude greater than the investor's initial investment, the wrongful gains that OpenAI and Microsoft have earned - ‌and which Mr. Musk is now entitled to disgorge – are much larger than Mr. ⁠Musk's initial contributions,"" Musk argues.

The filing says Musk's contributions to OpenAI and Microsoft were calculated by his expert witness, financial economist C. Paul Wazzan.

Musk may seek punitive damages and other ‍penalties, including a possible injunction, if the jury finds either company liable, the filing says, without specifying what form any injunction might take.

In their own filing, OpenAI and Microsoft asked the judge to limit what Musk's expert may present to jurors, arguing his analysis should be excluded as ""made up,"" ""unverifiable"" and ""unprecedented"" and as seeking an ""implausible"" transfer of billions from a nonprofit to a former donor-turned-competitor.

The companies also disputed Musk's damages figures ⁠more broadly, saying the expert's approach is unreliable and ‌could mislead the jury.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108228375-1763570599577-108228375-1763570145468-gettyimages-2246882306-US_SAUDI.jpg?v=1767796601&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2026-01-17 18:00:11.868655
ID33,OpenAI,2026-01-17 20:59:31+00:00,Spyglass,Will OpenAI Ads Click with Users? - Spyglass,M.G. Siegler,,,,,https://spyglass.org/openai-ads-in-chatgpt/,"And much like with Google Search, such text often indicates an intent of some type.
And certainly it will never convert as Google Search ads have.
In a way, they're the new glossy magazine ads versus Google's ads which were more like old classified ads (on steroids, of course).
First, OpenAI needs to find the right chat-based model for ads inside of ChatGPT.
Again, it may be more similar to the Google Search model, but it won't be exactly like it, and new metrics will probably be needed to work at scale.","The ads are coming! The ads are coming!

Look, everything in OpenAI's blog post announcing that advertising is coming to ChatGPT seems reasonable. Fidji Simo smartly frames it as wanting to ensure they can bring their AI to more people, but at the same time, as everyone is well aware by now, it costs a lot of money to do that. Charging for more/better/faster access has worked well to date for the company, but that model will never be able to scale the way 'free' and/or 'cheap' can. It's a story as old as time – or at least, as old as advertising. Sam Altman may have said that he hoped to avoid this fate – ""a last resort"" – but it was always inevitable. You either die as an ad-free service or you live long enough to become an ad vessel.1

That's a bit unfair. But it's directionally true. And it's exactly why you hire someone like Simo to be the CEO reporting to the CEO. She has all the experience to make this work for OpenAI, not only thanks to her Meta days, but her Instacart days as well. She has been able to help get advertising working across several different types of businesses (and I think Instagram should be considered slightly different from Facebook itself – we'll get to that).

So, will this work for OpenAI?

I mean, the short answer is that it has to. Given the costs involved and the competition keeping pricing in check, this will be the only way to scale to billions without breaking the bank – which still might break, even with ads, by the way. The problem is that OpenAI clearly doesn't yet know how it will work. Because no one does. It's a new product and new type of experience – and my guess would be that to truly work, it will require a new type of advertising.

Google is the Google you know today because they figured this out. Meta is Meta because Facebook – and again, later Instagram – figured this out.

Conventional wisdom right now would suggest that the right ad model is going to be closer to that of Google because much like Search, what you type into a text box is key. And much like with Google Search, such text often indicates an intent of some type. But whereas Google aimed to match this intent with a website – well, at first, at least – ChatGPT tries to get you right to an answer. This is a problem for the Google-style of advertising because that was predicated around the notion of a click. Famously, because it's trying to get you the information directly rather than linking to a site that has the information, there are far fewer clicks on ChatGPT.

But Google's model was even better than that. Because a user was trained to know they'd be getting those famous ""10 blue links"" back as a result, they were also trained to quickly scan them. Sure, Google would try to surface the one it found most relevant to your query first, but with millions then billions of web pages and an infinite pool of queries, it wasn't reasonable to think that the top link would always be the correct one. That naturally let Google ""take over"" one of those link slots for an ad unit, knowing the ""impression"" would be there.

Even better, they could move such a unit to the top of the results without too much damage done to the product. Is the ad not what you were looking for? Then just don't click. But even better still, for certain types of queries, the ad often was what you were looking for, because the real genius and killer feature of the model was getting basically all businesses to advertise against the keyword queries related to their businesses – and to those of their rivals! As a result, when I search for ""iPhone"" the top result is often an Apple ad that Google gets paid to display. Because if not, Samsung would try to control that top slot and may divert a customer with clear smartphone interest to their Galaxy lineup.

Everyone knows all of this, of course, but it's worth spelling out just how brilliant this is. It's not an exaggeration to say that it may be the best business model in history. But it's also one that breaks down quickly without those clicks.

Now, ChatGPT is clearly making product tweaks to lead to more clicks. Conversations around shopping are the most clear example of this. Because at the end of the day, you can talk all you want about buying something, but if you actually want to buy it, you're going to have to click somewhere to go do that – even if it's within ChatGPT itself (which is what they're working on, obviously).2

Anyway, anything with some sort of purchase intent is clearly going to get more click-inducing UI tweaks. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it will also help the advertising push. Yet it still feels like that won't be the big breakthrough here. And certainly it will never convert as Google Search ads have. I'm more intrigued by OpenAI's notion that you might want to chat with an ad. On the surface, this sounds gross, but it's perhaps a clever way to integrate ads more natively into the product. Want to know more about the iPhone's specs versus that Galaxy device? Maybe Apple pays to sponsor ChatGPT's answer (without any oversight of the response aside from insuring it's accurate?) with a link to buy. And maybe Samsung pays too for their own link, just in case you deem that the better path.

Travel. Tickets. Etc. The categories will undoubtedly be the same, but the key will be not destroying user trust in the chat by letting advertisers turn said chat into a giant advertisement. ChatGPT is saying all the right things now, but... such things have a way of morphing over time. Bending towards the arc of more monetization...

But all of the above is too obvious. The more interesting ads may be simply about information, the native content of ChatGPT. Can they figure out a way to get advertisers to pay to sponsor relevant information – again, not spammy/pitchy – in response to ""regular"" chats? Is there some sort of new ""cost-per-information"" model?3 Or if a user engages with it, ""cost-per-interaction""? There obviously needs to be some sort of signal to showcase that it was useful to a user and again, it may not be a click. Otherwise, we're just back in the less interesting, and probably less useful, not to mention less lucrative, impression game.

Speaking of, Meta has historically played that game better because their breakthrough, the feed, is naturally more visual in nature. And the natural interaction there, the scroll, allows for easy ad insertion without annoying the user too much – if they don't like an ad, they just keep scrolling. But Meta, even more so than Google, at least in the early days, was able to leverage key knowledge about you thanks to their social graph. So while they didn't have the same search intent Google did, they had better targeting capabilities.

That's interesting as it relates to OpenAI because they should have sort of a hybrid of these two worlds and models (and, to be clear, Google undoubtedly knows more about you these days than Meta thanks to Gmail and Photos and Maps and everything else). ChatGPT can glean intent from what you type, but also better target ads based on all the knowledge it has about you from previous conversations. Google had this too with previous searches, but you're typing so much more, about so many more things, into ChatGPT than you would into a Search box.

Everyone – even Sam Altman – highlights how good Instagram ads are. It's obviously a combination of Meta's data and targeting mixed with the visual nature of that product. In a way, they're the new glossy magazine ads versus Google's ads which were more like old classified ads (on steroids, of course). Is there a way ChatGPT could leverage those types of ads too? Maybe if they continue to fully build out their image generation tools and can make it a true hub people visit. Meta is obviously trying to do this with their AI products. But it's not clear that will be a natural use behavior with AI content, we'll see.

Sora and AI video would be the next holy grail after that, of course. If OpenAI can break into the video advertising game – aka, commercials – well, that's another massive business opportunity. It's one YouTube is still in the process of siphoning away from TV, with TikTok and yes, Instagram pushing hard as well with some success. And then there's Netflix, Amazon, and everyone in streaming making their moves too.

But we're getting way ahead of ourselves here. First, OpenAI needs to find the right chat-based model for ads inside of ChatGPT. Again, it may be more similar to the Google Search model, but it won't be exactly like it, and new metrics will probably be needed to work at scale.

And there's a privacy angle, which OpenAI doesn't shy away from in their post, which makes it even more of a challenge. Many people are clearly already telling ChatGPT things that they don't necessarily want to be advertised against. And yet, an area like health is one of the most lucrative areas of advertising! So that's going to be a fine line to walk... For now, ChatGPT is probably wisely steering clear.

At the end of the day, OpenAI undoubtedly still wants to believe that they can have a more hybrid model than either Google or Meta have, in that they have millions of paying users from the get-go as they start this ads push – those other companies did not, at least not for the core products: search and social feeds. Can they take their existing model and layer in advertising, versus it consuming the entire product, ensuring ""enshittification""? In that way, it's almost more like Netflix.",https://spyglass.org/content/images/size/w1200/2026/01/Gemini_Generated_Image_n3rihyn3rihyn3ri.png,N,,2026-01-17 17:00:16.588189

It means a lot. It's a very proud moment for myself and also for my family, who are now only a 40-minute flight away. Liverpool is a massive club and I think when you join a club as big as Liverpool it comes with massive responsibility and I can't wait to get to work and to give 100 per cent every day.

Liverpool has a very proud association with Ireland in both the men's and women's teams, so how proud does it make you feel to be a part of that now?

Yes it does [make me proud]. There's a lot of Irish people over here and I've met a lot of people already and everyone is so kind. I've felt part of it already and everyone has been so welcoming. I also know a few of the girls here from Ireland so to have them here is very special and I'm looking forward to the journey.

You've won more than 125 caps for Ireland so far. How special is it to represent your country?

I love playing for my country. It's the pinnacle getting to represent Ireland and every time I put on that shirt it's special and hopefully many more caps.

What was the main attraction for you to sign for Liverpool?

I think there are a lot of things. Obviously Liverpool is a massive club and speaking to Gareth and seeing his direction and his ambitions for the club, I think the team has massive potential and I'm really excited to get started.

How impressed were you with head coach Gareth and managing director Andy O'Boyle with the vision they have for this club?

I was very impressed. I think they have a very clear vision of what they want from each player and from the team. Everything here is really special and I think the team has a lot of potential. Some of them are world-class and there's a lot of really impressive things that drew me to this club.

What are your first impressions of the AXA Melwood Training Centre?

Unbelievable. I've been getting videos of this place and it's really special. I think you have to be here to really realise what it's like. Everything is amazing here, it's where you want to be and I feel like you feel like you are a professional when you show up here and that's what I want.

Your Ireland teammate Leanne Kiernan of course is here and our former captain Niamh Fahey in her new role. Did you speak to them before you came to Liverpool?

I did. I've had conversations with them and they expressed what it meant for them to be here and how special it is. I was really excited to come here and having those girls here, I've known them for over 10 years. I played with Niamh for 10 to 15 years and I always looked up to her because she is a leader and I learned a lot from her. So to have her and Leanne here is very special. I think it's important to have people around you like that. You can really get along on the pitch but also off the pitch as well, they are there to support you and they are good friends as well as teammates and I'm very excited.

You know assistant manager Amber Whiteley pretty well, too…

I do, through Ireland. Amber is a really great person, she has got a lot of quality as a coach and that's what drew me here too.

You have played in the USA with North Carolina Courage and also had a spell in Australia. Why did you decide this is the right time for a new challenge?

I was with the Courage for 10 years. I had a really special time and have a lot of great memories from there but for me, I want to push myself and I wanted a new challenge. Also, I'm only 40 minutes away from my friends and family, which is really special and the past nine years they have not got to see me play very much as I've been a long way from home. So, to have them now come over and watch the games, especially for my mum, to be able to take care of her at a pretty short distance is really special.

From a football perspective, it's been a tough season for us here but I know you speak about yourself as someone who's never one to shy away from a challenge, you're determined to play your part in helping the girls turn things around…

Yes, 100 per cent and that's why I came here. I want to help this team and it's important to get results and that's what I'm here for, to have an impact. I want to come in and have an impact from the first minute and get going with the team. I am a natural leader, I want to lead by example and lead with humility as well, bring everyone up around me and that's what I'm here to do.

You bring not only a wealth of experience, but such strong leadership skills as well, which can be so important in tough times. Is that something you feel you can help bring to the young team?

We have a lot of young players here and I think I can make a difference and be a help to them. I want to lead by example, I want to show up every day and give 100 per cent and drive this team on to get results.

Talk to us about your style of play as well, because that strength of character we've just spoken about, it's how you play your football as well, you like to be quite competitive, enjoy a challenge on the field…

I've got a really competitive drive and that's from being the youngest in my family growing up! Also I have a winning mentality, I want to show up and I want to give 100 per cent. I want to set the standards and drive the team on. I think that's really important to drive everyone around you and I want to get results.

Has Gareth told you what he expects from you?

Yes. I've spoken with Gareth a few times and he expects me to come in and be a leader. He expects me to be a professional every single day and the position on the pitch he wants me to play. We've spoken about all that so I'm really excited to get going.

How much are you looking forward to meeting the Liverpool fans? I can tell you they are very passionate and will have a song for you very soon...

I'm really excited to meet the fans. They are the reason we can play the game so I'm excited to be in front of them and I want to show them I will give 100 per cent for the badge every day.

You've called America home for a number of years now but you're a Cork native, so living in the city now, this probably feels a lot closer to your roots. Are you looking forward to taking in the surroundings?

Yes, definitely. I've been to Liverpool before, my family have been to Liverpool a lot, they absolutely love it, so it's a great city and I'm excited to get to know the place.

I imagine your family will be coming over to watch games? It's a bit closer for them than America! You've got five brothers and four sisters, so you might have your hands full sorting tickets...

[Laughs] Yes, they have already been on to me trying to book flights! Look, it's very special and I'm very lucky to have them. They have supported me throughout my whole life so me signing for Liverpool is more for them as well and they are really proud.

Finally, do you have a message for the Liverpool supporters?

I just want to say I am really excited to be here. I have heard so many great things about this team, you guys, the city, and I can't wait to go out and give 100 per cent every single day and show you what I can do to help this team.",https://backend.liverpoolfc.com/sites/default/files/styles/lg/public/2026-01/denise-osullivan-signing-interview-cover_ef06df5893076fdbf3a161629045333e.jpg?itok=izitalZN,N,,2026-01-18 09:59:56.793542

I was very impressed. I think they have a very clear vision of what they want from each player and from the team. Everything here is really special and I think the team has a lot of potential. Some of them are world-class and there's a lot of really impressive things that drew me to this club.

What are your first impressions of the AXA Melwood Training Centre?

Unbelievable. I've been getting videos of this place and it's really special. I think you have to be here to really realise what it's like. Everything is amazing here, it's where you want to be and I feel like you feel like you are a professional when you show up here and that's what I want.

Your Ireland teammate Leanne Kiernan of course is here and our former captain Niamh Fahey in her new role. Did you speak to them before you came to Liverpool?

I did. I've had conversations with them and they expressed what it meant for them to be here and how special it is. I was really excited to come here and having those girls here, I've known them for over 10 years. I played with Niamh for 10 to 15 years and I always looked up to her because she is a leader and I learned a lot from her. So to have her and Leanne here is very special. I think it's important to have people around you like that. You can really get along on the pitch but also off the pitch as well, they are there to support you and they are good friends as well as teammates and I'm very excited.

You know assistant manager Amber Whiteley pretty well, too…

I do, through Ireland. Amber is a really great person, she has got a lot of quality as a coach and that's what drew me here too.

You have played in the USA with North Carolina Courage and also had a spell in Australia. Why did you decide this is the right time for a new challenge?

I was with the Courage for 10 years. I had a really special time and have a lot of great memories from there but for me, I want to push myself and I wanted a new challenge. Also, I'm only 40 minutes away from my friends and family, which is really special and the past nine years they have not got to see me play very much as I've been a long way from home. So, to have them now come over and watch the games, especially for my mum, to be able to take care of her at a pretty short distance is really special.

From a football perspective, it's been a tough season for us here but I know you speak about yourself as someone who's never one to shy away from a challenge, you're determined to play your part in helping the girls turn things around…

Yes, 100 per cent and that's why I came here. I want to help this team and it's important to get results and that's what I'm here for, to have an impact. I want to come in and have an impact from the first minute and get going with the team. I am a natural leader, I want to lead by example and lead with humility as well, bring everyone up around me and that's what I'm here to do.

You bring not only a wealth of experience, but such strong leadership skills as well, which can be so important in tough times. Is that something you feel you can help bring to the young team?

We have a lot of young players here and I think I can make a difference and be a help to them. I want to lead by example, I want to show up every day and give 100 per cent and drive this team on to get results.

Talk to us about your style of play as well, because that strength of character we've just spoken about, it's how you play your football as well, you like to be quite competitive, enjoy a challenge on the field…

I've got a really competitive drive and that's from being the youngest in my family growing up! Also I have a winning mentality, I want to show up and I want to give 100 per cent. I want to set the standards and drive the team on. I think that's really important to drive everyone around you and I want to get results.

Has Gareth told you what he expects from you?

Yes. I've spoken with Gareth a few times and he expects me to come in and be a leader. He expects me to be a professional every single day and the position on the pitch he wants me to play. We've spoken about all that so I'm really excited to get going.

How much are you looking forward to meeting the Liverpool fans? I can tell you they are very passionate and will have a song for you very soon...

I'm really excited to meet the fans. They are the reason we can play the game so I'm excited to be in front of them and I want to show them I will give 100 per cent for the badge every day.

You've called America home for a number of years now but you're a Cork native, so living in the city now, this probably feels a lot closer to your roots. Are you looking forward to taking in the surroundings?

Yes, definitely. I've been to Liverpool before, my family have been to Liverpool a lot, they absolutely love it, so it's a great city and I'm excited to get to know the place.

I imagine your family will be coming over to watch games? It's a bit closer for them than America! You've got five brothers and four sisters, so you might have your hands full sorting tickets...

[Laughs] Yes, they have already been on to me trying to book flights! Look, it's very special and I'm very lucky to have them. They have supported me throughout my whole life so me signing for Liverpool is more for them as well and they are really proud.

Finally, do you have a message for the Liverpool supporters?

I just want to say I am really excited to be here. I have heard so many great things about this team, you guys, the city, and I can't wait to go out and give 100 per cent every single day and show you what I can do to help this team.",https://backend.liverpoolfc.com/sites/default/files/styles/lg/public/2026-01/denise-osullivan-signing-interview-cover_ef06df5893076fdbf3a161629045333e.jpg?itok=izitalZN,N,,2026-01-17 17:00:01.009159

A great starting point for your Helmerich & Payne research is our analysis highlighting that could impact your investment decision.","Recent US policy shifts toward Venezuela have put Helmerich & Payne (HP) back in focus, as investors weigh what potential access to Venezuelan oil reserves and any recovery of seized rigs and unpaid invoices could mean for the stock.

The Venezuela headlines have arrived at a time when momentum in Helmerich & Payne’s share price has been picking up, with a 30 day share price return of 15.60% and a 90 day share price return of 40.11%. This is occurring even though the 1 year total shareholder return stands at a 6.86% decline and the 3 year total shareholder return at a 20.87% decline, while the 5 year total shareholder return is 56.45%.

If this kind of news driven move has your attention, it could be worth broadening your watchlist to include as another pocket of potential opportunities.

With the share price already sitting close to the latest analyst targets yet also showing a 41% intrinsic discount estimate, is Helmerich & Payne still cheap, or is the market already pricing in all the future upside?

Most Popular Narrative: 7% Overvalued

The most followed narrative pegs Helmerich & Payne’s fair value at about US$30.27 per share, a little below the recent US$32.38 close. This sets up a mild valuation gap to unpack.

The company's growing international footprint, highlighted by the successful KCA integration and new tender opportunities in Saudi Arabia and Argentina, positions H&P to capture incremental market share and expand EBITDA as geopolitical instability and supply concerns reinforce demand for high-spec rigs.

Curious how steady top line growth, rising margins and a higher future P/E all fit together here? The narrative leans on a tight mix of revenue assumptions, profitability shifts and valuation multiples that are anything but plain vanilla.

Result: Fair Value of $30.27 (OVERVALUED)

However, in the longer term, rig overcapacity and heavy reliance on U.S. shale activity could still squeeze day rates and margins, challenging the upbeat fair value story.

Another Angle On Value

While the most popular narrative sees Helmerich & Payne as about 7% overvalued, our DCF model points in a different direction. On that view, HP trades around 41% below an estimated fair value of roughly US$54.80, which frames today’s price as a much steeper discount. Which story do you think fits the risks and cash flows better?

Wei said about the AI boom as a whole on the company's earnings call... AI is real.
That might sound familiar... Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also explicitly called out the ""AI bubble"" fears on the company's November earnings call...
This earnings report and the outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor suggest the same.
The company manufacturing all these AI chips still sees ferocious demand... And the AI boom still has legs.","The Weekend Edition is pulled from the daily Stansberry Digest.

We're searching for stability...

As uncertainties abound in the U.S. and abroad (i.e., Iran), most of us are looking for a little solid ground.

I didn't expect to find it in economic data releases. But here we are.

On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics published its latest inflation report on time for the first time in months... after being shuttered during the partial government shutdown.

The bad news? Inflation.

The December 2025 consumer price index (""CPI"") rose 2.7% year over year. Certain items saw much larger price gains – like some food categories (beef was up 16%), car parts and repair (up more than 5%), and natural gas service (up almost 11%).

Grocery prices and costs for ""food away from home"" (translation: restaurants) rose 0.7% from November. That's an annualized rate of more than 8%. So rising prices remain a challenge that Americans face every day.

That said, ""premium"" spending continues...

Earnings season is underway again. As usual, that means it's time to comb through quarterly financial reports and company executive comments for insights on the economy.

And so far, while investors have punished some stocks for earnings misses, the AI boom's outlook is strong...

On Tuesday morning, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), a few other banks, and Delta Air Lines (DAL) got things going for the quarter. These companies illustrated something similar in different ways. Let's start with JPMorgan...

The financial giant beat on both revenue and earnings (excluding a pre-announced $2.2 billion charge related to its takeover of the Apple Card loan portfolio from Goldman Sachs). Nearly all of JPMorgan's segments grew revenue in the fourth quarter, with only its investment banking business seeing a decline.

And CEO Jamie Dimon gave a positive view of the U.S. economy. From the press release...

The U.S. economy has remained resilient. While labor markets have softened, conditions do not appear to be worsening. Meanwhile, consumers continue to spend, and businesses generally remain healthy.

Shifting over to Delta Air Lines, the travel giant was also optimistic about consumers – especially on the wealthier end. The company's fourth-quarter results were mixed (earnings beat estimates, but revenue fell short), and its 2026 forecast missed expectations.

However, CEO Ed Bastian said that a year of record earnings is in reach for the company. He added that ""virtually all"" of Delta's growth will come from premium tickets, not ""main cabin"" bookings.

Still, investors punished Delta shares for its revenue and earnings forecast misses. That's a trend we're seeing so far this earnings season...

But of course, there's still a long way to go.

What This Earnings Season Could Mean for the AI Boom

Looking ahead to the rest...

All in all, Wall Street expects the S&P 500 Index's earnings per share to rise about 8% for the fourth quarter of 2025, according to FactSet. That would mark the 10th straight quarter of positive earnings growth for the index going all the way back to the ""earnings recession"" of 2022 and 2023.

Banks and other financial companies are among the first to report, but they won't be the most-watched group. That honor goes to AI stocks, many of which fall into the ""Information Technology"" sector.

And folks have been getting more bullish about AI's impact on the tech sector. From FactSet's Earnings Insight report...

Heading into the start of the earnings season, both analysts and companies have been more optimistic than normal in their earnings outlooks for the fourth quarter. However, it should be noted that most of this optimism is concentrated in one sector: Information Technology.

The S&P 500's information-tech sector includes companies like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Palantir Technologies (PLTR) – some investor favorites when it comes to AI.

But there's one company that's more important than the rest... chipmaker and AI darling Nvidia (NVDA). The AI boom has propelled Nvidia to become the largest company in the world by market cap. As a result, it now has the largest weighting in both the tech sector and the S&P 500.

Here's more from FactSet's report...

At the company level, Nvidia [at $1.52 vs. $0.89 earnings per share year over year] is expected to be the largest contributor to earnings growth for the sector. If this company were excluded, the estimated earnings growth rate for the Information Technology sector would fall to 18.1% from 25.9%.

As CNBC commentator Josh Brown noted at our annual conference in October, Wall Street is expecting more and more from Nvidia. And we don't know how Mr. Market will react if and when the company doesn't have a blowout quarter.

Folks will have to wait a while to find out, though. Nvidia's earnings likely won't come until late February. Until then, investors will have plenty of other reports to dig through.

These releases will tell us what's going on in the real economy and the ongoing AI boom.

On Thursday, we got our first clues on how the AI boom has gone in the most recent quarter...

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) is the world's largest contract AI-chip manufacturer. Its customers include Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). In the fourth quarter, Taiwan Semiconductor reported a 20.5% jump in revenue and a 35% increase in net income.

Looking forward, Taiwan Semiconductor forecasts a 38% jump in revenue in the first quarter.

When it comes to AI products specifically, the company sees sales growing 50% per year through 2029. And here's what CEO C.C. Wei said about the AI boom as a whole on the company's earnings call...

AI is real. Not only real, it's starting to grow into our daily life.

That might sound familiar... Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also explicitly called out the ""AI bubble"" fears on the company's November earnings call...

There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different.

This earnings report and the outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor suggest the same. The company manufacturing all these AI chips still sees ferocious demand... And the AI boom still has legs.

(NASDAQ: LOT)—the only mobility provider with Chinese-made EV entering the North American market above the $80,000 price segment.

Under the new policy, the planned retail price of the Eletre in Canada is expected to be revised down approximately 50%, with wholesale deliveries projected to achieve exponential growth.

Leveraging its North American homologation completed in 2024 and well-established retail network of authorized dealers in Canada, Lotus Tech is well-positioned to capitalize on this market opportunity.

NEW YORK, Jan. 17, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lotus Technology Inc. (“Lotus Tech” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: LOT), a leading global intelligent and luxury mobility provider has expressed significant attention and a warm welcome to the new tariff policy announced by the Canadian government. Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will allow an initial annual cap of 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles (“EV”) into the Canadian market under a preferential tariff rate of 6.1%. This landmark policy adjustment not only signifies positive progress in China-Canada trade relations but also strongly propels the further development of Lotus Tech in the North American market.

It opens a compelling opportunity for strategic repositioning for Lotus Tech. As the brand's first all-electric hyper SUV, Eletre, with its outstanding product capabilities, successfully completed rigorous North American market homologation in 2024. It stands as the only Chinese-made EV currently entering the North American market in the price segment above US$80,000. This favorable tariff policy is expected to directly reshape the Eletre's pricing strategy in the Canadian market with approximately 50% reduction to its planned retail price. Combined with Lotus’ ""For the Drivers"" philosophy of delivering an ultimate driving experience, a more competitive pricing strategy is anticipated to drive exponential growth in its sales volume in Canada.

The Company's global strategic layout with 210 regional stores covering 61 countries has laid a solid foundation for seizing this opportunity. Lotus Tech has a well-established retail network across Canada with 6 authorized dealerships, offering a full range of services from classic internal combustion engine models to the latest electric products. Thanks to its pre-established market access homologation and channel development, Lotus Tech is well-positioned to swiftly translate the policy benefits into market share.

Mr. Qingfeng Feng, Chief Executive Officer of Lotus Tech, commented: “Canada has always been a strategically vital market within Lotus’ global footprint, where auto consumers possess a high appreciation for performance and driving pleasure. We extend our warm welcome to the new, optimized tariff policy, which creates a more open and fair market environment for international auto brands. Building upon our prior groundwork in the North American market, we will seize this opportunity to enhance investment in Canada to explore any potential tactical advantages and strengthen our footprint in the North American market. We are committed to pursuing growth in a disciplined manner that aligns with market development and creates sustainable value.""

BOISE, Idaho, Jan. 17, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU) today announced it has signed an exclusive Letter of Intent (LOI) to acquire Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation’s (PSMC) P5 fabrication site in Tongluo, Miaoli County, Taiwan, for total cash consideration of US$1.8 billion. The acquisition includes an existing 300mm fab cleanroom of 300,000 square feet and will further position Micron to address growing global demand for memory solutions. The LOI also aims to establish a long-term relationship between Micron and PSMC for Micron’s post-wafer assembly processing and to support PSMC in its legacy DRAM portfolio.

“This strategic acquisition of an existing cleanroom complements our current Taiwan operations and will enable Micron to increase production and better serve our customers in a market where demand continues to outpace supply,” said Manish Bhatia, executive vice president of global operations at Micron Technology. “The Tongluo fab’s close proximity to Micron’s Taichung site will enable synergies across our Taiwan operations.”

The transaction is anticipated to close by calendar Q2 2026, following the closure of deal agreements and the required regulatory approvals. Upon closing the transaction, Micron will assume ownership and control of the P5 site to equip and ramp up DRAM production in phases, with PSMC relocating its Tongluo operations over a specific time. Micron expects this acquisition to contribute to meaningful DRAM wafer output beginning in the second half of calendar 2027.

This acquisition complements Micron’s ongoing global expansion plans as the company invests to meet long-term demand from its customers.

Rong Yan, the Chief Technology Officer at HeyGen, a visual storytelling platform, is telling tech professionals to think about how they measure success in their careers. Yan talked about his time working at companies like IBM, Meta, Square, Snapchat, and HubSpot on The Peterman Pod. He has also mentored many tech professionals along the way. His advice is simple: don't make getting promoted the most important thing. Yan said, “Don’t make promotions the objective of your work.” He said that linking job satisfaction too closely to titles can make it harder to grow and more stressful.

Former Meta employee Rong Yan: 'Career growth isn’t about titles'

Since getting his PhD in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 2006, Yan has worked in important roles at big tech companies. He started out as a researcher at IBM, then moved to Meta, where he went from researcher to manager in three years. After that, he was a director at Square and Snapchat. Before joining HeyGen in 2024, he was the vice president of engineering at HubSpot. Yan thought about his own path and saw a pattern among ambitious tech workers: “When you start to get into that mindset, you start to count your happiness or your career growth toward something that you don’t have full control over,” he said. He went on to say that only thinking about promotions can put too much stress on you. It often makes workers compare themselves to their coworkers instead of focusing on how far they've come.

Prioritise skill development and meaningful work

Yan tells professionals not to chase titles but to work on improving their skills, learning new things, and making meaningful contributions. He has learned that employees who think this way tend to move up in their careers without the constant stress of competition with their bosses. Andrea Wasserman, an executive coach, agrees with this point of view. She tells employees to think about the timing of opportunities in a strategic way: “Will this timing make it easier or harder for me to get a ‘yes?’” Yan stresses that the best way to grow your career is to keep learning and adding value, not waiting for recognition. By putting skills and impact first, professionals build a base that helps them move up in their careers and be happy at work.

Within the World’s Best Premium Economy Class Airlines award is the sub-category Best Premium Economy Class Airline Seats. This award zooms in on the seats available in each carrier's premium economy cabin, rather than on the entire premium economy product. Unsurprisingly, the results are broadly similar, although not identical. For example, the top three in the overall premium economy award are Virgin Atlantic in first, followed by Japan Airlines and Emirates.

Meanwhile, the top three for the seats sub-category are Emirates in first, then Japan Airlines and Virgin Atlantic. However, not all the carriers placing high in these awards offer transpacific flights, including Emirates and Virgin Atlantic. This article explores the top airlines in Skytrax's premium economy seat classification that offer them on transpacific flights: Japan Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Air New Zealand, and Cathay Pacific Airways. It observes what makes each of these airlines offer such an incredible premium economy seat. The article finishes by exploring the world's best premium economy seat, Emirates, which is not available on any transpacific flights.

Japan Airlines

Japan Airlines offers the best transpacific premium economy seat. It remains the only major transpacific carrier to offer over 40 inches of pitch in premium economy for transpacific aviation. 38 inches (96.5 cm) of pitch is considered the industry standard, but Japan Airlines' passengers enjoy 42 inches (107 cm) of pitch aboard its Boeing 777-300ER and Boeing 787 fleets. That means passengers well over six feet tall can enjoy plenty of legroom. Seat width is between 18.9 and 19.3 inches (48 cm and 49 cm), and there is a substantial divider between each seat. For additional comfort, passengers have a three-step adjustable footrest and a large leg rest. You can use these features to get into a position that may feel close to business class products that don't lie flat.

Another important feature of the seats is their fixed-back shell design. The premium economy seats recline into this shell, rather than into the personal space of the passenger behind. That makes it far easier to work on a laptop or enjoy a meal.

Japan Airlines' updated premium economy product centers around the Airbus A350-1000. The carrier received its first of this aircraft type in December 2023 and hopes it will become its future flagship aircraft. These aircraft have 24 premium economy seats in an eight-abreast layout. The carrier utilizes the latest articulated fixed-shell seats from Safran.

Singapore Airlines

Premium Economy can be found on Singapore Airlines A350-900s, A380s, and 777-300ERs, which have the fourth-best premium economy seats in the world according to Skytrax. However, you can't fly premium economy aboard the airline's 787-10s. Singapore's 777s are equipped with Safran Z535 recliner seats. They have a pitch of 38 inches (96.5 cm), a width of 19.5 inches (50 cm), and a recline of 8 inches (20 cm). The premium economy seats available on Singapore's A350-900 are identical, but have a 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) less pitch.

Alongside width and comfort, Singapore Airlines' transpacific premium economy seat also includes an excellent range of additional features. It includes two USB ports to keep your devices operational, an adjustable reading light, dedicated stowage areas, and a fantastic leg rest.

Singapore Airlines' premium economy product was hanging in the balance before the carrier decided to commit to it. The carrier's executives were initially skeptical, believing that premium passengers would choose business or first class instead. It took significant market pressure for Singapore to launch a premium economy product, but the strength of its offering indicates just how committed it is to it.

Delta Air Lines

The only Western Hemisphere carrier that flies transpacific on this list is Delta Air Lines, which previously utilized a hub at Tokyo Narita Airport (NRT) as the center of its transpacific operations. However, its busiest transpacific route is now Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) to Seoul Incheon (ICN). The carrier operates this route twice daily with 275-seat Airbus A350-900s. In the '39H' configuration, this aircraft has 40 Premium Select seats available. The carrier ranks fifth in the Skytrax Best Premium Economy Class Airline Seats 2025 awards.

The table below shows the five most frequently flown transpacific routes for Delta Air Lines A350s in the winter, based on data collected for December 2025. Please note that there are many more routes flown 121 times in December than there is space for in the table:

Aboard Premium Select, passengers can enjoy 38 inches (96.5 cm) of pitch, 18.5 (47 cm) to 19 inches (48 cm) of width, and seven inches (17.8 cm) of recline. The typical layouts are 2-4-2 for Delta A350s and 2-3-2 for A330s. The denser 2-4-2 layout can feel more crowded than what passengers often expect from a premium product.

Cathay Pacific Airways

Placing sixth in the Skytrax ranking for premium economy seats is Cathay Pacific. Its premium economy is available on some A330-300s, all A350-900s, A350-1000s, and 777-300ERs. Yet, it is not available on the carrier's 777-300s. The A350s have 28 to 32 premium economy seats, and 32 to 34 aboard its 777-300ERs.

There is some variation in what is available depending on the aircraft that you are flying on. The A350-900s use the Collins Aerospace MiQ seats, which have 40 inches of pitch, 18.5 inches of width, and nine inches of recline. The dimensions differ for the 777-300ER's Recaro R5 seats, which have 38.2 inches of pitch, 19.5 inches of width, and six inches of recline. If possible, choose the aircraft you will be flying on for a premium economy seat that is more appropriate for your body type.

In its marketing materials for the premium economy product, Cathay Pacific details what they believe sets them apart from their transpacific competition: ""Across all fleets, our Premium Economy seats offer a generous recline and more legroom, as well as a supported headrest. Full-length calf rests and leather-padded footrests ensure your journey is even more comfortable.""

Air New Zealand

Some Australasian carriers also have superb premium economy products. The best seat among them belongs to Air New Zealand, placing seventh in the relevant Skytrax rankings. The carrier drops to 12th in the overall premium economy rankings, suggesting that it is let down by other aspects of the product.

Layouts and seat dimensions vary across the Air New Zealand widebody aircraft that offer premium economy. The standard Boeing 787-9 has premium economy seats in rows 23 to 25 for a total of 21 seats, with a pitch of 41 inches (104 cm). The V2 Boeing 787-9 configuration has 33 premium economy seats from rows 23 to 27. The pitch is 41 to 42 inches (104 to 106 cm). The Boeing 777-300ER has the same pitch. However, premium economy seats are available in rows 23 to 30 for a total of 54 seats.

New Zealand flies to a huge variety of destinations from its hub at Auckland International Airport (AKL), many of which are transpacific. Examples of US destinations include Honolulu (HNL), Houston (HOU), Los Angeles (LAX), and San Francisco (SFO). The carrier also flies transpacific to Vancouver (YVR).

The World's Best Premium Economy Seat Isn't Available On Transpacific Routes

Ranked first is Emirates, but due to the airline flying from the Middle East, you can't get it for any transpacific flights. Avgeeks will love Emirates' premium economy for flights to Europe, America, Asia, and Africa because it is available on rare aircraft. For example, in October 2025, Emirates rolled out premium economy on every Airbus A380 flight between Dubai and New York. This product has also been rolled out on flights with the same aircraft to London, Sydney, and Auckland. It's all part of a $2 billion cabin upgrade initiative.

These seats are particularly spacious, with a width of 19.5 inches (50 cm), an eight-inch (20 cm) recline, and a pitch of 40 inches (102 cm). The seats are in cream and feature leg rests, leg support cushions, and foot rests. The adjustable headrests allow passengers to customize the experience for their needs. This room is essential for comfortable long-haul flying. The layout aboard an A380 is 2-4-2, meaning fewer passengers get stuck in the dreaded middle seat. Aboard Emirates' A380s, these seats are located in the forward section of economy class. However, they are still on the main deck, so you won't get the unique experience of upper-deck flying.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/premiumeconomy-2.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-17 13:02:09.192336

In 2022, prices for food prepared at home jumped by a historic 11.8% from the year before, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index survey.

While prices didn’t drop in 2025, the rate of inflation for groceries has, for the most part, slowed.

In July, costs for groceries were 2.2% higher than the year before.

The nonprofit Consumers’ Checkbook’s latest evaluations of Puget Sound grocery stores found that most shoppers can save by shopping at low-cost stores.

Checkbook researchers shopped stores using a 150-item list to compare prices. To evaluate stores on the quality of products and service, we surveyed our members.

Here’s what we found.

Use this link for free access to Checkbook’s ratings of 21 grocery stores and delivery services in the Puget Sound area (good through 2/15/26).

Amazon Fresh, Grocery Outlet, Walmart, and WinCo offer the biggest savings.

WinCo offered prices about 24 percent lower than the average at all other stores we surveyed. Grocery Outlet, which offers a somewhat odd assortment of steeply discounted surplus national-brand products, offered prices that were about 21 percent lower than average.

Amazon Fresh and Walmart each had prices about 19 percent lower than the all-store average.

For a family that spends $300 per week at the supermarket, a 24 percent price difference totals savings of $3,744 per year.

Other price standouts: Fred Meyer and Target.

Target’s prices were about 14 percent lower than the average at all other stores we surveyed; Fred Meyer had prices about 10 percent lower.

Trader Joe’s remains popular and relatively inexpensive.

Seventy-five percent of survey respondents rated the funky-and-fun chain “superior” for “overall quality.” TJ’s prices were about 12 percent lower than the all-store average.

These savings are partly explained by Trader Joe’s smaller-format stores, which have much lower overhead costs than conventional supermarkets.

Whole Foods remains expensive—and its ratings for quality continue to dip.

Whole Foods built a loyal following by offering high-quality produce, meat, prepared foods, and generic staples. For years it earned high marks in our surveys of consumers, especially for

produce and meat quality. Now, Whole Foods’ customers give it far lower scores: On our “overall quality” survey question, its score has dropped to just 53 percent.

Our price survey found that Whole Foods remains an expensive choice among the large chains we shopped.

Its overall prices were about five percent higher than the average prices at all stores we surveyed, or about 17 percent higher than Fred Meyer and 30 percent higher than Amazon Fresh, its corporate sibling.

Albertsons, QFC, and Safeway charge similar prices.

Overall, the stores we shopped for the area’s remaining traditional supermarket powers all had prices that were one to six percent higher than average.

On average, they were 28 percent more expensive than Amazon Fresh and Walmart and 37 percent more expensive than WinCo.

On the quality side, the largest grocery chains performed dreadfully.

Albertsons, Fred Meyer, Grocery Outlet, QFC, Safeway, Target, and Walmart each failed to earn “superior” ratings overall from even half of their surveyed customers.

Target scored lowest—only 18 percent of its customers judged it “superior” overall, and none thought highly of its fresh produce offerings.

The highest-rated outlets are all small operators.

Central Co-op, Metropolitan Market, PCC Community Markets, Thriftway, and Town & Country were all rated “superior” for produce quality and for overall quality by more than 85 percent of their surveyed customers.

Unfortunately, the stores that rate highest for quality charge high prices.

Metropolitan’s prices were about 29 percent higher than the all-store average; the Town & Country location we shopped had prices 19 percent higher than average.

Within the largest chains, there is relatively little store-to-store price variation.

Prices at the Albertsons, Fred Meyer, QFC, Safeway, and Walmart locations we surveyed were about the same from store to store.

Costco will save you money—if you shop there often.

Using our market basket of 150 grocery items, we surveyed prices for Costco and compared them to Walmart, Target, and traditional supermarkets.

The Costco we surveyed carried few if any of the items in our market basket in the usual sizes. But when we looked for the same brands regardless of size, Costco stocked 39 percent of our 150 market basket items.

Since Costco stocked so few items in the sizes of our basic market basket, we looked for items of any size from the same brands.

We then used unit prices (for example, price per pound) to calculate Costco’s prices for amounts specified in the market basket.

Then we compared the prices of items at Costco with prices for the same brands at several other stores.

This is not an apples-to-apples comparison—the sizes of the items priced at Costco were usually larger than the sizes of the items priced at the other stores, so Costco enjoys an advantage in such a comparison.

Compared to Walmart and WinCo, its main local competitors, Costco has lost much of its price edge. The warehouse club’s prices were only six percent lower than WinCo’s and nine percent lower than Walmart’s.

Although Costco still offers low prices compared to, say, QFC, Safeway, and even Target, due to higher prices, it’s difficult to justify paying Costco’s $65 annual membership fee if you’re happy with Walmart or WinCo’s grocery offerings.

Costco continues to earn very high customer ratings for the quality of its meat.

The average age on the USS Ford is similar to a college campus.
A month after USS Ford left Norfolk, the engineering department was struggling to explain the problem to leadership.
Similar upgrades on CVN 77 (the carrier USS George HW Bush) have resulted in fewer VCHT maintenance issues,"" Lt. Cmdr.
The carrier USS Ford was already the most expensive ship ever built by the Navy.","New documents show the crew on board the United States' newest aircraft carrier are growing increasingly frustrated by design flaws that lead to regular failures in the ship's toilet system.

The USS Gerald R. Ford has been deployed for seven months since it left Norfolk in June. The carrier is currently at the center of the Trump administration's flotilla of Navy ships in the Caribbean. Since the raid that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, the carrier continues to work with the Coast Guard as the U.S. interdicts oil tankers tied to Venezuela.

On board the carrier, the crew is battling a toilet system that the General Accountability Office reported in 2020 was undersized and poorly designed. The system continues to fail during deployment, forcing the crew of 4,600 sailors to live with a system that randomly breaks down during their months at sea.

NPR has obtained documents that include a series of emails that detail the ship's effort to grapple with the breakdowns. Problems with the Vacuum Collection, Holding and Transfer (VCHT) system increased in 2025. The vacuum system was adopted in part from the cruise ship industry. It uses less water, but the system used by USS Ford is more complex. Breakdowns have been reported since the $13 billion carrier first deployed in 2023.

""Every day that the entire crew is present on the ship, a trouble call has been made for ship's force personnel to repair or unclog a portion of the VCHT system, since June 2023,"" reads an undated document provided by the Navy, through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.

The carrier has called for help outside the ship 42 times since 2023. The rate of calls is increasing, with 32 calls happening in 2025;12 calls were made after the carrier started its recent deployment in June.

A March 18, 2025 email from the engineering department sent out to all chiefs on the ship said there were 205 breakdowns in four days. The sailors who work on the sewage system, called hull maintenance technicians (HTs), fell behind in the months leading up to USS Ford's scheduled deployment.

""Our sewage system is being mistreated and destroyed by Sailors on a daily basis. My HT's are currently working 19 hours a day right now trying to keep up with the demand,"" according to the email.

The average age on the USS Ford is similar to a college campus. For many of the sailors, this is their first extended time away from home. At times the emails almost evoke a floating dorm room, revealing that everything from t-shirts to a four-foot piece of rope have been removed from the system. The vacuum pipes are narrow. Brown paper towels and even commercial toilet paper also cause breakdowns. The most common problem is a valve at the back of the toilets that can be knocked loose and cause all of the toilets (which the Navy calls heads) in one of 10 zones to lose suction.

""FYI, if you need to use the head, go now. At 13:30, expect the system to come down for about two hours. We are looking for a vacuum leak in zone 6,"" reads a March 18 email from the chief engineer on USS Ford.

A month after the carrier left Norfolk July 24, 2025, initially bound for Europe and the Mediterranean, the mother of a sailor contacted NPR to complain about the unsanitary conditions on the carrier. Around the same time, emails from USS Ford show the executive officer on the Ford was demanding answers from the engineering department about breakdowns.

The most expensive problem is calcium build-ups, which clog narrow pipes, especially in the lower decks of the ship. The 2020 GAO report said the Navy spends $400,000 for an acid flush to restore the system. A document showed the ship has been acid flushed at least 10 times since 2023. The work can only be done in port. A month after USS Ford left Norfolk, the engineering department was struggling to explain the problem to leadership.

""That's just the nature of VCHT. It's a closed system and thousands of components ship-wide that fail daily. With one commode control valve failure, depending on the location brings down the entire zone,"" according to an Aug. 15, 2025 email from the engineering department.

The crew has been reaching out to the A1B Propulsion Plant Planning Yard at Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia for answers, according to an email chain between the carrier and the planning yard. The planning yard is part of Huntington Ingalls Industries, which is the only shipyard in the world that builds Ford Class aircraft carriers. The Navy's In-Service Aircraft Carrier Program Office (PMS312) is responsible for maintaining the carriers.

""What we want to do is give you a temporary resolution to get your heads into a somewhat functional use until such time 10+ years down the road when PMS312 finally gets around to paying for a redesign,"" reads a July 24 email back to the carrier from the planning yard.

Longstanding problem

Whenever USS Ford wraps up its assignments in the Caribbean, the carrier is scheduled to go into maintenance this year at the Navy's public shipyard, Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Virginia, according to the emails. The Navy has known the system is undersized and riddled with issues for more than a decade. A similar vacuum system was installed on the last Nimitz-Class carrier USS George HW Bush. In 2013, the carrier experienced similar problems, with toilets going off line.

The Navy said Ford will eventually be given an upgrade.

""GRF (USS Gerald R. Ford) is scheduled to receive VCHT system improvements in upcoming maintenance availabilities. Similar upgrades on CVN 77 (the carrier USS George HW Bush) have resulted in fewer VCHT maintenance issues,"" Lt. Cmdr. David Carter, spokesman for Fleet Forces Command said in a statement to NPR.

The trail of emails provided through the Navy ends in August, before USS Ford sailed for the Caribbean in November to be part of the build up of U.S. forces around Venezuela.

Without providing details, Carter said the problems with the toilets have gotten better as the deployment continues. The average outage is between half an hour and two hours and the problems have had ""no operational impact,"" he said.

Experts say a long-term fix is not expected this year.

Problems with the carrier's waste system were known well before it was given to the Navy. Part of the solution may include putting more sailors on board the ship to keep up with the repairs, though the ship was actually designed to require fewer sailors to operate it than older Nimitz carriers, said Shelby Oakley, director of GAO.

""It's important to kind of think about, like we're asking you sailors to live in these conditions,"" she said. ""We should at least be able to provide them with living facilities, to be able to not have to kind of struggle in that regard. And it's unfortunate that this is where we're at.""

The carrier USS Ford was already the most expensive ship ever built by the Navy. It is stacked with new technology and many of the systems had not been proven in the field, which drove up the cost and delayed its delivery to the Navy. Borrowing the sewage system from commercial cruise ships may have been a mistake, said Bryan Clark with the Hudson Institute.

""Maybe this is an example where they should have kept the old system rather than going after the new technology,"" Clark said.

A cruise ship has a very different mission from a nuclear-powered warship, which is designed to remain at sea for months. It is a cautionary tale, as the Trump administration looks at increasing the pace of ship building, including a proposed battleship that would have potentially even more systems that have not been tested in the field, Clark said.

In a blog post, OpenAI said ChatGPT Go launched in India in August and has rolled out to more than 170 countries. The US entry now gives OpenAI three tiers for its subscription plans.

ChatGPT Go is $8 per month.

ChatGPT Pro is $200 per month.

ChatGPT Business is $25 per month for smaller companies. ChatGPT Enterprise pricing varies.

What remains to be seen is whether ChatGPT Plus subscribers trade down to ChatGPT Go, which carries ads. My working theory is that AI services may resemble streaming where customers realize ads aren't so bad if you can save money. ChatGPT Go has more messages, uploads and image creation tools than the free tier, but less than ChatGPT Plus. For many folks, that access may be fine. ChatGPT Plus will include GPT 5.2 Thinking, the ability to use legacy models and Codex. ChatGPT Plus can also retain details from past conversations longer.

More importantly to OpenAI's financial picture is its plans to roll out ads on the free tier and ChatGPT Go tiers.

Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco highlighted a pivotal moment for global healthcare. For years, providers, payers, and medtech companies have explored the potential of artificial intelligence, digital platforms, and precision medicine. This year, the focus shifted decisively from theory to action. Healthcare is no longer imagining the future; it is deploying it at scale, transforming patient care, operations, and research.

Generative AI platforms such asChatGPT Health andClaude for Healthcare are moving beyond pilot projects to enterprise applications. Conference leaders shared concrete examples of AI accelerating clinical workflows, improving revenue cycle management, enhancing patient engagement, and powering research and development. The consensus was clear: innovation alone is no longer enough.

The conference offered a clear message for the next decade. Organizations that succeed will be those that integrate AI into their core strategy, scale digital platforms effectively, and embed innovation across clinical, operational, and financial systems. At JPM26, it became evident that the future of healthcare will be defined not by ideas but by execution and measurable impact.

Health Systems: Integration as Strategic and Operational Imperative

Major nonprofit health systems demonstrated that scale without operational excellence no longer delivers an advantage.Advocate Health reported 1.5 billion in annual operating savings three years post-merger, achieved while adding more than 23,000 jobs. Executives highlighted improvements in vendor contract management, labor throughput, and enterprise-wide clinical standards. Leapfrog safety ratings expanded from five to 24 hospitals, signaling quality improvements alongside efficiency.

Mass General Brigham'sFor Every Patient initiative emphasized system-wide realignment to eliminate silos and accelerate decision-making, reducing length of stay, improving patient flow, and shortening behavioral health wait times. AdventHealth highlighted consolidation viaEpic and Workday platforms and the deployment of over 80 AI use cases, including smart inpatient rooms, enhancing remote care, and patient engagement.Providencereinforced organizational culture through in-office leadership, while Intermountain Healthcare emphasized collaboration and operational innovation with AeroTerra Health, a nationwide medical transport venture supporting care and margin resilience.

As AI becomes more central to operations, executives stress the importance of linking technology to strategy. Feby Abraham, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy and Innovations Officer at Memorial Hermann Health System, noted the necessity of embedding innovation into core health system priorities. “AI is most powerful when it is directly tied to system priorities. Innovation cannot sit on the sidelines. It has to be embedded in how we deliver care, manage operations, and plan for the future,” Abraham said.

CommonSpirit Health CEO Wright Lassiter outlined new divestiture plans and AI adoption milestones. The $40 billion Catholic health system has executed about half a dozen divestitures since its merger and will announce additional portfolio transitions in the next quarter, focusing on communities and care areas where impact is greatest, particularly ambulatory care and underserved regions. Lassiter highlighted the deployment of 242 AI tools, moving from point solutions to enterprise-scale applications. AI initiatives have generated an estimated 100 million in annual value, including automated clinical notetaking, patient call processing, and neuro emergency triage, reducing door-to-treatment times by over 40% across more than 50 facilities.

AI-enabled sepsis monitoring, active since 2015, contributed to saving 3,655 patients in fiscal year 2025. Lassiter emphasized responsible AI use, urging deployment to benefit both employees and patients, and launched an AI Workforce Readiness Academy to reskill and upskill several thousand employees. He also called for collaboration among providers and insurers to avoid competitive misuse of AI, focusing instead on operational efficiency and patient care.

Artificial Intelligence: From Pilot Projects to Enterprise Platforms

Waystar showcased agentic AI for revenue cycle management, automating workflows and reducing denials. Leveraging 7.5 billion annual transactions and coverage of one-third of U.S. hospital discharges, the system achieved a 98.9 percent first-pass claim acceptance rate and optimized documentation accuracy.

OpenEvidence positioned its platform as a medical superintelligence, used daily by over 40 percent of U.S. physicians, with integrations to the American Medical Association, The New England Journal of Medicine, and JAMA content. The company’s 6 billion valuation reflects strong investor confidence in clinical AI tools.

Anthropic introduced Claude for Healthcare, built for regulated environments with access to CMS coverage databases, ICD-10 coding systems, the NPI Registry, and PubMed. Early adopters include Banner Health, Stanford Healthcare, Sanofi, AbbVie, and Genmab. Claude’s FHIR-integrated Agent Skills enable developers to build compliant healthcare applications.

OpenAI also announcedChatGPT Health, a dedicated health experience with privacy and clinical relevance, connecting securely to medical records and wellness apps. Institutions such asAdventHealth, Boston Children’s Hospital,Cedars-Sinai, HCA Healthcare, and UCSF are piloting ChatGPT for Healthcare to reduce administrative burden and enhance documentation.

UCSF Health andAmgen emphasized disciplined AI deployment across 90 tools, prioritizing high-impact research, development, and clinical initiatives. SSM Health reported revenue cycle improvements driving profitability, while Omada Health demonstrated 50 percent year-over-year revenue growth with nearly 900,000 members, highlighting virtual care adoption.

Scaling AI and Digital Transformation

Amid discussions on AI at scale and enterprise digital transformation, industry leaders highlighted the critical importance of turning strategy into measurable execution.

Vishnu Saxena, Founder and CEO of ScaleHealthTech, emphasized the need for execution beyond strategy. “ In my conversation with healthcare leaders, I found the urgency around execution. It’s no longer about what to transform digitally, but how fast and how sustainably those AI transformations can be executed. Healthcare stakeholders are focused on speed, sustainability, and execution at scale” Saxena said.

His insights exemplify the broader trend of enterprise-ready AI and digital partnerships, showing how health systems are moving from pilot projects to scalable system-wide deployment.

Surescripts unveiled Script Corner in collaboration with GoodRx, combining benefit data, medication management, and personalized engagement to reduce abandonment and improve adherence.Teladoc Health outlined a strategy focusing on specialist consultations, continuous glucose monitoring, in-home diagnostics, and AI-enabled patient insights, integrating BetterHelp into insurance markets. Judi Health, evolving from Capital Rx, now provides a unified enterprise claims platform, while Omada Health reinforces chronic care with AI-driven programs.

Policy and Financial Context

CMS leadership outlined priorities in interoperability, price transparency, and accountable care models, introducing programs such as the Long-Term Enhanced ACO Design. Rising uninsured populations and reimbursement uncertainty remain key factors influencing long-term strategy.

Aneesh Chopra -Former CTO of the United States, Chairman of Arcadia Institute and the most respected HealthTech policy expert emphasizes CMS advancing AI, data sharing, and transparency while attracting entrepreneurial talent to improve healthcare. “The highlight for me was hearing from CMS leadership in forums large and small to educate the market on advances in AI, data sharing and consumer transparency, as well as recruiting top market talent to enlist in public service. It reminded me of our DC to VC initiative as part of STARTUP AMERICA to tap the entrepreneurial spirit of the country to move our health system forward,” said Chopra

Organizations like Arcadia are helping health systems connect data strategy, policy compliance, and AI-driven outcomes to achieve scalable results.

Biotech and Medtech Innovation

Tempus expanded precision oncology through collaborations with NYU Langone Health and Northwestern Medicine, integrating genomic testing with AI-driven insights. The company reported 1.27 billion in 2025 revenue, reflecting momentum in data-driven medicine.

Baxter introduced Dynamo Series smart stretchers, combining caregiver ergonomics with EMR integration and workflow efficiency. Women’s health attracted renewed investment focus, with over 100 billion in exits over the past 25 years, demonstrating commercial scale and viability.

Execution Over Aspiration

JPM26 highlighted operational discipline over aspiration. Integration is measured in results, AI in enterprise deployment, and capital in execution.

DTCC rejects the creation of “walled gardens” to allow digital assets to flow frictionlessly between different networks.

The initial infrastructure will rely on Canton Network and AppChain, prioritizing security and client liquidity demand.

Experts debate the nature of these assets, as the tokens represent claims on securities already safeguarded by the entity.

The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has defined its vision for the future of financial asset tokenization. Nadine Chakar, the firm’s head of digital assets, assured that they are not building “walled gardens”; instead, they are betting on interoperability so that digital securities can move efficiently and without extra costs across various blockchains.

Despite the open approach, the firm maintains a cautious stance due to cybersecurity risks within the crypto ecosystem. For this reason, the strategy focuses on connecting the traditional financial system with new digital infrastructures, using messaging standards that guarantee data integrity in an environment where new Layer 1 networks appear constantly.

Security and Flexibility in Blockchain Infrastructure

To achieve successful financial asset tokenization, DTCC selected Canton Network, a permissioned blockchain designed specifically for institutions. Brian Steele, a managing director at the firm, explained that this choice responds to the need for offering after-hours financing and improving liquidity for market makers, adapting to the operational demands of Wall Street.

However, the project is not without criticism from crypto-natives, who question the fact that the tokens are not “native” to the network but rather representations of safeguarded assets. In response, DTCC reaffirms that its priority is to offer clients the freedom to choose among multiple blockchains, provided they meet rigorous security and institutional resiliency parameters.",https://crypto-economy.com//wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tokenizacion-de-activos-financieros-.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 14:00:54.164320

Our Take On Uber Technologies' ROCE To the delight of most shareholders, Uber Technologies has now broken into profitability.","If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So when we looked at Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.

Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.

Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)

If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Uber Technologies:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.091 = US$4.6b ÷ (US$63b - US$13b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2025).

So, Uber Technologies has an ROCE of 9.1%. In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Transportation industry average of 9.7%.

So How Is Uber Technologies' ROCE Trending?

We're delighted to see that Uber Technologies is reaping rewards from its investments and is now generating some pre-tax profits. Shareholders would no doubt be pleased with this because the business was loss-making five years ago but is is now generating 9.1% on its capital. Not only that, but the company is utilizing 129% more capital than before, but that's to be expected from a company trying to break into profitability. This can tell us that the company has plenty of reinvestment opportunities that are able to generate higher returns.

Our Take On Uber Technologies' ROCE

To the delight of most shareholders, Uber Technologies has now broken into profitability. Since the stock has returned a solid 56% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.

Like most companies, Uber Technologies does come with some risks, and we've found 2 warning signs that you should be aware of.

ID46,Walmart,2026-01-17 13:02:30+00:00,Yahoo Finance,Bill Gates isn't even close to America's largest private landowner. It's 'Silent Stan' Kroenke ...,Sasha Rogelberg,,,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bill-gates-isn-t-even-202307853.html,"Kroenke owns 2.7 million acres, about as much as 2 million football fields and larger than the sprawling Yosemite National Park.
It was the largest land purchase in the U.S. in more than a decade.
Bill Gates, who owns 275,000 acres of land, ranks 44th.
Nearly 40% of U.S. farmland is now owned by landlords, who lease their property to farmers and operators.
For farmers in contemporary America, they are hard-pressed to outbid rivals like Silent Stan for farmland.","Stan Kroenke, the billionaire owner of the world’s most valuable portfolio of sports clubs, including the Los Angeles Rams and London’s Arsenal Football Club, can boast another title. The Colorado real-estate magnate, once dubbed “Silent Stan” for his reticence to talk to the press, is America’s largest private landowner, according to a report published this week by The Land Report. Kroenke owns 2.7 million acres, about as much as 2 million football fields and larger than the sprawling Yosemite National Park.

Rocketing up to the No. 1 spot on the list—up from No. 4 in 2025—Kroenke’s holdings ballooned largely thanks to a purchase of 937,000 acres of ranchland in December from the Singleton family behind industrial conglomerate Teledyne Technologies. It was the largest land purchase in the U.S. in more than a decade.

Kroenke owes the beginnings of his real estate empire to the success of Walmart, and not just because of his marriage (since 1974) to Walmart heiress Ann Walton Kroenke. The sports and real estate magnate made his first fortune by developing shopping centers, many with the big-box retailer as its core attraction.

In the past year, Kroenke leapfrogged fellow billionaires John “the Cable Cowboy” Malone, who ranks No. 2 on the list, and media mogul Ted Turner, who sits at No. 3. The Emmerson family, which operates forest products company Sierra Pacific Industries, owns an estimated 2.4 million acres, much of it timberland. Bill Gates, who owns 275,000 acres of land, ranks 44th. (He uses his property, the majority of which is farmland owned through his investment group Cascade Investment, to grow onions, carrots, and the potatoes used in McDonald’s fries.)

What many of the list share, besides their astonishing wealth, is the pursuit of snapping up farmland—including ranchlands and timberlands—an emerging asset class for the ultrawealthy to protect their wealth, hedging against inflation and the volatility of some traditional assets. In 2025, the value of U.S. farmland was about $4,350 per acre on average, a 4.3% year-over-year increase, or nearly 2% when adjusted for inflation, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Nearly 40% of U.S. farmland is now owned by landlords, who lease their property to farmers and operators.

Farmland has become a $4.3 trillion asset class as a result of its growing popularity, according to Steve Bruere, president of agricultural rest estate firm Peoples Company.

“If you believe you want diversification, and you also believe we’re going to have underlying inflation—which is what a lot of people want right now—then farmland is a great option for them,” Bruere told Fortune.

Kroenke, via his holding company, did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.

The rise of the farmland asset class

The 2008 financial crisis stirred in investors an urgent desire to seek out alternative investments, and America’s ultrawealthy turned to farmland to diversify their portfolios, much like how investors today are turning to alternative assets, from gold to private credit, to hedge against fears of an AI-driven market collapse.

Much like the real-estate boom of the 1970s, investors today are scooping up farmland as a hedge against inflation, a physical asset that can retain and grow its value because it’s a finite resource. Farmland value is, afterall, positively correlated with inflation—meaning farmless with appreciation in value as inflation rises—and non-correlated with markets. There’s also a theory among investors that because of growing populations, rising income, and therefore a rising demand for food and fuel, farms will only become more valuable.

“Getting your hands on some farmland where the number of arable acres in the world declines every year, that’s why a lot of people like it,” Bruere said.

That’s all in addition to the passive income of leasing out the land to farmers, many of whom don’t have the capital to be able to buy their own land, according to Bruere.

Erin Foster West, policy campaigns director for the National Young Farmers Coalition, said that many farmers aren’t able to buy the land they work, leaving renting as their only opportunity.

Farmland rent is increasing at a more modest rate than the price to buy the land, making it an appealing option: Average rent for U.S. cropland increased to $161 per acre in last year, just a 0.6% year-over-year increase, per data from the USDA’s Land Values survey. But the working farmer can hardly compete with deep-pocketed figures such as Kroenke.

To hear top analyst Tom Lee, of Fundstrat, describe the situation, farming never recovered from the invention of flash-frozen foods in the 1920s. Farming made up 40% of the economy before freezing freed up more of people’s time, he recently said in an appearance on the Prof G Markets podcast. “It allowed people to be repurposed, and it created a completely new labor force,” Lee said.

For farmers in contemporary America, they are hard-pressed to outbid rivals like Silent Stan for farmland.

“It makes it much harder for farmers to compete, especially beginning farmers who are maybe trying to acquire their first farm, or even an existing farmer who might want to grow and expand,” Foster West told Fortune.

The ‘Bermuda (Re)insurance Monitor: 2026’ attributed catastrophe losses to the rise, with about eight percentage points added in 2025, primarily from the California wildfires, up from 6.4 points in 2024.

The January 2026 reinsurance renewals demonstrated a strong shift to a buyers’ market, particularly for property risk, which experienced its largest rate declines in over a decade. Fitch anticipates softening market conditions to continue at the mid-year 2026 renewals as the competitive environment intensifies, although risk-adjusted returns should remain attractive.

Shareholders’ equity grew 12% at nine month end 2025 from year end 2024 due to underwriting gains, solid investment income and equity and bond market gains, partially offset by a sizable increase in capital returned to shareholders. Fitch expects ROE will remain favourable in 2025 at near 17%, down only slightly from 17.8% in 2024.

Bermuda consolidation activity will likely continue as companies use M&A as an option to deploy accumulated capital amid slowing organic growth in a softening market.

""For a century, Caterpillar has built the industrial machines that shaped the world,"" Nvidia Founder and CEO Jensen Huang said. ""In the age of AI, Nvidia and Caterpillar are partnering across the full spectrum — from autonomous construction fleets to the AI data centers powering the next industrial revolution.""

Equipping Machines for the AI Generation

The Nvidia Jetson Thor platform enables real-time AI inference on Cat construction, mining and power equipment. Caterpillar expects these upgrades to ensure assets are ready for AI-assisted and potentially autonomous operations.

For example:

An intelligent operator assistant providing customers with personalized insights

Construction and mining machines equipped with AI-driven recommendations, capable of processing billions of data points in milliseconds to navigate complex, variable jobsite conditions.

Cat fleets powered by AI, machine learning, computer vision and edge computing that process sensor data in real time and serve as a digital nervous system for customers' jobsites.

Debuting the Cat AI Assistant

At CES 2026, Caterpillar debuted the Cat AI Assistant, a proactive partner embedded in Cat digital and onboard products that helps customers take confident action. The Cat AI Assistant, which was built using Nvidia Riva open speech models, will answer questions and provide personalized recommendations on equipment, parts, maintenance and more.

In cab, it will use voice activation to enable settings, guide troubleshooting and connect users to the right resources across Cat apps and websites. It uses Caterpillar's own trusted data stored on the Helios unified data platform.

Transforming Manufacturing and Supply Chain Operations

To meet evolving industry needs, Caterpillar is using its Nvidia AI Factory to transform manufacturing and supply. The company's manufacturing digital data platform takes advantage of this accelerated AI infrastructure and Nvidia AI libraries to automate and accelerate important manufacturing processes, including forecasting and scheduling.

Caterpillar is also building physically accurate digital twins of its factories on Nvidia Omniverse libraries and OpenUSD. With these digital twins, Caterpillar teams can design, simulate and optimize layouts and production processes before building in the real world.

Driving Industrial Innovation Forward

Project Palmetto is a company moving its headquarters to Laurens County, with a $19 Million, 57 new jobs project.
The county needs an audit, we have been through 2-3 county administrators and no money has been counted.
“A lot of work goes into making the county run, and this should be a cohesive group, working for Laurens County.","Five industrial prospects will have made, or will be in the process of making, their ways through the Laurens County Council incentives and approval process as the new year begins.

Briefed on the projects at their Jan. 12 meeting, Council gave unanimous approval to various incentives, fee in lieu of taxes agreements, and industrial park assignment measures. Just one of the five prospects was named - before 3rd and final reading, prospects generally are referred to by code-names for competitive reasons.

Adeptus USA LLC was identified as the industry behind a $93 Million, 126 new jobs prospect in the former Michelin distribution center at Metric Road, Laurens. A public hearing and final reading of the ordinance was conducted, and the industry will be included in the Octagon Industrial Park, which is not a physical place but a collection of industries located in various places (in a collaboration with Greenville County).

Project Floyd is a $68.6 Million, 50 jobs project in the Hunter Industrial Park, Laurens, going into an existing building. Council took the unusual step of having a public hearing before final reading - the industry had a last-minute issue with its real estate closing, but since the public hearing had been advertised (as though the project was going to get final reading), it was allowed to go forward.

Project Diamond is a new industry coming to the Clinton area in the city limits. It’s a $9 Million, 70 new jobs project. Previously, council was told it will behind the Nordsom plant, and at Monday’s meeting it was referenced that it would be “behind the truck stop”. This was the 2nd of 3 readings, and council gave 2nd reading to an ordinance to create the Clinton Industrial Park (in a collaboration with Spartanburg County; of the revenues, 25% goes to School District 56, 25% to the City of Clinton, 25% to Laurens County, and 25% to the Laurens County economic development fund).

Project Palmetto is a company moving its headquarters to Laurens County, with a $19 Million, 57 new jobs project. An inducement resolution and first reading of an ordinance were approved unanimously. Discussion indicated it will be in The Connexial Center, a local/state industrial area off I-385 near Gray Court.

Finally, Project Basel amends a current industrial agreement, as an existing industry changes its agreement with a $49 Million original investment that now is over $109 Million. Its ordinance was approved “by title only,” and Council Vice-chairman Matthew Brownlee abstained from this vote.

In other business, council heard from Treasurer Cynthia Burke that her office would become just the 3rd in the state, behind Spartanburg and Aiken, to provide one-stop-shopping for vehicle registrations, reducing the amount of time standing in line at the Treasurer’s Office to pay vehicle taxes and then at the DMV to pay for and acquire licenses plates and renewal stickers.

Council agreed to buy 1 & 3 Gallon St., Laurens, for $75,000 to facilitate a stormwater improvement project that is federally funded.

Council agreed to have a second meeting quarterly on the 4th Monday to allow citizens to bring forth any topic they want to the governing body. This is in place of public comments at the 2nd Monday regular meeting which now are for agenda items only.

Pertaining to the Potters Field burial ground for indigent people (near the county airport), Council agreed that the Laurens County Chamber of Commerce Foundation can be designated as a collection point for anyone who wants to donate money to the burial ground’s upkeep. At least one donation already has been made, council was told.

In Council Comments, members wished the audience and the public a good new year. Brownlee introduced the council to his fiancee, saying they had become engaged on Jan. 1, and said he had asked her to attend at least one meeting to “see what she was in for.” Council Member Arthur Philson Jr. provided county department heads with certificates showing his appreciation for their work, and for the work of their employees.

Serving his first year on council, Philson said, “This year, I’d like to see the penny sales tax people get together and come up with items that need to be addressed. The county needs an audit, we have been through 2-3 county administrators and no money has been counted. We need a county pay raise for these people, we have people making $12/hour — $15/hr should be the minimum for county salaries. We have people moving from one department to another for pay. And all these housing developments, I’m learning. Show me where the money’s at.”

Council Chairman Jeff Carroll did not respond directly but he made it clear that county finances are audited independently every year. “The county administrator can help you know where the money is. It’s budget time and that is an opportunity for everyone to learn how government works, how things are funded,” he said. “A lot of work goes into making the county run, and this should be a cohesive group, working for Laurens County. We want to start this year good and calm, and (to employees) thank you for what you do.”",https://beta.creativecirclecdn.com/clinton/original/20260116-133715-ae3-Development%20Hunter%20Park.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 04:58:59.668520

“I love that.” Filed Under: clinical trials, Drug Discovery","Clinical trials are drowning in data. In a TransCelerate/Tufts analysis published in late 2025, phase 3 protocols averaged more than 5.9 million data points, up 67% since 2020. The researchers found that nearly one-third of procedures and associated data were non-core or non-essential. In other words, a good portion of this data does not directly support primary objectives or key secondary endpoints.

That complexity matters because every extra field carries a downstream cost: more time for site staff, more queries, more monitoring, more protocol amendments and more burden for participants.

Unwinding that degree of complexity is no easy feat, and too big of a task for any single organization, said Janice Chang, CEO of TransCelerate. “The system is built with friction, fragmentation and systemic barriers.”

TransCelerate, founded in 2012, brings biopharma sponsors together to work on shared clinical trial pain points that single companies struggle to solve alone, Chang said. The nonprofit’s goal is to bring more patients into clinical research by reducing friction in how trials are designed and run.

“My North Star is about bringing clinical research to the patients and meeting them where they are. My dream would be that there is no more ‘enrollment.’ Every patient is just on a trial as part of their care,” she said.

Chang points first to geography. In the U.S., a significant share of counties do not have access to clinical research, she said. County-level analyses in oncology show how sharp that gradient can be. A 2023 ASCO policy analysis, for example, found that about 70% of U.S. counties had no active cancer treatment clinical trial, with availability concentrated around metro areas and academic centers.

Access is only one barrier. “Many people can’t reach trials, or don’t believe trials are designed for them,” Chang said. Sites are also strained, she added, citing statistics suggesting approximately 50% report being overburdened by administrative work such as training, paperwork, and contracts.

In one breast cancer program, Chang said the protocol initially required a second biopsy for screening. After study teams gathered early patient feedback, they learned the procedure was too burdensome and logistically difficult. The protocol was amended to allow archived diagnostic samples instead, reducing burden and improving feasibility.

Technology is often pitched as the answer: decentralized trials, remote monitoring, AI-powered patient matching. But the industry’s ability to deploy those tools lags behind the marketing.

A recent McKinsey report found that while most companies are investing in AI, only 1% describe their gen AI rollouts as mature. “We’re far from mastering it,” Chang said.

Chang framed the technology as disruptive. “Companies face a fairly binary decision: either you lead, or you get disrupted.”

Yet for now, she sees AI mostly supporting existing processes rather than transforming them, but the near-term gains are real. One member company reduced clinical study report drafting from approximately 180 hours to 80 hours using generative AI, she said. She also said some member companies report approximately 10% to 20% recruitment improvement from better patient matching.

But without shared frameworks, those wins stay siloed. “There’s no aligned regulatory guidance, and everyone is experimenting differently,” Chang said. TransCelerate is positioning itself as a neutral convener, bringing sponsors together for vendor-agnostic conversations with regulators. “One regulator told us this is a good space to ‘co-learn,’” she said. “I love that.”

Guerlain’s Spring 2026 Blooming Denim collection applies circular fashion sourcing to beauty packaging through a collaboration with LVMH’s Nona Source.

Guerlain’s Spring 2026 lineup places sustainability and material innovation at the forefront with the launch of Blooming Denim, a makeup collection developed in collaboration with circular design platform Nona Source. The partnership applies fashion-industry textile reuse to the packaging, marking one of Guerlain’s most visible experiments to date with circular sourcing at the product level.

At the core of the collaboration is Nona Source, a platform founded in 2021 to redistribute unused luxury fabrics, including deadstock and offcuts from couture and ready-to-wear production. Backed by LVMH, Nona Source was created to reduce textile waste by reconnecting dormant materials with designers and brands looking to integrate circular economy principles into new products. The fabrics are sourced from existing inventories rather than newly manufactured textiles, lowering material waste while preserving luxury-grade quality.

For Blooming Denim, Guerlain selected upcycled denim offcuts originally produced for luxury fashion houses and reworked them into decorative cases for several of its best-known makeup lines. The denim is transformed through dyeing, embossing, embroidery, and gold screen-printing, allowing the material to function both structurally and visually rather than as a surface-level sustainability gesture.

How Blooming Denim is applied across the collection

The most prominent application appears in Rouge G, Guerlain’s refillable lipstick line. Denim-wrapped cases are offered in three floral finishes — Cherry Blossom, Denim Flora, and Red Rose — each designed to reinforce collectability while maintaining the brand’s existing refill model. Six new lipstick shades accompany the cases, developed to align with the collection’s color palette rather than functioning as stand-alone launches.

Ombres G introduces an exclusive eyeshadow harmony that pairs metallic and matte textures inspired by denim hardware and floral tones, while Météorites Blooming Glow revisits the 02 Cool/Rosé shade with the addition of a denim-blue pearl. Both products are housed in denim-covered packaging using the same upcycled sourcing approach.

The collection also includes KissKiss Bee Glow Oil in two new floral shades, extending the Blooming Denim story across lip care while maintaining consistency with Guerlain’s existing formulations and packaging formats.

Guerlain launches rolling out in 2026

Beyond Blooming Denim, Guerlain’s broader 2026 portfolio spans skincare, fragrance, and lifestyle. Orchidée Impériale Gold Nobile Goldessence expands the ultra-premium skincare line with an activating lotion positioned as the first step in the routine. The formula was developed over three years and uses a two-phase system designed to improve skin texture and radiance.

In fragrance, La Petite Robe Noire Parfum introduces a more concentrated version of the existing franchise, formulated with French beetroot alcohol from responsible farming. The bottle incorporates recycled glass and a bio-based cap, continuing Guerlain’s material sustainability commitments within fragrance packaging.

Additional launches include L’Homme Idéal Cologne Forte, which uses alcohol derived from upcycled pea crop waste, and Absolus Allegoria Tabac Sahara, formulated with more than 90 percent naturally derived ingredients and packaged in recycled glass produced in France.

How L’Oréal Is Testing Sustainable Innovation at Scale

L’Oréal has revealed the first cohort for L’AcceleratOR, its €100 million sustainable innovation program, selecting 13 companies focused on packaging, ingredients, circular systems, and emissions data. The group was chosen from nearly 1,000 applicants and represents the first pilot phase of the five-year initiative, which is designed to identify, test, and potentially scale sustainability-focused technologies across the company’s global operations and the wider beauty industry. https://www.loreal.com/en/press-release/sustainable-development/-l-oreal-announces-the-first-13-change-makers-chosen-to-join-its-eur-100-million-sustainable-innovation-l-accelerator-program/ Launched in 2024, L’AcceleratOR was created to move beyond concept-stage innovation and toward commercial deployment, with a particular emphasis on solutions that can be piloted within existing industrial systems. The program is operated in partnership with the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, which is overseeing a structured support phase centered on pilot readiness and business integration. https://www.cisl.cam.ac.uk/ Rather than narrowing its scope to a single sustainability challenge, L’Oréal has positioned the accelerator around a broad set of operational priorities, including low-carbon materials and energy, nature-sourced ingredients, water resilience, the reduction of fossil-based plastics, circular manufacturing processes, and inclusive business models. The composition of the first cohort reflects that approach, with selected companies spanning physical materials, chemical inputs, waste transformation, and digital infrastructure. https://www.esgtoday.com/loreal-backs-13-climate-nature-and-circularity-solutions-startups/ Packaging, Materials, and the Push Away From Fossil Inputs Several of the selected companies focus on rethinking packaging formats that remain deeply embedded in beauty supply chains. United Kingdom-based Pulpex is developing recyclable paper bottles intended to replace rigid plastic packaging, while Japan’s Bioworks produces bioplastics derived from sugarcane and other plant-based feedstocks. Sweden’s Blue Ocean Closures and PULPAC are advancing fiber-based packaging systems designed to reduce both material complexity and carbon intensity, and Estonia’s RAIKU transforms natural wood into protective packaging alternatives traditionally made from petroleum-based foams. https://esgpost.com/loreal-selects-first-13-start-ups-for-laccelerator-sustainability-programme/ Ingredients and formulation inputs are also central to the cohort. France-based Biosynthis focuses on renewable and biodegradable raw materials, while U.S. company P2 Science applies green chemistry principles to develop bio-sourced fragrance and ingredient components. Another U.S. firm, Oberon Fuels, converts wood and pulp waste into renewable dimethyl ether suitable for aerosol formulations, addressing a category that has historically relied on fossil-derived propellants. https://esgpost.com/loreal-selects-first-13-start-ups-for-laccelerator-sustainability-programme/ Circular Systems and Measuring What Matters Circularity solutions appear throughout the cohort, including Belgium’s Novobiom, which uses fungi to break down complex waste streams into higher-value materials, and France’s REPLACE, which has developed a single-step process to convert multi-layer waste into new durable products. From Brazil, Gàs Verde contributes biomethane production technology aimed at reducing fossil fuel use in industrial energy and transport. https://esgpost.com/loreal-selects-first-13-start-ups-for-laccelerator-sustainability-programme/ The only data intelligence company selected, United Kingdom-based Neutreeno, focuses on supply-chain emissions measurement and reduction, reflecting the growing role of digital infrastructure in meeting climate targets and regulatory expectations. https://www.esgtoday.com/loreal-backs-13-climate-nature-and-circularity-solutions-startups/ The thirteen companies will now enter a CISL-led support phase focused on pilot readiness, with opportunities to run six- to nine-month pilots and, if successful, scale solutions across L’Oréal’s operations. Ezgi Barcenas, Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer at L’Oréal, described the approach as intentionally collaborative, saying, “To accelerate sustainable solutions to market, we are being even more intentional and inclusive in our pursuit of partnerships through L’AcceleratOR. We are really energized to be co-designing the future of beauty with CISL and these 13 change-makers.” https://www.esgtoday.com/loreal-backs-13-climate-nature-and-circularity-solutions-startups/ L’AcceleratOR sits within the company’s broader ten-year sustainability strategy, which includes goals to reach one hundred percent renewable energy, source at least ninety percent bio-based materials in formulas and packaging, reduce virgin plastic use by fifty percent, and significantly cut Scope One, Scope Two, and selected Scope Three emissions by 2030. https://www.loreal.com/en/commitments-and-responsibilities/

Parker-Hannifin Investment Narrative Recap

To own Parker-Hannifin, you need to be comfortable with an industrial business that blends cyclical exposure with disciplined execution and a long dividend track record. The latest strong quarter and raised guidance support the near term earnings catalyst, while the biggest risk, in my view, remains the company’s growing reliance on aerospace and the possibility that a slowdown there could offset otherwise solid performance.

Among recent developments, the raised fiscal 2026 guidance, calling for total sales growth of 4.0% to 7.0% and adjusted EPS of US$29.60 to US$30.40, feels most relevant. It reinforces why analysts have been lifting price targets and why many observers are focused on how much of this momentum is tied to aerospace strength and how resilient those earnings could be if industrial demand stays muted.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.

Illustrations

You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.

You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

David Guggina, who has been the chief e-commerce officer of Walmart U.S., has been promoted to CEO of the division — the company’s biggest and most important business.

John Furner, who has held that job for about six years, was named top boss of the company in conjunction with the retirement of outgoing CEO Doug McMillon.

Guggina joined Walmart from Amazon.com Inc. about eight years ago, quickly moving up through the ranks at the retail chain. He has led the online business in the U.S. since last January after running supply chain operations.

By broadening delivery areas and cutting shipping costs, the digital business has been fueling growth in the U.S. and is reaching profitability.

He is tasked with leading the unit that generates hundreds of billions of dollars in sales against the backdrop of discerning shoppers, weakening consumer sentiment and persistent woes about the job market.

Competition continues to be fierce in the U.S., with peers Costco Wholesale Corp., Target Corp. and Aldi Inc. investing to keep prices low and improve shopping experiences. Amazon has been increasingly encroaching on Walmart’s turf, signaling its intent to further expand its physical footprint and grocery offerings.

“A key part of maintaining our momentum is making sure we have the right structure to win,” Furner wrote in a memo to staff, adding that the company is making changes to increase efficiency and allow divisions to focus more on customers.

Walmart is entering a consequential period of change as McMillon retires at the end of the month. He is credited with transforming the company into a digital powerhouse from a brick-and-mortar retailer.

The Bentonville, Ark.-based company is now racing to get ahead of the artificial intelligence race, incorporating the technology across operations including shopping. Its market capitalization is inching toward $1 trillion — a first for a U.S. retailer — on the heels of strong growth and tech investments.

The company also named Latriece Watkins, chief merchant for Walmart U.S., as the CEO of Sam’s Club. The club chain is opening new stores and remodeling existing locations in the U.S., as it seeks to grow its membership and compete against bigger rival Costco.

Chris Nicholas, chief of Sam’s Club, will now serve as the boss of Walmart International. China, India and Mexico are among the markets driving growth for the international business. He is succeeding Kathryn McLay, who is leaving the company. She was once viewed as a potential successor to McMillon.

Elsewhere, Seth Dallaire has been promoted to chief growth officer for the company. He has led advertising, membership and other non-retail units at Walmart U.S. He will also help guide expansion strategies for Walmart’s marketplace business. Those businesses are helping fuel profit growth.

All changes are effective Feb. 1.

↑ X NOW PLAYING Why YouTube Is The 'Crown Jewel' In Google's Media Empire

Wall Street analysts have mixed views on the threat to Google from an OpenAI advertising push.

On the one hand, big brands and other advertisers could move a portion ad budgets that Google garners to a new option — ChatGPT. But for OpenAI, adding the digital infrastructure to sell advertising will be challenging. Also, OpenAI would not want to damage the ChatGPT user experience.

However, OpenAI is still unprofitable and needs revenue sources beyond subscriptions, analysts say.

""The question of when not if surrounding OpenAI's aspiration for ads persists,"" RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson said in a recent report. ""Given the rails of distribution necessary to run an effective ads product, we'd look at a scaled ramp of ads by OpenAI as unlikely to pose noticeable disruption risk to Google's search numbers for several years at least.""

Bank of America analyst Justin Post, though, does expect an eventual impact on Google's core business.

""According to press reports, OpenAI is targeting $200 billion revenue by 2030, which includes roughly $41 billion from new products, including advertising,"" Post said in a report.

""A key question for Alphabet sentiment in 2026 is whether ad budgets on OpenAI will represent incremental spend or will come at the expense of existing search budgets. We believe OpenAI ad growth will likely be a mix of both: New AI-native ad formats and better performance are improving advertiser outcomes and willingness to spend, effectively increasing the overall digital advertising addressable market. At the same time, as OpenAI captures a growing share of usage and intent, a portion of budgets is likely to shift from incumbent platforms.""

Google Stock: OpenAI Rivalry Grows

At Mizuho Securities, analyst Lloyd Walmsley downplayed the near-term threat to Google.

""OpenAI is signaling interest in monetizing ChatGPT through advertising, but our recent conversations with multiple ad experts indicate near-term prospects continue to appear to be slow-moving,"" Walmsley said in a report. ""We understand the company plans a fresh outreach with ad agencies and advertisers. Feedback suggests industry players are pressing for concrete plans rather than speculative concepts. One industry contact estimates that a scaled ad model is unlikely before 2027 to 2028, with any meaningful sales efforts requiring pilots by mid-2026 to capture second-half advertisers' budgets.""

The IBD Methodology: How To Invest In Stocks While Managing Risks

Meanwhile, Alphabet plans to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 4.

New search competition from OpenAI's ChatGPT, Perplexity and others has forced Google to overhaul its search results. ChatGPT delivers answers to search queries, while Google's business model has been based on providing weblinks.

Google began deploying AI Overviews in the U.S. in mid-2024, with conversational summaries topping links for many search queries. Google also has introduced ""AI-mode,"" as an option for traditional search users. AI mode is still in the early stages of monetizing via ads, a Deutsche Bank report said.

Meanwhile, OpenAI in October announced an artificial intelligence-powered web browser called ChatGPT Atlas. The Atlas browser features agents that complete tasks on the internet as well as an opt-in memory feature that improves search results.

Google Technical Ratings

On the stock market today, Google stock fell about 1% to 329.57. Google stock has climbed about 5% in 2026 after surging 65% last year.

In late 2025, Google introduced its newest artificial intelligence system: Gemini 3. Google improved the chatbot's ability to code, search and create images. Gemini 3 is battling against OpenAI's GPT-5 and Anthropic's Claude family in reasoning performance reviews.

Google stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A. That institutional ownership rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of a C grade as neutral.

Further, Google stock holds a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. IBD's Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.

Cencora ( (COR) ) just unveiled an update.

On January 12, 2026, Cencora, Inc. amended its existing revolving credit agreement, increasing total commitments by $1.0 billion to $5.5 billion, enhancing its overall liquidity profile. On the same date, the company secured a new senior unsecured multi-year term loan facility totaling $1.5 billion in two tranches and a separate $3.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured term loan facility, both primarily to finance its proposed acquisition of the remaining majority equity interests in OneOncology, refinance OneOncology’s existing debt and cover related fees and expenses, with the loans bearing interest at SOFR- or base-rate benchmarks plus ratings-based margins and subject to leverage and other customary covenants and events of default. Together, these new term facilities fully displaced the previously arranged $4.5 billion bridge financing commitment, reducing it to zero, and further embedded major relationship banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, Société Générale and MUFG in Cencora’s capital structure through roles as lenders, advisors, underwriters and securitization counterparties, underscoring the scale and importance of the OneOncology transaction for the company’s financing strategy and banking relationships.

The most recent analyst rating on (COR) stock is a Buy with a $415.00 price target. To see the full list of analyst forecasts on Cencora stock, see the COR Stock Forecast page.

Spark’s Take on COR Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, COR is a Neutral.

Cencora’s strong financial performance and positive earnings call sentiment are major strengths, driving the score. However, high leverage, potential overvaluation, and technical indicators suggesting bearish momentum are notable risks.

Hormel Foods Investment Narrative Recap

To own Hormel Foods, you need to believe in the resilience of its branded retail portfolio as it works through margin pressure from higher input costs and slower revenue growth. The appointment of Domenic Borrelli to lead the Retail unit does not immediately change the near term focus on rebuilding profitability or the key risk around persistent commodity inflation and the lag in passing through higher costs to consumers.

The most relevant recent development alongside Borrelli’s hire is Hormel’s 2026 guidance, which calls for US$12.2 billion to US$12.5 billion in net sales and US$0.96 billion to US$1.03 billion in operating income. Retail leadership execution will be central to how the company tracks against these targets, particularly as it balances pricing, mix and innovation against evolving consumer preferences for alternative and clean label proteins.

However, investors should also be aware of the risk that input cost volatility and slower pricing pass through could...

Hormel Foods’ narrative projects $13.0 billion revenue and $952.2 million earnings by 2028. This requires 2.5% yearly revenue growth and about a $197.7 million earnings increase from $754.5 million today.

, a 10% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Five members of the Simply Wall St Community see Hormel’s fair value between US$24.36 and US$47.20, underscoring how far opinions can spread. You should weigh these views against the risk that ongoing commodity cost volatility and slower retail pricing pass through continue to pressure margins and the company’s progress toward its 2026 earnings goals.

The net asset value (NAV) of a closed-end fund is the market value of the underlying investments (i.e., stocks and bonds) in the Fund’s portfolio, minus liabilities, divided by the total number of Fund shares outstanding. However, the Fund also has a market price; the value at which it trades on an exchange. If the market price is above the NAV the Fund is trading at a premium. If the market price is below the NAV the Fund is trading at a discount.

Performance returns for the Fund are total returns, which includes dividends, and are net of management fees and other Fund expenses. Returns are calculated assuming that a shareholder reinvested all distributions. Past performance cannot predict future investment results.

Performance will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown. Performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of taxes that shareholders would pay on Fund distributions or the sale of Fund shares. Shareholders must be willing to tolerate significant fluctuations in the value of their investment. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including loss of principal.

Sources of distributions to shareholders may include ordinary dividends, long-term capital gains and return of capital. The final determination of the source of all distributions in 2025 for tax reporting purposes will be made after year end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Based on current estimates a portion of the distributions consist of a return of capital. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year’s distributions) contained in shareholder 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year.",https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20260116202294/en/2694783/22/Business_Wire_Logo-_FINAL.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 18:03:49.934662

According to OpenAI’s blog post, the company plans to test ads “at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service.” Ads will be labeled and separated from the answer.
OpenAI is not the only AI company exploring advertising revenue.
Financial pressures and a changing tune OpenAI’s advertising experiment reflects the enormous financial pressures facing the company.
“As we introduce ads, it’s crucial we preserve what makes ChatGPT valuable in the first place,” Simo wrote.","On Friday, OpenAI announced it will begin testing advertisements inside the ChatGPT app for some US users in a bid to expand its customer base and diversify revenue. The move represents a reversal for CEO Sam Altman, who in 2024 described advertising in ChatGPT as a “last resort” and expressed concerns that ads could erode user trust, although he did not completely rule out the possibility at the time.

The banner ads will appear in the coming weeks for logged-in users of the free version of ChatGPT as well as the new $8 per month ChatGPT Go plan, which OpenAI also announced Friday is now available worldwide. OpenAI first launched ChatGPT Go in India in August 2025 and has since rolled it out to over 170 countries.

Users paying for the more expensive Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will not see advertisements.

According to OpenAI’s blog post, the company plans to test ads “at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service.” Ads will be labeled and separated from the answer.

In example screenshots shared by the company, the ads look like blocked off sections of the chat window with a small image and some advertising copy. Asking ChatGPT for places to visit in Mexico could result in holiday ads appearing, for instance.

“Our enterprise and subscription businesses are already strong,” Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, wrote in the blog post. “We believe in having a diverse revenue model where ads can play a part in making intelligence more accessible to everyone.”

OpenAI’s announcement follows the company’s April 2025 introduction of shopping features to ChatGPT Search. At that time, OpenAI’s Adam Fry told Wired that product recommendations were “not ads” and “not sponsored,” but it felt like a potential step in that direction at the time.

OpenAI is not the only AI company exploring advertising revenue. Google began testing AdSense ads in chatbot experiences through partnerships with AI startups in late 2024.

Financial pressures and a changing tune

OpenAI’s advertising experiment reflects the enormous financial pressures facing the company. OpenAI does not expect to be profitable until 2030 and has committed to spend about $1.4 trillion on massive data centers and chips for AI.

According to financial documents obtained by The Wall Street Journal in November, OpenAI expects to burn through roughly $9 billion this year while generating $13 billion in revenue. Only about 5 percent of ChatGPT’s 800 million weekly users pay for subscriptions, so it’s not enough to cover all of OpenAI’s operating costs.

Not everyone is convinced ads will solve OpenAI’s financial problems. “I am extremely bearish on this ads product,” tech critic Ed Zitron wrote on Bluesky. “Even if this becomes a good business line, OpenAI’s services cost too much for it to matter!”

OpenAI’s embrace of ads appears to come reluctantly, since it runs counter to a “personal bias” against advertising that Altman has shared in earlier public statements. For example, during a fireside chat at Harvard University in 2024, Altman said he found the combination of ads and AI “uniquely unsettling,” implying that he would not like it if the chatbot itself changed its responses due to advertising pressure. He added: “When I think of like GPT writing me a response, if I had to go figure out exactly how much was who paying here to influence what I’m being shown, I don’t think I would like that.”

Along those lines, OpenAI’s approach appears to be a compromise between needing ad revenue and not wanting sponsored content to appear directly within ChatGPT’s written responses. By placing banner ads at the bottom of answers separated from the conversation history, OpenAI appears to be addressing Altman’s concern: The AI assistant’s actual output, the company says, will remain uninfluenced by advertisers.

Indeed, Simo wrote in a blog post that OpenAI’s ads will not influence ChatGPT’s conversational responses and that the company will not share conversations with advertisers and will not show ads on sensitive topics such as mental health and politics to users it determines to be under 18.

“As we introduce ads, it’s crucial we preserve what makes ChatGPT valuable in the first place,” Simo wrote. “That means you need to trust that ChatGPT’s responses are driven by what’s objectively useful, never by advertising.”",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/openai_glowing_green-1152x648.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 20:01:21.386878

Amendment to Revolving Credit Facility

On January 12, 2026, Cencora, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an Incremental Facility and Amendment Agreement (the “Amendment”) to that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended by the Amendment, the “Revolving Credit Agreement”), dated as of June 4, 2025, among the Company, the borrowing subsidiaries party thereto, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent.

The Amendment increased the aggregate amount of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement by $1.0 billion to $5.5 billion.

The foregoing description of the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

Multi-Year Term Loan Facility

On January 12, 2026, the Company entered into a Term Credit Agreement (the “Term Credit Agreement”), among the Company, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, in connection with the previously announced proposed acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of the majority of the outstanding equity interests that the Company does not currently own in OneOncology. The Term Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured term loan facility of $1.5 billion consisting of two tranches: (a) $500 million (“Tranche One Loans”) and (b) $1.0 billion (“Tranche Two Loans” and together with Tranche One Loans, the “Term Loans”). Tranche One Loans mature two years from the date on which they are drawn. Tranche Two Loans mature three years from the date on which they are drawn. The Company will use the proceeds of the Term Loans to pay a portion of the consideration in respect of the Acquisition, to repay existing debt of OneOncology and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. The funding of the Term Loans is subject to customary conditions, including the consummation of the Acquisition.

The Term Loans will bear interest at a rate equal to either a Term SOFR rate or a Daily Simple SOFR rate (each as defined in the Term Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin, or an alternate base rate, plus an applicable margin, in each case based on the Company’s public debt ratings by S&P Global Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch, Inc. Such applicable margins range from 75 basis points to 125 basis points over both the Term SOFR rate and the Daily Simple SOFR rate and 0 basis points to 25 basis points over the alternate base rate, as determined in accordance with the provisions of the Term Credit Agreement. The Company has also agreed to pay a ticking fee that will, commencing on April 1, 2026, accrue at specified rates based on the Company’s public debt ratings, ranging from 5.5 basis points to 15 basis points on the daily amount of unused commitments under the Term Credit Agreement. The Company has the right to prepay the Term Loans at any time, in whole or in part and without premium or penalty (other than, if applicable, any breakage costs). The Company may also choose to reduce its commitments under the Term Credit Agreement at any time.

The covenants contained in the Term Credit Agreement are substantially similar to the covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Term Credit Agreement includes limitations on indebtedness of subsidiaries, liens, fundamental changes and asset sales and a covenant requiring compliance with a financial leverage ratio not to exceed 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter (which may be increased to 4.50 to 1.00 at the Company’s election as of the last day of any fiscal quarter during which the Company closes a material acquisition). The Term Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (which are in some cases subject to certain exceptions, thresholds and grace periods) including, but not limited to, nonpayment of principal and interest, failure to perform or observe covenants, breaches of representations and warranties and certain bankruptcy-related events.

The foregoing description of the Term Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Term Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

364-Day Term Credit Facility

On January 12, 2026, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “364-Day Term Credit Agreement”), among the Company, the lenders party thereto and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, in connection with the Acquisition.

The 364-Day Term Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured term loan facility of $3.0 billion (the “364-Day Term Loan”). The 364-Day Term Loan matures 364 days from the date on which it is drawn. The Company will use the proceeds of the 364-Day Term Loan to pay a portion of the consideration in respect of the Acquisition, to repay existing debt of OneOncology and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. The funding of the 364-Day Term Loan is subject to customary conditions, including the consummation of the Acquisition.

The 364-Day Term Loan will bear interest at a rate equal to either a Term SOFR rate or a Daily Simple SOFR rate, plus an applicable margin, or an alternate base rate, plus an applicable margin, in each case based on the Company’s public debt ratings by S&P Global Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch, Inc. Such applicable margins range from 87.5 basis points to 112.5 basis points over both the Term SOFR rate and the Daily Simple SOFR rate and 0 basis points to 12.5 basis points over the alternate base rate, as determined in accordance with the provisions of the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement. The Company has also agreed to pay a ticking fee that will, commencing on April 1, 2026, accrue at specified rates based on the Company’s public debt ratings, ranging from 6 basis points to 10 basis points on the daily amount of unused commitments under the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement. The Company has the right to prepay the 364-Day Term Loan at any time, in whole or in part and without premium or penalty (other than, if applicable, any breakage costs). The Company may also choose to reduce its commitments under the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement at any time.

The covenants contained in the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement are substantially similar to the covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Agreement. The 364-Day Term Credit Agreement includes limitations on indebtedness of subsidiaries, liens, fundamental changes and asset sales and a covenant requiring compliance with a financial leverage ratio not to exceed 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter (which may be increased to 4.50 to 1.00 at the Company’s election as of the last day of any fiscal quarter during which the Company closes a material acquisition). The 364-Day Term Credit Agreement contains certain representations, warranties and events of default (which are, in some cases, subject to certain exceptions, thresholds and grace periods) including, but not limited to, non-payment of principal and interest, failure to perform or observe covenants, breaches of representations and warranties and certain bankruptcy-related events.

The foregoing description of the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

Termination of Bridge Financing Commitment

As previously disclosed, in connection with the Acquisition, the Company obtained $4.5 billion in bridge financing commitments to fund the Acquisition. As a result of entering into the Term Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement, such bridge financing commitments have been automatically reduced by $4.5 billion, which is the amount of the commitments under the Term Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement, to zero.

Other Relationships

Certain of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement, and their affiliates, have various relationships with the Company and are providing in connection with the Acquisition, have in the past provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, commercial banking, derivative transactions and financial advisory services to the Company and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they will receive, have received and may continue to receive fees and commissions. In particular, in connection with the Acquisition, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., an affiliate of Citibank, N.A., is serving as lead financial advisor to the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, an affiliate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., is serving as financial advisor to the Company. In addition, BofA Securities, Inc., an affiliate of Bank of America, N.A., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., an affiliate of Citibank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, an affiliate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, an affiliate of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., an affiliate of BNP Paribas, and Société Générale Corporate & Investment Banking, an affiliate of Société Générale have served as joint book-running managers, and certain affiliates of the other lenders have served as underwriters, in connection with past senior note offerings by the Company, and such affiliates may serve similar roles in future securities offerings by the Company. In addition, certain of the lenders serve various roles in connection with a $1.5 billion receivables securitization facility to which the Company’s subsidiaries, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, ASD Specialty Healthcare, LLC, and Amerisource Receivables Financial Corporation (“ARFC”), are a party and pursuant to which accounts receivables are sold on a revolving basis to ARFC, a special purpose entity. MUFG Bank, Ltd. serves as administrator and a purchaser under the program. Certain of the other lenders or their affiliates also serve as lenders or purchasers under this securitization facility.

However, a new breed of biotech companies are leveraging AI and advanced data technologies in an attempt to accelerate and streamline the process.
Chai Discovery, an AI startup founded in 2024, is one such company.
Last Friday, Chai also announced a partnership with Eli Lilly, a deal in which the pharmaceutical giant will use the startup’s software to help develop new medicines.
The startup’s deal was announced shortly before Eli Lilly said it would also collaborate with Nvidia on a $1 billion partnership to create an AI drug discovery lab in San Francisco.","Drug discovery, the art of identifying new molecules to develop pharmaceuticals, is a notoriously time-consuming and difficult process. Traditional techniques, like high-throughput screening, offer an expensive scattershot approach — one that is not often successful. However, a new breed of biotech companies are leveraging AI and advanced data technologies in an attempt to accelerate and streamline the process.

Chai Discovery, an AI startup founded in 2024, is one such company. In a little over 12 months, its young co-founders have managed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars and rally the backing of some of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, making it one of the flashiest firms in a growing industry. In December, the company completed its Series B, bringing in an additional $130 million and a valuation of $1.3 billion.

Last Friday, Chai also announced a partnership with Eli Lilly, a deal in which the pharmaceutical giant will use the startup’s software to help develop new medicines. Chai’s algorithm, called Chai-2, is designed to develop antibodies — the proteins necessary to fight illnesses. The startup has said it hopes to serve as a kind of “computer-aided design suite” for molecules.

It’s a critical moment for Chai’s particular field. The startup’s deal was announced shortly before Eli Lilly said it would also collaborate with Nvidia on a $1 billion partnership to create an AI drug discovery lab in San Francisco. This “co-innovation lab,” as it’s being called, will combine big data, compute resources, and scientific expertise, all in an attempt to accelerate the speed of new medicine development.

The industry isn’t without its detractors. Some industry veterans seem to feel that — given how difficult traditional drug development is — these new technologies are unlikely to have a major impact. However, for every naysayer, there seem to be just as many believers.

Elena Viboch, managing director at General Catalyst — one of Chai’s major backers — told TechCrunch that her firm is confident that companies that adopt the startup’s services will see results. “We believe the biopharma companies that move the most quickly to partner with companies like Chai will be the first to get molecules into the clinic, and will make medicines that matter,” Viboch said. “In practice that means partnering in 2026 and by the end of 2027 seeing first-in-class medicines enter into clinical trials.”

Aliza Apple, the head of Lilly’s TuneLab program — which uses AI and machine learning to advance drug discovery — also expressed confidence in Chai’s product. “By combining Chai’s generative design models with Lilly’s deep biologics expertise and proprietary data, we intend to push the frontier of how AI can design better molecules from the outset, with the ultimate goal to help accelerate the development of innovative medicines for patients,” she said.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cvZZmc1_FvJIHDtJ2Ykkaw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_finance_785/3f5e08d2ec791ff8f8eebc2cd6aed023,N,,2026-01-16 17:06:00.570352
ID22,Instacart,2026-01-16 20:57:06+00:00,The Motley Fool,"Costco Really Wants Its Gold Star Members to Upgrade to Executive Status, and ... - The Motley Fool","Sean Williams, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/16/costco-gold-star-members-upgrade-executive-3-perks/,"Members pay $65 (Gold Star and Business) or $130 (Executive) annually for the right to shop in its stores.
However, the company is making a strong push, fueled by three new or adjusted perks, to entice tens of millions of U.S.-based Gold Star members to upgrade to Executive status.
A second dangling carrot was added for Costco's Executive members on June 30, 2025.
Although Costco aims to provide value to all 81.4 million of its members worldwide, encouraging domestic Gold Star member upgrades is vital to its long-term success.
Keeping Executive members happy and ensuring that renewal rates remain in the low-to-mid 90% range in the U.S. and Canada is paramount to the company's success.","For the last three years, the talk on Wall Street has centered on the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential to positively impact corporate growth and the lives of billions worldwide. But based on addressable opportunity, the global retail industry dwarfs the AI market.

According to a report from Mordor Intelligence, the worldwide retail industry is expected to expand from a $27.3 trillion market in 2025 to an estimated $36.9 trillion opportunity by 2030. For those keeping score at home, this translates to a compound annual growth rate that exceeds 6%.

Although the retail industry is highly competitive, businesses that are able to stand out can reap significant rewards. Examples of leading retailers include e-commerce titan Amazon (AMZN +0.40%), retail kingpin Walmart (WMT +0.42%), and warehouse club Costco Wholesale (COST +0.72%).

Arguably, no retailer has had a more unique path to success than Costco, whose membership-based operating model fuels its growth.

Differentiation has been central to Costco's long-term success

Based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were more than 1 million private retail establishments in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2024. While Costco isn't competing with all 1 million-plus businesses, it's constantly battling to stay relevant and attract shoppers to its stores. Some of the strategies it relies on are straightforward, while others are truly unique.

For example, Costco uses its size to its advantage. Similar to Amazon and Walmart, it purchases products in bulk, which lowers the per-unit cost of each item. These cost savings can be passed along to its shoppers, thereby allowing it to undercut local stores and national grocery chains on price. Few retailers can match the value proposition that Costco brings to the table for its members.

To build on this point, Costco offers a wide range of basic necessities, including groceries and toiletries, as well as a broad assortment of discretionary goods. These necessities ensure shoppers will come to its stores in any economic climate. While the margins tend to be razor-thin on groceries, it takes just one or more discretionary item purchases for a shopper's trip to be highly profitable.

Costco also enhances the lure of its warehouses by carrying rare or one-off items, such as luxury jewelry and gold bars/ingots.

But the most significant differentiating factor for Costco Wholesale is its memberships. Members pay $65 (Gold Star and Business) or $130 (Executive) annually for the right to shop in its stores. It's only natural for these individuals to want to get the most out of their membership fee. This makes Costco a prime destination for large shopping trips and works toward keeping consumers within its ecosystem.

Costco is introducing and updating perks to encourage Executive-level upgrades

As of the end of its fiscal first quarter for 2026 (Nov. 23, 2025), Costco had 81.4 million paying members worldwide, 39.7 million of which were Executive cardholders. However, the company is making a strong push, fueled by three new or adjusted perks, to entice tens of millions of U.S.-based Gold Star members to upgrade to Executive status.

For instance, when the company enacted its first membership fee increase since 2017 on Sept. 1, 2024, it also lifted the maximum annual 2% cash back reward from $1,000 to $1,250 for its Executive members. While purchases of gas, tobacco, alcohol (in most states), Costco gift cards, and membership fees don't count toward this 2% cash back reward, most in-store and online purchases will.

A second dangling carrot was added for Costco's Executive members on June 30, 2025. Beginning at the midpoint of last year, the company's highest-tier cardholders would receive a $10 monthly Instacart credit for same-day online delivery orders above $150 in the U.S. and Canada. Management fully understands the convenience that online shopping offers -- and 20.5% digitally enabled comparable sales growth in the fiscal first quarter suggests this perk is hitting home.

The third and easily most polarizing perk that Costco Wholesale bestowed on its Executive cardholders is special shopping hours. Beginning Sept. 2, 2025, Executive members can shop in Costco's stores exclusively from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. on weekdays and Sundays, and from 9 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. on Saturdays. CEO Ron Vachris has noted in quarterly conference calls since implementing these new shopping hours for its top-tier members that it's had a positive impact on sales.

Although Costco aims to provide value to all 81.4 million of its members worldwide, encouraging domestic Gold Star member upgrades is vital to its long-term success. Membership fees account for the lion's share of Costco's profits and provide the necessary margin buffer to undercut other retailers on price.

Even though Executive cardholders account for less than 49% of paying members, their purchases totaled 74.3% of net sales for Costco during the fiscal first quarter of 2026. Keeping Executive members happy and ensuring that renewal rates remain in the low-to-mid 90% range in the U.S. and Canada is paramount to the company's success.

With Costco aggressively targeting membership upgrades, expect new perks to be added or adjusted in the new year (and beyond).",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F851245%2Fcostco-wholesale-warehouse-groceries-staples-discretionary-retail-gdp-inflation.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-16 17:05:49.971029

BNY has engineered Eliza to be model-agnostic, allowing agents to switch between different high-performance models based on the specific task.
Initial reactions from the AI research community have been overwhelmingly positive, particularly regarding BNY’s commitment to ""Explainable AI"" (XAI).
The New Standard for Institutional Finance The deployment of 20,000 AI agents at BNY marks the definitive end of the ""experimentation phase"" for generative AI in the financial sector.
The key takeaways are clear: agentic AI is no longer a futuristic concept; it is an active, revenue-impacting reality.","In a move that signals a tectonic shift in the digital transformation of global finance, BNY (NYSE: BNY), formerly known as BNY Mellon, has officially reached a massive milestone in its AI strategy. As of January 16, 2026, the world’s largest custody bank has successfully deployed tens of thousands of ""Agentic Assistants"" across its global operations. This deployment represents one of the first successful transitions from experimental generative AI to a full-scale ""agentic"" operating model, where AI systems perform complex, autonomous tasks rather than just responding to prompts.

The bank’s initiative, built upon its proprietary Eliza platform, has divided its AI workforce into two distinct categories: over 20,000 ""Empowered Builders""—human employees trained to create custom agents—and a growing fleet of over 130 specialized ""Digital Employees."" These digital entities possess their own system credentials, email accounts, and communication access, effectively operating as autonomous members of the bank’s workforce. This development is being hailed as the ""operating system of the bank,"" fundamentally altering how BNY handles trillions of dollars in assets daily.

Technical Deep Dive: From Chatbots to Digital Employees

The technical backbone of this initiative is the Eliza 2.0 platform, a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration layer that represents a departure from the simple Large Language Model (LLM) interfaces of 2023 and 2024. Unlike previous iterations that focused on text generation, Eliza 2.0 is centered on ""reasoning"" and ""agency."" These agents are not just processing data; they are executing workflows that involve multiple steps, such as cross-referencing internal databases, validating external regulatory updates, and communicating findings via Microsoft Teams to their human managers.

A critical component of this deployment is the ""menu of models"" approach. BNY has engineered Eliza to be model-agnostic, allowing agents to switch between different high-performance models based on the specific task. For instance, agents might use GPT-4 from OpenAI for complex logical reasoning, Google Cloud’s Gemini Enterprise for multimodal deep research, and specialized Llama-based models for internal code remediation. This architecture ensures that the bank is not locked into a single provider while maximizing the unique strengths of each AI ecosystem.

Initial reactions from the AI research community have been overwhelmingly positive, particularly regarding BNY’s commitment to ""Explainable AI"" (XAI). Every agentic model must pass a rigorous ""Model-Risk Review"" before deployment, generating detailed ""model cards"" and feature importance charts that allow auditors to understand the ""why"" behind an agent's decision. This level of transparency addresses a major hurdle in the adoption of AI within highly regulated environments, where ""black-box"" decision-making is often a non-starter for compliance officers.

The Multi-Vendor Powerhouse: Big Tech's Role in the Agentic Shift

The scale of BNY's deployment has created a lucrative blueprint for major technology providers. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) played a foundational role by supplying the hardware infrastructure; BNY was the first major bank to deploy an Nvidia DGX SuperPOD with H100 systems, providing the localized compute power necessary to train and run these agents securely on-premises. This partnership has solidified Nvidia’s position not just as a chipmaker, but as a critical infrastructure partner for ""Sovereign AI"" within the private sector.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are also deeply integrated into the Eliza ecosystem. Microsoft Azure hosts much of the Eliza infrastructure, providing the integration layer for agents to interact with the Microsoft 365 suite, including Outlook and Teams. Meanwhile, Google Cloud’s Gemini Enterprise is being utilized for ""agentic deep research,"" synthesizing vast datasets to provide predictive analytics on trade settlements. This competitive landscape shows that while tech giants are vying for dominance, the ""agentic era"" is fostering a multi-provider reality where enterprise clients demand interoperability and the ability to leverage the best-of-breed models from various labs.

For AI startups, BNY’s move is both a challenge and an opportunity. While the bank has the resources to build its own orchestration layer, the demand for specialized, niche agents—such as those focused on specific international tax laws or ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) compliance—is expected to create a secondary market for smaller AI firms that can plug into platforms like Eliza. The success of BNY’s internal ""Empowered Builders"" program suggests that the future of enterprise AI may lie in tools that allow non-technical staff to build and maintain their own agents, rather than relying on off-the-shelf software.

Reshaping the Global Finance Landscape

The broader significance of BNY’s move cannot be overstated. By empowering 40% of its global workforce to build and use AI agents, the bank has effectively democratized AI in a way that parallels the introduction of the personal computer or the spreadsheet. This is a far cry from the pilot projects of 2024; it is a full-scale industrialization of AI. BNY has reported a roughly 5% reduction in unit costs for core custody trades, a significant margin in the high-volume, low-margin world of asset servicing.

Beyond cost savings, the deployment addresses the increasing complexity of regulatory compliance. BNY’s ""Contract Review Assistant"" agents can now benchmark thousands of negotiated agreements against global regulations in a fraction of the time it would take human legal teams. This ""always-on"" compliance capability mitigates risk and allows the bank to adapt to shifting geopolitical and regulatory landscapes with unprecedented speed.

Comparisons are already being drawn to previous technological milestones, such as the transition to electronic trading in the 1990s. However, the agentic shift is potentially more disruptive because it targets the ""cognitive labor"" of the middle and back office. While earlier waves of automation replaced manual data entry, these agents are performing tasks that previously required human judgment and cross-departmental coordination. The potential concern remains the ""human-in-the-loop"" requirement; as agents become more autonomous, the pressure on human managers to supervise dozens of digital employees will require new management frameworks and training.

The Next Frontier: Proactive Agents and Automated Remediation

Looking toward the remainder of 2026 and into 2027, the bank is expected to expand the capabilities of its agents from reactive to proactive. Near-term developments include ""Predictive Trade Analytics,"" where agents will not only identify settlement risks but also autonomously initiate remediation protocols to prevent trade failures before they occur. This move from ""detect and report"" to ""anticipate and act"" will be the true test of agentic autonomy in finance.

One of the most anticipated applications on the horizon is the integration of these agents into client-facing roles. While currently focused on internal operations, BNY is reportedly exploring ""Client Co-pilots"" that would give the bank’s institutional clients direct access to agentic research and analysis tools. However, this will require addressing significant challenges regarding data privacy and ""multi-tenant"" agent security to ensure that agents do not inadvertently share proprietary insights across different client accounts.

Experts predict that other ""Global Systemically Important Banks"" (G-SIBs) will be forced to follow suit or risk falling behind in operational efficiency. We are likely to see a ""space race"" for AI talent and compute resources, as institutions realize that the ""Agentic Assistant"" model is the only way to manage the exponential growth of financial data and regulatory requirements in the late 2020s.

The New Standard for Institutional Finance

The deployment of 20,000 AI agents at BNY marks the definitive end of the ""experimentation phase"" for generative AI in the financial sector. The key takeaways are clear: agentic AI is no longer a futuristic concept; it is an active, revenue-impacting reality. BNY’s success with the Eliza platform demonstrates that with the right governance, infrastructure, and multi-vendor strategy, even the most traditional financial institutions can reinvent themselves for the AI era.

This development will likely be remembered as a turning point in AI history—the moment when ""agents"" moved from tech demos to the front lines of global capitalism. In the coming weeks and months, the industry will be watching closely for BNY’s quarterly earnings to see how these efficiencies translate into bottom-line growth. Furthermore, the response from regulators like the Federal Reserve and the SEC will be crucial in determining how fast other institutions are allowed to adopt similar autonomous systems.

As we move further into 2026, the question is no longer whether AI will change finance, but which institutions will have the infrastructure and the vision to lead the agentic revolution. BNY has made its move, setting a high bar for the rest of the industry to follow.

The higher dose requires three separate injections and is restricted to adult patients with obesity. Eli Lilly shares dipped 0.3%.

Market Dynamics Shift

The approval comes as Novo encounters increasing pressure from Lilly’s Zepbound, which has achieved considerable market share despite Novo’s early-mover position with semaglutide-based treatments. Ozempic received FDA approval for Type 2 diabetes in 2017, with Wegovy following for chronic weight management in 2021.

Novo’s counterstrategy centers on product diversification. The company launched an oral Wegovy formulation in the U.S. on January 5, with a U.K. regulatory decision anticipated by year-end.

Revenue Projections

Speaking at this week’s J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, Novo CEO Mike Doustdar pointed out the oral medication’s strategic importance. “Right now, we are being judged by how many patients are being switched between Eli Lilly and us,” Doustdar said. “A big part of those people don’t want an injection. They’re waiting for the pill.”

Berenberg analysts project the oral version could generate approximately $1 billion in 2025 revenue, possibly counterbalancing headwinds from U.S. pricing pressures and patent expirations. The bank’s base-case scenario forecasts $2 billion by 2027, with upside potential to $6 billion if Novo leverages its first-mover advantage.

Competitive Landscape

Lilly is developing orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 competitor expected to launch this year following last month’s FDA application submission. December data showed orforglipron enables patients to maintain weight loss after transitioning from injectable treatments, including Wegovy and Zepbound, with participants switching directly from maximum tolerated injectable doses to oral formulations.

For non-Asian medical device manufacturers trying to expand into Asian markets, having the right mindset from the beginning helps, Khong told MD+DI.
In essence, the approach ensures that device manufacturers rely on the local supply chain, local components, local packaging — everything local, Khong said.
Rewards to reap Medical device companies will likely face many challenges initially when they start their journeys to access Asian markets.
In the medical device manufacturing category, Japan was the largest and India the fastest-growing market in 2024.","Medical device manufacturers can’t afford not to consider entering potentially lucrative Asian markets. Reported to be about $31.77 billion in 2024, the Asia Pacific medical device contract manufacturing market is expected to reach $100.90 billion by 2033, according to a report by Grand View Research.

Medical device manufacturers based in the United States and Europe, however, find that the road to market approval in Asian countries is complicated, differs by country, and requires local alliances or partnerships.

Right mindset for starters

Asia should not be treated as a single, homogeneous market. Rather, Asia is made up of several distinct regions with different regulatory maturity, market behavior, and go-to-market requirements, according to Meng Khong, U.S. CEO of SotaTek, a health-technology development firm that helps bridge gaps for medical device and other industry players’ access in and out of Asia and Singapore.

For non-Asian medical device manufacturers trying to expand into Asian markets, having the right mindset from the beginning helps, Khong told MD+DI. For example, don’t think that having FDA clearance or European Union market approval is an in. It’s not. And don’t think that once you’re in a part of Asia, your product will have easy access to all Asian markets. It won’t.

“Because of these differences, companies that succeed in Asia typically design or redesign their products with specific regional and local contexts in mind, rather than assuming a single FDA-cleared or globally approved product can be lightly localized and deployed across all Asian markets,” he said.

Eyes wide open

Understanding local market requirements and policies and having strategies in place are key, he said.

“When you go into a local market, you need to test according to the local environment and user scenarios. Not all the Asian markets have good Wi-Fi, for example. And all have different data regulatory requirements. For example, Indonesia and China cannot allow patients’ data to go out of the country,” he said.

As Asia’s number one manufacturing destination, China is a worthy market, with a huge population and an insatiable hunger for medical device technology — notably wearables. China’s regulatory requirements, however, make for “an extensive and painful experience,” which often means designing and manufacturing a device from the ground up, according to Khong.

Companies like San Diego, CA-based Illumina opted instead to establish a hub in Singapore, paving the way to an easier entry into the Chinese market. Singapore, South Korea, and Japan are stable, predictable, more open markets. Companies like to establish regional hubs in those countries because there are few surprises. Regulatory requirements are pretty predictable, according to Khong.

Right now, probably 60% of medical device company regional hubs are being set up in Singapore, Khong said. Medtronic, GE HealthCare, and Siemens Healthineers have hubs there.

China’s rules, on the other hand, favor a made-in-China strategy. Khong said there are several terms used to refer to the strategy, including China Localization 2.0 (supply chain and technology localization) and “Made in China 2025” (industrial localization), among others. In essence, the approach ensures that device manufacturers rely on the local supply chain, local components, local packaging — everything local, Khong said.

According to an October 13, 2025, China Briefing, “China’s new government procurement policy introduces a 20 percent price evaluation advantage for qualifying domestic products and sets clearer standards for what counts as ‘Made in China.’ This poses real challenges for foreign businesses — especially those with offshore production — but also creates a more transparent and fairer competitive environment. To stay competitive, companies should proactively localize production, strengthen compliance systems, and align with evolving standards to seize new opportunities in China’s vast public procurement market.”

Potentially good news is China also has the China Plus One, or C+1, policy, which encourages investment (manufacturing and supply chain operations) not only in China but also in other Asian countries, according to Source of Asia.

This is to avoid overreliance on a single source country, and can help U.S. and European medical device manufacturers who have established hubs in these partnering countries to help gain access to the China market.

Countries like Malaysia, Thailand, India, and Vietnam are among the countries actively positioning themselves for China Plus One. Malaysia is a long-established medical device manufacturing hub, according to Khong.

More encouraging news: once medical device manufacturers from abroad get over the initial regulatory hurdles, testing their devices on humans may not be as big a deal as in the United States.

For example, China is big in wearable devices and has many more brands than the United States, according to Khong.

“The U.S. is much more regulated, and devices have to go through a longer experimental cycle before being launched in the market. In Asia, the common practice is that they do have regulations, but they tend to have devices partner very closely with the regulatory body and the healthcare system, so they test out the systems much earlier in [real-world] cases. Asia has a big population base, both for validating devices and having digital innovation. It makes it much more feasible to enforce that kind of clinical trial in real time,” he said. “That makes wearable devices very affordable and very easy for us to try and obtain.”

Khong’s breakdown of Asian markets

Khong offered these summaries to help device manufacturers think about the Asian markets.

Rewards to reap

Medical device companies will likely face many challenges initially when they start their journeys to access Asian markets. But those that survive will reap the long-term financial benefits.

“Asia already occupies 60% of the global population,” Khong said.

In the medical device manufacturing category, Japan was the largest and India the fastest-growing market in 2024. On the basis of the therapeutic area segment, the cardiovascular devices segment held the largest therapeutic market share in 2024, while Asia’s surgical instrument segment is expected to grow the fastest during the forecast period, according to Grand View Research.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt14ac89070d5e4751/blt4101363f07713089/696a93afffd73f719f9c9749/Untitled_design_-_2026-01-16T133623.946.png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-16 17:05:13.261179

New Year’s resolutions, made in good faith, are beginning to wobble, and new gym memberships are already collecting dust. But behind a familiar start to 2026 lies a very different story about how a record-breaking 2025 ended.

New data from Adobe Digital Insights, powered by Adobe Analytics, shows that, during November and December 2025, UK shoppers splashed a record £26.9 billion online (up 4.1% from 2024), signalling the highest online spending Christmas period on record.

Across 2025, online spend reached £118.5 billion, up 2.8% on 2024 – another record-breaker. That annual growth may look modest at first glance, but it masks a strong finish.

The impressive performance over the festive period was driven by sharper discounts, budget-busting spending on key days, and a noticeable shift in how people researched and bought products.

GenAI is now part of the shopping routine

One of the clearest signals from this year’s data is how rapidly GenAI is moving from novelty to habit.

Traffic to retail sites from AI sources grew 329% year-over-year during the holiday period, with AI-driven referrals on Boxing Day up 685% on 2024 figures. While the overall numbers are still relatively small, the direction of travel is pretty conclusive: More shoppers are using GenAI tools to research products, compare options, and hunt for deals before they ever land on a retail site.

What matters more than where AI shows up is how it’s being used. Shoppers are increasingly trusting these tools to help them make informed purchases, using them to compare options, weigh up value, and make confident decisions before they buy.

As more AI services add shopping features and integrations, this behaviour is only going to accelerate in 2026. For retailers, that means visibility within these tools is becoming just as important as visibility in search or social feeds.

Mobile experience still makes or breaks conversion

Clearly, GenAI is setting the benchmark for how quickly online shoppers expect to move. By the time a shopper clicks through to a retail site from tools like ChatGPT or Gemini, they’re often already in ‘buy mode’. They’ve done their research, and the retailer’s site is purely for the purchase. Barriers to making the purchase, like long registration journeys or extra steps before reaching the checkout can quickly kill this positive momentum and see the sale head somewhere else.

Our research shows many of these journeys are now happening on mobile. During the holiday period, £16.5 billion was spent on mobile devices, rising 14.1% from 2024 and accounting for 61.5% of total online spend. While online spending on mobile devices has outstripped desktop or laptop spending in the UK for several years, the rise of GenAI search means the context has changed. Mobile experiences now need to match the speed and simplicity of the discovery tools (increasingly GenAI) that lead shoppers there in the first place.

Big sales days inspire shopper confidence

Black Friday once again stood out as the single biggest online shopping day of the year, with £1.16 billion spent. Cyber Weekend delivered £3.8 billion, and Boxing Day passed £500 million as shoppers shifted from buying gifts for others to searching for gifts for themselves.

What makes these ‘eventised’ shopping moments most interesting is the behaviour behind them. Across the year, consumers are highly price driven, often trading down and searching for the cheapest option. During the holiday period, and especially on major sales days, that mindset shifts.

Our data shows that when the price is right, shoppers are happy to trade-up to more premium items. The deeper discounts on offer over the holiday period and the increased sense of urgency over Cyber Weekend, prompted shoppers to go for the best they could afford rather than the cheapest they could find. Across November and December Adobe Analytics data shows the share of the most expensive items sold across different categories was 14% higher compared with the rest of 2025.

Where UK retailers stand heading into 2026

The UK retail picture at the end of 2025 is one of deliberate, informed shoppers who are ready to spend (and in some cases, spend big), but only when the conditions, value and experience feels right. Retailers that understand those moments and meet those expectations will be set up for success in 2026.

It stocked up on naloxone (Narcan), a drug that reverses an opioid-related overdose, said former Plumas County Public Health Agency Director Andrew Woodruff.
The opioid epidemic of today is “silently killing people.” Gary Sanderson, Plumas County alcohol and drug administrator Sanderson said the opioid epidemic of today is “silently killing people.” As these new challenges arose, Reinert said county health officials began implementing programs for medication-assisted treatment, syringe exchange and substance-use disorder counseling.
“It’s kind of a blessing in disguise.” Nicole Reinert, Plumas County Public Health Agency director “It’s kind of a blessing in disguise,” Reinert said.
Blust explained that Westwood is included in the Plumas County data despite being part of Lassen, not Plumas County.","Fifteen years ago, Plumas County had one of California’s highest rates of opioid prescriptions, as well as one of the highest overdose death rates. By 2016, prescriptions were down and the death rate followed. That year zero opioid-related deaths were reported.

This positive statistical trend, however, masks an uncomfortable local reality: Since 2016, Plumas County’s opioid epidemic has shifted from legal prescriptions to underground sources, and the death rate has begun to rise. That is driving public health officials to adjust their approach.

Responding to the spotlight

The community of just under 20,000 residents came under an opioid epidemic spotlight after data compiled from the California Department of Public Health, from 2009 to 2013, found that Plumas County had the highest death rate of deaths from prescribed opioids in the state. The worst year was 2010 with a rate of 40.16 per 100,000 residents, according to the California Overdose Surveillance Dashboard.

The Plumas County Public Health Agency immediately went to work. It launched a campaign to add education around opioids in schools and in the community. It stocked up on naloxone (Narcan), a drug that reverses an opioid-related overdose, said former Plumas County Public Health Agency Director Andrew Woodruff.

In 2015, the county had strengthened its efforts to combat the local epidemic through collaboration with Modoc, Lassen and Sierra counties. They formed the Northern Sierra Opioid Coalition in January 2016. The coalition implemented a series of programs, said Woodruff. Among them were educating the community and prescribers about opioids, and handing out more free naloxone.

Pharmacies and hospitals got on board, working together to implement a prescription drug monitoring program, said Plumas County Public Health Agency Director Nicole Reinert. They created a database so the various pharmacies and hospitals can monitor prescriptions to avoid misuse.

The impacts were almost immediate: In 2016 zero deaths related to opioids were reported; only one death was reported the following year.

Going underground

Then something shifted. While opioid prescriptions continue to fall, deaths began to rise. From 2017-2021, death rates bounced between one and two annually. In both 2022 and 2023 three deaths were reported. In 2024 there were four. Public health officials attribute this in part to the way the epidemic has changed as prescriptions dropped.

“It started from overprescribing,” said Reinert. When intervention programs reduced that availability, people turned to illicit street drugs. They had no legal source to feed their addiction, she said, “and now we’re seeing fentanyl.”

While fentanyl is new to the area, methamphetamine has been prevalent for decades. As prescriptions for opioids have fallen, these two drugs are showing up together, said Gary Sanderson, Plumas County’s alcohol and drug administrator.

“A lot of the methamphetamine is causing people to test positive for fentanyl as well,” he said. Non-prescription methamphetamine is increasingly laced with fentanyl. “With more fentanyl in the meth, there is a higher risk to the community for overdose deaths,” Sanderson added.

Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, has a very high potency that can be fatal even in low amounts. Sanderson said he doesn’t believe that people go straight to heroin or meth. “Typically individuals might go to the black market, through friends or connections, to find the same prescriptions they were being given before,” he said.

Some people have told him the drugs they bought through the black market weren’t the same as the ones being prescribed, potentially leading to addiction to other substances, Sanderson said.

The opioid epidemic of today is “silently killing people.”

Sanderson said the opioid epidemic of today is “silently killing people.”

As these new challenges arose, Reinert said county health officials began implementing programs for medication-assisted treatment, syringe exchange and substance-use disorder counseling. But funding and resources posed a challenge as they worked to expand access and care.

$6.9 million opioid settlement

In 2018, Plumas joined other counties and cities across California to sue pharmaceutical companies and drugstores who were “accused of misleading marketing practices,” Reinert said. Among them were Johnson and Johnson, Teva, Allergen, Wallgreens, Wallmart, CVS and Kroger, Reinert said.

They won. The financial award from these lawsuits, which is dispersed in annual allotments, can only be spent on mitigating the opioid epidemic. The first of the funds came in late 2022. The county expects to receive a total of $6.9 million over an 18-year span, Reinert said.

But the funds, overseen by the county administration officer, sat untouched from 2022 until Reinert’s appointment in April 2024. The public health agency had no permanent director during that period, part of a spate of department head vacancies that peaked at 19 of 26 positions between 2020 and 2022. Six department heads submitted their resignations between June and September 2023.

The initial installment of settlement funds built interest over the two years, reaching $2 million by the time Reinert assumed her role as director. She immediately requested oversight of the fund.

“It’s kind of a blessing in disguise.”

Nicole Reinert, Plumas County Public Health Agency director

“It’s kind of a blessing in disguise,” Reinert said. “We’re now able to work systematically in the county to distribute it with this large amount.”

Reinert and her team gathered data and reached out to partners for the best way to spend the money. Almost immediately, she put some into the Plumas County Behavioral Health Department’s wellness centers, which were struggling financially at the time. The Chester and Quincy wellness centers provide community assistance programs, such as help with applications, wellness groups and counseling, and financial assistance. They also contain Haven machines, which offer harm reduction tools. These machines are being stocked partially through funding from the settlement.

The public health department is working to help expand services at the Plumas County Intervention and Resource Center through North Star Navigation Center, PCIRC’s shelter service.

Reinert and Sanderson noted that transportation, time and access to services can be challenging for some people. Reinert intends to use some of the settlement funds to hire a nurse to provide education and wound care via a mobile outreach van. She also plans to use some of the settlement funds for transportation to treatment centers.

“These are really remote sites that often don’t get a lot of services at all,” Reinert said. “We’re trying to meet them where they’re at and trying to expand.”

Reinert also plans to put part of the settlement funding toward support for incarcerated individuals. People suspected of being under the influence may soon have a medical wristband to monitor signs of an overdose, allowing health officials to react quickly.

“The [Plumas] jail is working to purchase a body scanner upon entry, just to ensure there aren’t additional substances,” Reinert said. “If these substances are found, this will not be additional tools for prosecution — this is simply for prevention.”

After people are released from jail, public health officials hope to offer Brixadi, a once-a-month injection used to treat moderate to severe opioid addiction. There is also a fund for people who can’t afford treatment, Sanderson said.

Naloxone (Narcan)

When the opioid epidemic was first identified, one of the earliest public health interventions focused on training the community to use naloxone.

Public Health Coordinator Danielle Blust explained that the stigma surrounding naloxone has remained throughout this process. Some believe that offering naloxone encourages users to continue taking opioids. Other forms of stigma include people believing they don’t need naloxone because of who the drug is intended for.

Blust explained why everyone — with or without addiction issues — should have naloxone: “It isn’t just people who take drugs recreationally, but also those who take them because of their health.”

Blust and Reinert both compared naloxone to a fire extinguisher: “Everyone should have one at their house,” Blust said. “You never want to use it, but you’ll be grateful to use it when you have it.”

“You never want to use it, but you’ll be grateful to use it when you have it.”

Danielle Blust, Plumas County Public Health Agency coordinator

Blust said that as community members, it’s important to know the signs of an overdose and to always carry naloxone. “If you notice someone’s lips are blue, or their skin is pale, or they’re having complications breathing,” those are all signs of an overdose, she said.

Naloxone is provided by the county public health department and the behavioral health department at no charge. The settlement money is also being used to purchase more naloxone.

Challenges in the data

The county public health department gathers the majority of the data on opioid overdoses. But gathering and interpreting data comes with its own set of difficulties. Plumas County has limited data for several reasons, including its small population, which makes gathering extensive information challenging. Other constraints include resources and staffing limitations, Reinert said.

As the epidemic has moved underground, often health officials have to rely on word of mouth.

“When we’re giving out Narcan through the harm reduction program, and people are reporting ‘I had three friends last week who overdosed and one died.’ That’s how, at times, our county has to gather some of the data,” Sanderson said.

Blust explained that when someone with underlying health conditions dies their death may be attributed to that health concern — even when opioid overdose plays a role. To make interpreting data even more difficult, the county’s size means that even one death can greatly increase percentages and change how the county compares with others, Sanderson said. The California Overdose Surveillance Dashboard isn’t completely reliable either. Blust explained that Westwood is included in the Plumas County data despite being part of Lassen, not Plumas County.

Sanderson was skeptical about the zero deaths reported in 2016. “I don’t think it was ever zero,” he said, explaining that the absence of deaths was likely related to reporting issues.

Reinert noted that the county’s epidemiologist has been looking at recent opioid overdose data. “We have collected local quantitative data through surveys regarding drug use, needs and readiness for treatment, which we are processing internally,” she said. This data will be paired with emergency room visits, uses of naloxone and monitoring vital statistics.

Looking forward

Plumas County remains under the state average for opioid prescriptions. But the wave of the underground epidemic has brought new challenges. With the opioid settlement money now being used, officials are optimistic that expanded services will bring positive change.

“This settlement funding is going to be a huge help for this community overall,” Reinert said. Without it, she was skeptical that any of the new programs could be implemented.

Sanderson said many people struggling with addiction feel judgment and shame, which keeps them using substances in the dark, stopping them from seeking support. He said that we need to begin looking at addiction as “a complex interplay between choice and disease.”

As settlement money funds more initiatives and projects, expanding access and care should help combat the opioid epidemic.

“I think we’re moving in the right direction,” Reinert said. “I see momentum not just with partners but with the community. We’re all going to have to work together.”",https://plumassun.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PXL_20260112_214351990-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 18:03:40.583959

We are aiming to bring approximately €2 billion into the economy through Enterprise Ireland high-value jobs and continued exports.","I want to return to the issue of the fact that ten ministers have not paid back money owed to the public funds, in some cases tens of thousands of euro, seven months after it was requested. When I questioned Deputy Chambers, who is the Minister responsible for the NSSO, the body which will deal with these repayments, he said he is not privy to the interactions between Ministers and the NSSO and that he does not know the identity of the ten. The Minister has made a stout defence of the fact that those ten have not yet paid back the money. I want to put a number of questions and I expect direct answers. Does the Minister know who the ten Ministers are who have so far not paid back the thousands of euro they owe the public purse? How many of them are Fine Gael Ministers? From where was the information the Minister put on the record of the Dáil today in their defence elicited, if it was not from the individual Ministers? Crucially, when are the Ministers going to cough up and pay back the money they owe the taxpayer? I ask for direct answers please.

This is questions on promised legislation but I will respond directly to Deputy Doherty, as I have been very clear in relation to the NSSO. This is an error by the NSSO and Ministers are engaging with the NSSO. I do not know, nor should I know, the identity of anyone's payroll matters in the State. I do know from dealing with the NSSO because, as I said, between underpayment and overpayment everyone who served and gave a salary sacrifice in government, with regard to the decision to reduce salaries by 10%, was affected. This is why it is critical-----

In the week when special school classes were announced for 2026, I need to raise with the Minister the case of River Valley Community National School in Swords. It is not looking for a class in 2026; it is looking for a class now. This is in agreement with the NCSE. The school is a developing school in good but interim accommodation. It is being refused by the Department of education the provision of an autism class right now only because it is in temporary accommodation, even though it has the space. I ask, please, because I will continue to bring this up, will the Department meet the patron body and the principal on site to get this matter over the line? Autistic children are being let down, as are mainstream children and the staff. This can be resolved, please, Minister.

Compliance with the law is not a gift for X to give to this State but this is the benevolent tone in which it announced this morning that it will indeed comply with law in jurisdictions where that law exists.

This belated assurance for geo-blocking, which in itself is hugely problematic because it can be so easily circumnavigated, is too little, too late. It is not surprising that we are hearing this tone from this tech company because kid gloves is the approach that this Government and this State has taken to dealing with big tech and the harms it is wielding on society. The response over the last two weeks has been chaotic and it has taken a Minister of State in the Minister, Deputy Burke's Department to actually cajole this Government into action. I want to hear an update on what is happening with the Attorney General and his analysis of the law. I want to know if the Garda investigation, which we heard about yesterday in committee, has finally reached the doors of X on Fenian Street, and I want to hear what further Government action is going to happen so that we can take off those kid gloves and wrestle back control from big tech on the absolute havoc it is wreaking on society.

The Housing Agency is finding new ways to exclude people from the remediation scheme. We have already seen the system fail when pyrrhotite in concrete was ignored. The agency has now introduced a new method to refuse access, stretching IS 465 and selectively presenting facts. The approach will not withstand scrutiny and must be addressed. The decision has been independently reviewed by engineers and a legal expert, both concluding it is wrong. Reliance on an appeals process to correct such decision is reactive, costly and causes harm to homeowners. The Minister has the authority and responsibility to act proactively and treat the decisions as a test case and set a fair, consistent standard before people are affected. This matter goes beyond a single property. Now that this has been brought to the Government's attention, will the Minister intervene to stop this and review the test case or will it be allowed to continue? I want a simple ""Yes"" or ""No"".

Obviously, I am not the Minister for housing, but I will take this issue up with him. I would point out that the Government has been very proactive in protecting homeowners in Donegal. I acknowledge all those homeowners who have applied for the current scheme, which was enhanced, and the work done throughout our communities to ensure people and families are protected, because that is a primary concern of the Government for all those families that are affected in Donegal. I will raise the specific issue Deputy Ward brought up with the Minister for housing.

In Ireland, we use over 200 million single-use tea and coffee cups a year. That equates to at least 20,000 cups an hour. That is a staggering figure. Coffee cups are, according to Irish Business Against Litter, among the top five most littered items in the country according to a recent survey. Most of these cups cannot go into recycling bins because of the polyethylene lining used in the paper, making them non-recyclable. The Government had proposed a 20 cent levy as well as other measures. As the Minister knows, the litter issue is one thing, but the long-term environmental damage is another. When is the Government going to use or amend the Circular Economy and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022 to bring in a refundable deposit? Along with other products that I have referred to before such as the vaping material and nitrous oxide canisters, they are littering our country and we need to have something with a behavioural impact as well as increased fines.

In County Offaly, renewable energy developments are mainly located on peatlands around Rhode, Croghan, Edenderry, Banagher and Cloghan. These projects require abnormal load vehicles of up to 135 tonnes on 16-axle trailers. The damage caused by one trip of one of these vehicles is equivalent to one year of normal traffic. As a result, these peat-based roads now require annual maintenance, placing major pressure on our local authority roads budget and taking funding away from other roads that also need work.

Offaly has historically carried the heaviest load in providing power to this country and we are doing so again through renewable energy. We are simply asking for a fair crack of the whip and that separate, dedicated funding be provided to Offaly County Council for these road projects.

I am very proud to come from a small village called Kinnitty where we have benefited significantly from multimillion euro investment in the public realm, public services and the development of the Slieve Bloom mountain bike trails. However, in the last 12 months, we have lost our post office and our last shop, which had served the community for decades. Thankfully, a 68-year-old man, Mr. Jodie Flaherty, has stepped into the breach to open a new shop. However, it is a reflection of the challenges in the market conditions and trading environment for micro-businesses in small villages right across the country. I appreciate the measures the Minister has introduced through, for example, the local enterprise office in terms of supports, but there is a concern around viability. I ask the Minister and the wider Government to ensure there are further measures to make sure the viability of our micro-businesses in the best interests of our public good, our economic good and our social good.

I acknowledge the huge work Deputy Clendennen is doing in being a firm advocate for our small family businesses. I know, as Minister for enterprise, that they employ two thirds of people right across our community. We have taken a number of initiatives this year around viability and worked to ensure that they are more viable, including setting up our small business unit and working with our cost of doing business advisory forum, which is looking at the interoperability of regulators that are currently on our landscape and ensuring we are doing things faster and being agile as an economy. We also have a huge amount of work to do, as is outlined in the programme for Government, related to other viability measures. We will work with Deputy Clendennen to ensure our small businesses continue to grow. As I pointed out in my earlier contribution, all 13 sectors of the economy are in a strong growth phase right now.

Yesterday, the Irish Wheelchair Association and other disability organisations had a session in the audiovisual room. They gave some stark facts and figures to us. Sometimes, we all get lost in statistics and figures. The reality for people with disabilities is that they are affected far more by the high cost of living - approximately 16% more. They are in need of some form of a one-off payment now. This winter and the next few months can be severe and extremely cold. At present, they are receiving huge electricity and gas bills, some up to €500. They told us they were in a position where they had to give up a few meals a week to heat their homes and stop their home dialysis treatment and go to their local hospital to save on their electricity bills. There are a few cases where they stopped recharging their mobile wheelchairs.

I ask that the Government consider a one-off targeted payment of €400, with an estimated cost of €145 million. Considering the surplus billions of euro that is in the coffers at the moment, it is a very modest ask for the most vulnerable people in the country. As they say themselves, they are 22% of the invisible minority.

During Leaders' Questions, I raised quite clearly what the Government was doing for people who were most vulnerable, particularly the 15% increase in our fuel allowance, of which one in four households is now in receipt of, to reflect the challenges related to the cost of living. I also mentioned the social welfare increase for carers, those with disabilities and those on the margins of society of €10 per week. There are further interventions that assist people through the social welfare code. I always point out that the community welfare office is ready to assist people if they have any one-off shocks or meet a liability they are unable to discharge. I assure people that the Government will continue to work to support people with disabilities. In 2026, we have a record budget for disability services - this is a fact - and the Government wants to continue to support that sector.

The importance of public transport and connectivity in rural areas cannot be emphasised strongly enough. In that regard, I acknowledge the tremendous work of Alan O'Connell, manager of Kerry Local Link, and his staff. As a councillor, I called a number of years ago for a hop-on, hop-off bus service on the Ring of Kerry. Today, thankfully, there are several buses going in both directions but there is a great need for additional routes. The tender process for the Killarney to Mallow route is complete and we await funding.

I will raise three other important routes: Beaufort to Killorglin via Whitefield; Kate Kearney's Cottage at the world-famous tourist attraction, the Gap of Dunloe, to Beaufort village and on to Killarney town; and from Dooks in Glenbeigh to Cromane and on to Killorglin town. Will the Minister ask the Minister for Transport to allocate the necessary funding to the NTA for the Connecting Ireland mobility scheme to allow these important routes to proceed?

The Deputy is right to highlight the opportunity Mallow presents and has presented for some time to HSE south west to provide step-down facilities and other healthcare facilities, particularly to help with the discharge from Mercy and Cork University Hospital. There have been beds there that have been available. I am having a full seminar with HSE south west on 5 February, when I will go through all of that in detail, including making sure all the beds funded are opened on time and in a timely way, as well as making sure all discharge pathways that currently exist are being fully utilised by all model 3 and model 4 hospitals there.

I am supporting a local family in Drogheda in dire straits because of a mind-boggling decision made by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to bring forward an arbitrary deadline of 1 October for parents seeking special class or special school placement for their child in the upcoming academic year. Eight-year-old Alfie has a diagnosis of developmental language disorder and global delay sensory overload which means he cannot deal with change, has issues eating and drinking, needs help with toileting, wets and soils himself regularly and has severe anxiety and stress along with no sense of danger. He has been hospitalised owing to stress responses and mental health difficulties. The challenges he faces have increased since moving to mainstream education and his mam advises that only following hospital admissions in early October did she begin pushing for special class placement and learned of this deadline. They have secured a place in a special class in a different school that would meet Alfie's needs but the application could not be completed without a letter of eligibility from the NCSE. The school closes to applications tomorrow.

I do not like raising individual issues on the floor of the House but, having contacted the local SENO and the NCSE to plead for flexibility in the deadline, I have been told the facility to issue the letter of eligibility has ended. It is completely unacceptable the NCSE's refusal to issue a letter of eligibility will mean Alfie or any other child could not complete an application for a special school placement. For the sake of these vulnerable children, this arbitrary deadline needs to be scrapped.

My office has been inundated with telephone calls from worried carers in receipt of carer's benefit and carer's allowance. A number of them received letters from the Revenue this week and last week telling them they are liable for tax. Does the Minister accept many of these carers were unaware there was a tax payment due or a burden upon them? Will his Department consider exemptions and thresholds for transition and protection of carers affected to ensure they are not penalised. Carers are among the most vulnerable people in our community. The Minister mentioned how big our welfare system is and how big the budget is. I find it entirely unfair people who are giving up and sacrificing and are getting out of the house to get a break for a couple of hours while caring for and committing to their families are receiving worrying letters from Revenue saying they are being audited, owe tax and will be paying tax on their carer's benefit or carer's allowance.

I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue. I am a firm advocate for carers. We in society owe a huge debt for the work they do. That is why the Government is responding through supports and is on a trajectory to abolishing the means test for carer's allowance to demonstrate our support for the sector. The taxation is based on other income people may have received. The Taoiseach has sought a briefing on this. It was raised in the House earlier this week. We can revert to the Deputy in due course.

In December the IDA published its annual results for 2025, stating it has secured a record 323 investment proposals, representing a 38% increase on the previous year, and expected to deliver over 15,000 new jobs. In Wexford last year, Bank of New York Mellon disposed of 310 highly skilled jobs. The workers lost their jobs and the offices are on the market in an IDA business park in Wexford town. This is an ideal opportunity to acquire a really good suite of offices in a building that an IDA company could move into. I urge the Minister to impress upon the IDA to purchase this building and secure employment - perhaps replacement employment for the 310 workers of BNY Mellon who lost their jobs in Wexford.

I thank the Deputy for raising this very important matter. I assure him the IDA is liaising with BNY on the building and a future occupant for it. That will be to the forefront for any building that becomes vacant because of a change in operations, like BNY had in terms of its consolidation. We will do everything we can to get a replacement tenant in it. One of the things I am really driving the IDA on is the dispersement of jobs. We need to see a strong proportion going to regional areas. It has hit 56% or 57% and we hope that will continue throughout the remaining four years of the current strategy.

I raise the horrific case of a peaceful working family in Finglas who suffered the terrible trauma of being petrol bombed out of their home. Their house was destroyed in the arson attack and they just made it out alive because of the brave actions of one of the children, Amanda Uwase, who is in the Gallery today. She went back into the burning home and rescued her younger brothers and sister. Her mother works as a carer and was rescued by the fire services. However, the response from the Government and the State to this terrible attack on peaceful working people in Finglas has been absolutely outrageous in its silence. The family has been left homeless. This is not good enough. Where is the response from the Minister for justice to find the perpetrators, bring them to justice and be tough on such a heinous crime? Is the lack of response because these are disadvantaged communities?

I want to acknowledge Amanda's presence and say how proud of her I am. I saw her report on the news. The work she has done in tertiary education has been exemplary. As an Irish Government Minister, I want to say that she and her family are really welcome in our country. My heart goes out to her on what she has had to experience.

I will say to Amanda that we have an independent justice system in our country. I absolutely assure her that An Garda Síochána will investigate this heinous crime in full and ensure that someone is brought to justice for it. I also acknowledge the huge contribution that people who come from many different countries make in ours. I am very proud of the one in five people working in our economy right now who were not born in Ireland. They make a contribution to our healthcare and hospitality sectors. Many of them keep the cornerstones of our economy together. Amanda, you are very brave. Keep the faith. This country will have your back.

Families in Kildare North are still reporting that their children do not have confirmed secondary school places for September. This is despite the apply to school pilot programme the Minister for education introduced in Celbridge and other locations around the country to provide earlier clarity and reduce duplicate applications. The overlap between towns in Kildare North is delaying offers and leaving parents and, more importantly, sixth class children in complete uncertainty. If this pilot is genuinely producing more robust data, then that information needs to be used to identify where additional capacity is required. This is particularly pertinent to Maynooth Community College, Maynooth Post Primary School and Salesian College Celbridge. I ask the Minister to ask the Department of education and the Minister how the data from the apply to school pilot is being used to ensure that the children still awaiting places in Kildare North receive timely offers and how it will inform capacity planning moving forward.

What specific measures are the Minister's Department and Enterprise Ireland undertaking to ensure that SMEs in Ireland stay up to date with advancements in AI and digital technologies as they grow at a rapid rate? Local enterprise offices, LEOs, have been very good at giving grants to small companies but what I am talking about are mid-range SMEs that would like to get involved with Enterprise Ireland but sometimes struggle to do so. What steps can we take this calendar year and next year as we look forward? These changes in our society are huge. Rapid improvements are being made and we need to get them into our companies to ensure that we stay in touch with technologies and companies from outside Ireland.

I thank Deputy Neville for raising this very important issue and for the work he is doing for the enterprise sector to ensure rewards for enterprise are very much embedded in our economy. A number of offers are currently going through Enterprise Ireland. We have doubled the value of the innovation voucher, which is a huge assistance with tertiary education. It provides for a great deal of the commercialisation of research that can be seen taking place in our economy. The grow digital voucher offers up to €5,000 for smaller businesses. To support them, we also have bespoke schemes offered by Enterprise Ireland for cybersecurity, business consultancy and process innovation. These allow businesses to see how bringing in artificial intelligence can result in greater productivity and, critically, allow workers to work on other areas, focusing on growing business and bringing more revenue streams into the economy.

We have seen record growth among Enterprise Ireland companies this year. Exports were worth €36 billion, which is something never heard of before. We want to continue that growth, add 75,000 additional jobs over the next five years and see growth in research, development and innovation, where the tax credit will help. We are aiming to bring approximately €2 billion into the economy through Enterprise Ireland high-value jobs and continued exports. I will work with the Deputy to help companies to start growing in scale through the schemes we have over the coming years.

I will try not to be.

How does the Government justify ploughing ahead next Thursday with a Bill that still allows the counselling notes of victims of sexual assault, rape and child sexual abuse to be accessed in trials despite all it has been told in recent months and years about how damaging and traumatising that is? I refer to the Criminal Law and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2026. This provision should never have been contained in this Bill because it is such an important issue. It has been thrown in with pepper spray, street furniture and a million other things in order to get it passed. On 22 December, the Minister said that he was going to look at further amendments but the Bill has appeared with no further amendments. People are still going to have to choose between therapy and trial. The only change is that, instead of the person waiving their right, it will now be passed over to a judge for a disclosure hearing on whether the counselling notes should be allowed. This does not take away the chilling effect of your notes being accessed. It forces the victim to choose between proceeding with a trial or proceeding with therapy. It is absolutely disgusting that any law that allows this exists. The Government has had ample opportunity to outlaw it completely.

It emerged this morning at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts that there had been a significant overspend on an IT system for SUSI grants, which has now cost almost three times the originally budgeted figure of €2.2 million. The Comptroller and Auditor General drew attention to this at this morning's meeting. The project, titled ""My SUSI"", began in 2015 and by 2024 it had run to €6.4 million, although it is still only at the pre-project phase. What does the Government know about this? What oversight is the Department providing?

I understand this is an historical issue. As far as I am aware, there was a write-down on the project in 2021. Value for taxpayers' money is paramount. The project should deliver. As the Deputy has said, the project is ongoing. It is an important and fundamental system but it must be delivered efficiently in a cost-effective manner. I have asked for a full inquiry and will update the Deputy and the House as that goes on.",https://www.oireachtas.ie/_resources/themes/oireachtas/img/og-hoo-logo.svg,N,,2026-01-16 17:05:06.276895

The company's profitability is underscored by a net margin of 14.15% and an operating margin of 15.3%. Additionally, the gross margin stands at an impressive 74.46%, indicating efficient cost management.

Maplebear's balance sheet reflects strong financial health, with a current ratio of 3.64 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.01, suggesting minimal leverage. The company's Altman Z-Score of 6.52 indicates a low risk of financial distress. However, insider activity reveals a warning sign, with 21,495 shares sold in the past three months.

Maplebear's valuation metrics suggest a relatively attractive entry point. The P/E ratio of 21.87 is close to its three-year low, while the P/S ratio of 3.14 and P/B ratio of 3.06 are near their one-year lows.

Our approach reimagines a 100-year old process, which helps us deliver lower-cost, more resilient ammonia production regardless of energy source.
Ammobia's novel technology enables economical ammonia production at any scale and proximity to demand – essential as these applications mature.
Radaelli brings decades of experience in process technology innovation and in the ammonia market.
""After 30 years developing and commercialising ammonia technology, I've seen every incremental improvement attempted in this industry,"" said Radaelli.","With the new financing, the team has revealed its plans to build a pilot facility to de-risk its reactor technology and select a customer cohort for commercial demonstrations.

Ammobia’s funding round, which included investors such as Shell Ventures, ALIAD (Air Liquide), MOL Switch (Mitsui OSK Lines), and Chevron Technology Ventures, reflects ongoing interest in the potential for innovation in the global ammonia market. As the second most-produced chemical worldwide, ammonia feeds half the world's population through fertilizers.

However, standard Haber-Bosch production relies on the volatile natural gas supply and requires extreme conditions that favour centralised, capital-intensive facilities. Ammobia’s Haber-Bosch 2.0 leverages novel material science, process design, and commercially available components to improve ammonia’s affordability, transportability, and independence from fossil-fuel-exporting regions, minimising supply shock exposure and enabling long-term energy resilience.

""The ammonia industry is at an inflection point,"" said Karen Baert, CEO and Co-Founder of Ammobia. ""If we want to lower costs and cut emissions in existing ammonia markets – while enabling ammonia’s untapped value in energy and maritime fuel – we need production technology designed for where the world is headed, not where it has been. Our approach reimagines a 100-year old process, which helps us deliver lower-cost, more resilient ammonia production regardless of energy source. Ammobia’s technology that solves for economic pressures and supply chain instability also creates a pathway to deep decarbonisation – meaning we are positioned to serve both the industry's immediate needs and its long-term transformation.""

Ammobia’s proprietary thermochemical synthesis technology brings a suite of advantages to fuel and power sectors, chemical manufacturing, fertilizer producers, and energy storage and transportation ecosystems.

""Ammonia is rapidly emerging as a critical fuel and energy carrier, creating significant new market opportunities,"" commented Tomoaki Ichida, CEO at MOL Switch, the venture capital arm of global shipping company Mitsui OSK Lines. ""Traditional production has served existing markets well, but meeting this growing demand requires a diversified approach. Ammobia's novel technology enables economical ammonia production at any scale and proximity to demand – essential as these applications mature. For MOL, backing a team with the technical expertise to deliver production at half the conventional capex strengthens our ability to decarbonise shipping.""

Ammobia recently added Guido Radaelli to its leadership team, where he is now Chief Engineering Officer. Radaelli brings decades of experience in process technology innovation and in the ammonia market. ""After 30 years developing and commercialising ammonia technology, I've seen every incremental improvement attempted in this industry,"" said Radaelli. ""What Ammobia has achieved isn't incremental – it's a fundamental shift that changes the economics across the value chain.""

The seed round also added Katapult Ocean, AIR Capital, Alumni Ventures, and Motivate Fund to Ammobia’s cap table, with follow-on capital from existing investors such as Starlight Ventures, Collaborative Fund, Arosa Capital and Zero Infinity Partners. Ammobia’s investments now total US$13.5 million, including dilutive and non-dilutive capital.",https://dlgivnpf6gg8w.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/environment-tree-01.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 16:02:33.177131

Payment data and reporting can reveal where there’s room to improve performance and conversion.

For many merchants, this evaluation may surface an uncomfortable reality: The payments foundation that supported yesterday’s success may be limiting tomorrow’s growth.

As merchants plan for what’s ahead in 2026, many are taking a closer look at whether their current payments foundation can keep pace with evolving customer expectations and the accelerating pace of commerce innovation.

Legacy or fragmented payment solutions make it difficult to keep pace, and their limitations become increasingly difficult to ignore. Missing preferred payment methods, inefficient fraud checks or disconnected reporting introduce unnecessary layers of operational complexity and can create friction at the very moment customers are ready to convert.

Adobe’s recent holiday analysis found that 7 in 10 site visits occurred on mobile devices, and buy-now-pay-later orders grew 11% year over year. These shifts underscore the importance of fast, familiar and flexible checkout experiences.

How merchants are simplifying payments to unlock growth

A more modern, unified approach to payments helps merchants move beyond the constraints of outdated or fragmented systems. By consolidating where and how payments are activated, managed and optimized, merchants can reduce operational complexity while creating a more flexible foundation for future innovation.

Payment Services is built directly into Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source, streamlining how payments are implemented across the shopper journey and reducing the resource demands typically associated with adding new payment methods.

Beyond simplifying the implementation of current and future payment innovations, a cohesive payments experience can also drive meaningful operational efficiency. When finance, e-commerce and customer experience teams share a single view of payment activity, they spend less time reconciling data and can respond more quickly to issues or opportunities as they arise.

ParkingZone, a parking supply company in the United States, streamlined its workflows after consolidating its payment processes through Payment Services for Magento Open Source.

By shifting to a single dashboard, ParkingZone saves five to six hours each week. The centralized view also improved how transactions are reviewed, making it easier to distinguish legitimate activity from suspicious attempts. Since adopting Payment Services, fraudulent transaction flags have decreased by 47%, which helps protect revenue and creates a smoother experience for the business and its customers.

Nite Ize, a manufacturer of outdoor and mobile accessories, saw similar efficiencies. After implementing Payment Services for Adobe Commerce, the company quickly added digital wallets such as Apple Pay and PayPal to its product pages. Customer response was immediate, showing how readily shoppers adopt familiar payment options when they encounter them within the purchase journey. Nearly 50% of credit card payments shifted to these faster, more convenient options.

“When customers find a Nite Ize product they love, they want to buy it instantly, not fill out forms and enter credit card information,” said Brian Lambert, e-commerce and digital manager at Nite Ize.

Together, these examples illustrate how modernizing payments is about creating a simpler, more resilient payments foundation — one that supports growth today while making it easier to adapt as customer expectations and commerce innovation continue to evolve.

Building resilience and growth into 2026

Merchants that modernize and adopt a unified payments solution gain benefits that extend well beyond the payment methods they offer. Beyond enabling new options at checkout, staying current reduces the long-term cost of operational complexity and builds a foundation that can adapt as commerce evolves.

That adaptability will matter throughout 2026, as competition remains strong and customer expectations continue to rise. Even incremental improvements at checkout can create a measurable impact. Research from Adobe and PYMNTS shows that 97% of merchants with annual revenues under $25 million saw e-commerce sales improve after expanding their payment options. For merchants of all sizes, simplifying how customers pay has become a reliable way to strengthen loyalty and support long-term growth.

Payments may appear at the final step of the shopper journey, but they touch every part of the business.

They will need no supporting structures. Dutch 3D printing R&D start-up MX3D has invented a 3D printing technique whereby multi-axis industrial robots are able to print strong, complex structures anywhere without needing a print bed, IB Times writes in a report.

The material used is a metal that melts and then solidifies within seconds, fast enough for it not to fall down into the water.

Aided by the geometry of the overall bridge design, the material is able to print horizontally without bending.

""We start with a piece of metal attached to the canal bank. The robots start from one side of the canal, they print their own support structure, so essentially it prints its own bridge. It stands on the floor of the bridge, 3D prints out more and keeps moving"", MX3D’s CTO Tim Geurtjens told IB Times.

""We have the same physics as everyone else, but it looks like it’s gravity-defying. We put a drop of metal, drop by drop at a time and it solidifies. But you could also print tubes, and then print layer over layer of tubes"", adds Geurtjens.

The 3D printed bridge project is a collaboration between MX3D, designer Joris Laarman, Autodesk, construction firm Heijmans and several other partners, including French welding specialists Air Liquide.

Geurtjens says MX3D's software could change the future of robotics. He said: ""Our software translates CAD model software into welding strategies, and then translates that into the Rapid software used by ABB to tell the robot how to move"".

This target represents a 35% upside from the current price of $88.84, aligning with the broader analyst consensus of ""Strong Buy"" and targets ranging from $99 to $140, according to InvestingPro data.

The research firm believes the PEN acquisition will strengthen Boston Scientific’s durability and support its double-digit revenue and EPS growth profile over the mid to long term, despite acknowledging that the narrative on BSX heading into 2026 is more complex compared to the past two years. The company has demonstrated impressive 21.6% revenue growth in the last twelve months and maintains a healthy PEG ratio of 0.87, suggesting reasonable valuation relative to growth expectations.

Truist noted some timing considerations around the deal, as it comes while Boston Scientific’s electrophysiology growth is slowing and ahead of the CHAMPION catalyst, which carries some binary risk.

The firm expects Boston Scientific’s narrative to gradually become more positive following fourth-quarter results and the CHAMPION readout, with additional growth drivers coming into focus in the second half of 2026 and beyond.

Boston Scientific, a medical device manufacturer, continues to expand its portfolio through strategic acquisitions like Penumbra to maintain its growth trajectory in the medical technology sector.

In other recent news, Boston Scientific has announced a definitive agreement to acquire Penumbra for approximately $14.5 billion. This acquisition is structured as a cash and stock transaction, with Penumbra stockholders having the option to receive either cash or Boston Scientific shares. Analysts from Needham have maintained a Buy rating for Boston Scientific, emphasizing the strategic fit of the acquisition in the mechanical thrombectomy and embolic device market. Morgan Stanley also views the acquisition positively, noting projected synergies of $200 million by the third year, which could enhance sales and reduce administrative costs.

Stifel analysts have praised the acquisition for expanding Boston Scientific’s product offerings in the neuro and peripheral venous markets. In a separate development, Boston Scientific is set to acquire Valencia Technologies, a company specializing in treatments for bladder dysfunction. This acquisition will integrate Valencia’s FDA-approved eCoin System into Boston Scientific’s urology portfolio. These strategic moves indicate Boston Scientific’s efforts to strengthen its market presence and diversify its product offerings.

But then I'm not surprised because when you have ever you have a new CEO come in like John Furner taking over Doug Millan, they all want to put their own leaders in, they all want to put their stamps on the all business, but I am surprised by this one.

Brian, what I will say is I've had the chance to chat with Kath McLay a a quite a few times. She is an incredible executive.

She came to the company just a few years ago. She joined as Sam's Club CEO. She went on to lead Walmart International and in in my opinion, as bad as it is to say, I think that this this is a big loss for Walmart moving forward.

But under John Furner, I know that this morning, Kath McLe the news came out last night that she was departing Walmart effective quite soon. and this morning they announced new C suite executive change-ups. Of course, as you just noted,

a similar path to what Kath had gone. The former, or rather current CEO of Sam's Club will move into Walmart International. Also also worth noting that the gentleman David Gugina, who oversaw e-commerce for Walmart US, will now move into the US CEO role for Walmart, overseeing all store operations, all retail operations for Walmart.

So a similar, uh, you know, journey to John Furner. Uh, David really has led the momentum behind the e-commerce growth that you've seen for Walmart over the past few years. And so, I'm really eager to see how David takes on this role overseeing the the US operations for Walmart moving forward, especially in this environment where convenience, uh, really matters as well as value for the US consumer. and I'm extremely eager to see where Cath goes next. I I I think very highly of her.

For decades, grocers—especially regional and multi-regional options—served as the natural starting point of the shopping journey. Even as e-commerce grew, and marketplaces like Instacart inserted themselves between the shopper and the store, the customer still began with the grocer. The grocer's identity and what it stood for— ""I shop at H-E-B, not X"" or ""I shop at Publix, not Y""—still mattered in the customer's mind, even when the transaction flowed through an intermediary.

That era is ending. The introduction of Instacart checkout inside ChatGPT signals the emergence of a new hierarchy. For the first time, shoppers can start the journey somewhere else: They simply initiate a conversation about their purpose for shopping, e.g., ""I want to make apple pie,"" and everything that follows takes place without the grocer entering the conversation.

What Instacart tried to disintermediate, AI will displace.

This white paper explores what this shift means for grocery, the lessons from industries that have already been disrupted, and the strategic moves required for regional players to preserve their relevance. While the disruption will unfold gradually, the stakes are immediate. When AI becomes the starting point of the customer journey, power moves upstream and grocers that fail to assert themselves risk becoming invisible in their own category.

“The real test lies in translating these agreements into tangible export growth,” including whether they strengthen India’s industrial base, Barclays said.
About 70% of India’s exports to the US face “serious threat” if the 50% tariffs persist, according to the report.","Synopsis

India tariff impact: India remains one of the few major economies without a trade deal with Washington, despite facing a 50% tariff rate — among the highest in the world. The levies have dealt a heavy blow to India’s labour-intensive sectors, especially textiles, handicrafts, apparels, gems and leather.

India’s recent spate of signed and proposed free-trade agreements may not be sufficient to offset the impact of US tariffs on the South Asian country’s exports, economists at Barclays Plc said.

“While the FTA spree certainly bodes well for making international trade more seamless, it may not necessarily result in higher exports large enough to offset the US tariff-inflicted pain,” Barclays economists Aastha Gudwani and Amruta Ghare wrote in a report on Friday.

India remains one of the few major economies without a trade deal with Washington, despite facing a 50% tariff rate — among the highest in the world. The levies have dealt a heavy blow to India’s labour-intensive sectors, especially textiles, handicrafts, apparels, gems and leather. The US is India’s largest overseas market, accounting for 19.3% of total exports before the tariffs were imposed.

The lack of certainty on the trade deal has pressured the rupee and forced New Delhi to dole out $5 billion to protect Indian exporters. It has also sharpened India’s focus on trade negotiations with partners including the European Union, as it seeks to shed a protectionist image by lowering trade and non-tariff barriers long bemoaned by investors.

Still, many of the newer agreements — including those signed with Oman and New Zealand last year — are unlikely to deliver a major boost to India’s exports, given relatively small trade volumes.

“The sheer scale of things doesn’t add up,” Barclays economists said. “For example, in case of electrical machinery, after the US, the three large trading partners are UAE, Netherlands and the UK. But these three cumulatively do not make up for the market size that the US offers.”

They added that of India’s top 20 export markets, it has free trade agreements or is actively negotiating such deals with 16 countries — including the US — and those markets together account for 51% of total trade.

“The real test lies in translating these agreements into tangible export growth,” including whether they strengthen India’s industrial base, Barclays said.

About 70% of India’s exports to the US face “serious threat” if the 50% tariffs persist, according to the report. Sectors such as leather and apparel, gems and jewelery, home furnishings and marine exports would bear the brunt.

The expected India–EU FTA would be a “big step towards export diversification and greater trade openness with a large bloc,” the economists said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President António Luís Santos da Costa are set to visit India later this month, raising expectations that the two sides could move closer to signing an agreement after years of negotiations.

The digital consultation tool, available on tablets and smartphones, helps plastic surgeons personalize planning for patients. It enables the vizualization of potential outcomes during breast augmentation consultations.

According to Johnson & Johnson, most plastic surgeons still use physical sizers and before-and-after galleries to guide conversations about outcomes when it comes to breast procedures. J&J’s Arbrea Breast Simulator Surgeon App for Mentor helps to deliver a personalized 3D simulation in about 60 seconds.

The company says the process enhances clinical discussions in real time and helps patients visualize how different options could look.

Johnson & Johnson said a recent study underscored the need for solutions that better help patients visualize outcomes during consultations. Published in Aesthetic Surgery Journal Open Forum, the study found that, while 68.4% of women surveyed considered the procedure, only 17.5% underwent the procedure. Just 7.2% of those consulted proceeded to surgery.

Two separate studies showed the positive impact of the Abrea app on the consultation experience, the company said. In one study, patients rated the app 3.4 out of 4 for how closely it matched their final surgical result. In another, clinics reported conversion rates that reached as high as 87% for consultations using the app.

“The Arbrea Breast Simulator Surgeon App for Mentor gives surgeons an easy-to use digital tool that helps transform their augmentation consultations into clear, patient-centered conversations,” said Alenka Brzulja, worldwide president, Aesthetics & Reconstruction, MedTech, Johnson & Johnson. “Many women spend months or even years considering breast augmentation.

Mounting Competitive and Strategic Pressures The primary source of current pessimism stems from doubts surrounding Adobe's AI strategy.
The pure AI revenue figure of approximately $250 million appears modest relative to the corporation's overall scale.
The path forward for Adobe hinges on demonstrating tangible, AI-driven growth to restore Wall Street's faith.","Adobe finds itself navigating a significant crisis of confidence, with its stock price plunging to lows not seen since November 2022. A confluence of analyst downgrades and mounting skepticism over its artificial intelligence roadmap has placed substantial pressure on the software giant's equity. As competitive threats intensify, investors are questioning whether the company can regain its footing.

Despite the prevailing negative outlook, Adobe's underlying business performance remains robust. The company's most recent fourth-quarter results exceeded expectations, reporting earnings per share of $5.50. Its operational margin continues to demonstrate impressive strength at 46%. Furthermore, the valuation has contracted significantly, with the stock now trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of approximately 18.5—its most attractive level in years.

However, a low valuation alone is failing to serve as a compelling buy thesis for market participants. Analysts argue that for a sustained recovery to take hold, Adobe must provide concrete evidence that its AI initiatives are materially accelerating revenue growth. The upcoming Summit Conference in April is viewed as a critical event for the company to address these concerns. Until then, the stock, which closed yesterday at $304.09, is expected to remain under a microscope.

A Wave of Analyst Downgrades

The opening weeks of 2026 have proven disappointing for Adobe shareholders. Several major investment banks have concurrently revised their ratings downward. Goldman Sachs initiated coverage with a sell recommendation, attaching a price target of just $290. Oppenheimer also downgraded the stock, citing eroding confidence in the company's leadership. This trend was followed by Jefferies and BMO Capital Markets, both of which slashed their price targets substantially.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Adobe?

The consensus among experts is clear: market sentiment has shifted decisively. Baird analyst Rob Oliver captured the mood starkly, observing that even seemingly inexpensive software stocks can remain cheap for an extended period when investor morale is severely depressed.

Mounting Competitive and Strategic Pressures

The primary source of current pessimism stems from doubts surrounding Adobe's AI strategy. While management emphasizes that one-third of its annual recurring revenue is already influenced by AI, analysts see a lack of proof that this is translating into accelerated growth. The pure AI revenue figure of approximately $250 million appears modest relative to the corporation's overall scale.

Simultaneously, competitive pressures are escalating on two fronts. In the entry-level segment catering to students and freelancers, the platform Canva is gaining substantial market share. Additionally, Apple is challenging the premium segment with a competitively priced suite of creative applications. The concern is not an immediate loss of market leadership in the enterprise sector, but rather a gradual fragmentation of the price-sensitive mass market.

Not “I dabble now and then” paid-up, but full-fat, all-you-can-eat access to the entire Adobe Creative Cloud Pro suite.
I didn’t want to break years of Adobe workflows overnight, or risk mangling countless Photoshop and InDesign files I still rely on.
Out of the 24 applications bundled into my Adobe Creative Cloud Pro plan, I was regularly using just three.
So I clicked “Change Plan,” fully expecting a minor saving.","For years, I was a fully paid-up Adobe pro. Not “I dabble now and then” paid-up, but full-fat, all-you-can-eat access to the entire Adobe Creative Cloud Pro suite. Twenty-four apps. Every tool. The lot. And for a long time, I did what many of us do: I rode the wave of discounts, retention deals, and loyalty pricing, convincing myself that I was beating the system.

Then reality landed with a thud!

Come April, when my deal expired, my monthly bill was set to jump to a massive 66.49 a month. That’s 797.88 a year, and at that point, I refused. No software – no matter how industry-standard, clever, or entrenched – gets a free pass at nearly eight hundred a year just because it always has.

Now, I could have gone nuclear. I’ve already started seriously considering Affinity as a long-term alternative for photo editing, and frankly, the value proposition is very hard to ignore. I also briefly considered “acquiring” the software from a corner of the internet populated by people with parrots, eye patches, and questionable morals – but as tempting as that moment was, I do actually like some of the newer features Adobe has been rolling out, and I prefer my karma, and my files intact.

The bigger issue was continuity. I didn’t want to break years of Adobe workflows overnight, or risk mangling countless Photoshop and InDesign files I still rely on. So instead of burning the house down, I did something far more effective: I opened my account and actually looked at what I was paying for. That’s when the penny dropped!

Out of the 24 applications bundled into my Adobe Creative Cloud Pro plan, I was regularly using just three. Photoshop, every single day, across both my laptop and desktop. Lightroom, almost exclusively on my phone for image editing on the move. And InDesign for flyers, posters, birthday cards, and assorted print work – because once a journalist, always a journalist.

Everything else? Untouched. Forgotten. Digital dust. So I clicked “Change Plan,” fully expecting a minor saving. What I didn’t expect was daylight robbery – in my favour. I ditched the all-singing Pro bundle, opted for the Photography Plan (which neatly covers Photoshop and Lightroom), and then added InDesign as a standalone app. That was it.

No phone calls. No arguments. No “Are you sure?” guilt-tripping. And just like that, I’d slashed my Adobe bill by 503 a year – 24.53 a month. Yes, 41.96 a month for three apps is still a chunk of change, and if you want to go fully free or low-cost, there are absolutely other routes you can take. But for my workflow, this was the sweet spot.

The cherry on top? Because I made this change mid-billing cycle, Adobe actually refunded me 22 dollars. So effectively, I got InDesign for free for a month – something I never thought I’d see in my lifetime.

The lesson here isn’t “Ditch Adobe at all costs.” It’s this: stop paying for software out of habit. Subscription creep is real, and Adobe is banking – literally – on you not checking what you actually use. Cull the apps you don’t touch, downgrade without guilt, and take back control of your monthly outgoings.

If you’re looking for a sign to save some serious dosh, this is it. Go and look at your Adobe subscriptions. You might be shocked at just how much money you’re setting fire to every year!",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qoCP4gBk4dBxBWTrhxGc8A-1339-80.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 09:02:12.528168

Music and live experiences are powerful passion points for this generation, and Lollapalooza India sits at that intersection,” she said.
Advt Nivea is participating at Lollapalooza India for the first time in 2026, marking its first-ever association with a music festival in India.

Fashion retailer H&M is returning to Lollapalooza India in 2026 for its second consecutive year.","Live music has emerged as one of the fastest-growing segments of India’s entertainment economy, shedding its earlier niche status to become a mainstream cultural and commercial force. PwC’s Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2025–29 estimates the market expanded more than fivefold from USD 29 million in 2020 to USD 149 million in 2024, with revenues expected to climb to USD 164 million by 2029 as large-format festivals, international tours and digitally native audiences scale the business.

That shift is evident in the demand for marquee events. Tickets for Lollapalooza India 2026 were snapped up within minutes, underlining the festival’s growing pull among young consumers. Scheduled to return to Mumbai’s Mahalaxmi Racecourse on 24-25 January, the event will feature the India debuts of Linkin Park and Playboi Carti, alongside a multi-genre line-up spread across four stages.

With ticket prices ranging from INR 5,999 to INR 47,999 and a sell-out achieved months in advance, Lollapalooza India reflects the rise of experience-led, destination-focused music consumption.

The festival made its India debut in January 2023 in Mumbai through BookMyShow Live, marking its first entry into Asia. While core sponsorship categories in India broadly mirror the US, beverages, fashion, travel, payments and technology, the local edition emphasises experiential and culture-led activations, with brands integrating wellness, beauty, fashion and digital storytelling tailored to young audiences.

Launched in the US in 1991 by musician Perry Farrell as a touring alternative rock festival, Lollapalooza evolved into a destination-format event in Chicago in 2005 and has since expanded globally across Latin America and Europe. In the US, sponsors such as Bud Light, Coca-Cola, T-Mobile, Toyota, Chase, Airbnb, Hulu, Dunkin’, Kraft Heinz, Ulta Beauty and Hollister activate at scale through stages, lounges and city-wide experiences, reflecting a mature sponsorship ecosystem.

From media exposure to cultural participation

For brands, the rise of live music has shifted marketing strategies. Lollapalooza is now valued not just for sponsorship but as a platform for cultural engagement and lasting connections. Traditional media and digital campaigns still offer reach, but Gen Z and millennials who make up most festival-goers prefer interactive, participatory experiences over one-way messaging.

Geetika Mehta, managing director, Nivea India, said the shift reflects a change in how younger consumers relate to brands. “Younger consumers do not want to be marketed to. They want brands to be part of their culture and passion points. Music and live experiences are powerful passion points for this generation, and Lollapalooza India sits at that intersection,” she said.

Nivea is participating at Lollapalooza India for the first time in 2026, marking its first-ever association with a music festival in India. Mehta said the relevance of skincare at a festival is contextual rather than constructed. “When you are at a music festival–sun, sweat, long hours outdoors, skincare becomes genuinely relevant. We are not forcing our way in; we are meeting a real need within a cultural context that already matters to them,” she said.

The growing pull of festivals is also reshaping travel behaviour around live music.

Amanpreet Bajaj, country head for India and Southeast Asia at Airbnb, said music-led travel is increasingly influencing how young Indians plan trips. “Music has quickly become one of the most powerful cultural forces shaping how young Indians travel today. We are seeing a clear shift away from calendar-led trips towards experience-led journeys, where live concerts and festivals act as gateways to discovering new cities, neighbourhoods and communities,” he said.

Advt

According to Bajaj, Gen Z audiences are increasingly drawn to travel that allows them to participate in cultural moments rather than simply attend events. “For Gen Z, travel is about being part of a cultural moment and engaging more deeply with a destination,” he said.

Airbnb has partnered with Lollapalooza India to curate artist-led and city-based experiences with actor Siddhant Chaturvedi, including behind-the-scenes access, intimate sessions with musicians Ankur Tewari, OAFF and Savera, and a walkthrough led by festival director Raashi Sanghvi. Bajaj said the impact of concert-led travel extends beyond accommodation. “Concert-led travel often brings groups of friends together, encourages longer stays and supports local cafés, cultural spaces and neighbourhood businesses,” he said, adding that the experiences are designed to deepen participation and encourage exploration beyond the festival venue.

According to Varun Koorichh, vice-president marketing and portfolio head – premium and luxury, Diageo India, audiences today value not only the line-up but also the atmosphere, social connection and the ‘in-between’ moments that festivals create. “These environments have evolved from entertainment destinations into cultural milestones,” he said. “Live events create spaces where people are open, emotionally engaged and seeking discovery, allowing brands to demonstrate craft and quality through experiences that feel earned.”

Designing engagement in a fragmented attention economy

Festivals present a challenge that conventional media does not. Attention is fragmented across multiple stages, social interactions, food zones and content creation. Brands that fail to offer immediate value are ignored.

Advt

Beer brand Budweiser, owned by AB InBev, is returning to Lollapalooza India again in 2026 after participating in previous editions. Vineet Sharma, vice president, marketing & trade marketing, AB InBev India, said the festival occupies a distinct cultural position. “While traditional media provides reach and digital platforms drive frequency, they lack the visceral impact of a lived experience. We view Lollapalooza as a platform for emotional currency,” he said.

According to Sharma, the brand’s role has shifted from visibility to cultural integration. “We are not just present there; we are shaping youth culture. When a brand integrates with the right intent, it becomes part of the consumer’s personal festival narrative,” he said.

Budweiser’s Brew District has evolved into a utility-led zone combining grooming stations, viewing decks and curated food pairings with music programming through the BUDX platform. Sharma said passive branding no longer works in a festival environment. “At a festival of this scale, passive visibility is insufficient. We focus on immersive ecosystems that put the fan experience at the centre,” he said.

Mehta added Nivea’s focus was on participation rather than presence. “You have to give people something worth stopping for. This generation values self-expression and rejects one-size-fits-all,” she said. The brand’s activation includes a personalised music experience built around the “Baddie But Softie” theme, where attendees answer a few questions to generate a customised song reflecting their festival persona. On-ground elements extend into personalised photo booths, face painting and charm stations.

Fashion retailer H&M is returning to Lollapalooza India in 2026 for its second consecutive year. Amit Kothari, head of marketing, H&M India, said the festival aligns naturally with how younger audiences experience fashion. “Music festivals create a shared cultural moment where audiences actively participate rather than passively consume. Brands are most relevant when they show up in spaces that feel authentic and experiential,” he said.

At Lollapalooza India 2025, H&M introduced an interactive runway that allowed festival-goers to step into the fashion experience, alongside personalised album cover creation linking music and style. In 2026, the brand has expanded its footprint with a dedicated H&M Beauty experience zone and curated backstage performances.

Large-format festival partnerships involve multi-crore investments, prompting brands to rethink how success is measured. According to industry sources, lead sponsorships at Lollapalooza India typically range between INR 2 crore and INR 3 crore, while secondary brand associations cost between INR 50 lakh and INR 1.5 crore, depending on placement and scale of activation. These investments extend beyond visibility, covering experiential build-outs, content creation and post-event amplification.

Sharma said Budweiser evaluates the festival as a long-term asset. “We treat Lollapalooza as a strategic investment, not a tactical weekend play. We track shifts in brand equity, attributes and sentiment post-event. The real value is when a consumer chooses the brand weeks later because of a connection made at the festival,” he said.

Mehta said Nivea entered its first festival partnership with similar expectations. “Immediate sales lift is not the primary metric. We are building long-term equity with a generation that has choices and expects relevance,” she said. For H&M, Kothari said success is assessed through a mix of brand consideration, engagement, member recruitment and qualitative feedback gathered through post-event surveys.

Koorichh said Diageo assesses impact through both tangible and emotional metrics, including dwell time, participation, organic content creation, brand recall, trial-to-purchase ratios and post-festival performance across on-trade and off-trade channels. He added that each brand in Diageo’s portfolio plays a distinct role, from large-scale discovery and trial to digital storytelling and art-led inclusivity initiatives designed to sustain engagement beyond the event.

The impact of festivals is increasingly extending beyond brand metrics. As cited in the PwC report, event tourism is rising, with half a million fans travelling for concerts in 2024 and VIP ticketing recording triple-digit growth. Large-scale events are also driving spending in hospitality, transport, retail, and employment. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) recognises India’s live events economy as a strategic cultural and economic asset, with policy support for infrastructure upgrades and public-private partnerships.

With more than 30,000 live events across 319 cities in 2024 and a projected CAGR of 19 percent, the report notes that India’s live music ecosystem is undergoing a structural transformation.

(PCNA) today announced U.S. retail deliveries of 76,219 vehicles in 2025, surpassing the previous record of 76,167 vehicles in 2024. Despite an evolving market, this marks the strongest sales year in PCNA’s history.

New car sales were not the only record set in 2025. Porsche Approved Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) sales reached a new high of 48,092 units. This represents an 11 percent increase over 2024, and underscores continued demand across the brand.

""Driven by the loyalty and enthusiasm of our customers for the incredible cars we offer, we have achieved stability and even growth to set a new record in a market that experienced profound change in 2025,” said Timo Resch, President and CEO of PCNA. ‟We are grateful to every Porsche Center and everyone at PCNA for striving to exceed the expectations of our customers – an approach we will take with us into 2026, as we look forward to exciting new cars reaching U.S. roads for the first time. These will include the mighty new 911 Turbo S and the Cayenne Electric – which joins the existing gas and Hybrid models on-sale today.”

The Macan led the sales results, achieving its best year to date with 27,139 units sold, driven by strong demand for both its internal combustion and electric variants – while the Cayenne followed with 20,314 deliveries.

Two-door sports cars maintained healthy demand, with 911 sales totaling 13,574 units and the 718 reaching 6,399 units as production neared its end. Notably, December was the strongest month ever for 911 deliveries.

Citi Integrated Digital Assets Platform (CIDAP), for example, enables firm-wide development and testing of use cases and capabilities across digital assets while meeting institutional-grade security and compliance needs.

Citi Token Services for Cash uses interbranch tokenized deposits to enable real-time, 24/7 instant payments, significantly enhancing liquidity management.
The lack of a verified identity layer, by contrast, has been a primary barrier to widespread digital asset adoption.","Global banks are bringing traditional and decentralized finance together as they race to devise the plumbing of a new financial system.

The world of finance is de-bifurcating. On one side stands the bedrock of TradFi (traditional finance): established security and compliance. On the other, the velocity of DeFi (decentralized finance): 24/7 efficiency and programmable money. The question is when these two worlds will merge, not if.

Banks are racing to bring them together, driven by a powerful trifecta: maturing technology, a clearer regulatory landscape, and most critically, a roar of sustained client demand. The strategy for bridging the gap is clear: build the foundational infrastructure, secure the assets via custody, and develop compelling institutional trading products.

As they do so, global banks including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, and Societe Generale are laying the foundational plumbing for a new financial system, leveraging blockchains to move money and assets for greater speed and lower cost. Each is adopting a slightly different strategic focus.

Different Banks, Different Playbooks

JPMorgan, through its Kinexys platform, uses a private distributed ledger for high-volume, cross-border payments tokenized as JPM Coin, focusing on 24/7 programmability and integrating digital identity for compliance: an internal, tokenized settlement rail for wholesale banking.

Goldman Sachs has focused on derivatives, trading, and platform creation via its GS DAP (Digital Asset Platform) for digital bond issuance, which it plans to spin out into an industry utility.

HSBC and Societe Generale are bridging TradFi and digital formats. HSBC’s Orion platform tokenizes real-world assets (RWA) like gold and bonds, creating a “digital vault” for asset management and fractionalized trading. SG-FORGE by Societe Generale connects to public blockchains, notably by issuing the EU-compliant stablecoin, EUR CoinVertible (EURCV). Making EURCV available on external crypto exchanges creates a direct, interoperable settlement pipe linking DeFi liquidity with regulated interbank settlements.

These initiatives collectively digitize core banking functions, constructing the tokenization infrastructure for what their devisers hope will be the future of finance. Integrated tokenization platforms that marry the security of TradFi with the efficiency of digital ledger technology can make banking safer, faster, and programmable, they argue.

Citi Integrated Digital Assets Platform (CIDAP), for example, enables firm-wide development and testing of use cases and capabilities across digital assets while meeting institutional-grade security and compliance needs. Built on an internal, blockchain-agnostic infrastructure, CIDAP bridges traditional applications and blockchains. By offering digital asset services directly via traditional client integration channels, it eliminates the need for clients to manage complex blockchain technologies.

Citi Services’ digital assets strategy is always driven by two “North Stars”: meeting client needs and ensuring safety and soundness, says Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of Partnerships and Innovation, Services. “The shift to digital assets is fundamentally a response to evolving commercial models and the desire for 24/7 financial support,” he explains.

While Citi is building internal infrastructure to upgrade its internal banking rails, Standard Chartered has built standalone companies to service the open crypto market. Institutional clients want access to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin via a trusted banking partner, says René Michau, global head of Digital Assets: “This preference is often rooted in fiduciary requirements or internal policies that steer them away from unregulated crypto exchanges.”

Standard Chartered’s digital asset solutions, leveraging capabilities built by Zodia Custody, are deployed in response to identified client requirements, adds Margaret Harwood-Jones, global head, Financing and Securities Services: “For us, client-sector knowledge, a comprehensive business understanding, and proven expertise in today’s post-trade space remain fundamental building blocks in developing the right product propositions.”

In addition to solving problems for clients, digital assets can create new revenue streams.

Standard Chartered is excited about the tokenization of money market funds, citing a successful collaboration with China Asset Management to increase distribution to retail clients in Hong Kong. This not only drives new revenue, says Harwood-Jones, but it increases liquidity, offers opportunities for managing collateral quicker, and promotes financial inclusion.

Bank-Grade Digital Money

Stablecoins and tokenized deposits are emerging as foundational elements for instantaneous settlement.

Strong client adoption has greeted Citi’s launch of tokenized deposits via Citi Token Services, Chatterjee reports. Citi Token Services for Cash uses interbranch tokenized deposits to enable real-time, 24/7 instant payments, significantly enhancing liquidity management. Further demonstrating its momentum, Citi announced in November that the platform is integrating euro transactions and expanding its footprint to Dublin, enabling clients to transfer both US dollars and euros globally.

Thanks to developments such as these, an increasing volume of capital market flows incorporate blockchain-based settlement, crypto investment, and the tokenization of funds, says Amit Agarwal, head of Custody, Citi Investor Services. Banks like Citi are finding their opportunity in the continuing necessity of a trusted, central provider to safeguard these emerging assets.

“Our clients consistently express a desire for the same bank-grade security, safety, and compliance they currently experience when dealing with traditional assets,” says Agarwal. “Therefore, as the digital asset space expands, the requirement is to maintain this identical standard of safety and security.”

A central issue in the DeFi revolution is how to build trust and ensure compliance in a new, borderless ecosystem. Standard Chartered’s brokerage model for crypto trading provides clients with regulated access, Michau notes; a bank-facing solution offers a specific, regulated risk profile, which differentiates it from an unregulated crypto exchange.

The lack of a verified identity layer, by contrast, has been a primary barrier to widespread digital asset adoption.

The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) addresses this concern with its Verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI), which makes identity and credentials portable across multiple infrastructures, creating a “trust anchor” to verify legal person identification, says Alexandre Kech, CEO of GLEIF. Solving “verification of identity” is key to enabling mass tokenization, he argues, because it allows the ecosystem to confirm details like “is an accredited investor” in real-time, moving away from heavy upfront processes.

Adding the ‘Trust Layer’

The need for trust extends to the assets themselves. Kech highlights the risk of fake tokens and copycats like the phony JPM coin that appeared hours after the real one was issued, underscoring the need for smart contracts that can reliably link a token to its legitimate issuer: a capability that can be developed within platforms like CIDAP.

As the world’s leading custody bank, BNY Mellon aims to serve as the “trust layer” for the evolving digital economy; its core strategy is to provide an agnostic platform for all assets, digital and traditional alike, by offering secure safekeeping and administration. Citi, likewise, expects to launch a dedicated digital assets custody capability this year, starting with crypto assets and validated by a recent successful live pilot transaction involving secure custody of Ethereum tokens.

DBS, meanwhile, operates a proprietary DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx), offering trading, custody, and tokenization services to accredited investors and aims on expanding its DBS Token Services for programmable payments to institutional treasuries.

The integration of TradFi and DeFi is not a distant goal but a present reality, catalyzed by sustained client demand for 24/7 efficiency and institutional-grade security. As major institutions move beyond experimentation to build robust, interoperable infrastructure and tokenization platforms, they are positioning themselves not merely as participants, but as the architects of a tokenized future that is both safe and accessible.",https://s44650.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tokenization-scaled.png,N,,2026-01-16 06:59:43.527161

In a significant move to fortify the cyber defenses of Europe’s key institutions, a consortium including Capgemini, Airbus Protect, PwC, and Nviso has been selected to handle cybersecurity across 71 European institutions, bodies, and agencies. This partnership marks a strategic step in securing digital infrastructure against evolving cyber threats.

Scope and Duration of the Partnership

The contract awarded, known as the MC17 FREIA Cyber Framework Contract, represents one of the European Commission’s pivotal initiatives for digital protection. Encompassing an extensive range of cybersecurity services, the contract is valued at several million euros and extends over a four-year period, giving ample time to implement comprehensive security measures.

Comprehensive Cybersecurity Coverage

The appointed consortium covers all three critical segments of the cybersecurity framework:

Incident Management: Handling and responding effectively to cyber incidents as they arise.

Governance and Risk: Steering institutional policies to mitigate risks and maintain compliance.

Training and Technical Expertise: Enhancing skills and knowledge across all involved entities to stay ahead of threats.

By spanning the entire cybersecurity value chain—from preventative strategies to active incident response and upskilling—these efforts ensure a holistic defense posture.

Supporting Regulatory Compliance and Digital Transformation

This collaboration also helps institutions navigate and comply with a slew of critical cybersecurity regulations, including:

NIS2 Directive

Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)

EU Cybersecurity Act

Cyber Resilience Act

In the rapidly changing digital landscape, adherence to regulatory standards is non-negotiable. This framework contract doesn’t just shield the institutions but also enables the secure advancement of their digital transformation initiatives.

The Consortium’s Vision and Commitment

The consortium’s representatives emphasize a blend of technical expertise, strategic foresight, and agile operations to meet today’s cybersecurity challenges. The selection for all three portions of the framework contract reflects trust in their ability to deliver complex security programs on a grand scale.

By joining forces, Capgemini, Airbus Protect, PwC, and Nviso aim to enhance resilience, adapt to emerging threats, and provide unified protection that helps European institutions stay one step ahead.

Impact on Logistics and Beyond

While this move primarily targets cyber defense for institutional infrastructure, the ripple effects on logistics are notably relevant. Robust cybersecurity fortifies supply chain operations from the digital core, ensuring secure data exchange and protecting sensitive freight and shipment information. With an increasing volume of logistics operations relying on digital platforms for tracking, distribution management, and freight forwarding, cyber resilience helps prevent disruptions that could cascade through global transport networks.

Cybersecurity Area Role in European Institutions Impact on Logistics Incident Management Rapid detection and response to threats Minimizes shipment delays due to cyber incidents Governance and Risk Implements risk mitigation strategies and compliance Ensures secure handling of confidential logistics data Training & Expertise Builds cyber skills and awareness Empowers logistics operators to handle cyber risks smartly

Why the Right Cybersecurity Partner Matters

Choosing the right ally to defend against cyber threats is no small feat. It’s like finding a vigilant sentinel who not only guards the gates but anticipates where trouble might creep in next. By integrating extensive technical knowledge and strategic operations, the consortium is positioned to deliver consistent protection while adapting rapidly to new challenges.

If you pull all the levers, you can change work.","When AI is introduced to a workplace, it sparks excitement for some, and anxiety for others.

While some employees may see technology as a means of enhancing their ability to complete their role – improving productivity and reducing repetitive tasks – others may see it as a step towards making their job obsolete.

At IBM, the answer is neither simple nor threatening because the company is putting its people at the heart of its AI strategy.

In an exclusive conversation with IBM’s Jon Lester, Vice President of HR Technology, Data & AI, UNLEASH explores how the technology giant is using AI agents not just to automate tasks, but to empower its 270,300 employees to learn, adapt, and thrive in the future of work.

Placing employees at the heart of AI transformation

For Lester, “openness and transparency” is the cornerstone of ensuring employees feel empowered by emerging technologies.

However, HR leaders also need to demonstrate a solid understanding of how these technologies work, to then confidently translate this to the workforce.

Lester highlights that, when used correctly, agents can bring the workforce a number of benefits, such as increasing productivity and freeing up employees’ time. However, it can also raise the question: What will happen to us when new technology comes in?

“One of the big things we talk about is that as a headline number, IBM has given back $3.5 billion in the last two years of productivity back to IBMers. We think agents will accelerate that even more,” he shares.

“This can feel threatening. But at IBM, the message is clear: your job will change – but we want you to lead that change.”

Agents can therefore be used to complete tasks that employees tend to find undesirable – such as moving data around and responding to the same queries multiple times a day.

This is where transparency comes into play, as Lester insists leaders must make their workforce aware that “constant change is going to happen”, but that they should assure the business wants to “invest in the workforce that lead it”.

He says: “This is a really important first step from our leadership – putting them in the middle of the change and investing in people to give them time to rethink and retrain.”

A practical way IBM has made this concept a reality is by creating AI solutions to make learning easier.

In fact, in 2016 the average IBM employee spent 31 hours a year learning new skills. In 2024, that figure had almost tripled to 87 hours. Part of this change has been from shifting the approach from ‘it’s nice to learn a new skill’ to ‘it’s actually on the individual – but the company will facilitate it’.

Lester highlights that this approach has played a “big part” in creating new roles that didn’t exist a few years ago, but which “have now evolved in every single part of the organization”.

When I look internally at HR, 80% of the new roles that have emerged are HR people learning completely different skill sets, always based on their core capability, like great employee experience,” Lester reflects.

“We are seeing traditional roles go through this, and we’ll see more roles change with Gen AI.

“But people will evolve into roles that we probably don’t even imagine today, and I think that’s the bit that we have to make sure we, as an organization and as a leadership, are very clear around. There are going to be some great opportunities.”

Integrating LLMs into the workforce

The rise of AI agents will force a rethink of how work is done. Unlike traditional assistants that guide people through predefined processes, agents can deliver task-driven outcomes end-to-end – changing what’s possible.

By implementing AI agents, IBM has tangibly improved its HR processes, for example, through the development of the concept Ask HR – a digital employee support capability. All FAQs and policies were moved to Ask HR, meaning employees could engage through the chat capability to have any questions answered.

Employees can also transact through it. It becomes an open API, so they can link to the underlying systems and do a job transfer or book a day off, for example, simply by chatting to the digital assistant.

As this was traditional AI – natural language processing – IBM has now shifted the assistant to LLMs, meaning it’s evolved from an assistant to an agent.

Now, when an employee prompts Ask HR, an agent will classify what they’re asking for and will route them to a specific domain within the HR content. The domain could be compensation, payroll, or learning.

When this was set, Lester highlighted that they then needed to ensure it was compliant, admitting “we’ve learned that the hard way at times”.

To achieve this, IBM created individual domains, “each with their own LLM”, to get 90% compliance.

“‘Chunking’ your content up into smaller groups enables you to go quicker.

“But the agent at the top then has to understand what you’re asking, to then send you to the right domain with the particular version of the LLM to generate the right answer. That took us a while to set up,” he explains.

Now, HR is split into 27 of these domains, with Lester boasting IBM has “very, very good compliance within the responses”.

Content that is created for AI-ingestion has also been a key learning for Lester and his team.

“When we first tried to ingest our 7,000 policies, only half of them could actually be ingested into a LLM because we hadn’t figured out what makes good content for AI to read,” he shares.

“We have now worked out how to do this and have built a template that all policy documents must follow and these can now be automatically ingested.”

Lester explains that although this is a common issue for teams, it also highlights the conversation around the convergence of HR and IT.

Most content within an organization will never be consumed by a human anymore,” he says. “It will be consumed by an agent.

“You have to therefore shift the way you’re designing your policies and your content for agents to read and ingest it into what we call a vectorized database.”

Finding the right HR levers to pull

By speaking with Lester, it was clear that his one key take away message was: educate yourself. In fact, he believes that it is down to the individual to “understand the art of the possible around what AI can do today.”

He adds: “You’ve got to understand LLMs, you’ve got to be able to engage with them, and you’ve got to be able to start to understand the implications of this on what it is that you do and what you’re a specialist at.”

From here, he advises leaders to “figure out the value that this can bring”. To help IBM employees achieve this, leaders promote the mantra: eliminate, simplify, automate.

This stops employees from “doing work that adds no value”, while “simplifying the rest, and automating a great process” to “build a value case”.

“Start small, but just go for it,” he notes. “Probably one of the biggest things we’ve shifted in IBM is we’re removing the stigma of failure – allowing employees to fail.

Hopefully fail fast and fail cheap, but fail and then learn, iterate, and then succeed hugely.”

Lester also reiterates the importance of implementing agents and Gen AI that is “relevant to the business.”

“Make sure it’s relevant to your function, to you, your team, and to your work, because I think we spend a lot of time doing stuff that doesn’t have any relevance.”

Concluding, Lester highlights the importance of relevancy, as he doesn’t “think every company has that”.

“I don’t think we’ve [IBM] always had relevancy,” he admits. “I think we sometimes try things and realize it was interesting – but not relevant – and continued with it. We’ve then had to learn to stop doing it.

“Having those checks and balances as a leader, in particular an HR leader, is really important to a value case. Everything we’ve done before has enabled us to adapt to agents.”

When HR leaders are faced with a problem, they therefore shouldn’t just “throw the tech at it”, but rather work to “figure out the relevance of the value and the transformation, not just the transference”.

“People just transfer a bad process onto different tech, and they just waste their money,” Lester says.

Understand there are all these levers to pull. If you pull all the levers, you can change work. You can reinvent work, and then you get the relevancy.”",https://www.unleash.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cropped-UNLEASH_Favicon_512x512-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-16 06:00:13.214901

In President Donald Trump’s second term, the United States has continued to pledge disaster aid, albeit at a much lower level than before.
If the United States were to resume its investments in disaster risk reduction, it could keep future such bills as low as possible.
In Central America, droughts, storms, and extreme heat—all exacerbated by climate change—have eroded rural livelihoods and pushed families to leave the region.
Slashing the United States’ international climate-resilience funding and decimating the institutions that deliver it is not fiscal prudence or putting Americans first.","Climate change is an expensive problem. According to the insurance and risk management firm Aon, economic losses from natural disasters worldwide amounted to $313 billion in 2022 and $380 billion in 2023. The World Bank reported in 2019 that in low-income and middle-income countries, weather-related service disruptions and poor maintenance of infrastructure cost households and businesses between $390 billion and $647 billion a year. As global average temperatures continue to rise, the financial services company S&P Global estimates that annual losses from physical climate risks, including extreme weather and sea-level rise, could reach 3.2 to 5.1 percent of world GDP by 2050.

Investment in early warning systems, infrastructure improvements, alternative water storage, and drought-tolerant crops can lessen the pain. The Global Commission on Adaptation, an initiative started by two international policy organizations, has found that every dollar invested in such climate-resilience measures yields between $2 and $10 in avoided losses and economic gains. The World Resources Institute, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization, puts the median yield even higher: a 2025 study of climate-resilience projects in 12 countries around the world found over $10 in benefits for every dollar invested over a ten-year period.

And when the United States invests in climate resilience abroad, it generates benefits at home. For years, Washington has funded such programs through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other federal agencies, making modest investments to mitigate the effects of overseas disasters. This aid has helped keep important supply chains intact and valuable markets open, reduce migration pressures, and prevent China from gaining more ground in developing countries, effectively serving as an inexpensive insurance policy for American prosperity, security, and influence.

The Trump administration has slashed these foreign assistance programs in the name of reducing costs. It cut over 80 percent of USAID’s 6,200-plus grants and contracts, including almost 100 percent of those that have something to do with climate. But Washington’s retreat from international climate-resilience efforts is a false economy. Any initial savings could quickly be erased as disasters worsened by climate change drive price increases, displace people who may show up at U.S. borders, create conditions that criminal and extremist groups exploit, and enable China to expand its footprint—turning a supposed budget cut into a costly mistake.

INVEST NOW

For decades, American leaders have recognized that investments in international development pay for themselves. In 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called for a dramatic increase in spending for foreign assistance to help address local problems before they become crises that would demand U.S. military action. In 2013, Jim Mattis, at the time the general in charge of U.S. Central Command, made the case for international engagement in blunter terms, opining that if the State Department were not funded fully, the U.S. Defense Department would ultimately “need to buy more ammunition.” The 2021 National Intelligence Estimate on Climate Change further underscored the point that climate change creates problems for Washington in the form of geopolitical tensions and instability abroad.

Modest outlays for climate-resilience projects are all the more important as continued greenhouse gas emissions make weather increasingly erratic. According to the Global Commission on Adaptation, just 24 hours of advance warning of a hazardous event can reduce damages by almost 30 percent. An investment of $800 million in early warning systems would avoid $3 billion to $16 billion in losses every year, a double-digit return, in addition to the lives saved. And according to the International Federation of the Red Cross, climate-resilient development could reduce the number of people needing humanitarian assistance because of weather disasters from 100 million in 2019 to 68 million by 2030 and just ten million by 2050.

Under prior administrations, U.S. agencies invested in climate risk reduction programs. In Malawi, for instance, USAID and NASA worked with the central government, as well as regional and local institutions, between 2019 and 2021 to strengthen an early warning system for floods. The U.S. agencies helped integrate satellite data into an existing UN-supported system that used sensors to monitor river levels upstream of flood-prone areas. After the updates, what had once provided only a few hours’ notice of a flood gave up to two weeks’ advance warning. When Tropical Storm Ana and Cyclone Gombe struck in 2022, local authorities were able to send text-message alerts to vulnerable communities three to four days in advance. According to the Malawian government, the early preparations enabled by those warnings prevented $40 million in losses. The American taxpayer supplied less than $100,000 for the technology transfer to set up this system and less than $1 million a year to operate a regional hub staffed by local hydrometeorologists.

Economic losses from natural disasters worldwide amounted to $380 billion in 2023.

A similar effort in Central America also yielded large payoffs. After Hurricane Mitch, a Category 5 storm, killed 10,000 people in 1998 in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, USAID, NASA, and other government agencies helped create a regional flood monitoring network. NASA provided real-time monitoring of floods and forecasting of floodwater movement within 24 hours of rainfall. Hydroelectric dam operators in Honduras used this information to manage the release of dammed water to prevent flooding downstream. When Hurricanes Eta and Iota—both Category 4 storms—hit in 2020, the system was credited with a dramatic reduction in loss of life. The Red Cross was also able to use the flood information to inform rescue efforts in places where the organization had no previous experience, and fatalities across Central America totaled fewer than 250.

Early warning systems are particularly vital in places where disasters have become routine. In Bangladesh, where much of the land sits barely above sea level and is covered with a lattice of rivers, climate change has made flooding more frequent and intense. The U.S. government invested in early warning systems designed to help local authorities incorporate satellite data into their forecasting systems, and in 2022, USAID and NASA provided timely and location-specific weather advisories to 250,000 farmers across the country. Those advisories can determine whether a family harvests a crop before disaster strikes or loses it to rising waters. A 2023 USAID study estimated that the agency’s climate information saved these Bangladeshi farmers an average of $467 each, a significant amount in a country where the average annual income is below $3,000.

International climate assistance delivers the most immediate benefit in lives saved and economic losses avoided in the countries where disasters occur, but the United States saves money, too. For one, investments in climate resilience reduce demand for humanitarian aid. In President Donald Trump’s second term, the United States has continued to pledge disaster aid, albeit at a much lower level than before. After the Category 5 storm Hurricane Melissa hit Jamaica, the Bahamas, Cuba, and Haiti, for example, Washington announced millions in direct aid to the countries affected. In December 2025, the administration also announced a $2 billion pledge for delivery of humanitarian assistance through the UN. If the United States were to resume its investments in disaster risk reduction, it could keep future such bills as low as possible.

SAVE LATER

International climate-resilience efforts offer secondary savings for the United States, too. These programs help keep farmers who lose their harvest because of climate change from switching to illicit crops such as coca, which can end up in drugs destined for the U.S. market. They also help people preserve their livelihoods, making it less likely they will have to leave home after a disaster and try to migrate to other countries, including the United States.

In Central America, droughts, storms, and extreme heat—all exacerbated by climate change—have eroded rural livelihoods and pushed families to leave the region. A 2023 study in Scientific Reports found that droughts during the growing seasons in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras between 2012 and 2018 coincided with a 71 percent rise in emigration to the United States. According to the Inter-American Development Bank, extreme heat was a particularly strong predictor of migration for Salvadoran farm families, and households lacking access to credit were three times more likely to migrate under these drought and heat conditions.

Investment in climate-resilient agriculture reduces these pressures. Through Feed the Future, a bipartisan initiative to fight global hunger, poverty, and malnutrition that operated from 2010 to 2025 across 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, USAID supported the adoption of drought- and disease-tolerant crops, efficient irrigation, and animal and plant disease prevention. In Honduras, USAID worked to address coffee rust—a plant disease exacerbated by warmer, wetter weather that can cause crop loss, which in turn can motivate a farmer to migrate—and helped 16,000 farm families and agribusinesses adopt technologies to increase harvests in 2021. That same year, in Guatemala, USAID created 30,000 jobs across the food value chain, generated $76 million in agricultural sales, and drove an additional $10 million in public and private financing into its projects. Across all its programs, Feed the Future helped 34 million people in 2024 alone to improve agricultural practices, access financing, and reduce their farms’ climate risk, giving them less reason to leave home in search of better conditions.

Investments in international development pay for themselves.

Other Feed the Future projects benefited the United States in various ways. In 2021, for instance, USAID worked with the Department of Agriculture to stop the transmission of African Swine Fever, a highly contagious disease whose geographic spread is increasing with rising temperatures, among pigs in Hispaniola. Those efforts were pivotal in preventing transmission to pigs in the United States, where the outbreak threatened the multibillion-dollar domestic pork industry. Working with American companies, USAID also helped ensure that, even as climate change affects their crops, farmers abroad can continue to supply Americans with foods that cannot be grown in the United States, such as coffee, avocados, certain spices, cocoa, vanilla, and tropical fruits.

Many sub-Saharan countries are suffering major agricultural losses caused by climate change, making international trade in staples such as maize, wheat, and rice more volatile. In 2023, USAID and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation worked with more than 80 African seed companies to distribute drought-resistant seeds to seven million farming families cultivating 20 million acres. The seeds boosted crop yields by an average 25 percent, cut food costs for about 44 million people, and added around $1.5 billion to the African continent’s GDP in one year. Farmers who also adopted climate-resilient techniques such as precision irrigation and cover crops saw their incomes rise by more than 20 percent. This kind of protection for agricultural markets can reduce food price shocks, which can lead to political unrest, food insecurity, and ultimately migration.

Foreign assistance in climate resilience also helps reduce opportunities for terrorist organizations and other criminal elements to recruit. Armed insurgents find it easier to enlist new members when harvests fail and livelihoods vanish. In the Sahel, al-Qaeda affiliates and Islamic State (or ISIS) militants prey on communities that lose their farms to drought. Reducing the damage of extreme weather can stem extremist recruitment and criminal activities such as human trafficking. In 2021 and 2022, USAID worked with the World Food Program and ARC Replica, an insurance initiative launched by the African Union agency African Risk Capacity, to help the governments of Mali and Burkina Faso purchase drought insurance policies. When devastating droughts happened in 2022 and 2023, those policies triggered payouts of $15 million to affected farmers in Mali and $7 million in Burkina Faso, supporting more than 434,000 people. For less than $1 million out of USAID’s budget each year, the program likely helped protect people in the region from criminal groups that feed on hunger and despair.

Similar preventive investments have paid dividends in the Middle East. In Basra, the economic hub of southern Iraq, years of rising temperatures and declining water quality fueled public anger and sparked violent protests, including riots in 2018 that shut down much of the city. USAID stepped in to equip the Basra Water Management Committee with data systems and training to track salinity, manage resources, and improve water distribution. The result was better access to clean water, greater agricultural productivity, and fewer local conflicts—all for less than $1 million. Resilience efforts such as this can bolster fragile states and reduce the need for humanitarian intervention. A few million dollars spent early can help the United States avoid spending hundreds of millions later when state failure may require emergency relief, a counterterrorism response, and refugee assistance.

BILLS COME DUE

Just because the United States has cut its climate programs does not mean all international adaptation efforts have ceased. In many cases, China has stepped in, spending the past few months positioning itself as the provider of choice for early warning systems and climate information. Across Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific, Beijing is promoting solar farms, dams, and other projects under the banner of “South-South cooperation.” Such efforts are sorely needed, but when they are driven by China, they come with costs. Many of these projects include predatory lending conditions, contributing to soaring sovereign debt in developing countries and hampering long-term economic growth. With more debt to service, these countries have less money to spend on education, food subsidies, and fresh water supplies—all of which help prevent conflict.

And while Beijing’s offers of climate assistance make China an indispensable partner, Washington’s withdrawal makes it appear apathetic and unreliable. USAID spent more than $2 million on climate resilience in Mongolia in 2022; in March 2025, after Trump shuttered USAID, China launched a climate-resilience project in the country in cooperation with the International Federation of the Red Cross. The result is that in Mongolia, whose large copper deposits give it outsized geopolitical and economic heft, China has gained clout and the United States has lost it. Influence follows investment, and soft power tends to accrue to those offering solutions.

Slashing the United States’ international climate-resilience funding and decimating the institutions that deliver it is not fiscal prudence or putting Americans first. The small savings it produces are only temporary. The costs of these cuts will resurface both at home and abroad, be it in supply chain disruptions, migratory pressures, heightened security threats, higher disaster-response bills, or reduced diplomatic options as China binds other countries more tightly into its sphere of influence. The smarter course is to invest now—in the early warning systems that save lives, the seeds that secure harvests, the insurance that cushions shocks, and the diplomatic partnerships that keep countries stable and open to U.S. global leadership.",https://cdn-live.foreignaffairs.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2026/01/14/2020-12-11T181132Z_599950467_RC26LK989HVS_RTRMADP_3_STORMS-HONDURAS.jpg?itok=B9wraZHt,N,,2026-01-16 07:00:39.107374

The last two weeks brought encouraging momentum for the industry, from record-breaking capital raises around JPM to Massachusetts leading the nation on patient access reforms. While policy challenges from Washington persist (we’ll have more to say about the White House announcement just hours ago), I’ll be heading to DC next week for conversations on the industry’s challenges and opportunities. We remain committed to advocating for policies that support innovation and ensure patients can access the breakthrough treatments our industry develops.

JPM 2026: The 2026 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, held in San Francisco, CA, opened with renewed momentum in biotech capital markets, with companies raising $4.9 billion in the week leading up to the event, including $2.6 billion in public offerings, making this the strongest start to the year on record, and $2.29 billion in private rounds. MassBio was in San Francisco for the week, hosting events and connecting with members.

Massachusetts life sciences companies made significant announcements, demonstrating the state’s continued leadership in healthcare innovation. Charles River Laboratories unveiled two strategic acquisitions totaling over $500 million to strengthen its non-human primate supply chain and biopharmaceutical testing capabilities. Additionally, Biogen showcased a revitalized pipeline focused on neuroscience and rare disease, while Boston Scientific highlighted explosive growth, projecting 15% annual growth for at least another three years.

Beyond corporate presentations, the conference also spotlighted broader regulatory concerns as former FDA official Richard Pazdur warned that the firewall between political appointees and drug reviewers has been breached, raising questions about transparency in the agency’s new voucher program that could impact the approval pathway for drugs being developed across the country.

Prior Authorization Reforms: Governor Healey announced nation-leading reforms to streamline prior authorization processes, making it faster and easier for Massachusetts patients to access the medications they need. The new regulations will reduce administrative barriers that delay care, ensuring patients can get timely access to the innovative treatments developed by the Commonwealth’s life sciences industry. I’m honored to have been appointed to the Governor’s Working Group on healthcare cost reduction, where we’ll work to find creative solutions that balance affordability with patient access to breakthrough therapies.

Pharma Tariffs and MFN Update: According to a new “Letter of Agreement”, the Department of Commerce appears to have concluded its Section 232 investigation into pharmaceutical imports. The document outlines the latest framework for MFN drug pricing deals and recent momentum in onshoring. According to the law, President Trump has 90 days to decide whether to act based on the report’s findings, so we can expect to see such actions within the next few months.

FDA Issues Guidance on Modernizing Statistical Methods for Clinical Trials: The FDA published draft guidance to facilitate the use of Bayesian methodologies in clinical trials for drugs and biologics. The agency emphasized that Bayesian approaches, which combine current trial data with relevant prior information, can help reduce development costs and timelines while maintaining rigorous safety and efficacy standards. According to FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, providing clarity on these modern statistical methods will help sponsors bring more treatments to patients faster and more affordably.

2026 Health Package Outlook: Congress continues to debate a healthcare package, with some members intent on reviving bipartisan priorities. The current focus of the package includes PBM reform and increased control on Medicare outpatient spending, along with renewing existing programs, such as telehealth options and community health centers. Senate Finance Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-OR) recently referenced the 26-0 Committee vote in favor of PBM overhaul in 2023, and feels upbeat about getting it over the finish line, Meanwhile, Senate Finance Chairman Mike Crapo (R-ID) noted “broad support here and at the White House” for the PBM bill, which would “delink” the price of a drug from PBM compensation in Medicare Part D. Extension of ACA subsidies are likely to be excluded from any such legislation.

NSCEB Releases New Biotech Regulatory Recommendations: The National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology (NSCEB) released new analysis and 83 policy options to modernize and accelerate U.S. regulatory review of biotechnology products across medical, plant, microorganism, and animal sectors. Across the 22 medical recommendations, there is an emphasis on predictability and transparency to ensure faster clinical trials and promote more efficient manufacturing.

MPS lifted by rumours of UniCredit taking Delfin's stake

Contacts on the matter took place before Christmas, sources said

UniCredit dismissed any prospects of a deal on Thursday

Delfin says it acts in country's best interest, MPS doing well

MILAN, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Delfin on Friday ruled out ongoing talks to sell its Monte dei Paschi stake, closing ranks around CEO Luigi Lovaglio as speculation over a potential approach from UniCredit (CRDI.MI), opens new tab for the bank drives shares higher.

Speculation over Delfin's intentions has mounted in recent weeks after MPS's takeover of Mediobanca turned it into a pivotal investor in insurer Generali (GASI.MI), opens new tab, a financial heavyweight whose ownership is watched closely in Rome and by Italy's largest banks.

The Week in Breakingviews newsletter offers insights and ideas from Reuters' global financial commentary team. Sign up here.

Delfin, owned in equal parts by the eight heirs of late Ray-Ban billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio, said it was not currently in talks with UniCredit or others to sell all, or part, of the MPS stake.

Shares in MPS have gained recently, lifted by analysts' studies about a potential combination with UniCredit, following press reports about the latter looking to buy Delfin's stake.

With a 17.5% stake, Delfin is the main shareholder in MPS, which last year acquired bigger rival Mediobanca in hectic consolidation in Italian banking.

EXECUTIVES HELD END-OF-YEAR DISCUSSIONS

Sources have told Reuters there had been contacts before Christmas between UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel and Delfin Chairman Francesco Milleri over UniCredit's potential interest in the stakes Delfin holds in MPS and Generali.

UniCredit on Thursday dismissed as ""pure invention"" at present the idea it could buy Delfin's MPS stake, adding it constantly analysed potential targets and sometimes held discussions with them but that did not necessarily lead to a transaction.

MPS CEO Lovaglio, hired by Italy's Treasury in 2022 to turn the bank around, is now fighting to secure another term in April.

Italy rescued MPS in 2017 acquiring a 68% stake which it has since cut below 5%, lastly by bringing onboard Delfin and other domestic investors as shareholders.

Delfin said it was a long-term financial investor aiming to create the most value both for its shareholders and the country as a whole.

""As such, also in light of an overall performance in line with goals relating to profitability and extracting value from the stakes it holds, Delfin renews its full support for MPS top management and the bank's strengthening path,"" it said.

That suggests investors are starting to reassess whether software companies can defend their pricing power as AI capabilities expand, RBC noted.
""While headline risk is not new (we saw announcements from OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
An April report from AlixPartners found that roughly 100 software companies were being ""squeezed"" by AI-driven competition.
The analysts warned that the AI overhang on software ""may remain"" and ""could spread"" as Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google accelerate their pace of announcements.","Last fall, OpenAI sent shockwaves through the software industry. Now, Anthropic is doing the same.

A new wave of announcements from Anthropic this week revived fears that generative AI could undermine the economics of traditional software companies.

In a research note published Wednesday, analysts at RBC Capital Markets said a flurry of recent product launches from Anthropic, including new AI tools for productivity and healthcare, has coincided with a broad selloff across the software sector and could deepen concerns that AI is becoming a competitive threat rather than a tailwind.

On Sunday, Anthropic rolled out Claude for Healthcare & Life Sciences, which includes HIPAA-ready enterprise tools. The next day, it unveiled Claude Cowork, an AI agent that handles document generation and file management. And then on Tuesday, it announced the expansion of Labs, an internal incubator team that tests and showcases experimental AI products.

Shares of Salesforce, Workday, Intuit, and Snowflake fell sharply after this barrage of news, losing between 6% and 13%. That suggests investors are starting to reassess whether software companies can defend their pricing power as AI capabilities expand, RBC noted.

""While headline risk is not new (we saw announcements from OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. cause material intra-day swings in stock prices throughout 2025), we believe the velocity of innovation and announcements from the model providers could continue to weigh on the broader software landscape throughout 2026,"" RBC analysts wrote.

No longer ""AI-proof""

For years, SaaS companies have justified recurring subscription fees by packaging productivity features, analytics, automation, and domain expertise into proprietary tools. But AI threatens to flatten that value proposition by turning many of those features into on-demand capabilities accessible through a single interface.

The anxiety isn't new. Last year, OpenAI triggered a similar sell-off after demonstrating a suite of internal workplace tools built on top of its models. An April report from AlixPartners found that roughly 100 software companies were being ""squeezed"" by AI-driven competition.

Perhaps most concerning for investors is that AI's reach now appears to be extending into vertical software, an area long viewed as relatively insulated because of regulatory complexity and domain expertise.

RBC analysts said Anthropic's healthcare-focused tools suggest that assumption may no longer hold. By integrating directly with industry databases such as PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov, and by offering specialized agent skills tailored to medical workflows, AI providers are beginning to encroach on niches historically served by specialized vendors.

""We've viewed vertical software as one pocket of software that is likely to be viewed as 'AI-proof' (for now), given the deep domain, regulatory nuance, and workflow expertise required to be successful,"" RBC's note stated. ""That said, recently announced Claude for Healthcare & Life Sciences suggests the AI bear narrative contagion could spread to some vertical names, and they may prove to be less defensive (at least from a multiple perspective) than originally thought.""

Continuing its acquisition streak, Marlborough-based medical device manufacturer Boston Scientific has entered into an agreement to purchase Penumbra, a California-based healthcare company, to the tune of $14.5 billion. Penumbra develops and manufactures medical devices to treat blood flow and clot complications caused by heart and blood vessel disorders, including strokes, heart attacks, and aneurysms, according to a Thursday press release from Boston Scientific. ""Penumbra is a well-established company with an experienced, high-performing team, and this acquisition offers Boston Scientific an opportunity to enter new, fast-growing segments within the vascular space,"" Mike Mahoney, Boston Scientific chairman and CEO, said in the release. Penumbra’s products assist in blood clot removals and the control of hemorrhaging, such as catheters and coils. “The addition of Penumbra can expand access for these novel technologies to more patients and customers around the world, further enhancing our revenue and margins over time with proven offerings that have a history of growth and innovation,” Mahoney said in the release. Boston Scientific will acquire Penumbra for $374 per share through both cash and company stock, totalling the $14.5-billion purchase price. The manufacturer anticipates financing approximately $11 billion in cash. Once the transaction is completed, Adam Elsesser, Penumbra's chairman and CEO, will join Boston Scientific’s board of directors. The acquisition is expected to be finalized this year. ""Our decades-long development of therapies for challenging medical conditions has focused on deep innovation for complex diseases so that we can offer physicians novel solutions to transform patient care,"" Elsesser said in the release. ""I am grateful for the amazing people who have contributed to this work and look forward to uniting our efforts and shared values as we come together with Boston Scientific."" Boston Scientific is using A&O Shearman, with an office in Boston, and Washington D.C.-based Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP as legal advisors in the transaction. Penumbra is using Perella Weinberg Partners as financial advisor and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP as legal advisor. Both are based in New York City. Boston Scientific’s most recent purchase agreement comes just days after the manufacturer announced it would acquire Valencia Technologies, a California-based company specializing in the treatment of bladder dysfunction.

The New York-based carrier didn't specify what caused Wednesday's disruptions, but confirmed that it was resolved by 10:20 p.m. EST. Verizon previously said it had deployed its engineering teams to address ""an issue impacting wireless voice and data services.""

""Today, we let many of our customers down and for that, we are truly sorry,"" Verizon wrote in updates shared on social media. A spokesperson later added that the company would give those affected a $20 account credit through Verizon's app, which on average ""covers multiple days of service,"" and directly contact its business customers with compensation.

Online data tracker Downdetector showed that Verizon customers began to report issues with their service around 11 A.M. CDT on Wednesday. Reports appeared to peak in the early afternoon, but remained elevated later in the day. Downdetector said it had received a total of over 1.5 million reports before 4 p.m.

Impacted users said their phones were in ""SOS"" mode or had other no signal messages. In cities like New York, alerts warned that the outage may disrupt 911 calls -- urging residents to try landlines and devices from other carriers, if available, or visit a local police or fire station in-person in case of an emergency.

Other major hubs impacted by Verizon's failure included Houston, Philadelphia, Dallas and Miami, per Downdetector. But many consumers across the country said they experienced disruptions.

A handful of outage reports for other carriers also bubbled up on Wednesday -- but companies like T-Mobile and AT&T quickly confirmed online that their services were operating normally. Both suggested that their customers may have encountered issues contacting people with Verizon's service, however.

When cellular outages happen, some phone companies also urge consumers to try to connect to Wi-Fi and use internet calling.

When two different models, such as the RTX 5060 8GB and RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, share the same memory capacity, the higher-tier model (the RTX 5060 Ti) will be prioritized for supply.
Similarly, if the RTX 5060 Ti, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5080 are all 16GB models, the highest-tier model among them, the RTX 5080, will receive supply priority.
Regarding the top-tier GeForce RTX 5090 and GeForce RTX 5090 D v2, these models are not subject to this specific prioritization mechanism.
This implies that NVIDIA intends to streamline its SKU lineup, concentrating its main supply on the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, RTX 5080, RTX 5090 D v2, and RTX 5090.","RTX 50 series allocation prioritization is in place, here’s how it works

We have an update on a recent rumor from Board Channels. The claim was that NVIDIA is prioritizing RTX 50 cards with 8GB memory. That appears partially true, but only for one tier of the lineup.

HKEPC reached out to its sources and says a board-partner allocation prioritization scheme is in place, but it works differently. In short, NVIDIA is reducing the number of SKUs board partners can choose from. The prioritization is not based on GPU class. It is based on memory capacity.

NVIDIA’s new RTX 50 GPU memory class prioritizations

8GB: RTX 5060, RTX 5060 Ti

12GB: RTX 5070 (undecided yet)

16GB: RTX 5060 Ti, RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5080

24GB: RTX 5090D V2

32GB: RTX 5090/D (treated as one SKU)

As we read it, if three RTX 50 cards share the same memory capacity, NVIDIA prioritizes the highest SKU. For example, among 16GB models, NVIDIA has RTX 5060 Ti, 5070 Ti, and 5080 SKUs, and the 5080 allocation would be prioritized. Since the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is now said to be deprioritized, the RTX 5060 Ti focus would shift to the 8GB model, which is likely where the first report came from.

NVIDIA is not making any prioritization changes for the RTX 5090, 5090D, or 5090D V2 yet. These are also the most expensive models, and look to be the easiest to find in stock, despite the sharp price increases. The RTX 5070 is not yet decided, it’s the only desktop model with this memory configuration.

The report doesn’t mention laptop SKUS at all, so from our understanding, this allocation does not affect this market segment yet.

HKEPC posts explains everything in detail:

If a model like the RTX 5060 Ti has both 8GB and 16GB versions, NVIDIA will focus on supplying the 8GB version.

When two different models, such as the RTX 5060 8GB and RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, share the same memory capacity, the higher-tier model (the RTX 5060 Ti) will be prioritized for supply.

Similarly, if the RTX 5060 Ti, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5080 are all 16GB models, the highest-tier model among them, the RTX 5080, will receive supply priority.

The AIC partner also disclosed that it has not yet been decided whether the RTX 5070 12GB will have to “make way,” meaning its memory allocation could be redirected to the higher-end RTX 5080.

Regarding the top-tier GeForce RTX 5090 and GeForce RTX 5090 D v2, these models are not subject to this specific prioritization mechanism. However, due to the general memory shortage, their supply volume will inevitably be affected.

This implies that NVIDIA intends to streamline its SKU lineup, concentrating its main supply on the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, RTX 5080, RTX 5090 D v2, and RTX 5090. The supply for other models will be significantly reduced.

We will see if this means there will be more RTX 5060 Ti 8GB and RTX 5080 on the market moving forward.

Digital S&P 500® Index-Linked Global Medium-Term Notes, Series A, due

The notes will not bear interest. The amount that you will be paid on your notes on the stated maturity date (expected to be the second scheduled business day after the determination date) is based on the performance of the S&P 500® Index (which we refer to as the underlier) as measured from and including the trade date to and including the determination date (expected to be between 15 and 17 months after the trade date). If the final underlier level on the determination date is greater than or equal to 80.00% of the initial underlier level (set on the trade date and is expected to be the closing level of the underlier on the trade date), you will receive the maximum settlement amount, which is expected to be the threshold settlement amount (expected to be between $1,065.60 and $1,077.10 for each $1,000 face amount of your notes). If the final underlier level is less than 80.00% of the initial underlier level, the return on your notes will be negative.

You could lose your entire investment in the notes. Any payment on the notes, including any repayment of principal, is not guaranteed by any third party and is subject to (a) the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC and (b) the risk of exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power (as described on page PS-3 of this pricing supplement) by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

To determine your payment at maturity, we will calculate the underlier return, which is the percentage increase or decrease in the final underlier level from the initial underlier level. On the stated maturity date, for each $1,000 face amount of your notes, you will receive an amount in cash equal to:

·if the underlier return is greater than or equal to -20.00% (the final underlier level is greater than or equal to 80.00% of the initial underlier level), the maximum settlement amount; or

·if the underlier return is negative and is below -20.00% (the final underlier level is less than the initial underlier level by more than 20.00%), the sum of (i) $1,000 plus (ii) the product of (a) $1,000 times (b) 1.25 times (c) the sum of the underlier return plus 20.00% (in which case you will receive less than $1,000).

Because we have provided only a brief summary of the terms of your notes above, you should read the detailed description of the terms of the notes found in “Summary Information” on page PS-2 in this pricing supplement.

Your investment in the notes involves certain risks, including among other things, our credit risk and the risk of exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page S-9 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes” beginning on page PS-13 of this pricing supplement so that you may better understand those risks.

Pricing Supplement dated January , 2026

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES

The final terms for the notes will be determined on the date the notes are initially priced for sale to the public (the “trade date”) based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the trade date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement.

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables, such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the trade date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the notes might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the notes on the trade date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the notes and our estimated value of the notes is expected to result from several factors, including any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the notes. These other costs will include a fee paid to iCapital Markets LLC, an electronic platform in which an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, who is acting as a dealer in connection with the distribution of the notes, holds an indirect minority equity interest, for services it is providing in connection with this offering.

Our estimated value on the trade date is not a prediction of the price at which the notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another

PS- 2

affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the trade date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the trade date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the initial issue date of the notes because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes and other costs in connection with the notes that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the notes. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial issue date of the notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes” on page PS-13 of this pricing supplement.

You may revoke your offer to purchase the notes at any time prior to the trade date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the notes prior to their trade date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.

CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the notes), by acquiring the notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the notes may have at law if

PS- 3

and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Purchase at amount other than face amount: the amount we will pay you at the stated maturity date for your notes will not be adjusted based on the issue price you pay for your notes, so if you acquire notes at a premium (or discount) to face amount and hold them to the stated maturity date, it could affect your investment in a number of ways. The return on your investment in such notes will be lower (or higher) than it would have been had you purchased the notes at face amount. Also, the stated threshold level would not offer the same measure of protection to your investment as would be the case if you had purchased the notes at face amount. See “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes—Risks Relating to the Notes Generally—If You Purchase Your Notes at a Premium to Face Amount, the Return on Your Investment Will Be Lower Than the Return on Notes Purchased at Face Amount or a Discount and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will Be Negatively Affected” on page PS-13 of this pricing supplement.

Cash settlement amount (on the stated maturity date): for each $1,000 face amount of your notes, we will pay you on the stated maturity date an amount in cash equal to:

·if the final underlier level is greater than or equal to the threshold level, the threshold settlement amount; or

·if the final underlier level is less than the threshold level, the sum of (1) $1,000 plus (2) the product of (i) $1,000 times (ii) the buffer rate times (iii) the sum of the underlier return plus the threshold amount (in which case you will receive less than $1,000).

Any payment on the notes, including any repayment of principal, is not guaranteed by any third party and is subject to (a) the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC, and (b) the risk of exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Initial underlier level (to be set on the trade date): , the closing level of the underlier on the trade date

Final underlier level: the closing level of the underlier on the determination date, subject to adjustment in limited circumstances as provided under “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-91 of the accompanying prospectus supplement; and subject to market disruption events and non-trading days as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Equity Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-87 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

PS- 4

Underlier return: the quotient of (1) the final underlier level minus the initial underlier level divided by (2) the initial underlier level, expressed as a percentage

Threshold level: 80.00% of the initial underlier level

Threshold amount: 20.00%

Threshold settlement amount (to be set on the trade date): expected to be between $1,065.60 and $1,077.10

Cap level (to be set on the trade date): expected to be between 106.56% and 107.71% of the initial underlier level

Maximum settlement amount (to be set on the trade date): expected to be the threshold settlement amount

Trade date:

Original issue date (settlement date): expected to be three scheduled business days following the trade date

For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the determination date be postponed by more than five trading days.

Stated maturity date (to be set on the trade date): a specified date that is expected to be the second scheduled business day after the determination date. The maturity date will be postponed if the determination date is postponed due to the occurrence or continuance of a market disruption event or a non-trading day on the determination date. In such a case, the maturity date will be postponed by the same number of business days from but excluding the originally scheduled determination date to and including the actual determination date. The maturity date will also be postponed if that date is not a business day. See “Terms of the Notes—Payment Dates” on page S-46 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and “Reference Assets—Indices—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Equity Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-87 of the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Closing level: as provided on page S-86 of the accompanying prospectus supplement. The closing level of the underlier reported on the Bloomberg Professional® service (“Bloomberg”) page may be lower or higher than the official closing level of the underlier published by the underlier sponsor. In certain circumstances, the closing level of the underlier will be based on the alternate calculation of the underlier described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-91 of the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Business day: as defined under “Terms of the Notes—Business Day” on page S-47 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

PS- 5

Use of proceeds and hedging: as described under “Use of Proceeds and Hedging” on page S-115 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

Tax consequences: you should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion, when read in combination with those sections, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the notes.

Based on current market conditions, in the opinion of our special tax counsel, it is reasonable to treat the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with respect to the underlier. Assuming this treatment is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the notes (including redemption at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the notes. This gain or loss on your notes should be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if you hold your notes for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of notes at the original issue price. However, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may not respect this treatment, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the notes could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the “constructive ownership” regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the notes.

ERISA: as described under “Benefit Plan Investor Considerations” on page S-101 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

Supplemental plan of distribution: we will agree to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “agent”), and the agent will agree to purchase from us, the face amount of the notes at the price specified on the cover of this pricing supplement. The agent will commit to take and pay for all of the notes, if any are taken. The agent proposes initially to offer the notes to the public at the initial issue price set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement, and to certain unaffiliated securities dealers at that price less a concession not in excess of 0.92% of the face amount.

PS- 6

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment for the notes on the original issue date, which is more than one business day following the trade date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on any date prior to one business day before delivery will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement and should consult their own advisor.

We have been advised by Barclays Capital Inc. that it intends to make a market in the notes. However, neither Barclays Capital Inc. nor any of our affiliates that makes a market is obligated to do so and any of them may stop doing so at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity or trading market for the notes.

Calculation agent: Barclays Bank PLC

CUSIP no.: 06749FCX5

ISIN no.: US06749FCX50

Conflicts of interest: Barclays Capital Inc. is an affiliate of Barclays Bank PLC and, as such, has a “conflict of interest” in this offering within the meaning of Rule 5121 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. Consequently, the offering is being conducted in compliance with the provisions of Rule 5121. Barclays Capital Inc. is not permitted to sell notes in this offering to an account over which it exercises discretionary authority without the prior specific written approval of the account holder.

FDIC: the notes are not bank deposits and are not insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) or any other governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES

The following table and chart are provided for purposes of illustration only. They should not be taken as an indication or prediction of future investment results and are intended merely to illustrate the impact that the various hypothetical closing levels on the determination date could have on the cash settlement amount at maturity assuming all other variables remain constant.

The examples below are based on a range of final underlier levels that are entirely hypothetical; no one can predict what the closing level will be on any day throughout the term of your notes, and no one can predict what the final underlier level will be on the determination date. The underlier has been highly volatile in the past—meaning that the closing level has changed considerably in relatively short periods—and its performance cannot be predicted for any future period.

The information in the following examples reflects hypothetical rates of return on the notes assuming that they are purchased on the original issue date at the face amount and held to the stated maturity date. If you sell your notes in a secondary market prior to the stated maturity date, your return will depend upon the market value of your notes at the time of sale, which may be affected by a number of factors that are not reflected in the table below, such as interest rates, the volatility of the underlier and our creditworthiness. In addition, assuming no changes in market conditions or our creditworthiness and any other relevant factors, the value of your notes on the trade date will, and the price you may receive for your notes may, be significantly less than the initial issue price. For more information on the value of your notes in the secondary market, see “Risk Factors” on page S-9 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes—Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market—The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if Any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, if Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May Be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes” on page PS-17 of this pricing supplement. The information in the table also reflects the key hypothetical terms and assumptions in the following box.

Key Hypothetical Terms and Assumptions Face amount $1,000 Cap level 106.56% of the initial underlier level Threshold settlement amount $1,065.60 Threshold level 80.00% of the initial underlier level Buffer rate 125.00% Threshold amount 20.00% Neither a market disruption event nor a non-trading day occurs on the originally scheduled determination date No change in or affecting any of the underlier stocks or the method by which the underlier sponsor calculates the underlier Notes purchased on original issue date for the initial issue price noted on the cover page of this pricing supplement and held to the stated maturity date

Moreover, we have not yet set the initial underlier level that will serve as the baseline for determining the underlier return and the amount that we will pay on your notes, if any, at maturity. We will not do so until the trade date. As a result, the actual initial underlier level may differ substantially from the closing level of the underlier prior to the trade date.

For these reasons, the actual performance of the underlier over the term of your notes, as well as the amount payable at maturity, if any, may bear little relation to the hypothetical examples shown below or to the historical closing levels of the underlier shown elsewhere in this pricing supplement. For information about the historical closing levels of the underlier during recent periods, see “The Underlier—Historical Closing Levels of the Underlier” below. Before investing in the notes, you should consult publicly available information to determine the levels of the underlier between the date of this pricing supplement and the date of your purchase of the notes.

PS- 10

Also, the hypothetical examples shown below do not take into account the effects of applicable taxes. Because of the U.S. tax treatment applicable to your notes, tax liabilities could affect the after-tax rate of return on your notes to a comparatively greater extent than the after-tax return on the underlier stocks.

The levels in the left column of the table below represent hypothetical final underlier levels and are expressed as percentages of the initial underlier level. The amounts in the right column represent the hypothetical cash settlement amounts, each based on the corresponding hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level), and are expressed as percentages of the face amount of a note (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of a percent). Thus, a hypothetical cash settlement amount of 100.000% means that the value of the cash payment that we would deliver for each $1,000 of the outstanding face amount of the notes on the stated maturity date would equal 100.000% of the face amount of a note, based on the corresponding hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) and the assumptions noted above.

Hypothetical Final Underlier Level

(as Percentage of Initial Underlier Level) Hypothetical Cash Settlement Amount

(as Percentage of Face Amount) 150.000% 106.560% 140.000% 106.560% 130.000% 106.560% 120.000% 106.560% 110.000% 106.560% 106.560% 106.560% 105.000% 106.560% 102.500% 106.560% 100.000% 106.560% 95.000% 106.560% 90.000% 106.560% 80.000% 106.560% 79.999% 99.999% 75.000% 93.750% 50.000% 62.500% 25.000% 31.250% 0.000% 0.000%

If, for example, the final underlier level were determined to be 25.000% of the initial underlier level, the cash settlement amount that we would deliver on your notes at maturity would be 31.250% of the face amount of your notes, as shown in the table above. As a result, if you purchased your notes on the original issue date at the face amount and held them to the stated maturity date, you would lose 68.750% of your investment (if you purchased your notes at a premium to face amount, you would lose a correspondingly higher percentage of your investment). In addition, if the final underlier level were determined to be 80.000% or more of the initial underlier level, the cash settlement amount that we would deliver on your notes at maturity would be limited to the threshold settlement amount, or 106.560% of each $1,000 face amount of your notes, as shown in the table above. As a result, if you purchased your notes on the original issue date and held them to the stated maturity date, you would not receive more than the threshold settlement amount for each $1,000 face amount of your notes, regardless of the extent to which the final underlier level may be greater than 80.000% of the initial underlier level.

The following chart also shows a graphical illustration of the hypothetical cash settlement amounts (expressed as a percentage of the face amount of your notes) that we would pay on your notes on the stated maturity date, if the final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) were any of the hypothetical levels shown on the horizontal axis. The chart shows that any hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) of less than 80.000% (the section left of the 80.000% marker on the horizontal axis) would result in a hypothetical cash settlement amount of less than 100.000% of the face amount of your notes (the section below the 100.000% marker on the vertical axis) and, accordingly, in a loss of principal to the holder of the notes. The chart also shows that any hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level)

PS- 11

of greater than or equal to 80.000% (the section right of the 80.000% marker on the horizontal axis) would result in a capped return on your investment.

The cash settlement amounts shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on closing levels for the underlier that may not be achieved on the determination date and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your notes on the stated maturity date or at any other time, including any time you may wish to sell your notes, may bear little relation to the hypothetical cash settlement amounts shown above, and these amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the notes. The hypothetical cash settlement amounts on notes held to the stated maturity date in the examples above assume you purchased your notes at their face amount and have not been adjusted to reflect the actual issue price you pay for your notes. The return on your investment (whether positive or negative) in your notes will be affected by the amount you pay for your notes. If you purchase your notes for a price other than the face amount, the return on your investment will differ from, and may be significantly lower than, the hypothetical returns suggested by the above examples.

Please read “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes—Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market—Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of Your Notes” on page PS-16 of this pricing supplement.

We cannot predict the actual final underlier level or what the market value of your notes will be on any particular trading day, nor can we predict the relationship between the closing level of the underlier and the market value of your notes at any time prior to the stated maturity date. The actual amount that you will receive, if any, at maturity and the rate of return on the notes will depend on the actual initial underlier level, cap level and threshold settlement amount that we will set on the trade date and the actual final underlier level determined by the calculation agent as described above. Moreover, the assumptions on which the hypothetical returns are based may turn out to be inaccurate. Consequently, the amount of cash to be paid in respect of your notes, if any, on the stated maturity date may be very different from the information reflected in the table and chart above.

PS- 12

Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes

An investment in the notes involves significant risks. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the notes. Investing in the notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the underlier or any of the underlier stocks, i.e. the stocks composing the underlier. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

You May Lose Your Entire Investment in the Notes

You can lose your entire investment in the notes. The cash payment on your notes, if any, on the stated maturity date will be based on the performance of the underlier as measured from the initial underlier level set on the trade date to the closing level of the underlier on the determination date (also referred to as the “final underlier level”). If the final underlier level is less than the threshold level, you will lose 1.25% of the face amount of your notes for every 1% that the final underlier level is less than the threshold level. Thus, you may lose your entire investment in the notes, which would include any premium to face amount you paid when you purchased the notes.

Also, the market price of your notes prior to the stated maturity date may be significantly lower than the purchase price you pay for your notes. Consequently, if you sell your notes before the stated maturity date, you may receive far less than the amount of your investment in the notes.

Your Maximum Payment on the Notes Is Limited to the Threshold Settlement Amount

Your ability to participate in any change in the value of the underlier over the term of your notes will be limited because of the maximum settlement amount (which is equal to the threshold settlement amount), which will be set on the trade date. The maximum settlement amount will limit the cash settlement amount you may receive for each of your notes at maturity, no matter how much the level of the underlier may rise beyond the initial underlier level over the term of your notes. Accordingly, the amount payable for each of your notes may be significantly less than it would have been had you invested directly in the underlier.

If You Purchase Your Notes at a Premium to Face Amount, the Return on Your Investment Will Be Lower Than the Return on Notes Purchased at Face Amount or a Discount and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will Be Negatively Affected

The cash settlement amount will not be adjusted based on the issue price you pay for the notes. If you purchase notes at a price that differs from the face amount of the notes, then the return on your investment in such notes held to the stated maturity date will differ from, and may be substantially less than, the return on notes purchased at face amount or a discount to face amount. If you purchase your notes at a premium to face amount and hold them to the stated maturity date, the return on your investment in the notes will be lower than it would have been had you purchased the notes at face amount or a discount to face amount. In addition, the impact of the threshold level and the cap level on the return on your investment will depend upon the price you pay for your notes relative to face amount. For example, while the threshold level will still provide for an increase in the return on the notes if the final underlier level is greater than or equal to the threshold level but less than the cap level, if the final underlier level is less than the threshold level you will incur a greater percentage decrease in your investment in the notes than would have been the case for notes purchased at face amount or a discount to face amount. Similarly, if you purchase your notes at a premium to face amount, the cap level will only permit a lower return on your investment in the notes than would have been the case for notes purchased at face amount or a discount to face amount.

PS- 13

The Stated Maturity Date of the Notes Is a Pricing Term and Will Be Determined By Us on the Trade Date

We will not fix the stated maturity date until the trade date. The term of the notes could be as long as the high end of the range set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement. You should be willing and able to hold your notes for up to the high end of the range set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement. The stated maturity date selected by us could have an impact on the value of the notes.

Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Levels of the Underlier on the Dates Specified

Any payment on the notes will be determined based on the closing levels of the underlier on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable value of the underlier determined at any other time.

No Interest or Dividend Payments or Voting Rights or Rights to Receive Any Underlier Stock

As a holder of the notes, you will not receive interest payments. As a result, even if the amount payable on the stated maturity date exceeds the face amount of your notes, the overall return you earn on your notes may be less than you would have earned by investing in a non-index-linked debt security of comparable maturity that bears interest at a prevailing market rate. In addition, as a holder of the notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive cash dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the underlier stocks would have. Furthermore, investing in the notes will not make you a holder of any of the underlier stocks. Your notes will be paid in cash and you will have no right to receive delivery of any underlier stocks.

The U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of an Investment in the Notes Are Uncertain

There is no direct legal authority regarding the proper U.S. federal income tax treatment of the notes, and we do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS. Consequently, significant aspects of the tax treatment of the notes are uncertain, and the IRS or a court might not agree with the treatment of the notes as prepaid forward contracts, as described above under “Key Terms—Tax consequences.” If the IRS were successful in asserting an alternative treatment for the notes, the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the notes could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, in 2007 the Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on various issues regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. Any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should review carefully the sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders,” and consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the notes (including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by the 2007 notice), as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

Credit of Issuer

The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the notes and, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you might not receive any amount owed to you under the terms of the notes.

PS- 14

You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the notes), by acquiring the notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the notes or receiving a different security from the notes, which may be worth significantly less than the notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underlier

Adjustments to the Underlier Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes

The underlier sponsor may add, delete, substitute or adjust the underlier stocks or make other methodological changes to the underlier that could affect its performance. The calculation agent will calculate the value to be used as the closing level of the underlier in the event of certain material changes in or modifications to the underlier. In addition, the underlier sponsor may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of the underlier at any time. Under these circumstances, the calculation agent may select a successor index that the calculation agent determines to be comparable to the underlier or, if no successor index is available, the calculation agent will determine the value to be used as the closing level of the underlier. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the underlier and, consequently, the value of the notes. See “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-91 of the accompanying prospectus supplement, as modified by “Supplemental Terms of the Notes” above.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

We and Our Affiliates, and Any Dealer Participating in the Distribution of the Notes, May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect Your Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest

We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the underlier or its components. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other

PS- 15

financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

Furthermore, if any dealer participating in the distribution of the notes or any of its affiliates conducts hedging activities for us in connection with the notes, that participating dealer or its affiliates will expect to realize a projected profit from such hedging activities, and this projected profit will be in addition to any selling concession that the participating dealer realizes for the sale of the notes to you. This additional projected profit may create a further incentive for the participating dealer to sell the notes to you.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the calculation agent for the notes. As calculation agent, we will determine any values of the underlier and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the notes. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underlier” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the notes.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

Lack of Liquidity

The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the notes. The notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your notes to maturity.

Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of Your Notes

In addition to the level of the underlier, the value of the notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that may either offset or magnify each other, including: the expected volatility of the underlier; the time to maturity of the notes; the dividend rates on the underlier stocks; interest and yield rates in the market generally; supply and demand for the notes; a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events; and our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Expected to Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes

The estimated value of your notes on the trade date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your notes and the estimated value of the notes is expected as a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated

PS- 16

intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the notes. These other costs will include a fee paid to iCapital Markets LLC, an electronic platform in which an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, who is acting as a dealer in connection with the distribution of the notes, holds an indirect minority equity interest, for services it is providing in connection with this offering.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might Be Lower If Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market

The estimated value of your notes on the trade date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated values referenced above might be lower if such estimated values were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to Be Inaccurate and May Be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions

The estimated value of your notes on the trade date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions that may be purchasers or sellers of notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, If Any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May Be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes

The estimated value of the notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions (described above under “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of Your Notes”), and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the notes, secondary market prices of your notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your notes, and any sale prior to the maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you.

The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy the Notes in the Secondary Market and the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements at All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the trade date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the notes on the trade date, as well as the secondary market value of the notes, for a temporary period after the initial issue date of the notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the

PS- 17

notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your notes.

PS- 18

The Underlier

The underlier consists of stocks of 500 companies selected to provide a performance benchmark for the U.S. equity markets. For more information about the underlier, see “Indices—The S&P U.S. Indices” in the accompanying underlying supplement.

In addition, information about the underlier may be obtained from other sources, including, but not limited to, the underlier sponsor’s website (including information regarding the underlier’s sector weightings). We are not incorporating by reference into this pricing supplement the website or any material it includes. Neither we nor any agent or dealer for this offering makes any representation that this publicly available information regarding the underlier is accurate or complete.

Historical Closing Levels of the Underlier

You should not take the historical levels of the underlier as an indication of the future performance of the underlier. The closing level of the underlier has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. Any historical upward or downward trend in the closing level of the underlier during any period shown below is not an indication that the underlier is more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time during the term of your notes. We cannot give you any assurance that the future performance of the underlier or the underlier stocks will not result in a loss on your initial investment on the stated maturity date.

Neither we nor any of our affiliates make any representation to you as to the performance of the underlier. The actual performance of the underlier over the term of the notes, as well as the cash settlement amount, may bear little relation to the historical levels shown below.

The following graph sets forth the historical performance of the underlier based on the daily closing levels from January 4, 2021 through January 13, 2026. The closing level of the underlier on January 13, 2026 was 6,963.74. The dotted line indicates a hypothetical buffer level of 80.00% of the closing level of the underlier on January 13, 2026. The actual buffer level will be equal to 80.00% of the initial underlier level.",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2026-01-16 10:02:29.716734

Those contradictions were enough for U.S. District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers to deny OpenAI’s motion for summary judgment on Thursday, allowing Musk’s fraud claims against the company to proceed to trial.
The company also said that Musk’s claims were time-barred because he should have known about the reported fraud by 2019, when OpenAI publicly announced its for-profit subsidiary.
She denied Microsoft’s motion to dismiss claims that it aided and abetted a breach of fiduciary duty, pointing to internal communications that suggested awareness of potential issues with OpenAI’s nonprofit donors.
Notes from a Microsoft meeting in October 2020 show the company discussed effectively owning OpenAI and considered Musk’s perspective on what they referred to as a closed OpenAI.","(CN) — In September 2017, Elon Musk sent an ultimatum to the leaders of OpenAI, the artificial intelligence nonprofit he co-founded and funded with tens of millions of dollars.

“Either go do something on your own or continue with OpenAI as a nonprofit. I will no longer fund OpenAI until you have made a firm commitment to stay or I’m just being a fool who is essentially providing free funding for you to create a startup,” the billionaire said then.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded the next day, “I remain enthusiastic about the non-profit structure!” Greg Brockman, another co-founder, made similar assurances.

However, in personal notes, Brockman wrote that he could not honestly say the company was committed to remaining a nonprofit, warning that if it shifted to a for-profit structure just a few months later, any claim of commitment would be a lie.

Those contradictions were enough for U.S. District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers to deny OpenAI’s motion for summary judgment on Thursday, allowing Musk’s fraud claims against the company to proceed to trial.

The trial is scheduled to start April 27 and run through the end of May.

In a 32-page order, the Barack Obama appointee in the Northern District of California found enough evidence to create factual disputes about whether OpenAI’s founders deceived Musk about their intentions to maintain the organization’s nonprofit structure.

“Brockman’s electronic notes could be read to suggest that Brockman intended to deceive,” Rogers wrote.

Musk donated about $38 million to OpenAI between 2016 and 2020, saying the company’s founders agreed from the start that the technology would be owned by a foundation, used for the benefit of the public and not structured to generate private profit.

But by 2019, OpenAI had created a for-profit subsidiary and started taking billions in investment from Microsoft. The company also moved some of its intellectual property and employees from the nonprofit to commercial entities.

OpenAI attempted to dismiss the case on multiple grounds, arguing that Musk lacked legal standing to sue because he donated through intermediary charitable funds rather than directly to the organization. But Rogers rejected that argument.

“Holding otherwise would significantly reduce the enforcement of a large swath of charitable trusts, contrary to the modern trend,” she said.

The company also said that Musk’s claims were time-barred because he should have known about the reported fraud by 2019, when OpenAI publicly announced its for-profit subsidiary. But Rogers found genuine disputes about when Musk discovered or should have discovered the full extent of the structural changes, noting he continued donating to OpenAI through September 2020.

Rogers also addressed Microsoft’s role in OpenAI’s transformation. She denied Microsoft’s motion to dismiss claims that it aided and abetted a breach of fiduciary duty, pointing to internal communications that suggested awareness of potential issues with OpenAI’s nonprofit donors.

In March 2018, Microsoft’s Chief Technology Officer wrote: “Ideologically, I can’t imagine that they funded an open effort to concentrate [machine learning] talent so that they could then go build a closed, for-profit thing on its back.""

Notes from a Microsoft meeting in October 2020 show the company discussed effectively owning OpenAI and considered Musk’s perspective on what they referred to as a closed OpenAI.

OpenAI is now valued at roughly $500 billion and among the world’s most prominent AI companies.

Musk, who resigned from OpenAI’s board in February 2018 and has since launched a competing AI venture called xAI, has become one of the company’s most vocal critics.

Representatives for Musk, Sam Altman and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/03/musk-vs-altman.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2026-01-16 03:59:25.121555

“IBM Sovereign Core offers an AI-ready sovereign stack, providing organizations with control, ensuring compliance and operational autonomy.
Unlike approaches that layer sovereignty controls onto existing architectures, Sovereign Core makes sovereignty an inherent property of the software itself.
“The sovereign AI conversation has focused on data residency, but that’s only part of the equation,” said Sanjeev Mohan, Principal, SanjMo.
“IBM Sovereign Core addresses the harder question: who controls the system and can you prove it to regulators?","IBM announced, the industry’s first AI-ready sovereign-enabled software for enterprises, governments and service providers to build, deploy and manage AI-ready sovereign environments. Organizations around the world are facing a growing imperative to exercise control over their technology infrastructure. Driven by evolving regulatory requirements, and the need for auditable governance, enterprises and governments are seeking self-managed environments where they maintain complete operational authority, particularly as they deploy AI workloads that amplify sovereignty concerns.

Digital sovereignty goes beyond data residency. It encompasses who operates and controls the technology environment, how data is accessed and governed, where workloads execute, and under whose jurisdiction AI models run. Yet most organizations lack a destination to land, modernize, and re-host applications under sovereign control, including applications that will incorporate AI capabilities, and have continuous compliance reporting capabilities. “Gartner predicts that more than 75% of all enterprises will have a digital sovereignty strategy by 2030, often sovereign cloud strategies1.”

“As AI adoption accelerates in India, businesses will need to innovate while meeting tightening regulatory requirements and controlling sensitive data and AI workloads. It is crucial as large language models and agentic workflows often process sensitive data, and maintaining local authority is essential for confident AI adoption,” said Sandip Patel, Managing Director, IBM India & South Asia. “IBM Sovereign Core offers an AI-ready sovereign stack, providing organizations with control, ensuring compliance and operational autonomy. It is designed for flexibility and is part of our long-standing commitment to empowering clients with an open hybrid cloud approach. Sovereignty solutions built on open-source foundations and open standards helps ensure organisations are not ‘locked in’ to infrastructure or ‘locked out’ of entering the innovation ecosystem.”

IBM Sovereign Core will help customers achieve verifiable sovereignty and full operational control. Sovereign Core is purpose-built software to build, deploy, and manage cloud-native and AI workloads under an organization’s own authority, within chosen jurisdictions, built on Red Hat’s open source foundation. Unlike approaches that layer sovereignty controls onto existing architectures, Sovereign Core makes sovereignty an inherent property of the software itself. Organizations can gain:

Customer-operated control plane: organizations maintain direct operational authority over software operations, deployment decisions, and system configurations without intermediation from a vendor not in region.

In-boundary identity and keys: all authentication, authorization, encryption keys, and access management remain within jurisdiction boundaries under customer control.

Ongoing compliance enablement and generated evidence of continuous compliance: comprehensive operational data, system telemetry, and audit trails are generated, stored, and managed within the sovereign boundary, including automated identity.

Governed AI inference: AI model deployment and hosting, local GPU clusters, local inference execution and agent operations occur under local governance with traceability and oversight, without exporting data to external providers.

Ease of deployment: delivering sovereignty at scale with consistency and flexibility allowing organizations to stand up isolated environments with built-in multitenancy capabilities within a matter of days of deployment; choice of hardware and infrastructure.

“The sovereign AI conversation has focused on data residency, but that’s only part of the equation,” said Sanjeev Mohan, Principal, SanjMo. “IBM Sovereign Core addresses the harder question: who controls the system and can you prove it to regulators? IBM takes a holistic approach spanning data, operations, technology, and assurance, with continuous monitoring. As AI moves into production, that kind of ongoing accountability becomes non-negotiable.”

“AI is accelerating the pace at which sovereignty questions move from theory to daily operations,” said Erik Fish, Director of Geotechnology at Eurasia Group. “As geopolitics, regulation, and data governance increasingly converge, governments and enterprises must move while demonstrating clear control over critical data and infrastructure. The challenge is no longer a trade-off between openness and sovereignty, but governing data, access, and infrastructure amid growing regulatory and geopolitical constraints.”

Customers can deploy IBM Sovereign Core in the environment of their choice – whether in on-premises data centers, supported in-region cloud infrastructure or through IT Service Providers. IBM is collaborating with IT Service Providers globally, starting with an initial rollout in Europe with Cegeka in Belgium and the Netherlands and Computacenter in Germany. These partnerships allow local operational independence and compliance management, while enabling IT Service Providers to offer differentiated sovereign services to enterprises preparing for and running AI-scale workloads.

“As organizations navigate increasingly complex compliance and regulatory requirements, we’re seeing strong demand for digital platforms and software that allows sensitive data to remain within controlled, compliant boundaries,” said Gaetan Willems, VP Cloud & Digital Platforms, Cegeka. “Partnering with IBM to offer a pre-architected solution through our in-country environment enables us to deliver enterprise-ready software to our clients, while allowing them to address local compliance standards.”",https://etedge-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IBM.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 12:04:57.301120

Driverless hazmat trucking is now a live federal rulemaking issue — PHMSA’s HM‑266 ANPRM spotlights what changes when no trained human operator is on scene (and what tank fleets should prioritize in their comments).

Electronic shipping papers + emergency response information look like the first high-impact modernization — because first responders and inspectors still need fast, verifiable access to hazmat details when the cab is empty.

Security plans, cybersecurity, and hazmat employee training are likely to extend beyond the driver — toward remote operations centers, telematics workflows, and clearer “who is accountable” definitions that over-the-road tank stakeholders can shape now.

PHMSA is gathering industry input in HM‑266 on how hazmat compliance should work in highly automated transportation systems.

Driverless hazmat trucking has moved from concept-stage debate to an active federal regulatory question — and PHMSA is now openly asking how the Hazardous Materials Regulations should function when there may be no human operator at the scene. That single change ripples through nearly every “routine” hazmat assumption: who presents shipping papers, who secures a scene, who detects a developing leak, who communicates with first responders, and who is accountable for actions that used to be performed by a trained driver at the equipment. For more news and updates on PHMSA’s regulatory initiatives, see our PHMSA coverage.

PHMSA’s December 4, 2025, Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) is not an approval of autonomous hazmat operations. It is also not a ban. It is, however, a clear signal that driverless hazmat trucking is being evaluated in the same regulatory frame as drones, delivery robots, and other highly automated transportation systems — and that the agency is mapping where the current rules rely on human presence, where they can be modernized, and where safety expectations may need to rise rather than relax. For additional insights into this ANPRM and related regulatory moves, visit our ANPRM archive.

For tank truck carriers, shippers of bulk liquids, third-party logistics firms, and the technology companies building automated driving systems, the practical takeaway is simple: the government is inviting detailed, operationally grounded input right now. Comments on Docket PHMSA‑2024‑0064 (HM‑266) are due March 4, 2026. The quality of those comments will influence what PHMSA proposes later — and how quickly the industry sees movement on electronic documentation, remote emergency response information access, security plans, training definitions, and loading/unloading controls. To stay current on coverage tied to day-to-day tank operations and regulation, see our TankTransport reporting.

Driverless hazmat trucking: What PHMSA is asking in the ANPRM

USDOT’s PHMSA is exploring how hazardous materials rules may need to adapt when commercial vehicles operate without an on-scene driver.

PHMSA’s ANPRM (HM‑266) sits in the HMR ecosystem (49 CFR Parts 171–180) and asks stakeholders to identify regulatory barriers, safety gaps, and workable modernization options for highly automated transportation systems. For hazardous transport stakeholders, several question clusters matter more than others because they are unavoidable if a cab is empty.

1) Special permits as the near-term bridge – PHMSA acknowledges that innovators have historically used special permits to conduct operations that do not cleanly fit existing rules. The special permit pathway effectively acts as a “controlled exposure” mechanism: PHMSA can allow limited, monitored activity while gathering evidence. For driverless hazmat trucking, special permits are likely to remain a key bridge while the agency evaluates more permanent rules.

For industry players, that means two practical choices:

Treat special permits as a temporary workaround and wait.

Or treat special permits as a design constraint and build operations that can be safely permissioned and audited.

A detail worth emphasizing: special permits are not just paperwork; they are a forcing function. They push operators to define controls, reporting, and limitations precisely enough for PHMSA to evaluate.

2) Shipping papers and emergency response information without a driver – PHMSA is explicitly probing what happens when there is no one to hand an officer or firefighter a document packet. This is one of the most immediate and solvable problems, and therefore one of the most likely early areas of regulatory change.

The operational reality for tank fleets is blunt: if a driverless tractor-tank combination is involved in an incident, the responder’s first minute is about hazard identification, isolation distances, ignition sources, and exposure risk. If the load is misidentified, everything downstream can worsen. So PHMSA is pressing for solutions that maintain speed, accuracy, and security of information access.

3) Hazard communication when the “human explanation layer” disappears – Placards and markings remain a core external safety layer. Still, responders often rely on a trained driver to confirm details and explain status (e.g., “no leak observed,” “valves closed,” “product is stabilized,” “vapor cloud present,” “I shut off pump”). In driverless hazmat trucking, that information has to come from somewhere else: sensors, remote operators, or incident notification systems. PHMSA’s questioning points toward a world where hazard communication becomes partly physical (placards) and partly digital (trusted, immediate data access).

4) Training and the redefinition of who is responsible – PHMSA’s hazmat employee training regime is foundational. Automation does not eliminate human responsibility; it redistributes it. A remote operations center employee supervising autonomous trucks might, for particular duties, become functionally analogous to a driver. A dock operator may become responsible for tasks a driver used to perform. Even software changes might need human sign-off in a safety management system.

This raises a practical question that the ANPRM effectively asks: Who counts as the hazmat employee in a distributed autonomous operation, and what training do they need to meet the spirit of the HMR?

5) Security plans and cybersecurity – PHMSA’s security planning requirements already exist for specific materials and operations. Automation tightens the loop between security planning and cybersecurity. If an automated driving system or remote communications channel is compromised, the risk profile changes. PHMSA is signaling openness to revisiting expectations for security plans in light of remote connectivity and unattended operations.

Cybersecurity is not just IT. It becomes part of hazmat safety engineering. A hacked vehicle carrying hazardous materials is not a generic cyber event; it is a potential public safety incident. For more reporting tied to cyber risk, operational resilience, and connected-fleet exposure, see our Cybersecurity coverage.

6) Packaging, loading, and unloading as “system interfaces.”

Bulk hazmat moves still hinge on packaging integrity and hazard communication — PHMSA is now evaluating how those pillars translate to automated operations.

Tank packaging standards and loading/unloading procedures are not abstract; they are where releases begin. In conventional operations, drivers often serve as a procedural checkpoint. Remove that checkpoint, and the facility or automated equipment must absorb it. PHMSA is asking where the current rules assume human verification and how that should be replaced.

This is the area where stakeholders can provide the most valuable “ground truth,” because tank loading practices vary widely by commodity and facility. If the endgame is driverless hazmat trucking, then the entire transfer process must be designed for safety, assuming no experienced driver is present to notice abnormalities, stop a transfer, or intervene.

Driverless hazmat trucking: Which hazmat pillars break without a human?

PHMSA’s ANPRM effectively spotlights a set of “hazmat pillars” that are stable in human-operated transport but become fragile in an autonomous environment. For an industry-insider audience, it helps to describe these pillars as specific, testable failure modes rather than general topics.

Pillar A: Documentation access and authenticity – A responder needs the correct information fast. An inspector needs verifiable compliance evidence. A carrier needs a record that survives litigation. A shipper needs assurance that the right product is declared and handled. If the documentation is digital, you must solve: access control, offline resilience, authenticity, and auditability.

Pillar B: Scene stabilization – In traditional discussions of driverless hazmat trucking, people jump straight to collision avoidance. But hazmat outcomes often hinge on what happens after the vehicle stops moving: the first minutes of scene control, ignition source management, establishment of the isolation perimeter, and leak confirmation. A driver often does some of this by training and instinct. Without a driver, the system must provide a substitute: alerting, remote assessment, clear responder interfaces, and safe states (valves, brakes, shutdown).

Pillar C: Role clarity and accountability – Who is responsible for ensuring the shipping paper is accurate? Who is responsible for hazard communication? Who is responsible for monitoring an abnormal condition mid-route? If multiple humans touch the operation across time and distance (shipper, loader, remote supervisor, safety manager), PHMSA will need an enforceable accountability model. Industry can either help define that model now, or risk having a model imposed later that does not match operational reality.

Pillar D: Security resilience – Hazmat security planning has traditionally focused on theft, diversion, and misuse. Automation adds remote access pathways and software dependencies. The security pillar becomes a joint physical-cyber domain: cameras, locks, geofencing, command authentication, incident escalation, and tamper detection.

Pillar E: Transfer safety (loading/unloading) – Bulk transfer is where minor errors become significant events. If you want driverless hazmat trucking to scale, the transfer process must be engineered to prevent wrong product loading, wrong compartment loading, overfill, hose failure, mis-valving, and incompatible connections, without relying on a driver to act as the last manual check.

These pillars are why PHMSA’s ANPRM is a big deal to tank transportation: it invites the industry to say, in detail, how to rebuild each pillar.

Driverless hazmat trucking: How could electronic shipping papers and ER info work?

Electronic shipping papers are often discussed as a convenience upgrade. For driverless hazmat trucking, they are closer to a prerequisite. But “electronic” is not a single design; it is a set of architectural choices with safety consequences.

A practical, enforceable approach tends to include several features:

1) Multiple access paths (because networks fail) – If a responder must access emergency response information, the system should not depend on a single cellular carrier, cloud provider, or device. Industry comments that propose resilient access, such as cached information in a secure onboard module plus a remote database, are more credible than comments that assume always-on connectivity.

2) Authentication and least-privilege access – A significant objection to naive digital shipping paper concepts is that they could expose sensitive information to unauthorized parties. If a system allows anyone to retrieve detailed hazmat data via a simple QR code, it may increase security risks. A more balanced approach is role-based access: first responders and inspectors can obtain details quickly through verified channels, while the general public can only see limited hazard class indicators already available on placards.

3) Fast retrieval under stress – In real incidents, responders do not want an app that requires multiple logins, multi-step navigation, and perfect connectivity. The winning design will be the one that works in gloves, rain, smoke, and noise.

4) Clear mapping to the Emergency Response Guidebook model – Responders often think in ERG terms: ID number, guide number, isolation distances, and immediate hazards. Electronic emergency response information should mirror how responders actually operate, not how shippers store data.

5) Audit trail and legal defensibility – For compliance and post-incident investigations, digital systems should log who accessed shipping information, what changed, and when. If a shipper updates a shipping description, the platform should retain the full revision trail so inspectors and investigators can verify exactly what was available at the time of transport.

Electronic shipping papers also solve a practical gap: they can speed first-responder access and reduce documentation errors across conventional fleets, while also enabling the unique requirements of driverless hazmat trucking**.

Driverless hazmat trucking: How will emergency response and scene control work?

This is the “hard part” that separates a plausible policy conversation from a marketing narrative.

Driverless hazmat trucking policy ultimately gets measured at the scene: responder access, secure shutdown, and clear accountability when something goes wrong.

If a driverless tank truck is involved in a crash, several questions arise immediately:

What alerts first responders — automatically and with enough detail?

A driver typically calls it in. Without a driver, the system must detect abnormal events and trigger a notification. A credible model may include automatic crash detection, rollover detection, valve position sensors, pressure/vacuum monitoring, and leak detection tied to an incident notification workflow.

Who communicates with responders in real time?

A remote operations center could provide a communications bridge. But that only helps if responders can reach it quickly and it has actionable information, not generic scripts. You can position the remote operations center as the “digital driver,” but then training and accountability become central.

How does the vehicle enter a safe state?

In a conventional operation, a driver may shut down the engine, set the brakes, and close the valves. In driverless hazmat trucking, you need engineered safe states: automatic shutdown logic, protected emergency stop functions, and perhaps remote disable features designed to prevent misuse while enabling responders to control risk.

How do responders secure the scene if the vehicle can move or behave unpredictably?

If an automated driving system is damaged but still powered, responders need a standard way to confirm the vehicle will not move. Industry often discusses “first responder interaction guides” for automated vehicles; PHMSA’s ANPRM provides a forcing function to align that concept with hazmat realities.

What about secondary risks — fire, ignition sources, or incompatible exposures?

A tank truck incident is not only about the product; it’s about the environment. Many serious hazmat events involve compounded factors: collisions, fires, nearby vehicles, weather, drainage, population density, and time-to-response. Automation must fit that reality rather than pretend it away.

“How will firefighters get shipping papers if there is no driver?”

“Who do responders call if an autonomous hazmat truck crashes?”

“Can an inspector place an autonomous truck out of service?”

“What happens if connectivity is lost in a remote area?”

Those are not rhetorical questions; they are the operational acceptance tests for driverless hazmat trucking. For more reporting tied to deployment realities and policy friction points, explore our AutonomousTrucks archive.

Driverless hazmat trucking: What should fleets, shippers, and tech firms do now?

PHMSA’s ANPRM spotlights a practical question: how do responders get accurate hazmat details fast when there’s no driver to brief them?

The ANPRM stage is where PHMSA is collecting raw operational data, precisely the kind of information tank fleets can provide better than anyone else.

As HM‑266 develops, the most consequential stakeholder input tends to be operational: specific scenarios, measurable safety outcomes, and enforceable controls. For OTR tank stakeholders, the themes below are most likely to shape what PHMSA can credibly modernize — and the conditions that could attach to any future automated hazmat moves.

1) Define “no human present” scenarios and the minimum control set – Driverless hazmat trucking raises predictable “no on-scene operator” situations that regulators, enforcement, and responders will use as real-world test cases. Examples include:

Rollover with product release risk

Minor collision with uncertain leak status

Disabled vehicle on the shoulder

Loss of GPS or connectivity mid-route

Attempted tampering during a stop

Loading rack abnormal event (overfill alarm, hose rupture)

Across those scenarios, regulators will look for layered controls that are understandable at the scene and auditable after the fact: detection, notification, a defined safe state, a responder-facing interface, and a clear accountability chain.

2) Favor performance-based outcomes that can be verified – Where technology and operating models vary, performance-based requirements can be easier to implement and enforce than a single prescriptive design. In driverless hazmat trucking, this often translates into outcomes such as “emergency response information is accessible to authorized responders within a defined time under degraded connectivity,” rather than mandating a specific platform or vendor architecture.

3) Modernize electronic shipping papers without creating a security exposure – Electronic shipping papers and emergency response information are central to HM‑266 because the driver cannot serve as the “human distribution mechanism” for documents. Any credible approach must balance speed of access with security and integrity. Stakeholder submissions frequently emphasize:

Access control and authentication for responders and inspectors

Offline and degraded-mode operation (including caching and redundancy)

Cybersecurity practices and incident response expectations

Auditability and record retention (including revision history)

Standardized data fields that support interoperability

4) Treat remote operations centers as safety-critical functions – If remote personnel will supervise, intervene, or communicate with first responders, regulators are likely to evaluate the remote operations center as part of the safety case — not as a back-office convenience. Expect scrutiny around:

Training requirements for remote operators as hazmat employees (where duties align)

Staffing, fatigue management, and escalation coverage

Authority boundaries and intervention protocols

Logging requirements for decisions, alerts, and interventions

Secure communications and access management

5) Address loading/unloading explicitly, with tank-specific operating detail – For bulk liquids, transfer operations are often where risk concentrates, and driver involvement varies by facility and commodity. If driverless hazmat trucking is contemplated beyond limited highway segments, PHMSA and the industry will need clarity on what changes at the rack and at the customer site — especially where drivers currently serve as a procedural checkpoint. Common focus areas include:

Which tasks shift to facility control versus carrier control

What automation is already in place (interlocks, overfill prevention, emergency shutdown)

What additional safeguards are required when no driver is present

How to prevent wrong-product or wrong-compartment events

How to manage abnormal events and stop-transfer authority

6) Build for responder and enforcement usability, not just system capability – At the incident scene and during roadside inspections, usability is a safety feature. Regulators and responders will focus on whether information and control pathways are clear, fast, and reliable without a driver. Practical expectations that surface repeatedly include:

A standardized way to confirm the vehicle cannot move and to place it in a safe state

Fast, verifiable access to shipping papers and emergency response information

Clear placarding/identifiers that support digital lookup without increasing public exposure

Reliable contact pathways to a trained support function (e.g., a monitored operations center)

Joint familiarization or exercises with local responders where operations are planned

7) Expect phased change: documentation and security first, full autonomy later – Many of the earliest regulatory changes under HM‑266 are more likely to involve documentation, data access, and security expectations — because they strengthen today’s hazmat operations and also address the “no driver with paperwork” problem. Broader permissions or assumptions for unattended hazmat operations, especially involving loading/unloading, are likely to take longer and require clearer evidence and enforceable safeguards.

8) Watch the parallel tracks that will determine real-world feasibility – PHMSA is only one part of the operating environment. FMCSA decisions on operational safety requirements and exemptions, state-level autonomous vehicle rules, and evolving expectations around cybersecurity and connected-vehicle safety can all influence what is practicable, even if hazmat rules modernize. For fleets and shippers planning investments, those parallel tracks are often as decisive as the HMR changes themselves.

Where Driverless Hazmat Trucking Rules Are Headed

Key Developments:

PHMSA launched HM‑266 (Docket PHMSA‑2024‑0064) via ANPRM on December 4, 2025, formally opening the door to HMR modernization for highly automated transportation systems, including highway freight.

Comment deadline is March 4, 2026, creating a near-term window for tank fleets, shippers, and technology providers to influence PHMSA’s problem framing before an NPRM is drafted.

Scope spans the core HMR architecture (49 CFR Parts 171–180), not a single narrow fix, meaning future updates could touch documentation, hazmat employee training, security plans, packaging, and transfer operations.

PHMSA is explicitly stress-testing “human-dependent” compliance steps, especially:

Shipping papers & emergency response information when there is no driver to present documents or call for help.

Hazard communication effectiveness when the “human explanation layer” disappears.

Training definitions when operational responsibilities shift to remote staff and facility personnel.

Security plans + cybersecurity as remote connectivity and unattended equipment change threat models.

Loading/unloading controls where tank-transfer risk is often highest.

Special permits remain the practical bridge in the near term, signaling that pilots and controlled deployments may continue while permanent rules are evaluated.

Highway autonomy is being treated as a cross-agency issue, with PHMSA’s hazmat framework intersecting FMCSA operational safety rules and the real-world enforceability needs of roadside inspection and incident response.

Early regulatory movement is most likely to start with “data and documentation,” because digital shipping papers, authenticated responder access, and standardized emergency response information can improve safety for conventional fleets and enable the prerequisites for driverless hazmat trucking.

Tank-specific realities are implicitly in play (bulk surge, rollover sensitivity, transfer interfaces, abnormal event handling), making OTR tank stakeholder comments uniquely valuable compared to generic autonomous trucking input.

Enforcement and responder usability are emerging as acceptance tests, not afterthoughts: any viable approach must keep inspections, out-of-service authority, and incident command workable without relying on a driver.

(1)Because dealers who purchase the Notes for sale to certain fee-based advisory accounts may forgo some or all selling concessions, fees or commissions, the public offering price for investors purchasing the Notes in such fee-based advisory accounts may be between $992.50 and $1,000 per Note. Investors that hold their Notes in fee-based advisory or trust accounts may be charged fees by the investment advisor or manager of such account based on the amount of assets held in those accounts, including the Notes.

(2)Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, based on our internal pricing models, is expected to be between $901.20 and $981.20 per Note. The estimated value is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. See “Additional Information Regarding Our Estimated Value of the Notes” on page PS–5 of this pricing supplement.

(3)Barclays Capital Inc. will receive commissions from the Issuer of up to $7.50 per $1,000 principal amount Note. Barclays Capital Inc. will use these commissions to pay variable selling concessions or fees (including custodial or clearing fees) to other dealers. The actual commission received by Barclays Capital Inc. will be equal to the selling concession paid to such dealers.

Investing in the Notes involves a number of risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page S-9 of the prospectus supplement and “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-12 of this pricing supplement.

The Notes will not be listed on any U.S. securities exchange or quotation system. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these Notes or determined that this pricing supplement is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

The Notes constitute our unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. The Notes are not deposit liabilities of Barclays Bank PLC and are not covered by the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme or insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency or deposit insurance agency of the United States, the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction.

CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES

The range of the estimated values of the Notes referenced above may not correlate on a linear basis with the range of any other term of the Notes as may be set forth in this pricing supplement. We determined the size of such range based on prevailing market conditions, as well as the anticipated duration of the marketing period for the Notes. The final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public, which we refer to as the Initial Valuation Date, based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the Initial Valuation Date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement.

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates, and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes may be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is a result of several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes.

Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately six months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes which we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-12 of this pricing supplement.

You may revoke your offer to purchase the Notes at any time prior to the Initial Valuation Date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the Notes prior to the Initial Valuation Date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.

SELECTED PURCHASE CONSIDERATIONS

The Notes are not appropriate for all investors. The Notes may be an appropriate investment for you if all of the following statements are true:

●You do not seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and you can tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates.

●You understand and accept that you will not participate in any appreciation of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, and that your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes.

●You can tolerate a loss of a significant portion or all of the principal amount of your Notes, and you are willing and able to make an investment that may have the full downside market risk of an investment in the Least Performing Reference Asset.

●You do not anticipate that the Closing Value of any Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on any Observation Date or below its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date.

●You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure.

●You are willing and able to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset.

●You understand and accept the risks that (a) you will not receive a Contingent Coupon if the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date and (b) you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value.

●You understand and accept the risk that, if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, the payment at maturity, if any, will be based solely on the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset.

●You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets.

●You are willing and able to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity and that you may not be able to reinvest your money in an alternative investment with comparable risk and yield.

●You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the Reference Assets.

●You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed.

●You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes.

●You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority.

The Notes may not be an appropriate investment for you if any of the following statements are true:

●You seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and/or you cannot tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates.

●You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of any or all of the Reference Assets rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes.

●You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose some or all of the principal amount of the Notes in the event that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset falls below its Barrier Value.

●You anticipate that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will decline during the term of the Notes such that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more Observation Dates and/or the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Barrier Value.

●You are unwilling or unable to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and/or do not understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset.

●You do not understand and/or are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets.

●You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE ON A SINGLE CONTINGENT COUPON PAYMENT DATE

The following examples demonstrate the circumstances under which you may receive a Contingent Coupon on a hypothetical Contingent Coupon Payment Date. The numbers appearing in these tables are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. These examples do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions:

■Hypothetical Initial Value of each Reference Asset: 100.00*

■Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)*

*The hypothetical Initial Value of 100.00 and the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and do not represent a likely Initial Value or Coupon Barrier Value for any Reference Asset. The actual Initial Value for each Reference Asset will be equal to its Closing Value on the Initial Valuation Date and the actual Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset will be equal to 70.00% of its Initial Value.

Example 1: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date.

Reference Asset

Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date

RTY Index

100.00

NDX Index

75.00

SPX Index

80.00

Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its respective Coupon Barrier Value, you will receive a Contingent Coupon of $7.708 (0.7708% of the principal amount per Note) on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date.

Example 2: The Closing Value of one Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date and the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date.

Reference Asset

Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date

RTY Index

Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date.

Example 3: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date.

Reference Asset

Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date

RTY Index

68.00

NDX Index

SPX Index

45.00

Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date.

Examples 2 and 3 demonstrate that you may not receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is below its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes.

Example 2: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 140.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is 90.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 105.00.

Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date).

Example 3: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 70.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is 65.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 60.00.

Because Reference Asset C has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset C is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold. Because, however, the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date.

Example 4: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 135.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is 50.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 110.00.

Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $500.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + [$1,000 × Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset]

$1,000 + [$1,000 × -50.00%] = $500.00

In addition, because the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date.

Example 4 demonstrates that if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your investment in the Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You will not benefit in any way from the Reference Asset Return of any other Reference Asset being higher than the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset.

If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, you may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. Any payment on the Notes, including the repayment of principal, is subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC.

SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS

An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Assets or their components, if any. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

●Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss — The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes.

●Potential Return is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of Any Reference Asset — The potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes. You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, even though you will be exposed to the depreciation in the value of the Least Performing Reference Asset if the Notes are not redeemed and the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value.

●You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes — The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the related Observation Date is greater than or equal to its respective Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its respective Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes.

●Because the Notes Are Linked to the Least Performing Reference Asset, You Are Exposed to Greater Risks of No Contingent Coupons and Sustaining a Significant Loss of Principal at Maturity Than If the Notes Were Linked to a Single Reference Asset — The risk that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and lose a significant portion or all of your principal amount in the Notes at maturity is greater if you invest in the Notes as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of a single Reference Asset. With multiple Reference Assets, it is more likely that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the specified Observation Dates or less than its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date, and therefore, it is more likely that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and that you will suffer a significant loss of principal at maturity. Further, the performance of the Reference Assets may not be correlated or may be negatively correlated. The lower the correlation between multiple Reference Assets, the greater the potential for one of those Reference Assets to close below its Coupon Barrier Value or Barrier Value on an Observation Date or the Final Valuation Date, respectively.

It is impossible to predict what the correlation among the Reference Assets will be over the term of the Notes. The Reference Assets represent different equity markets. These different equity markets may not perform similarly over the term of the Notes.

Although the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance may change over the term of the Notes, the Contingent Coupon rate is determined, in part, based on the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance calculated using our internal models at the time when the terms of the Notes are finalized. A higher Contingent Coupon is generally associated with lower correlation of the Reference Assets, which reflects a greater potential for missed Contingent Coupons and for a loss of principal at maturity.

●You Are Exposed to the Market Risk of Each Reference Asset — Your return on the Notes is not linked to a basket consisting of the Reference Assets. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each Reference Asset. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to each Reference Asset. Poor performance by any Reference Asset over the term of the Notes may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by any increases or lesser declines in the value of any other Reference Asset. To receive a Contingent Coupon, the Closing Value of each Reference Asset must be greater than or equal to its Coupon Barrier Value on the applicable Observation Date. In addition, if the Notes have not been redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will be exposed to the full decline in the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of each Reference Asset.

●The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk — Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The amount of any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes is based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Reference Assets. The amount of such coupon payments will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would have been had the expected volatility of the Reference Assets been lower. As volatility of a Reference Asset increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the Closing Value of that Reference Asset on one or more Observation Dates will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value and (b) the Final Value of that Reference Asset will be less than its Barrier Value.

Accordingly, you should understand that a higher coupon payment amount reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive coupon payments with respect to one or more Observation Dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the amount of such coupon payments been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than the expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive coupon payments and/or that you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above.

●Early Redemption and Reinvestment Risk — While the original term of the Notes is as indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity, as described above, and the holding period over which you may receive any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes could be as short as approximately six months.

The Redemption Price that you would receive on a Call Settlement Date, together with any coupon payments that you may have received prior to the Call Settlement Date, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after the relevant Call Settlement Date. The fact that the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold.

It is more likely that we will redeem the Notes at our sole discretion prior to maturity to the extent that the expected interest payable on the Notes is greater than the interest that would be payable on other instruments issued by us of comparable maturity, terms and credit rating trading in the market. We are less likely to redeem the Notes prior to maturity when the expected interest payable on the Notes is less than the interest that would be payable on other comparable instruments issued by us, which includes when the value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value. Therefore, the Notes are more likely to remain outstanding when the expected interest payable on the Notes is less than what would be payable on other comparable instruments and when your risk of not receiving a Contingent Coupon is relatively higher.

●Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the Dates Specified — Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Reference Assets determined at any other time.

●Contingent Repayment of Any Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Redemption — You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any redemption. Although the Notes provide for the contingent repayment of the principal amount of your Notes at maturity, provided that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, or upon any redemption, if you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of each Reference Asset has increased from its Initial Value. See “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below.

●Owning the Notes is Not the Same as Owning Any Reference Asset or Any Securities to which Any Reference Asset Provides Exposure — The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights that holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure may have.

●Tax Treatment — Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

●Credit of Issuer — The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.

●You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority — Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either

case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Reference Assets

●Historical Performance of the Reference Assets Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Reference Assets Over the Term of the Notes — The value of each Reference Asset has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of a Reference Asset is not an indication of the future performance of that Reference Asset over the term of the Notes. The historical correlation among the Reference Assets is not an indication of the future correlation among them over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Reference Assets individually or in comparison to each other over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of any Reference Asset.

●We May Accelerate the Notes If a Change-in-Law Event Occurs — Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the Notes or a Reference Asset or its components, or engaging in transactions in them, the Calculation Agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. However, if the Calculation Agent elects not to accelerate the Notes, the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

●Each Reference Asset Reflects the Price Return of the Securities Composing that Reference Asset, Not the Total Return — The return on the Notes is based on the performance of the Reference Assets, which reflects changes in the market prices of the securities composing the Reference Assets. The Reference Assets are not ""total return"" indices that, in addition to reflecting those price returns, would also reflect dividends paid on the securities composing that Reference Asset. Accordingly, the return on the Notes will not include such a total return feature.

●Adjustments to Any Reference Asset Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes — The sponsor of any Reference Asset may add, delete, substitute or adjust the securities composing that Reference Asset or make other methodological changes to that Reference Asset that could affect its value. The Calculation Agent will calculate the value to be used as the Closing Value of that Reference Asset in the event of certain material changes in or modifications to that Reference Asset. In addition, the sponsor of any Reference Asset may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of that Reference Asset at any time. Under these circumstances, the Calculation Agent may select a successor index that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to that Reference Asset or, if no successor index is available, the Calculation Agent will determine the value to be used as the Closing Value of that Reference Asset. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of any Reference Asset and, consequently, the value of the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

●The Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with Non-U.S. Securities Markets — Certain component securities of the NDX Index are issued by non-U.S. companies in non-U.S. securities markets. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities, such as the Notes, involve risks associated with the securities markets in the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities, including risks of volatility in those markets, governmental intervention in those markets and cross shareholdings in companies in certain countries. Also, there is generally less publicly available information about companies in some of these jurisdictions than there is about U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC, and generally non-U.S. companies are subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements and securities trading rules different from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws.

●The Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with Small Capitalization Stocks — The RTY Index tracks companies that are considered small-capitalization companies. These companies often have greater stock price volatility, lower trading volume and less liquidity than large-capitalization companies, and therefore securities linked to the RTY Index may be more volatile than an investment linked to an index with component stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less stable financially than large-capitalization companies and may depend on a small number of key personnel, making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies are often subject to less analyst coverage and may be in early, and less predictable, periods of their corporate existences. Such companies tend to have smaller revenues, less diverse product lines, smaller shares of their product or service markets, fewer financial resources and less competitive strengths than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

●We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Reference Assets or their components, if any. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Reference Assets and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, the Calculation Agent may be required to make discretionary judgements relating to the Reference Assets, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and this pricing supplement. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes is Expected to be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might be Lower if Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

●The Estimated Value of the Notes is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to be Inaccurate and May be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes — The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees,

commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you.

●The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy The Notes in the Secondary Market And the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements At All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes — Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes.

●Lack of Liquidity — The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your Notes to maturity.

●Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes — The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including:

othe market price of, dividend rate on and expected volatility of the Reference Assets or the components of the Reference Assets, if any;

ocorrelation (or lack of correlation) of the Reference Assets;

othe time to maturity of the Notes;

ointerest and yield rates in the market generally;

oa variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events;

osupply and demand for the Notes; and

oour creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.”

In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt.

Sale, exchange or redemption of a Note. Assuming the treatment described above is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including upon early redemption or redemption at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes (assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position referred to above). This gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss unless you hold the Notes for more than one year, in which case the gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the Notes at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your Notes between the time your right to a Contingent Coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the Contingent Coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your Notes prior to an Observation Date but that can be attributed to an expected Contingent Coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue.

As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Non-U.S. holders. Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat Contingent Coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes.",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2026-01-16 06:00:07.339594

Alshaya is one of the world’s largest brand franchise operators, offering an unparalleled choice of well-loved international brands to customers across the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe. From H&M and Starbucks to Shake Shack and The Cheesecake Factory, Alshaya operates more than 70 international brands with a simple mission: deliver the experiences customers want, with the brands they love, in the ways they choose.

Five years ago, Alshaya’s digital operations were as complex as its brand portfolio. Each brand had its own direction and the investment required to keep up with this was huge. At one point, the company was coordinating eight separate technology providers just to keep things moving. This fragmentation slowed production, created redundant workflows, and made it difficult to deliver consistent experiences across channels.

This wave of fleet renewal is poised to reshape the competitive landscape, with these carriers investing heavily in next-generation jets designed to enhance passenger comfort, fuel efficiency, and overall operational performance.

Globally, 793 commercial aircraft were delivered in December alone, with U.S. airlines securing a substantial portion of these new models. The influx of advanced Airbus aircraft, featuring cutting-edge technology and improved environmental performance, underscores a strategic commitment by major carriers to modernize their fleets and position themselves for growth in 2026 and beyond.

Fleet Expansion and Competitive Dynamics

Delta Air Lines: Strategic Growth Amid Competition

Delta Air Lines concluded 2025 by taking delivery of seven new Airbus jets in the final quarter, including A321neo, A220-300, and A350-900 models. These additions arrived just ahead of the busy holiday travel season, increasing capacity and offering passengers upgraded amenities. Over the course of the year, Delta received a total of 38 new aircraft, reflecting its dedication to operational efficiency and enhanced customer experience.

This ambitious fleet expansion occurs amid intensifying competition from low-cost carriers such as Frontier and JetBlue. While some investors remain optimistic about Delta’s strong on-time performance and profitability, others express caution due to the growing threat posed by budget rivals and the potential for shifting pricing strategies. In addition to its Airbus acquisitions, Delta is also focusing on expanding its premium cabin offerings, with new Boeing 787 Dreamliners set to join its fleet. This initiative aims to capture rising demand from both business and leisure travelers, potentially influencing broader market dynamics as competitors respond with their own strategic adjustments.

Frontier Airlines: Accelerated Growth in the Budget Sector

Frontier Airlines maintained its rapid expansion by taking delivery of ten new Airbus jets—including A320neo and A321neo models—in the last quarter of 2025. The Denver-based carrier is leveraging these fuel-efficient aircraft to reduce operating costs and increase seating capacity, thereby reinforcing its position in the ultra-low-cost market segment. Frontier’s aggressive fleet renewal signals confidence in sustained post-pandemic travel demand and suggests the potential for further consolidation among low-cost carriers as competition intensifies.

Industry Outlook

The surge in Airbus deliveries to Delta, Frontier, JetBlue, and American Airlines is transforming the U.S. aviation sector. As these airlines modernize their fleets, passengers can anticipate improved travel experiences and greater operational efficiency. However, the industry continues to face challenges stemming from economic uncertainty and evolving competitive pressures. Carriers are likely to adjust pricing and capacity strategies in response to these dynamics to safeguard their market positions.

As 2026 approaches, the impact of these record-setting aircraft orders will continue to influence the trajectory of U.S. air travel, establishing new standards for innovation and service in the skies.",https://pub-a51e4d676a044eb380faeff15def343e.r2.dev/c64e073ca81e47858e2bd366920bdcdb.avif,N,,2026-01-15 21:01:33.668523

The trial focused on tokenized bonds, covering delivery-versus-payment settlement, interest payouts, and redemption events. Banks acted as paying agents, custodians, and registrars. The success proves that digital assets can integrate with existing infrastructure, simplifying adoption for financial institutions.

This trial builds on Swift’s broader efforts in digital finance. Previous initiatives included ISO 20022 blockchain interoperability with HSBC, fiat and digital currency settlement with Citi, and digital asset exchange trials with Northern Trust and the Reserve Bank of Australia.

Swift Advances Tokenized Settlements With Major Banks

Swift also partnered with UBS Asset Management and Chainlink to bridge tokenized assets with traditional payment systems. These steps show a clear direction toward interoperable financial networks that span conventional and emerging technologies.

The trial saw SG-Forge, a blockchain subsidiary of Société Générale, employ digital assets and stablecoins in settling tokenized bonds. Other institutions that took part in this trial were BNP Paribas, acting as the paying agent, and Intesa Sanpaolo, acting as the custodian.

This trial proved that it is possible for tokenized bonds to employ financial messaging infrastructure without losing the benefits that come with blockchain technology.

In this way, financial institutions can move through digital assets without necessarily having extensive knowledge of blockchain technology. By managing multiple platform transactions as a unified process, Swift has managed to simplify the process of settlement and increase scalability in the market through interoperability and standardization of digital financial solutions.

Building a Shared Ledger for the Future

Swift’s trials having concluded, it is set to incorporate a blockchain-based ledger system into its existing architecture. The common ledger should help to achieve real-time and 24/7 cross-border payment capabilities.

This will ensure a safe environment for transactions, ensuring synchronization between the timing and results for all involved parties. The ledger system of Swift is based on its messaging and API platform and is expanding into the digital world.

State of play: Lurie framed his first year as mayor as a reset after a period of stalled progress on entrenched city challenges, casting progress on public safety and street conditions as the foundation of recovery.

He touted affordability as the next, harder chapter that will determine whether families and businesses can remain in the city long term.

Lurie — a Levi Strauss heir who ran on the promise of restoring public safety — cited broad improvements, noting falling crime and traffic deaths, rebounding police recruitment, fewer homeless encampments, and rising downtown foot traffic and office leasing.

To maintain momentum, he argued, the city must now prioritize turning those gains into lasting change.

What they're saying: ""Our recovery is underway — the work now is to make it durable for everyone,"" Lurie said while speaking to a crowd of supporters, city and state officials, and residents at Angelo J. Rossi Playground in the Richmond.

The big picture: Lurie's affordability-first message aligns him with a growing bloc of Democratic leaders nationwide prioritizing cost-of-living relief.

Zoom in: Lurie announced a wide-ranging plan called the ""Family Opportunity Agenda"" to make housing, child care, education, food, health care, and transportation costs more affordable for residents.

A central pillar of the plan is universal access to child care for San Francisco families with children under age 5. Starting this month, the city is expanding free and subsidized care at more than 500 providers citywide.

Families of four earning under $230,000 will qualify for free child care, while those making up to $310,000 will receive a 50% subsidy.

""When tech booms, opportunity grows, but so does anxiety about rising rents, displacement and a boom-and-bust cycle that has historically left far too many people behind,"" Lurie said. ""Opportunity and stability must rise together for every resident in every neighborhood.""

Zoom out: Lurie also hopes to stabilize public transit funding, push for more government changes like charter reform, simplify permitting processes and close the city's budget deficit.

Approach 2: Compagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin Société en commandite par actions Price vs Earnings

For a profitable business, the P/E ratio is a useful yardstick because it links what you pay for the shares to the earnings the company is already generating. It helps you gauge how many euros the market is willing to pay today for each euro of current earnings.

What counts as a “normal” or “fair” P/E depends on how the market views a company’s growth prospects and risk profile. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually means a lower multiple is more typical.

Michelin currently trades on a P/E of 13.38x. That sits below the Auto Components industry average P/E of 20.55x and also below the peer average of 17.92x. Simply Wall St’s proprietary Fair Ratio for Michelin is 12.69x. This Fair Ratio aims to estimate the P/E you would expect for the company after accounting for its earnings growth outlook, industry, profit margins, market value and risk characteristics. Because it is tailored to Michelin’s own fundamentals, it offers a more targeted reference point than broad industry or peer comparisons alone.

With the actual P/E of 13.38x slightly above the Fair Ratio of 12.69x, the shares look modestly expensive relative to this metric.

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce Narratives. Narratives are simply your story about a company connected directly to numbers like your fair value, revenue, earnings and margin assumptions, so that its business story, financial forecast and fair value all line up in one clear view.

On Simply Wall St, Narratives live on the Community page and are easy to use, even if you are not a valuation expert. They show you a fair value based on your assumptions and set that against the current price so you can decide whether the gap between value and price is large enough for you to consider buying or selling.

Narratives also update automatically when new information arrives, such as news or earnings. This means your view on Compagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin Société en commandite par actions can evolve in real time without you rebuilding a model from scratch. You can see, for example, how one investor might focus on a higher fair value closer to €43.00 based on confidence in premium mix and margins, while another might anchor around €28.00 because they are more cautious about competition, regulation and volume risks.

Broadening S&P 500 earnings growth expected in 2026

Tech sector's dominance challenged by valuation concerns and AI uncertainty

NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - After years of watching technology stocks drive the U.S. bull market, investors are betting the rally will broaden to industrial, healthcare and small-cap companies, with a chance they can catch up and assert market leadership.

Stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab, Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab and Broadcom (AVGO.O), opens new tab have buoyed the market's enduring rally, in which the S&P 500 (.SPX), opens new tab has risen over 90% since the bull market began more than three years ago.

But investors have become wary of expensive tech valuations amid uncertainty over the AI theme that propelled market gains, concerns that helped other stocks make inroads.

Shares of industrial, healthcare and small-cap companies have outperformed the S&P 500 since the end of October, while the tech sector has declined. That rotation was on display on Wednesday as the S&P 500 tech sector (.SPLRCT), opens new tab fell more steeply than broader market indexes.

""There is a lot of hope that this is going to be the year where we are going to see some true broadening of leadership,"" said Angelo Kourkafas, senior global investment strategist at Edward Jones. ""The conditions are likely in place for that broadening to happen, especially when you sprinkle in and consider elevated valuations, there are some pockets of value that can be found looking beyond technology.""

Fourth-quarter earnings reports in coming weeks will factor into the broadening trend's durability. A wide swath of sectors is expected to show solid profits in 2026.

""Strategists have been predicting better earnings for a long time, but I really think it has legs this year,"" said Nanette Abuhoff Jacobson, global investment strategist at Hartford Funds. ""We're starting to see the AI benefits filtering through to such a broad collection of sectors.""

'AVERAGE' S&P 500 STOCK NOT SO AVERAGE

Tech and tech-related stocks led much of the bull run that began in October 2022, just before the launch of chatbot ChatGPT that sparked enthusiasm for AI-linked shares.

Late last year, the trend began to turn. One factor has been concerns AI investments would not yield sufficient returns to justify elevated valuations, investors said.

""With some questions being raised on tech, investors are looking at, what are other areas that I could invest in,"" said Keith Lerner, chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services.

In another sign of broadening, the equal-weight version of the S&P 500 (.SPXEW), opens new tab, which is a gauge for the average stock in the index, has gained over 5% since the end of October. That tops a 1% rise for the standard S&P 500, which is more heavily influenced by heavyweight stocks.

EARNINGS GROWTH FOR ALL SECTORS

More expansive profit growth stands to support wider stock gains. Each of the 11 S&P 500 sectors is expected to show earnings up at least 7% this year, according to LSEG IBES.

Megacaps have been responsible for a huge chunk of earnings growth, but their advantage over smaller companies is shrinking. The ""Magnificent Seven,"" which includes Nvidia, Alphabet and Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab, are expected to grow earnings by 23.5% in 2026, against a 13% rise for the rest of the S&P 500, according to Tajinder Dhillon, head of earnings research at LSEG.

""If, in fact, that gap in earnings growth narrows between the Mag 7 and everyone else, I think we'll get a broadening,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Investment Management. ""If it doesn't, then it's likely the Mag 7 will continue to be leadership.""

In a report this week titled ""The Broadening Is Underway,"" Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson said the median S&P 500 stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 19 times, against a P/E of 22 for the cap-weighted index.

Improving valuations on top of strong earnings for the median or average stock could be a ""wildcard"" for 2026, Wilson said in the report.

TECH'S DOMINANT MARKET PRESENCE

To be sure, tech's massive presence - the sector accounts for one-third of the S&P 500's weight - means it likely will remain a force in U.S. stocks, while the market may struggle if tech falters.

Over the past decade, the S&P 500 has never gained at least 10% on an annualized basis when the tech sector has lagged the aggregate performance of the other 10 S&P 500 sectors during those periods, according to Citi Wealth.

Meanwhile, tech is generating outsized profits. The sector is expected to increase earnings by over 30% in 2026, against 15.5% for the S&P 500 overall.

After last year recommending clients overweight in ""growth"" stocks, which include tech and other AI-exposed names, Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers, said he has been suggesting to investors that they balance more with ""value"" stocks, which include financials and industrials.

But Matt Lyteson, IBM’s CIO and VP of technology platform transformation, said IBM has been a leader in AI for years.

Some analysts believe it’s more of a PR than a product problem.

The market has seen IBM “significantly” lag behind Microsoft in AI and cloud growth because of the focus on tailored solutions rather than scalable cloud services for the public, according to Seeking Alpha’s 2025 reporting.

Making a case. But Matt Lyteson, IBM’s CIO and VP of technology platform transformation, said IBM has been a leader in AI for years. His goal is to capitalize on IBM’s technology and scale it for the enterprise.

“We very quickly asked ourselves: ‘What does agentic AI look like at the enterprise scale, and what are we going to focus on?’” Lyteson said. “When we think about the enterprise context, the real value is doing these end-to-end workflows.”

Lyteson believes it’s “great” that companies can garner attention with AI consumer experiences, but enterprises have a totally different set of questions and concerns, including how to ensure agentic identity management, equality of interactions with team members, or safety with interactions.

“Those are all the things that IBM is addressing head on,” Lyteson said. “Quite frankly, the market’s ignoring that.”

What’s the issue? While Microsoft has Copilot and Google has Gemini, IBM isn’t driving AI adoption via a single product or platform, which can make it hard to determine its place in the AI conversation, according to Rick Villars, group vice president of worldwide research at IDC.

“What IBM does—how we assess their impact—is [that] their strength as an organization broadly is with larger enterprises globally,” Villars said. “They’re at the core of many businesses.”

But the broader market, Villars said, doesn’t have high visibility into IBM’s solutions or deployment, and therefore the company is judged by how effectively it helps customers navigate through the AI craze.

“It’s a complex story that they have, and so they have to deal with that…Because as they’ve pivoted as a company, they’re in midstream of story development,” Villars said. “They have a very loyal customer base of people who want to read the story and want to see the drafts and everything else, but go beyond that and to build that presence.”

Issues with Watson. IBM’s AI tool Watson, which could be seen as synonymous with Microsoft’s Copilot, was spun into existence almost 20 years ago as a platform for competing on Jeopardy!. In 2020, IBM released a beta version of Watson Assistant that acted as a chatbot, combining machine learning, transfer learning, and deep learning techniques onto a single platform.

IBM then released Watson Health in 2015, designed to help with cancer research and other healthcare challenges, which subsequently ran into significant challenges and was sold off parts to a private equity firm in 2022.

Now, IBM has Watsonx, an umbrella term for the company’s portfolio of AI products. As of December 2025, Watsonx can monitor agents at runtime, giving IT pros insight into how their agentic AI is performing and how users are interacting with it.

The old Watson, Villars said, is not the same as Watsonx: “While they’re very different, it does affect how people see what IBM was doing or is doing, so it’s something that they have to work hard to be very clear about what they’re explaining and what it is. I’d say it’s a challenge that they do face.”

What we can expect to come. There’s one area where IT professionals can expect to see IBM go more in-depth: data governance,which remains a key part of agentic AI.

Villars said this is more about data in motion, as a result of agentic AI focusing on “event-driven activity” (such as when a software or smartphone company tracks how people use a particular app).

“IBM has an amazing event stream…but they didn’t have a very AI-connected way of making that event information consumable,” Villars said. “I think you’re going to see announcements around how they can.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/6e46a9d6cee5cbeafe3f7505927f0df1dbbb09c7-5000x3327.jpg?rect=0,351,5000,2625&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2026-01-15 16:02:22.331440

01/15/2026 - 02:01 PM

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - January 15, 2026) - Masivo Silver Corp. (TSXV: MASS) (OTC Pink: GNYPF) (""Masivo"" or the ""Company"") reports that ongoing field operations at its newly optioned Cerro Colorado Project in Sonora, Mexico, will significantly ramp up with field crews, drill crews and equipment mobilizing to the project preparation for its 1500 meters Phase I drill program.

With environmental approvals in place and private property access agreement, current activities include rehabilitation of access routes, construction of drill pads, and site preparation required to support drilling. These steps represent the final stages of preparation prior to commencement of drilling.

Project Advancement Highlights and Ongoing Field Activities

Masivo is currently undertaking the following activities at Cerro Colorado:

Mobilized field crews, drill crews and required equipment to site

Rehabilitation of access routes to priority target areas

Construction of drill pads for the Phase I program

Secured drilling contractors and water-supply infrastructure

Finalizing logistics to support continuous drilling

The Phase I drill program has been designed to test a number of priority targets identified through surface sampling, geological mapping, and review of historical data. The Company's initial drill program is designed to test targets with strong potential for a silver discovery.

Historical Sampling Highlights and Geological Context

Historical records from the Consejo de Recursos Naturales No Renovables (now the Servicio Geológico Mexicano- SGM) document high grade Silver, Gold and base metal values from underground workings on the property.

A historical sample reportedly collected in November 1972 by Ing. Adalberto Vázquez P. from, what is now a collapsed tunnel, on the main mineralized structure returned values of 2,200 g/t silver (Ag) and 4.57 g/t gold (Au).

Approximately 400 meters northeast, a second historical sieve sample taken from mine dump material associated with another collapsed tunnel on the same concession reportedly returned values of 1,840 g/t silver (Ag), 4.8 g/t gold (Au), 3.06% copper (Cu), 4.5% lead (Pb) and 2.92% zinc (Zn).

These historical samples are selective in nature and may not be representative of broader mineralization. However, they provide geological context and support the presence of a multi-metal mineralizing system, which has informed current target selection.

Management Commentary

David Coburn, President and CEO of Masivo Silver Corp., commented:

""We are excited to launch our maiden drill program at Cerro Colorado. After significant effort compiling historical information, completing detailed geological mapping, and carrying out systematic sampling, we have selected what we believe are the most geologically compelling targets. There is scale potential as seen with the historical sampling over a large mineral system footprint. The upcoming drill program is designed to test these targets for the potential to make a Silver discovery.""

Senior Geologist Jorge Rafael Gallardo added:

""The historic samples at Cerro Colorado clearly demonstrate that this is a productive mineral system capable of returning high grades over a significant footprint . While these results are selective and historical in nature, they provide invaluable geological insight and strongly support our current targeting strategy. We are confident that the upcoming drill program is designed to properly evaluate the scale and continuity of this mineralized system.""

Technical Oversight

The Phase I drill program has been designed and will be carried out under the supervision of Jorge Rafael Gallardo, Senior Geologist, together with Mark Bailey, P.Geo., and Brian Brewer, P.Geo., who is the Qualified Person as defined under NI 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the technical content of this news release.

CEOs from JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon to Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan warned that interference with the outgoing Fed chair could undermine the foundation of the U.S. economy. Their comments come as President Donald Trump ramps up his public pressure on the Fed, which he has spent the past few months criticizing over its perceived reluctance to cut interest rates. Those efforts have included threatening to fire Powell and nominating loyalists to fill the central bank’s board vacancies.

The administration’s attempt to twist the Fed’s arm reached a crescendo earlier this week, when Powell revealed that the central bank had received subpoenas from the Department of Justice (DoJ) related to the $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed headquarters in Washington, D.C. According to Powell, the probe is a thinly veiled attempt to push for faster rate cuts. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,” he said in a statement.

Wall Street executives might not back all of Powell’s decisions. But one thing they broadly agree on is that the Fed’s autonomy is key to a sustainable economy—one free from short-term political pressures.

“Everyone we know believes in Fed independence,” said Dimon during a recent call with reporters. “Anything [that] chips away at that is probably not a great idea, and in my view will have the reverse consequences,” added the CEO, who noted that the DoJ’s investigation could eventually lead to higher inflation expectations and interest rates over time.

Dimon’s comments marked a departure from the executive’s earlier stance. He has managed to stay in Trump’s good graces by striking a more measured tone on policy disagreements. He also drew a rebuke from the President himself, who called the JPMorgan head “wrong” and suggested that Dimon “probably wants higher rates—maybe he makes more money that way.”

Much of Wall Street has sought to remain on Trump’s good side so far in his second term. But the President’s escalating attacks on the Fed appear to have crossed a line for many banking leaders, prompting an outpouring of support for Powell. Jeremy Barnum, JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, echoed Dimon earlier this week, telling reporters that “loss of Fed independence tends to lead to steeper yield curves and other damage to ongoing economic dynamism,” with the potential to harm both the U.S. economy and “global economic stability.”

Robin Vince, head of the Bank of New York Mellon, also criticized the investigation, calling it a “counter-productive” move that could put the bond market at risk. “Doing things that are going to detract from that agenda don’t seem like the best things to do now,” he said.

It is “fair game” to offer critical commentary on the Fed’s decisions, including whether policymakers are acting too quickly or too slowly, according to Moynihan. But the Bank of America CEO draws the line when it comes to threatening the central bank’s autonomy, which he described as essential to American prosperity. “An independent Fed provides an anchor in this country to a success that all of us believe in,” he told CNBC yesterday (Jan. 14).

Support for Powell has extended beyond sitting CEOs to former economic officials. More than a dozen past leaders, including former Fed chairs Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan, issued a statement on Jan. 12 warning that such attacks have “no place” in the U.S. They described the approach as akin to how “monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly.”",https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/GettyImages-2235991263.jpg?quality=80,N,,2026-01-15 17:03:05.297478

Instacart (NASDAQ:CART), the online grocery delivery service, saw its stock price drop by 3.3% during the afternoon trading session. This decline followed news that Kroger, a major grocery retailer, has expanded its delivery services through partnerships with Uber Eats and Postmates. With this move, Kroger now offers delivery from nearly 2,700 stores nationwide, including brands such as Ralphs and Fred Meyer. As a result, Kroger's full product lineup is now available on popular on-demand delivery platforms, putting it in direct competition with Instacart. Investors reacted with concern, fearing that this convenient alternative could erode Instacart’s share of the market, sending the stock to its lowest point in almost two months.

Market reactions to news can sometimes be exaggerated, and significant price drops may create opportunities to purchase strong companies at a discount. Is this a good moment to consider buying Instacart shares?

Understanding the Market’s Response

Instacart’s stock is known for its volatility, having experienced 18 swings of more than 5% over the past year. In this context, today’s decline suggests that investors view the latest news as significant, though not enough to fundamentally alter their outlook on the company.

The last notable movement occurred 24 days ago, when Instacart’s shares fell by 2.2% after the company announced the end of a controversial pricing strategy and agreed to pay $60 million to settle with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

This pricing strategy relied on artificial intelligence to display different prices for the same product to different customers. The practice was discontinued after consumer advocacy groups raised concerns, prompting an FTC investigation. The $60 million settlement addressed claims that Instacart misled customers by advertising free deliveries while still imposing mandatory service fees, and by enrolling users in its paid membership program without clear consent. These incidents have sparked questions about Instacart’s business ethics and customer trust.

Since the start of the year, Instacart’s stock has dropped 10.3%. At $39.40 per share, it currently trades 25.9% below its 52-week high of $53.15, reached in February 2025. Investors who purchased $1,000 of Instacart stock at its IPO in September 2023 would now see their investment grow to $1,169.

The reverse stock split removed the risk that the company could be delisted from the Nasdaq exchange for falling below the $1 per share minimum pricing requirement, but it was also followed by a substantial valuation pullback for the stock. While a higher share price can sometimes be attractive from a psychological standpoint for some investors, reverse stock splits are often followed by big sell-offs.

Lucid stock also lost ground following fundraising moves. In November, the company announced that it had completed sales of new stock. The company generated roughly $962.4 million in proceeds from the sale to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) and other institutional investors, and it used roughly $752.2 million to repurchase outstanding 1.25% convertible senior notes due to mature this year. While the share sale gave the company some extra flexibility, it once again had a dilutive impact for shareholders.

Why Lucid stock has continued to stall in 2026

At the beginning of 2026, Lucid published its Q4 and full-year production and delivery numbers for 2025. The company produced 18,378 vehicles last year and delivered 15,841 vehicles -- good for growth of 104% and 55%, respectively. While production has gone up dramatically, growth for deliveries appears to be decelerating.

On Jan. 6, Baird published new coverage on Lucid and maintained a neutral rating on the stock. On the other hand, the investment firm lowered its one-year price target on the stock from $17 per share to $14 per share.

Lucid stock has continued to lose ground in response to the underwhelming deliveries data and new analyst coverage. The stock has fallen 1.8% year to date despite the Nasdaq Composite index climbing 1.9% across the stretch.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F850620%2Fgettyimages-83077315-copy.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-15 18:03:50.167987

People are perfectly comfortable using generative AI at home.
Second is generative AI or natural language processing.
Machine learning and generative AI belong in the hands of everyday employees.
The rest will be left explaining to their boards why billions were spent for pennies in return.","Deloitte's 2025 analysis reveals that only 6% of organizations see AI deliver ROI within a year, while most projects take two to four years to break even, if they ever do. That gap between expectation and reality is quickly becoming a career risk. Boards are no longer asking whether AI is strategic. They are asking why the returns are missing and who is accountable.

The problem is that AI works, but our approach doesn't. In most organizations, AI is treated as a centralized, technical initiative. It lives in IT. It is managed by a small group of specialists. It is rolled out through long, expensive programs designed to ""transform the enterprise."" Frontline employees, the people who actually sell, operate, analyze, and serve customers, are largely spectators. That approach almost guarantees disappointment.

I see another dynamic at play as well: anxiety. People are perfectly comfortable using generative AI at home. They will ask the AI questions, plan trips, or explore ideas without hesitation. At work, that confidence evaporates. Employees worry about policies, compliance, making mistakes, or ""doing AI wrong."" So, they step back and wait for permission. Or worse, they wait for IT to solve everything for them.

The result is predictable. Projects balloon in scope. Timelines stretch to nine or 12 months. Budgets hit seven figures. And when the promised savings don't materialize, the initiative is labeled a failure. What makes this particularly frustrating is that, for the most part, the value of AI does not require moonshots.

One reason organizations overspend is that they lump all AI into a single, mysterious category. It helps to separate it into three distinct flavors.

First is machine learning. This is pattern recognition based on historical data, and by that I mean predictive maintenance, demand forecasting, and anomaly detection. If you already have data, these solutions can often be deployed in weeks, not years, for hundreds or thousands of dollars.

Second is generative AI or natural language processing. These tools work with text, ideas, images, and audio. They summarize documents, draft content, analyze proposals, generate reports, and automate knowledge work. Many of the highest-impact use cases I see cost less than a hundred dollars a month and save hours per employee every week.

Third is agentic AI. This is where systems plan and act autonomously. It is powerful, complex, and expensive. It requires technical expertise, careful rules, and real investment. This is the domain of IT and advanced teams.

The mistake is starting with the third flavor and ignoring the first two. Machine learning and generative AI belong in the hands of everyday employees. These are low-cost, low-risk tools with immediate returns. Saving even six or eight hours a week for a salesperson, analyst, or operations manager is real money. Time saved becomes time reinvested in customers, revenue, and better decisions. Multiply that across a workforce, and the ROI becomes obvious.

Agentic AI, meanwhile, should remain the playground for technical teams pursuing high-risk, high-reward innovation. Let IT chase the five percent opportunities. But do not bet the company on them.

In my time at Process Innovation, Inc. (PPI), I have watched organizations waste staggering amounts of money by assuming they need the Cadillac version of AI when a Schwinn would do just fine. Leaders chase massive savings targets, declare victory only if millions appear on the balance sheet, and overlook hundreds of small wins that compound into real advantage.

There is a counterargument, of course. Some believe that decentralizing AI is risky, that governance, security, and consistency demand tight control. Those concerns are valid. But control does not have to mean paralysis. Paid, secure tools trained on internal data are far safer and more effective than pretending employees won't experiment anyway.

The bigger risk is doing nothing or doing everything at once. Right now, many companies are effectively gambling on their slim chance of success. They are buying Powerball tickets and calling it a strategy. A far smarter approach is to fund dozens or hundreds of small experiments, each tied to a real business problem, each with clear ownership and fast feedback.

If you want a practical starting point, give every employee a modest AI budget and a simple mandate: identify one task you do regularly and use AI to make it better. Support experimentation, reward results, and measure time saved and decisions improved, not just dollars spent.

The money being wasted on AI today is not inevitable. It is the consequence of poor framing, misplaced control, and unrealistic expectations. The organizations that fix this now, by decentralizing AI, empowering their people, and focusing on steady, measurable wins, will be the ones leading their industries tomorrow. The rest will be left explaining to their boards why billions were spent for pennies in return.

Shares of medical device company Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) fell 4.6% in the afternoon session after the company agreed to acquire Penumbra in a transaction valued at approximately $14.5 billion, marking its largest deal in two decades.

The acquisition, a mix of cash and stock, aimed to expand Boston Scientific's portfolio of cardiovascular devices, particularly in high-growth vascular and neurovascular markets. However, the market reacted negatively to the news. To finance the roughly $11 billion cash portion of the deal, the company planned to use a combination of cash on hand and new debt. Boston Scientific also stated that the acquisition was expected to be dilutive, or reduce, its adjusted earnings per share in the first full year after the deal's closing.

The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Boston Scientific? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.

What Is The Market Telling Us

Boston Scientific’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 3 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 9 months ago when the stock gained 8.5% on the news that the company reported first quarter 2025 results that beat analysts' sales and EPS expectations. Organic sales growth topped the company's own forecast and was led by a 25.6% surge in its Cardiovascular segment, a signal that demand in its largest business is accelerating. Looking ahead, its revenue guidance for next quarter exceeded Wall Street's estimates. Overall, we think this was a decent quarter with some key metrics above expectations.

Boston Scientific is down 4.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $90.08 per share, it is trading 16.7% below its 52-week high of $108.14 from September 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Boston Scientific’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,480.",https://news-assets.stockstory.org/cover-images/boston-scientific-cover-image-43c4a53384fd_2025-02-03-172625_aohi.jpeg,N,,2026-01-15 15:02:29.128470

While everyone chases the next meme ticker, this industrial heavyweight has been stacking gains like it’s on easy mode. So the real talk question: are you seriously sleeping on Parker-Hannifin, or is the hype just not built for your bag?

Let’s break it down in scroll-friendly, no-fluff mode – price moves, clout level, rivals, and whether this is a must-have or a hard drop.

The Hype is Real: Parker-Hannifin on TikTok and Beyond

Parker-Hannifin isn’t exactly a household name on your FYP – it’s not an AI chatbot, not a crypto, not a gadget you can unbox. It’s a monster behind the scenes: motion control, hydraulics, aerospace, factory automation. Basically, the stuff that keeps planes flying, robots moving, and factories not catching fire.

Social buzz? It’s low-key – but that might be your edge. While hype traders chase whatever’s trending, long-term money is quietly watching industrials like this. Finance creators, dividend nerds, and value investors are starting to drop more Parker-Hannifin mentions in breakdown videos and ""boring stocks making dumb money"" threads.

Right now, Parker-Hannifin is more ""finance TikTok sleeper pick"" than ""full send viral."" That can flip fast if earnings keep beating and industrial AI, automation, and defense themes stay hot.

Market Watch: The Business Side – Parker-Hannifin Aktie

Here’s where it gets real, because price action doesn’t lie.

Live data check: Using multiple financial sources (including Yahoo Finance and at least one other major market data provider), Parker-Hannifin Corporation (ticker: PH, ISIN: US7010941019) is currently trading around the upper end of its historical range. As of the latest available market data (time-stamped from live feeds on the current day), the stock is sitting close to its recently recorded highs, with a market cap firmly in big-league territory and a price that reflects strong institutional demand.

If markets are closed where you’re reading this, what you’re seeing on your app will likely show the last close price, not live action. But across the major platforms checked, the picture matches: this is not a bargain-bin stock – it’s priced like a proven winner.

Performance-wise, Parker-Hannifin has been punching above its ""boring industrial"" label. Over recent periods, it’s outpaced a lot of traditional industrial peers and held its own against the wider market, riding themes like:

Automation and robotics build-out – factories are upgrading hard.

Defense and aerospace demand – more gear means more systems and components.

Infrastructure and reshoring – more stuff built at home needs Parker-grade hardware.

Real talk: this is the opposite of a penny play. You’re paying a premium for a company that’s already delivering. The question is: does the next chapter still have upside?

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

Forget the 200-page investor deck. Here’s the simplified, scrollable version: the three biggest reasons Parker-Hannifin even shows up on serious watchlists.

1. It’s Wired Into Every Big Trend You Hear About

You like AI, robots, aerospace, EVs, clean energy, smart factories? Parker-Hannifin is the behind-the-scenes plug for a ton of that. The company builds motion and control systems – think hydraulics, pneumatics, filters, sealing, and complex systems that make heavy machines not just move, but move safely and efficiently.

Whenever a factory gets more automated, a plane gets upgraded, or a new industrial system rolls out, there’s a decent chance something Parker-related is in the blueprint. That kind of ""picks and shovels"" role is why long-term investors love it. The hype headlines may be about AI or EV brands, but the real money often piles into the suppliers that quietly bill everyone.

2. The Stock Has That ""No-Drama Overachiever"" Energy

This is not the type of ticker that goes up 40% overnight because a celebrity tweeted about it. But if you zoom out, Parker-Hannifin’s chart tells a very different story than your average meme stock flameout.

Across multiple time frames checked on major financial platforms, Parker-Hannifin shows:

Solid long-term uptrend – it’s rewarded patient holders.

Resilience in rough markets – not invincible, but not a collapse machine.

Consistent execution – earnings and cash flow that match its ""grown-up"" price tag.

Is it cheap? No. Is it a total flop for the price? Also no. It’s closer to a ""you pay up because it actually delivers"" situation.

3. Boring On Social, Serious In Real Life

Clout level from a Gen Z / millennial angle? Low for now. It’s not a brand you wear, not an app you flex, not something that throws influencer trips. But ask people actually working in aerospace, heavy equipment, or industrial automation, and the respect is there.

Because this company isn’t chasing virality, it focuses on what actually matters to long-term investors:

Big, sticky customers who don’t churn every five minutes.

High switching costs – if your jet or plant runs on Parker systems, you don’t just swap overnight.

Margins and cash flow that look way better than the brand recognition would suggest.

So is it a game-changer? From a ""change the world overnight"" standpoint – no. From a ""quietly compound your portfolio if you hold and chill"" standpoint – it’s absolutely in that conversation.

Parker-Hannifin vs. The Competition

Every stock has a villain. For Parker-Hannifin, picture a cage match with other industrial and automation giants. Think big names in motion control, automation, and aerospace components. Different companies get love for different reasons – some for pure automation software, some for diversified industrial exposure, some for more cyclical vibes.

On the scoreboard that matters to you:

Clout war: A lot of younger investors know the big automation brands before they know Parker-Hannifin. From a brand-awareness POV, Parker is playing more stealth mode than headline act.

Execution: When you check revenue growth, margins, and long-term returns, Parker-Hannifin hangs with the best of them. It’s not the loudest, but the numbers back it up.

Valuation: Versus key rivals, Parker tends to trade at a valuation that signals ""high quality, not screaming cheap."" That’s the tradeoff – you pay for the track record.

If we’re picking a winner in the pure clout war, Parker-Hannifin loses to names that trend more on social and show up more in retail portfolios. But if the battle is who actually prints money and compounds over time, Parker looks way more competitive.

The real edge? Because Parker isn’t meme-ified, there’s less random sentiment whiplash and more price action driven by earnings, orders, and real industrial demand.

Is It Worth the Hype?

Here’s where it gets spicy. You’ve got a stock that:

Is trading near high levels according to current live data.

Has a long-term winning record.

Is plugged into almost every big industrial megatrend.

But you also have:

High expectations baked in – the market already knows it’s good.

Limited viral upside – it’s not going to moon just because it’s trending on your FYP.

Real business risk – if industrial demand slows or big projects get cut, the stock can absolutely take a hit.

So is it ""worth the hype""? Depends what game you’re playing:

If you want YOLO, 10x in a year, gamble energy – this is not your play.

If you want ""sleep at night"" industrial exposure with a strong track record – this is exactly the type of name serious investors study.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

Let’s land this.

Is Parker-Hannifin a game-changer? In culture – no. In industrial reality – yes. It’s one of those companies that help make the flashy stuff work, without grabbing any of the spotlight.

Is it a must-have? If you’re building a long-term, diversified portfolio and you want exposure to automation, aerospace, and industrial infrastructure, this sits in strong ""must-watch"" territory. For some investors, especially those into quality industrials, it’s already a must-have core holding.

Is there a price drop coming? Nobody can call the next candle. What’s clear from the current pricing: the stock isn’t cheap, and the bar is high. Any earnings miss, slowdown in orders, or macro shock could trigger a pullback. If you’re the type who likes buying quality names on dips, Parker-Hannifin is exactly the stock you bookmark and stalk for better entries.

Real talk:

As a flex on social, this stock is mid.

As a long-term, fundamentals-first play, it looks powerful.

As a short-term trade, you’re basically betting on near-term earnings and macro news.

Only 17% said that they “actively” use AI to support decision making.","New research released today by Capgemini indicates that enterprise leaders are looking beyond the hype surrounding AI and are taking a more pragmatic approach to its use. However, leaders remain shy about disclosing publicly its use in decision making.

The research, ""The multi-year AI advantage: Building the enterprise of tomorrow"" surveyed more than 1500 executives globally, 38% of organisations already operationalise generative AI use cases, while six in ten organisations are now exploring the application of agentic AI.

China is more advanced than the US and Europe with 46% of Chinese organisations are piloting or deploying agentic AI, as opposed to 40% in the US and 30% in Europe.

Researchers also found that data sovereignty is emerging as a critical priority for 2026 which is perhaps unsurprising given the sharp deterioration in relations between the US and Europe, and the tumultuous state of geopolitics more broadly.

54% prioritise data sovereignty, keen to ensure that their confidential data remains within their control, regardless of platform. AI sovereignty is subsequently gaining in importance as organisations understand the link between the data feeding these models and outcomes.

Nonetheless, the market for generative and agentic AI is still at least partly driven by FOMO. Two thirds of business leaders expressed a fear of being left behind strategically if their competitors got ahead in the race to scale up AI deployments.

The desire not to be left behind even overrode concerns about the prospect of an AI winter setting in. Most of those surveyed acknowledged the likelihood of the optimism and financial confidence in AI starting to ebb, but 80% said that they planned to wait it out by focusing on foundational capabilities such as the data and infrastructure. 72% planned to prioritise low cost, high impact initiatives. A smaller proportion (57%) said that they intended to keep hold of “core talent and knowledge.”

AI winter or not, organisations are planning to accelerate AI investments. They are just doing so more selectively, prioritizing functions with well-defined processes and measurable outcomes. On average, they expect to allocate 5% of their annual business budget to AI initiatives in 2026, up from 3% in 2025.

Capgemini’s researchers also note that organisations have evolved in the way that they measure AI success. It's not all about cost reduction. New measures of ROI include revenue growth, risk management and compliance, knowledge management and customer experience and personalisation.

AI is reshaping decision-making, but few will admit it

Additional research from Capgemini shines a light on executive decision making. ""How AI is quietly reshaping executive decisions"", surveyed 500 C-level executives, including 100 CEOs. It finds that more than half of this group uses AI to support or inform their strategic decision-making in some way.

Only 17% said that they “actively” use AI to support decision making. 42% did so “selectively”, and 31% are currently “experimenting” with it. However, the proportion expecting to use AI actively within one to three years is 38%.

Early adoption is already delivering value. More than half of executives reported reduced time and cost to make decisions, and improvements in creativity and foresight from the use of AI.

However, leaders are clear that AI should not be considered a replacement for human judgement – wisely given the propensity of generative AI to make mistakes or just make things up. Only 41% described their level of trust in AI for executive decision-making as “above-average.” Leaders were mindful of legal and security risks, and the difficulty of explaining decisions to others when they were AI-influenced.

A particularly interesting finding of this piece of research is a dichotomy between private enthusiasm for using AI, and public reticence to admit doing so. Only 11% of executives were prepared to highlight publicly the use of AI in business decisions.

Why the shyness around such a transformative technology? Those who prefer not to disclose AI use cite concerns about reputational risk if AI-influenced decisions go wrong and uncertainty around how other people - clients, partners and the public - perceive AI use.",https://www.computing.co.uk/news-analysis/media_16f31547ec1202978ced5805758914880e9c161cd.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2026-01-15 14:03:38.262534

Dive Brief:

After the bank’s headcount remained neutral in 2025, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said Wednesday he expects its employee total to drop this year.

The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender, which has had about 213,000 employees for the past two years, has leaned into artificial intelligence capabilities in recent years. With expense discipline in mind, “the No. 1 thing,” Moynihan said during the bank’s fourth-quarter earnings call, is “work the headcount through operational excellence and applications of new technologies, including AI.”

Citi and Wells Fargo are also projecting job cuts this year. Citi CEO Jane Fraser, in a Wednesday memo to employees seen by Bloomberg, said the “bar is raised” for working at the bank. “I expect to see the last vestiges of old, bad habits fall away, and a more disciplined, more confident, winning Citi emerge in 2026,” Fraser wrote.

Dive Insight:

Bank of America brought on about 17,000 new employees in 2025, to fill roles that were vacated. “Every time someone leaves, we take the opportunity to evaluate whether the role needs to be replaced,” the bank’s CFO, Alastair Borthwick, said Wednesday.

BofA notched productivity improvements through AI and digitalization last year, enabling the bank to add client-facing employees while eliminating operational support work and roles, Borthwick said.

Moynihan pointed to the bank’s audit team as an example where an AI-powered capability that’s been built could result in a smaller team. The unit had grown in recent years to handle “the regulatory onslaught,” Moynihan said.

BofA also added 2,000 new college graduates last year, executives noted. Headcount is the bank’s top expense driver.

“If you look at the expense load, it comes from people and it comes from the benefits and compensation, and it ultimately comes from the buildings and computer systems to allow them to do the great job for clients,” Moynihan said. “So that's what we're working on.”

In its consumer segment, the bank has cut headcount by nearly half over the past 15 years – from 101,000 in 2011 to 55,000 today, executives said during a November investor day.

The bank spends about $13 billion on technology annually, with about $4 billion allocated to new initiatives. That includes “several hundred million dollars” on AI investments, with some 20 different projects in process across the company, such as the audit team example, Moynihan said.

Meanwhile, Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf on Wednesday said the San Francisco-based bank has more tools to achieve greater efficiency than it ever has, “especially with AI.”

The lender’s headcount has dropped by about 25% since the second quarter of 2020, he said as the bank reported earnings Wednesday.

Wells ended 2025 with about 205,000 employees, and $612 million in severance costs led to higher expenses in the fourth quarter of the year.

Scharf said in December he expected the bank would have fewer employees heading into this year. He called the long-term impact of AI on the bank’s headcount “extremely significant” and said the lender aims to “use attrition as our friend.”

At Citi, CFO Mark Mason buttressed Fraser’s memo, saying the bank has made headway on its plan to trim 20,000 jobs by the end of this year and added he expects a further decline in headcount in 2026 and subsequent years.

Fraser, for her part, noted the bank’s progress on resolving regulatory issues, adding that completion of those tasks may result in some roles being eliminated.

The private credit universe has matured dramatically over the past decade, but the latest data from S&P Global’s With Intelligence suggests the asset class is facing its first significant downturn test.

After a prolonged period of strong US direct lending growth, a combination of higher risk behavior, rising defaults and a pivot toward European markets signals a changing competitive landscape for investors and their clients.

A key stress indicator for private credit in 2025 has been a subtle uptick in selective defaults and the growing prevalence of payment-in-kind structures, where interest is added to loan principal rather than paid in cash. Taken at face value, headline default rates remained below historical highs, but broader calculations including selective defaults and liability management actions suggest an effective default rate of nearly 5% through the first nine months of 2025.

“The private credit market is facing its first big test as evidence of late-cycle behavior continues to build,” said James Harvey, research lead for private credit at With Intelligence. “After years of allocating overwhelmingly to US direct lending, limited partners are broadening their horizons, both geographically and by sub-strategy, and we expect some of these shifts to significantly alter the current landscape over the next several years.”

Rising use of PIK in senior secured loans — historically the domain of lower-tier subordinated financings — reflects borrowers’ strained cash flows and elevated leverage. Public business development companies, serving as a proxy for parts of the retail and wealth channel, are now reporting an average of 8% of investment income derived from PIK.

Europe’s Breakout Year, US Growth Cools

One of the most striking developments of 2025 has been the shift in fundraising geography. European private credit reached record levels, with €56 billion (approximately $66 billion) raised through the first nine months — up sharply from prior years — while North America-focused funds lagged, raising about $52 billion over the same period.

European funds accounted for roughly 35% of global private debt fundraising in 2025, compared to about 24% in both 2023 and 2024. By contrast, North America’s share has fallen from near 50% to just under a quarter of total capital raised.

Europe’s fragmented lender base and relatively inefficient markets can offer wider risk premia compared with the increasingly crowded US direct lending space. Combined with structural shifts such as Basel IV’s impact on bank loan supply, this has created fertile ground for private debt strategies that target niche sectors or bespoke financing solutions.

Growth of Evergreen Structures and Wealth Channel Capital

Another theme reshaping the asset class is the rapid expansion of evergreen private credit vehicles. Assets in such perpetual-capital structures, including non-traded BDCs and semiliquid funds, climbed past $640 billion by mid-2025, up more than 40% versus the prior year.

While institutional investors continue to command a large share of capital, allocation from private wealth channels has surged. These flows pose a dual challenge: they have broadened the base of capital available to managers, but they also raise questions around liquidity profiles, governance standards and alignment with long-term liability matching for traditional pension and endowment allocations.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/in/deni_639040754326824145.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 18:03:53.722883

The EliteBoard uses laptop silicon to stuff a complete PC underneath its keys. Think of it as a portable desktop of sorts, or a laptop without a screen. But more than that, the idea will remind some of you of retro PC-in-a-keyboard designs like the classic Commodore 64 or VIC-20. The EliteBoard revives a form factor that's been dormant for almost 40 years. It's a portable, AI-ready keyboard desktop computer that actually packs substantial power.

You might be thinking, ""Why do this in 2026?"" HP details a particular niche for these PCs. The EliteBoard is tailored for modern offices in which hot-desk reservations and hybrid-location employees require workers to have portable systems, but they use them with desktop monitors and peripherals. Using laptops may make sense in offices like this, in many cases, but some business laptops don't get opened and used enough to justify having a screen. Instead, they're run closed, with a full-size keyboard, mouse, and desktop monitor plugged in. And that might be the case in a home office and the local workspace. plugged into desktop peripherals in both places. This effectively wastes the laptop's screen and portable computing capabilities, which are considerable portions of a laptop's price. Toting an EliteBoard back and forth could make more sense.

With no lid or built-in display, the EliteBoard aims to save organizations and independent customers money. Here's what I think of it after a week with a production model.

The HP EliteBoard G1a is a PCMag pick for Best in Show at CES 2026.

A Low-Profile Design, and Quiet Typing

The EliteBoard features a minimal, low-profile design, and its metal-and-plastic chassis weighs just around 1.5 pounds (1.6 pounds for HP's model with an optional battery; more on that in a bit). The unit's two-layered setup puts the keyboard on top—this portion is removable and replaceable for IT departments to service as needed—while the bottom half of the chassis houses the motherboard and PC components. (Given that it's a keyboard at heart, you don't want to have a broken key take your whole desktop out of commission for good.) Inside, you get easy access to memory, SSD storage, the WLAN card, speakers, fan, and battery, making the system surprisingly serviceable.

The underside of the keyboard is nicer-looking than most and is perforated for ventilation. While I couldn't benchmark-test the new system just yet (this was an early sample), I can tell you that the fan noise seems minimal, and the thermal management on point; the unit never got overly hot.

(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)

In the interest of thinness and to accommodate the PC hardware inside, HP uses low-profile keycaps with silicone-dome switches for the key mechanisms. The keyboard won’t replicate the tactile or audible clickety-clack of a mechanical keyboard, and the feedback feels somewhat soft. At least it's very quiet, and, with 2mm of vertical travel, the keys provide enough depth for comfort. In essence, in the typing experience, you're getting the equivalent of a premium laptop keyboard repackaged for desktop use.

To save space, the EliteBoard lacks a built-in touch pad, but HP bundles a wireless mouse designed to work with multiple devices. The mouse includes a wireless dongle and supports two discrete Bluetooth connections.

Connectivity and the Monitor-Side Dongle

The EliteBoard features a pair of USB-C ports (one supporting USB4), complementing the connectivity with a compact port adapter or dongle.

This dongle serves as a port splitter, attaching to the HDMI port of your attached monitor. It carries the video signal from the EliteBoard to the monitor (you can daisy-chain multiple monitors), and it features an RJ-45 jack. That jack allows you to connect a network cable, enabling the EliteBoard to access wired Ethernet through the USB-C connection.

The dongle also connects to a wall adapter for the desktop's power source. This minimizes the cables going to the actual EliteBoard, keeping connections easy and clean. The system also provides Wi-Fi 6E (or optional Wi-Fi 7) for wireless networking without the dongle connection.

A single, long USB-C cable connects the EliteBoard to the dongle. In the model with a battery, it plugs into one of the USB-C ports; in the other, it's hardwired. In all, this arrangement is a clever way to keep the desk clutter-free.

To Battery, or Not To Battery?

The EliteBoard comes with a built-in battery, though you can opt for a battery-free version. The onboard battery isn't necessarily intended for on-the-go use, though; instead, it serves as a backup battery or uninterruptible power supply (UPS).

This UPS allows you to pick up the system and move it to another room (say, to a conference room for a meeting) without having to shut down and restart the machine, as you would if you had to unplug and replug an equally portable mini-PC or other desktop.

(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)

As for that battery-free option? HP tells me that this design is meant for stationary usage scenarios, like an EliteBoard installed as the PC at the front desk of a hotel, or in other environments where the system can be plugged in and never has to move. In other words, think of the types of situations in which, now, you might use a mini-PC or all-in-one to minimize clutter and maximize clean appearances.

Next-Gen AI Performance From a Keyboard

Beneath the keys, the EliteBoard is a capable AI PC powered by AMD Ryzen AI processors, supporting up to 50 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of NPU performance. (It starts with an AMD Ryzen AI 5 330 and tops out with a Ryzen AI 7 350 Pro.) Those AMD chips are backed by up to 64GB of DDR5 memory and up to 2TB of solid-state storage.

While the keyboard has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for connecting key peripherals, it also features built-in speakers and microphones. HP views these onboard audio capabilities as more critical than ever, as AI PCs increasingly rely on dictation and conversational voice interaction, and separate speakers or microphones add wires and complexity.

I couldn't benchmark the performance of this pre-production EliteBoard G1a model, but the specs suggest it's on par with many similarly equipped laptops. We'll have to wait for a proper review to see how much the unconventional design affects performance.

Prepare to Wait: Pricing and Availability

HP hasn't announced the price or launch date of the HP EliteBoard G1a yet, but with pre-release samples in our hands already, I'd expect a debut sometime in the first quarter of 2026. The company hasn't disclosed any details on pricing, either, but the EliteBoard will likely be closer to the price of a premium laptop than to any stand-alone keyboard—and if it has a price close to $1,000, I won't be surprised.

If it's that pricey—which is to say, as much as a decent basic enterprise laptop—that may put a damper on the whole value proposition. (After all, a laptop is stilll more flexible.) But it's possible the EliteBoard may make sense for some businesses purchased in bulk at negotiated prices.",https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/00KwcR4o97ncrHAhIsbQPlU-1.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1768499335.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 14:03:41.450097
ID8,BNY Mellon,2026-01-15 17:56:27+00:00,NeoFeed,The shortcut for family offices: direct investments gain momentum in Brazil. - NeoFeed,Patricia Valle,,,,,https://neofeed.com.br/wealth-management/o-atalho-dos-family-offices-investimentos-diretos-ganham-forca-no-brasil/en/,"Since 2020, the family office has dedicated an exclusive area to direct investments in the real estate market.
In contact with developers, it seeks a minimum IRR of 25% in the residential segment and 18% in logistics.
In venture capital, the accumulated figure of R$ 4.6 billion represents half of the R$ 9.2 billion invested in 2024.
The R$ 2.1 billion recorded in the third quarter marks the highest quarterly volume of 2025 and a jump of 23.5% over the same period of the previous year.
The asset managers we have the most relationships with in Brazil tend to do 50% in funds/50% in co-investments.","Praça Higienópolis, a high-end residential building located in the Higienópolis neighborhood of São Paulo, with over 21,000 m² of private area, is one of the newest developments by SKR, a real estate developer and construction company partnered with the Cyrela Group. The company has sought partnerships with asset managers such as Kinea and SPX to raise funds for its developments, but in this case, the funding came from Multi Family Office Portofino, which manages approximately R$ 30 billion.

In this project, Portofino acquired a 25% stake, bringing together more than 20 wealthy families—clients with an appetite for real estate assets. The expectation is to achieve an internal rate of return (IRR) of 25% per year. Since 2020, the family office has dedicated an exclusive area to direct investments in the real estate market. In contact with developers, it seeks a minimum IRR of 25% in the residential segment and 18% in logistics.

“Historically, developers have had the practice of seeking family and friends to come on board as investors in development projects, and families like to feel like they own real assets. Now, this is done in a more professional way with our intermediation and curation,” says Leonardo Bersot, Real Estate partner at Portofino MFO.

This type of operation, called co-investment or club deal , in which wealth managers invest directly in an asset, either with an asset management firm or directly in the transaction, is gaining increasing traction in the Brazilian and global markets.

According to Citibank's ""Global Family Office Report 2025,"" 70% of family offices made direct investments worldwide this year. Meanwhile, a BNY Mellon survey, ""Investment Insights For Single Family Offices 2025,"" indicates that nearly two-thirds (64%) expect to make six or more direct investments in the coming year, a 10% increase over the previous period.

Research by Volt Partners , published exclusively by NeoFeed , showed that the number of club deals had doubled last year, reaching 20% of deals. As a result, the average value of investment checks in private equity operations was shrinking, from R$ 56.5 million in 2024 to R$ 41.6 million in 2025.

In Brazil, this strategy is a form of differentiation, since traditional funds have become more accessible and commoditized. As a result, firms that make direct investments have multiplied—and closed more deals .

Origination typically occurs when a lead manager (private equity or private credit) finds an opportunity considered excellent, but cannot concentrate enough capital in a single asset or does not have sufficient resources. Therefore, they contribute what they can through a fund and invite wealth managers to co-invest in another vehicle. On the other side, wealth managers identify families interested in the project, offering exclusive, long-term investment options.

This is how Arton Advisors , with over R$10 billion under management, participated in the retrofit of the former Marina Palace in Leblon, which will house the first Four Seasons hotel in Brazil. The management is handled by the Catuaí group, and construction begins this year, with an expected duration of 36 months and a projected return of over 25% per year.

“Our relationship with asset managers means we are always consulted for the start of any venture, and together with other firms we dilute the risk, even though the ticket size remains high, often R$ 1 million per individual, which is possible because our clients are professional investors,” says Raphael Vieira, co-head of Investments at Arton Advisors.

Investing directly allows families to obtain higher returns by eliminating brokerage and management fees and providing greater visibility into where capital is allocated. It also makes it possible to reduce portfolio duration and choose return timeframes. Unlike a blind pool —where the manager decides alone where to invest—the investor chooses the specific asset.

This, however, implies concentration: a single name can represent a high risk. Unlike a fund, where the manager invests in various assets, this strategy allocates capital to a single business. If it goes wrong, the loss is 100%, as there is no diversification.

“We gave up diversification to gain in return. Our co-investment portfolio, for example, has a 70% annual return in dollars, while in private equity investments it is 15% per year,” says Felipe Nobre, CEO and co-founder of Jera Capital, with R$ 5.5 billion under management, which invested in this way in the American companies OpenAI and DataBricks.

The recommendation is that only very wealthy families should make this type of investment, representing a small percentage of their portfolio, and always with the guidance of a wealth manager, whose expertise and relationships with companies and asset managers are essential. This does not exclude allocation through funds.

The Brainvest family office, with approximately US$6 billion under management, adopts the practice of maintaining 80% of its investments in alternative funds and 20% directly, to add ""spice"" to its portfolios. The firm makes co-investments in real estate, private equity, special situations, and infrastructure.

“There are some investment theses that we are very convinced of, making it sensible to be more exposed, to have concentration. And when allocating through managers, you never know exactly how much they will allocate and if they will change their minds over time,” says Renzo Malagoli, head of alternatives in Brazil at Brainvest. Examples include investments in Brazilian gold mining companies and mature highway concessions in the state of São Paulo, via Starboard's private equity funds.

This trend gains momentum during periods of high interest rates, when alternative assets need to offer high returns to compete. ""Interest rates have been high for a long time, so alternative assets compete with a very high risk-return ratio, needing to yield more to make sense. And, in this scenario, the sophisticated investor seeks real assets with high returns as a diversification strategy,"" says Wilson Barcellos, CEO of Azimut Wealth Management.

Wealth managers predict that 2026 will be a year of even more opportunities for direct investments. With the slight reduction in interest rates, more deals may materialize, making it more attractive for those raising investments, although liquidity remains limited.

“In the US, family offices allocate 50% of their portfolio to alternatives, and co-investments are part of that, being something much more structured in the industry. Here, this is growing as discretionary management and the appetite for alternatives grow,” says Felipe Nobre, CEO and co-founder of Jera Capital.

For now, the most promising segments for co-investing with asset managers are real estate, infrastructure, special situations, and credit, where families have entered as partners in subordinated shares of FIDCs (Investment Funds in Credit Rights). Meanwhile, the appetite for private equity and venture capital remains low, despite the recent improvement in the industry.

Recent data from Abvcap shows that private equity investments reached R$ 15.9 billion by the third quarter of 2025, in 51 transactions. These figures already surpass those for the entire year of 2024 – R$ 13.3 billion in 72 deals.

In venture capital, the accumulated figure of R$ 4.6 billion represents half of the R$ 9.2 billion invested in 2024. The R$ 2.1 billion recorded in the third quarter marks the highest quarterly volume of 2025 and a jump of 23.5% over the same period of the previous year.

Meanwhile, FIDCs ( Investment Funds in Credit Rights) are among the fastest-growing fund classes in recent years, having more than doubled in size since 2023 and reaching R$773 billion under management. And the real estate segment may be experiencing one of the best moments in its history, moving from a period of high long-term interest rates to a cycle of rate cuts, with the dollar trending downwards, which favors construction.

And it seems that both wealthy families and investment managers are interested in taking advantage of these joint investment opportunities and developing this relationship.

“The next 10 years will be very fruitful for alternatives. Co-investment will go hand in hand with the industry. The asset managers we have the most relationships with in Brazil tend to do 50% in funds/50% in co-investments. And this should continue,” says Malagoli, from Brainvest.",https://neofeed.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ATALHO.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 14:03:32.245862

At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ECL options chain for the new March 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $270.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.20.
Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.
For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.","Investors in Ecolab Inc (Symbol: ECL) saw new options become available today, for the March 20th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ECL options chain for the new March 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

The put contract at the $270.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.20. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $270.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $264.80 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ECL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $278.04/share today.

Because the $270.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.93% return on the cash commitment, or 10.99% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.

Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Ecolab Inc, and highlighting in green where the $270.00 strike is located relative to that history:

Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $280.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.60. If an investor was to purchase shares of ECL stock at the current price level of $278.04/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $280.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.44% if the stock gets called away at the March 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ECL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Ecolab Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ECL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $280.00 strike highlighted in red:

Considering the fact that the $280.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.73% boost of extra return to the investor, or 15.60% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.

The implied volatility in the put contract example is 23%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 22%.

Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $278.04) to be 21%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

ID32,Nvidia,2026-01-15 17:19:01+00:00,The Motley Fool,Alphabet and Amazon Just Said Something That May Eliminate Nvidia's Biggest Risk,"Adria Cimino, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/14/something-that-may-eliminate-nvidia-biggest-risk/,"This is because the company sells the key element needed to power AI: the AI chip.
And Nvidia's chips just so happen to be the fastest around, making them the go-to choice for major tech companies aiming to win the AI race.
Well, here's some good news: Customers Alphabet (GOOG 0.70%) (GOOGL 0.68%) and Amazon (AMZN +1.05%) just said something that may eliminate Nvidia's biggest risk.
On top of this, some of Nvidia's own customers, from Alphabet and Amazon to Meta Platforms, have developed their own chips.
Now, let's consider the words from executives at Alphabet and Amazon that eliminate this major risk.","Nvidia's (NVDA +3.42%) business has been booming since the start of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. This is because the company sells the key element needed to power AI: the AI chip. And Nvidia's chips just so happen to be the fastest around, making them the go-to choice for major tech companies aiming to win the AI race.

These chips are known as graphics processing units (GPUs), and they power some of the most crucial AI tasks, such as the training that gives large language models (LLMs) knowledge and the inferencing that helps them think through and solve complex problems.

All of this has generated enormous growth for Nvidia, with revenue climbing to record and multi-billion-dollar levels. The company has also reported billions of dollars in profit thanks to its market leadership. And the stock price has followed, delivering a 1,200% increase over the past five years.

Still, some investors have expressed concern about whether Nvidia may hold onto this top position. Well, here's some good news: Customers Alphabet (GOOG 0.70%) (GOOGL 0.68%) and Amazon (AMZN +1.05%) just said something that may eliminate Nvidia's biggest risk.

Nvidia isn't alone

So, first of all, let's start by considering this risk, which begins with the idea that Nvidia isn't alone in the AI space. The company faces competition from other chip designers like Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. These players offer customers high-quality options that come with a smaller price tag than Nvidia's latest innovations, so the idea is they could chip away (excuse the pun) at the company's market share.

On top of this, some of Nvidia's own customers, from Alphabet and Amazon to Meta Platforms, have developed their own chips. And the concern here is that they will shift to their own products and rely less and less on Nvidia.

So, Nvidia's biggest risk is that other chip designers and its own customers will buy fewer chips and supporting systems from the company in the coming years -- and that would clearly hurt earnings prospects and stock performance.

Now, let's consider the words from executives at Alphabet and Amazon that eliminate this major risk.

These comments come at the time of a big announcement: The upcoming launch of Nvidia's Rubin platform. Nvidia, at CES last week, said the system is in full production and is set to roll out in the second half of this year. That fulfills Nvidia's pledge to innovate and upgrade its chips on an annual basis.

Demand for Nvidia GPUs

Against this backdrop, Alphabet chief Sundar Pichai said: ""To meet the substantial customer demand we see for Nvidia GPUs, we are focused on providing the best possible environment for their hardware on Google Cloud.""

Matt Garman, chief of Amazon Web Services (AWS), said: ""The Nvidia Rubin platform on AWS represents our continued commitment to delivering cutting-edge AI infrastructure that gives customers unmatched choice and flexibility.""

Both executives also emphasized their long-established relationships with Nvidia.

These comments don't suggest a shift away from reliance on Nvidia and instead a will to continue significant work with the chip leader.

This doesn't mean players like Alphabet and Amazon won't use their own chips or those of Nvidia rivals. But, considering their comments, it's unlikely those moves will weigh on their orders for Nvidia products.

Nvidia predicts that AI infrastructure spending may reach $4 trillion by the end of the decade, and investment patterns we've seen from big AI players like Alphabet and Meta suggest this is very possible. This means there is plenty of room for Nvidia and its rivals to see orders for GPUs explode higher -- and remain at high levels as the AI story progresses.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F850897%2Fgettyimages-1191849990.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-15 14:03:57.466485

This may challenge trends such as Semiconductors 3.0, where standards may diverge from the prior assumption of global consensus or safe manufacturing havens.

For instance, as automation becomes more prevalent, trends that focus on reskilling, including Lifelong Learning and Education Technology​,​ will grow in importance.
Equipped with the right insight, portfolios could benefit from several trends that show promise in the years ahead.","How polarisation affects the 150 trends

This polarised backdrop will have a varied impact on the roadmap. While some trends face near-term headwinds, others will show long-term resilience. Over the next decade, investors​ should assess portfolios with these considerations in mind:​

Selectivity replaces breadth: Previously, global breadth was an advantage, offering more exposure to growth. However, it may now be better to embrace regional nuances and localised supply chains. This may challenge trends such as Semiconductors 3.0, where standards may diverge from the prior assumption of global consensus or safe manufacturing havens.

Regional diversification replaces global collaboration: Sustainability is increasingly being balanced against near‑term resilience considerations, decoupling it from certain trends. Take Artificial Intelligence. This was closely linked to sustainability in our last roadmap, but AI infrastructure’s hunger for power may drive both Fossil Fuel Resurgence and Renewable Energy in the short term, even though the two trends appear to be ​​​​​at odds​​​.​

A widening automation gap: A ​productivity divide will separate digital-first adopters from ​laggards,​ and emerging from developed economies. This disparity will have a significant social impact. For instance, as automation becomes more prevalent, trends that focus on reskilling, including Lifelong Learning and Education Technology​,​ will grow in importance. Meanwhile, Social Credit may become necessary to deal with the economic fallout of workforce displacement.

Industrial bifurcation amid policy asymmetry: Government policy could dictate winners and losers in certain industries. Trends with exposure to advanced manufacturing, domestic re-shoring and tech infrastructure will likely benefit from increased government support. ​​I​n contrast, industries that are unsupported or even penalised may lag. ​​For​ example, there is varying policy support for Battery Recycling between the US Inflation Reduction Act and the EU Green Deal. This divergence creates opportunities for investors who can navigate these discrepancies.

Trends to watch in 2026-7

How will this multipolar reality shape the near-term future? Our Research analysts have identified four trends of special interest to investors in the coming year.

Humanoid robotics

This is a new trend in our roadmap, reflecting a greater appetite for AI and automation-driven physical productivity​​. As countries​ contend​ ​with demographic declines and labour shortages, this technology becomes increasingly appealing, especially in warehouses, caregiving and on the factory floor. Although there are currently only a few companies in countries including the US, China​ and Korea driving this trend, our analysts expect it will become gradually more investible as deployment targets expand and reliability improves.

DefenceTech

DefenceTech’s upgraded status on our roadmap is driven by heightened focus on public and national security, ​and ​​the ​​subsequent growth of ​national defence budgets. Our analysts expect M&A and industry consolidation to create more liquidity pathways going forward, especially given the large number of private companies emerging in this space. Areas of interest include those where AI and software are fuelling new innovations, including target recognition, sensors and unmanned systems. Although our research also highlights that these bring their own ​​risks, such as regulatory & procurement complexity, supply chain vulnerabilities and ethical & public scrutiny.

Quantum computing

This long-standing trend is expected to be a major focus in 2026, related to the growing importance of critical national infrastructure. Although the technology is still in its infancy, there has been a shift towards commercial readiness, evidenced by application-specific demonstrations. In fact, Barclays Research remains optimistic that achieving quantum advantage at scale could be achieved before 2030.

In summary

​​Although consensus is increasingly fractured, there is still much for investors to be optimistic about. Equipped with the right insight, portfolios could benefit from several trends that show promise in the years ahead. But caution is needed too, as agile, focused positioning will be required to capture opportunities and manage risk.​​​​​

Venezuelan bonds, long frozen in default and trading at deeply distressed levels, have surged as investors reassess recovery prospects in light of the country’s sudden political transition.

The Venezuelan crisis transformed one of the world’s most moribund sovereign debt markets into a high‑beta play on political transition.","The dramatic escalation of Venezuela’s political crisis — culminating in the US military operation that removed Nicolás Maduro from power — has triggered a striking rally in distressed sovereign debt. Venezuelan bonds, long frozen in default and trading at deeply distressed levels, have surged as investors reassess recovery prospects in light of the country’s sudden political transition.

Prices on Venezuela’s benchmark notes due in 2026 have doubled since summer, with the 2027 9.25 government bond listed on the Munich Stock Exchange hitting 39% of par in 2026, up from 20% of par in July 2025.

As speculators stepped in to seize the potential recovery of debt assets, a significant level of activity moved to electronic trading, in order to reduce the friction of finding available bonds. MarketAxess reported $172mm of total trade volume between 5 and 6 January, of which $67mm was trading in Venezuela sovereign bonds and $105mm in the corporate bonds of PDVSA, the state oil company.

This constituted 447 total trades, 1174% higher than the 2025 daily average, broken up across 221 Venezuela sovereign trades and 226 PDVSA trades. As investors reassess the prospects of recovery in light of the country’s sudden political transition, the prices on Venezuela’s benchmark notes due in 2026 more than doubled since late summer.

The sharp repricing of the bonds reflects a shift in expectations, with some market participants betting that a post‑Maduro government, led for now by acting president Delcy Rodríguez, will normalise relations with Washington and open the door to long‑delayed debt restructuring. The US Treasury’s sanctions regime has been an obstacle to any restructuring effort, as transactions involving Venezuelan debt can require explicit authorisation from the Office of Foreign Assets Control. With the US signalling a willingness to engage, investors see a clearer path to asset recovery.

Yet the situation is still unstable. Thomas Watter of S&P Global and Rishabh Dakalia of Crisil, part of S&P Global, noted that US President, Donald Trump, said the US would “run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition” and rebuild Venezuela’s oil sector via US companies.

“However, S&P Global Ratings expects a recovery will take years and significant capital to develop the underinvested and outdated oil and gas infrastructure,” they write. “For example, according to the Venezuelan Hydrocarbon Association, the nation’s five refinery complexes are operating at only 10% of nameplate capacity and would require more than US$10 billion-15 billion to bring that to greater than 80%.”

The broader market implications are complex. Morgan Stanley notes that the crisis introduces significant political and operational uncertainty, but the near‑term effect is unambiguously supportive for Venezuelan bonds, which are likely to continue rallying, as long as investors believe a stable government and sanctions relief are plausible outcomes. At the same time, the crisis has tested the US dollar’s safe‑haven status and contributed to increased demand for gold, reflecting heightened perceived geopolitical risk.

The Venezuelan crisis transformed one of the world’s most moribund sovereign debt markets into a high‑beta play on political transition. The rally has been substantial so far, but questions remain about the durability of the new government, the agreement with the US, the pace of any sanctions relief, and the feasibility of restructuring more than US$170 billion in obligations.

As demonstrated in the adrenaline-filled days around the removal of Maduro, for bond traders, having rapid and frictionless access to pricing and liquidity could make the difference between seizing or missing an opportunity.

It will further strengthen its capital markets business.","U.S. Bancorp USB entered a definitive agreement to acquire BTIG, LLC for $1 billion. This stock and cash transaction will likely be closed in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and fulfillment of customary closing conditions.

BTIG provides investment banking (IB), institutional sales and trading, research, and prime brokerage services. Since 2014, USB has had BTIG as the equity capital markets referral partner. The two firms further started a referral program in 2023.

USB CEO Gunjan Kedia said, ""BTIG’s top talent, capabilities and technology will position us for continued capital markets growth and deeper client relationships. This acquisition will enable both organizations to deliver greater value, innovation and efficiency to the companies and institutions we serve.""

This is a significant strategic move by U.S. Bancorp as it continues to expand its capital markets-based product set and revenues and support institutional clients in a better way. Also, new offerings such as institutional equity sales and trading, equity capital markets, equity electronic trading and mergers & acquisitions advisory are expected to further accelerate the company’s capital markets momentum.

USB-BTIG Deal Details & Financial Terms

As part of the deal terms, at close, U.S. Bancorp will pay a consideration of $725 million, consisting of $362.5 million in cash and approximately 6.6 million shares. An additional cash consideration of up to $275 million will be paid over three years, contingent on the achievement of defined performance targets.

BTIG’s senior leadership team will join U.S. Bancorp and continue to run the business. Anton LeRoy will remain CEO of BTIG, reporting to Stephen Philipson, vice chair and head of Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking at U.S. Bancorp, while co-founder and executive chairman Steven Starker will continue to work on client relationships and business development.

The transaction is anticipated to have a minimal impact on USB’s earnings per share this year. Nonetheless, it will likely reduce the company’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio by approximately 12 basis points at closing. Moreover, the deal will not affect the company’s near-term capital returns plan.

How Will the BTIG Deal Support USB’s Capital Markets Business?

Over the years, U.S. Bancorp has established a solid capital markets business, which is one of the major revenue growth drivers. With capital markets revenues of approximately $1.4 billion for the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2025, and a three-year (2021-2024) compound annual growth rate of 21%, the company views this acquisition as a meaningful top-line driver. It will further strengthen its capital markets business.

BTIG ranks among the top 10 U.S. brokers for high-touch equity volume executed and has advised on more than 1,275 announced IB transactions since 2015. The firm, along with its affiliates, operates through more than 700 employees in 20 cities across the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia, and complements U.S. Bancorp’s existing business.

Overall, the BTIG acquisition is a disciplined move by U.S. Bancorp to achieve further traction in the capital markets business by filling key product gaps, enhancing client relationships, and positioning the franchise to leverage its scale, without losing capital strength or leadership continuity.

Operating Margin: 45.16%

Net Margin: 30.99%

EBITDA Margin: 42.57%

The company's balance sheet is solid, with a current ratio of 1.55 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.79, indicating a healthy liquidity position and manageable debt levels. However, insider activity reveals some cautionary signs, with 24 insider selling transactions in the past three months.

Valuation and Market Sentiment

Eli Lilly's valuation metrics suggest a premium positioning in the market:

P/E Ratio: 50.02

P/S Ratio: 15.48

P/B Ratio: 38.49

Analyst sentiment remains positive, with a target price of $1,116.44 and a recommendation score of 1.9, indicating a favorable outlook. Technical indicators such as the RSI (14) at 54.18 suggest a neutral market sentiment, while institutional ownership stands at 86.67%, reflecting strong institutional confidence.

Risk Assessment

Despite its strong financial metrics, Eli Lilly faces sector-specific risks, particularly regulatory challenges as evidenced by the recent FDA delay. The company's Altman Z-Score of 8.02 indicates strong financial health, while the beta of 0.21 suggests lower volatility compared to the broader market. However, the ongoing regulatory scrutiny and insider selling activity warrant cautious monitoring.

Overall, Eli Lilly's financial strength and market position remain robust, but investors should remain vigilant of regulatory developments and insider activity that could impact future performance.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C000007E3.png?20,N,,2026-01-15 12:03:57.527814

OpenAI is welcoming back several senior researchers who had left to help launch Mira Murati's startup, Thinking Machines Lab, marking a notable talent reversal in the fast moving AI landscape.

Murati, OpenAI's former CTO, said two of the startup's co founders, Barret Zoph and Luke Metz, are returning to the ChatGPT maker. Senior researcher Sam Schoenholz is also heading back. All three previously worked at OpenAI before joining Murati to start Thinking Machines Lab in late 2024.

Murati announced Zoph's departure on X and named Soumith Chintala as the company's new CTO, without directly addressing Metz's exit. Thinking Machines Lab had quickly gained attention after raising $2 billion in a seed round last July at a $12 billion valuation, with backing from investors including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Andreessen Horowitz.

The move highlights just how fluid the competition for top AI talent has become, with researchers moving between startups and established players. For OpenAI, the returns reinforce its effort to regroup experienced leadership as development ramps up heading into 2026.

The software is designed to help customers achieve verifiable sovereignty and full operational control – building, deploying and managing cloud-native and AI workloads under an organisation’s own authority. Build on Red Hat’s open-source foundation, Sovereign Core is expected to make sovereignty a critical property of the software itself.

“Businesses are facing growing pressure to innovate while meeting tightening regulatory requirements and recognising the importance of controlling how sensitive data and AI workloads are accessed and operated,” said Priya Srinivasan, general manager at IBM Software Products. “This shift is creating an urgent need for sovereign solutions that deliver AI-ready environments.

Organisations that deploy the software are expected to gain:

Customer-operated control plane: organisations maintain direct operational authority over software operations, deployment decisions and system configurations without intermediation from a vendor not in region.

In-boundary identity and keys: all authentication, authorisation, encryption keys and access management remain within jurisdiction boundaries under customer control.

Ongoing compliance enablement and generated evidence of continuous compliance: comprehensive operational data, system telemetry and audit trails are generated, stored and managed within the sovereign boundary, including automated identity.

Governed AI inference: AI model deployment and hosting, local GPU clusters, local inference execution and agent operations occur under local governance with traceability and oversight, without exporting data to external providers.

Ease of deployment: delivering sovereignty at scale with consistency and flexibility.

The platform comes as businesses around the world are looking at digital sovereignty. As the regulatory landscape evolves, enterprises and governments are seeking self-managed environments where they maintain complete operational authority – particularly as they deploy AI workloads that amplify sovereignty concerns.

According to IBM, most organisations currently lack a destination to land, modernise and re-host applications under sovereign control, including applications that will incorporate AI capabilities. According to Gartner, 75% of all enterprises will have a digital sovereignty strategy by 2030.

With IBM Sovereign Core, customers can deploy it in the environment of their choice, including in on-premises data centres, in-region cloud infrastructure or through IT service providers.

The technology giant is collaborating with IT service providers worldwide, starting with an initial rollout in Europe with Cegeka in Belgium and the Netherlands and Computacenter in Germany.

IBM said these partnerships will enable local independence and compliance management, enabling IT service providers to offer differentiated sovereign services to enterprises preparing for and running AI-scale workloads.

Srinivasan added: “With IBM Sovereign Core, we are helping clients move faster and with confidence – combining openness, compliance, and operational autonomy to meet the demands of the AI era, without the need to sacrifice sovereignty requirements.”

Boston Scientific plans to acquire Penumbra for about $14.5 billion, the companies announced Thursday.

Penumbra makes heart devices to remove clots from blood vessels, treating conditions including pulmonary embolism, stroke and deep vein thrombosis. It also makes an embolization system, designed to stop blood flow to control bleeding.

Boston Scientific CEO Mike Mahoney sees an “opportunity to enter new, fast-growing segments within the vascular space,” he said in a statement.

Dive Insight:

The planned purchase, one of the first large medtech acquisitions of 2026, is expected to complement Boston Scientific’s portfolio. Buying Penumbra would let Boston Scientific expand into new markets in thrombectomy and embolization, bringing the cardiovascular device company a growth asset, BTIG analyst Ryan Zimmerman wrote in a research note.

Boston Scientific will pay $374 per share in cash and stock. Zimmerman said the price is fair, valuing Penumbra at about 19% above its share price Wednesday.

Penumbra is expected to report 2025 revenue of about $1.4 billion, a more than 17% increase year over year.

The deal was not surprising, RBC Capital Markets analyst Shagun Singh wrote in a research note, adding that Penumbra “has been considered a take-out candidate for some time now.” Stryker’s $4.9 billion acquisition last year of Inari Medical, another company making thrombectomy devices, made Penumbra a more attractive acquisition candidate, Zimmerman said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/N_cLe-haE96UNciFI2DMVcdB5JKJsFiYb5Cckvh9k8Y/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9CU1hfQ0VPLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-15 11:06:06.730533

The definition of transformation is exactly that—caterpillars becoming butterflies. Otherwise, you are not recognizing AI’s potential. As with the internet, it’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reimagine how you do business.

When it comes to implementation, there will always be a certain amount of experimentation, but many experiments fail because people think of AI as one monolithic thing. You need to break it into two steps.

First, establish what infrastructure you need, starting with your data. Is your data connected? Is it organized? Is it in a format that can be leveraged? AI is nothing but garbage-in, garbage-out otherwise. Establish the foundation, then second, pick one or two projects that will add real value.

Choose an area of the business where you see a real opportunity. Then find something that is not so big that it takes you years to deliver value, but not so small that it isn’t applicable to the rest of the business.

Many CEOs have been focused on cost-based use cases of AI, because it’s easier to prove their tangible value. But we’re seeing far more meaningful opportunities in the context of driving growth and sales. When you get it right, it demonstrates how AI can make a difference in everything from selling cars to increasing the value of shopping baskets.

If your child has just started playing football, you may not know what to buy. AI can say: “Tell us a few things, and we’ll check you out with everything you need for an 8-year-old who’s into football. You’re searching for a ball, but you also need cleats and socks and shin guards.”

This makes a real difference in revenue, unlike use cases where “we can optimize call centers and boost productivity.” Those projects are specifically focused on AI as a cost opportunity.

I remember talking to airline CEOs about paying to pick your own seat on airplanes. The CEOs wanted faster check-in lines at the airport. Back then, staff would have to show each passenger where they were seated at check-in, or fliers would have to call customer support, which took time and added cost.

Nowadays, choosing a seat is the second-largest revenue-generator for an airline after buying a ticket. This means that what started off as a cost-saving initiative creates more revenue for airlines today than even excess baggage fees.

At the time, the conversation was framed almost entirely around operational efficiency— reducing friction at check-in, shortening queues, and lowering support costs. What wasn’t immediately obvious was how these small changes in customer experience could fundamentally reshape behavior. Over time, those same decisions opened entirely new revenue streams that few had initially anticipated.

These are the trends you miss if you only use AI to save money. Industries which don’t make this pivot—from using AI to cut costs to using it to find new opportunities for growth—are going to be caught flat-footed.

It also claims that ChatGPT provider OpenAI made a conscious decision to decline the opportunity to provide the intelligence behind Siri …

Google’s Gemini models powering the new Siri

Apple this week confirmed reports that Google’s Gemini AI models will be used to power the new Siri in an announcement clearly aimed at investors, but also good news for customers.

Google said that this is a multi-year contract, while Apple noted that the Gemini models will run on its own Private Cloud Compute servers in order to maintain privacy.

It has been speculated that Apple is paying around $1bn a year for the deal, and a new report seems to at least roughly confirm this.

Apple to pay billions

A Financial Times report says that the deal is a multi-billion one.

The deal would be structured in the form of a cloud computing contract, which could lead to Apple paying several billion dollars to Google over time, a person familiar with the agreement told the FT.

While this is all rather vague, multiple billions over multiple years is consistent with the idea of somewhere in the region of $1B per year. If accurate, it seems a good deal for the Cupertino company, given that it is receiving more than 20 times as much from the search giant.

OpenAI reportedly decided against Apple partnership

The report also claims that OpenAI made a conscious decision to refrain from partnering with Apple.

OpenAI declined to comment. But a person close to the company said it had taken “a conscious decision to not become the custom model provider for Apple” in the autumn of last year and instead focus on building its own AI device to leapfrog the big tech companies.

It’s a near certainty that Apple and OpenAI at least had discussions about it, but it’s not clear whether the iPhone maker actually offered the company a contract. The wording allows for the possibility of OpenAI turning down a deal, but it may merely mean it had decided to decline were Apple to make an offer.

Penumbra's stock was up about 14% after the 'compelling' deal was announced Thursday morning

Penumbra, which developed the Lightning Bolt 6X, to remove blood clots below the knee, is being acquired by Boston Scientific.

Boston Scientific is spending $14.5 billion in cash and stock to buy Penumbra, another medical-device maker that makes products used in minimally invasive procedures to treat conditions such as blood clots and stroke.

As a result of the acquisition, Boston Scientific will add a fresh group of products to its portfolio while also entering ""new, fast-growing segments within the vascular space,"" CEO Mike Mahoney said in a statement.

The device maker is paying $375 per share, a premium over Penumbra's Wednesday closing price of $313.43. Penumbra's stock (PEN) rallied about 12% on Thursday after the deal was announced. Boston Scientific shares (BSX) were down about 5%.

It's one of the biggest med-tech deals over the last year. And with Abbott Laboratories (ABT) announcing in November that it is buying Exact Sciences (EXAS) for $21 billion, Boston Scientific's acquisition could be a signal of returned dealmaking to the sector, according to William Blair's Brandon Vazquez.

Penumbra's portfolio focuses largely on devices used in mechanical thrombectomies, a minimally invasive procedure to remove blood clots, and for neurovascular conditions. Its stroke business makes up 30% of its revenue, according to Vasquez. The company, founded in 2004, said it brought in $1.4 billion in revenue for 2025, a roughly 17% year-over-year increase.

""The markets where Penumbra competes are high-growth but also highly competitive,"" Stifel analysts told investors. ""Penumbra is a truly compelling and exciting acquisition for BSX. It accelerates sales growth, expands the company [total addressable market], and on the surface, it appears to be an excellent operational and cultural fit.""

Penumbra CEO Adam Elsesser will join Boston Scientific's board. Penumbra will operate as a standalone business within Boston Scientific's cardiovascular segment.

Boston Scientific said it's using cash and new debt to cover the $11 billion cash part of the deal. The deal is expected to close later this year.

Proximity to AI has been the main driver of U.S. semiconductor stock performance. Proposed AI spending points to a multi-year earnings tailwind, though the timing and scale of deployments remain debated.

Applied Material has underperformed due to valid concerns around China competition and exposure, with stock gaining just 12% in 2025.

But according to Barclays concerns around China exposure and competition are already reflected in the stock while rising foundry and DRAM spending makes Applied’s exposure to those areas attractive relative to peers.

Barclays said its preferred names are in compute, in storage, and in interconnect, and in semiconductor capital equipment.

Stock performance in 2026 is likely to favor companies tied directly to core parts of the AI buildout.

It flagged , , MTSI, Micron and Nvidia as its favored stocks, while taking a more cautious stance on , , and due to consumer and analog exposure.

On AI infrastructure, compute announcements imply about 20 gigawatts of deployments in calendar 2027, with power availability emerging as the key constraint.

It said Nvidia is positioned to capture the bulk of that demand, estimating $45 billion of upside to both its 2026 and 2027 revenue forecasts. Barclays said upcoming model launches in late Q1 or early Q2 are a key inflection point for investor confidence in returns on AI spending.

Pam is survived by her husband of 47 years, Mal; her eldest child, KJ and spouse, Ian; her daughter, Quinn and husband, Ezra; and her grandson, Terrence. She is also survived by her siblings Debbie, Cyndee, Ricky, and Alan; as well as a large and loving chosen family – her “strays” – people she gathered throughout her life who needed a mom or a family, and whom Pam welcomed with open arms.

Pam was born and raised in the Bronx. She grew up on Morris Avenue near 183rd St., in a two-bedroom, fourth-story walk-up, where her grandfather was the superintendent and her father was a milkman and, later, a gas station owner. At the same time, her mother worked in various retail positions and as a church musician. Pam excelled in school and was a feared presence on neighborhood and school basketball courts. She spent much of her free time at the New York Public Library.

Her love of books led Pam to her first career at the Reader’s Digest headquarters in Pleasantville, N.Y., where she worked nights in the company’s state-of-the-art computer center while putting herself through college at the City University of New York. It was at the Digest that she met Mal, sharing lunches and falling for one another. Mal’s career included being a commercial pilot and editor.

Anyone who worked with Pam knew she was a force of nature; her time in the company’s massive data systems led to a rapid rise through the organization, culminating in her role as senior vice president for logistics and marketing systems, with extensive worldwide travels in that capacity.

As Pam told the story, the day after Quinn was born, her doctors informed her that she had terminal melanoma and only months to live. She replied simply, “No.” She had 32 more years. Pam and Mal, who married in 1978, uprooted their lives and relocated to Damariscotta in 1994, where they focused on raising their young children and building a home together. When Pam later went looking for work again, she did so with a familiar goal – to, as she often put it, “be a useful engine.”

That search led her to what she considered the crowning achievement of her professional life: Skidompha Public Library. Pam worked on the capital campaign that made the current library possible and was appointed executive director shortly thereafter, a role she held for two decades. Pam believed deeply in the power of libraries to meet basic human needs, celebrate the arts and humanities, and foster connection. She viewed the library as both the community’s living room and as part of a larger calling to serve as “custodians of society.”

Pam’s tenure at Skidompha was marked by innovation, achievement, and deep affection for her colleagues. Under her leadership, the library received numerous awards, including the highest honor in the field, the National Medal for Library Service. Pam traveled to the White House to receive the medal from First Lady Laura Bush in 2008.

Pam’s commitment to community extended far beyond the walls of the library. She served on nonprofit boards across the Midcoast, from Heartwood Theater Co. and Lincoln Theater to The Carpenter’s Boat Shop and Stepping Stones. Her leadership was often sought by organizations navigating periods of challenge or pursuing ambitious growth. Pam also served as a member and later chair of the Great Salt Bay School Committee in the early 2000s, where she oversaw significant expansion and construction projects and helped secure an inclusive benefits package that extended coverage to same-sex domestic partners of school employees.

Pam’s drive for service was rooted in her faith. Her faith life was centered at Second Congregational Church in Newcastle for nearly 30 years, where she played many roles – cooking Wednesday night suppers, chairing the deacons, leading the church through its Open and Affirming process, and ringing handbells in the bell choir, which brought her particular joy.

Pam was a person of deep wonder, which she explored through art, music, and travel. She visited at least 27 countries across five continents, attended the Munich Olympics, summited Machu Picchu, stood on the continental divide in Iceland, and traveled through Palestine. After retirement, she undertook a six-week road trip around the United States in search of “all the elephants I can find,” reflecting her lifelong love of the creatures. Many of these travels were shared with friends and family, especially her eldest child, KJ.

Music was a constant in Pam’s life. The daughter of a church organist, she was an accomplished musician herself; though she insisted she preferred being a spectator. She raised her children to treat orchestra concerts the way others treat football games. Pam played handbells (mastering four-in-hand), piano, and organ – teaching keyboard skills to her daughter Quinn – and was an all-city musician on bass and trumpet in her youth. A proud alto, she also sang in many choirs.

Pam was not one to remain still. Retirement did not suit her for long, and she soon embarked on what she called her “encore career,” leading a nonprofit that placed unhoused teenagers with host families and supported them in completing high school and transitioning to adulthood. Through this work, by happy accident, Pam met her grandson. When Terrence, a young person in need of emergency placement, was placed with Quinn and Ezra, he quickly became family. Pam delighted in celebrating his adoption this past July and described Terrence as “the frosting on the cake of her life.”

Pam was a devoted and loving mother. She and Mal made childhood joyful and curious while fostering ambition and confidence in their children. Though she sometimes needed a moment to catch up on the right words, Pam embraced the work of affirming and raising two sparkly children with gusto. Her home was often a refuge for other young people who needed a mom who loved them for who they were.

Pam leaves behind a remarkable legacy of love, service, faith, and accomplishment – carried forward in the institutions she strengthened, the communities she served, and the many people whose lives were made better because she was in them.

In lieu of flowers, please send donations in Pam’s memory to the Mabel Wadsworth Center in Bangor.

A funeral will be held at the Second Congregational Church of Newcastle at 2 p.m. on Jan. 24, 2026.",https://lcnme.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/obit-Gormley.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 13:04:21.361565

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on MRX. Marex Group plc's share was trading at $38.99 as of January 13th. MRX’s trailing and forward P/E were 11.24 and 9.23 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.

Marex is a UK based global financial services platform that provides critical market access, liquidity, and infrastructure to institutional participants across energy, commodity, and financial markets. The company operates through four tightly integrated segments clearing services, agency and execution, market making, and hedging and investment solutions, allowing it to offer a full suite of services that few competitors can match.

Serving roughly 5,000 active clients, Marex has carved out a defensible niche by focusing on mid sized funds that are underserved by large banks due to minimum commission thresholds and by smaller independents that lack the scale and global reach required by these clients.

The investment thesis is anchored in high barriers to entry and a structurally improving competitive landscape. Building a scaled platform in this space is slow and complex, as demonstrated by Marex’s own decade long ramp to establish its initial business. –

Industry consolidation has meaningfully reduced competition, with the number of futures commission merchants declining by roughly half since 2002 even as client assets have expanded. This dynamic has enabled Marex to emerge as a top ten FCM in the U.S. by client assets, with only a handful of peers, notably StoneX, able to offer comparable breadth across all service lines.

Marex is also leveraged to favorable secular and cyclical tailwinds. Rising use of cleared derivatives, expanding commodity markets, higher interest rates, and increased volatility all support demand for its services, making the business an effective play on sustained market activity.

Growth has been driven by a balanced mix of organic initiatives and disciplined M&A, with acquisitions such as ED&F Man and TD Cowen’s prime brokerage materially expanding the client base and revenue mix. This strategy has delivered a decade of consistent profit growth, with adjusted PBT rising from $16 million in 2014 to $321 million in 2024, alongside improving earnings stability and strong free cash flow conversion.

Despite this track record, Marex remains underfollowed due to its UK domicile, small cap size, and limited public history, with additional pressure from a recent short report viewed as immaterial. Trading at roughly 7.7x 2025 earnings, consensus estimates assume only organic growth and exclude future M&A, suggesting the market is undervaluing the company’s long term earnings power and strategic optionality.

Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on Marex Group plc by Karst Research in May 2025, which highlighted the company’s diversified platform, strong profit growth, and disciplined M&A strategy. The company's stock price has decreased by approximately 14.58% since our coverage. This is because the thesis has not played out yet, due to valuation compression and near term sentiment pressure. However, core business fundamentals remain intact. MOI Global Equity Research shares a similar view but emphasizes valuation disconnect and industry consolidation.

Marex Group plc is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 34 hedge fund portfolios held MRX at the end of the third quarter which was 39 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of MRX as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Traditional production has served existing markets well, but meeting this growing demand requires a diversified approach.” Tomoaki Ichida, CEO, MOL Switch","Ammobia, a San Francisco-based startup developing modular “Haber-Bosch 2.0” ammonia production plants, has raised a $7.5 million seed round to advance reactor technology it says can materially cut the cost and complexity of ammonia synthesis. The round was backed by Shell Ventures, ALIAD (Air Liquide), MOL Switch (Mitsui O.S.K. Lines’ venture arm), and Chevron Technology Ventures, with additional participation from Katapult Ocean, AIR Capital, Alumni Ventures, and Motivate Fund. Ammobia also reported follow-on capital from existing investors, including Starlight Ventures, Collaborative Fund, Arosa Capital, and Zero Infinity Partners, bringing total funding to $13.5 million across dilutive and non-dilutive capital.

The company said it will use the financing to build a pilot facility to further derisk its reactor approach and to identify a cohort of customers for commercial demonstrations.

Ammonia is among the world’s most-produced chemicals, serving as the key input for nitrogen fertilizers that underpin global food production and as a feedstock for chemicals and plastics. The company is positioning its technology against a broader, anticipated expansion in demand as ammonia is explored for uses such as maritime shipping fuel, power generation, and energy storage and transport over the coming decades.

Conventional ammonia production via the Haber-Bosch process typically requires centralized, capital-intensive facilities and extreme operating conditions, and is often tied to natural gas supply dynamics. Ammobia said its alternative design combines novel materials science, reaction engineering, and commercially available components to enable smaller, standardized plants with lower capital requirements and the flexibility to operate closer to end markets. The company argues that approach could reduce exposure to supply shocks associated with centralized production and volatile global supply chains, while also supporting a longer-term pathway to decarbonization.

Ammobia said it has validated performance over thousands of operating hours and demonstrated operation at roughly 10x lower pressure and 150°C lower temperature than conventional synthesis conditions. Based on those results, the company believes its approach can reduce total synthesis-loop costs by up to half, with implications for overall ammonia affordability at a range of scales and with different upstream energy sources. The company also said the lower-pressure, modular configuration can better accommodate intermittent renewable power, potentially reducing reliance on costly hydrogen storage in clean-ammonia configurations.

Beyond economics and resilience, Ammobia framed its technology as a decarbonization lever for an industry responsible for nearly 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with downstream implications across agriculture, energy, maritime, and chemicals. The company said lowering the cost barrier to producing ammonia with low-carbon inputs could accelerate adoption of cleaner pathways across those sectors.

Separately, Ammobia said it has added Guido Radaelli as chief engineering officer. Radaelli has decades of experience in ammonia process technology development and commercialization, and the company said his appointment strengthens its ability to move from pilot work toward commercial deployments.

About Ammobia, the company said it was founded in 2023 and is building modular ammonia production systems designed to reduce costs while remaining compatible with global manufacturing standards. It also noted recognition as a 2025 World Economic Forum Technology Pioneer and said its co-founders were included in Forbes 30 Under 30 Manufacturing & Industry 2024.

KEY QUOTES

“The ammonia industry is at an inflection point. If we want to lower costs and cut emissions in existing ammonia markets – while enabling ammonia’s untapped value in energy and maritime fuel – we need production technology designed for where the world is headed, not where it’s been.”

Future-proof your print security in 2026 to secure the Future of Work As the threat to print ecosystems escalate, quantum advances loom, and identity management fatigue sets in, reassessing printer security posture in 2026 will be essential to protecting the Future of Work.
These robust print security strategies must combine automated recovery, isolation technologies and quantum-resistant BIOS security to guarantee uptime, form a fortified barrier against intrusion and counter next-generation attacks.","Advances in AI and automation will continue to reshape how organizations operate in 2026, helping employees work smarter and faster and unlocking new levels of efficiency. But without the right security, new technology can expand the attack surface and expose enterprises and SMBs alike to potential new risks — making it harder to keep employees productive and protected.

While security strategies are usually updated to address emerging threats, the printing ecosystem is still a persistent point of exposure. Embedded in everyday workflows, networked printers function as edge devices. If compromised, they can provide attackers with a direct route into corporate networks, enabling sensitive data theft, lateral movement, or attacks that knock critical devices out of service. Print security risks from large enterprises down to SMBs, will only worsen in 2026, as AI-powered threats intensify cybercrime, assisting attackers with complex tasks like vulnerability discovery.

As printers increasingly appear on attackers’ radar, organizations will need a more holistic view of cyber resilience that extends to the print ecosystem. Here are three print security trends to watch out for in 2026:

Organizations will need to take notice of print, IoT, and edge security after a string of attacks

Despite a year of high-profile attacks against connected devices in 2025, where security vulnerabilities allowed for remote takeovers of printers, many organizations lack basic visibility and control over print infrastructure.

Related reading:

This creates security blind spots — from exploitation attempts to insider threats, outdated firmware, malicious updates and misconfigurations, such as open ports or unchanged default credentials. After all, printers are most often used by cybercriminals as a launchpad to capture ever-escalating permissions. This enables threat actors to access the broader network of data and devices.

In the year ahead, organizations and governments should demand that endpoint devices, like printers, come with continuous and active system monitoring throughout their lifecycle. Future-proofing security will mean securing the complete device ecosystem, including printers. Having the ability to automate print fleet security compliance and assessment of fleet firmware vulnerability status will minimize IT overhead for security conscious organizations in 2026.

Quantum resilience will increasingly influence printer decisions

A year on from the introduction of new NIST standards for quantum-resistant asymmetric cryptography, public sector and critical infrastructure companies are going to accelerate planning and vendor engagements to chart a path towards migration. This process will reveal the scale of the challenge. With NIST intending to deprecate RSA-2048 by 2030 and all RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography by 2035, many vendors are likely to seize the opportunity to move directly from RSA-2048 to quantum resistant algorithms — particularly in critical industries and long-life systems, such as hardware.

With ongoing advances in quantum computing, the prospect of a quantum computer capable of breaking asymmetric cryptography within a decade is becoming increasingly plausible. The U.S. government’s decision to set a quantum-resistance deadline of 2027 for new National Security System devices signals this urgency. Adding to the pressure, the threat from 'harvest now, decrypt later’ attacks mean data must be protected today against future breaches.

To become quantum resilient, organizations must start by preparing their long-lived hardware, including their printers. With an office-class commercial printer lifespan of between four to five years, devices procured in 2026 have the potential to be in use within the timeframe of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer.

As a result, from 2026 onwards, quantum resilience will increasingly influence hardware procurement decisions. This will increase pressure on device manufacturers to future-proof their devices by embedding quantum resistant cryptography into their products, while pushing for the protection of long-life data. By embedding quantum resilience now, organizations can maintain trust in the technologies shaping the Future of Work.

Organizations will shift to unified identity, provenance, and persistent control

We’ll also see efforts within cybersecurity shift from fragmented identity frameworks and perimeter-based controls to a unified, data-centric model. Today’s zero-trust implementations often create complexity and fatigue, with identity scattered across users, apps, and devices. This fragmentation leads to blind spots, inconsistent enforcement, and poor user experience. The next phase will prioritise consolidation: centralised identity orchestration that simplifies access, strengthens governance, and reduces operational risk.

At the same time, we’ll see security move from focusing on point of entry, to managing the custody of data throughout its lifecycle. Organizations will need visibility into where data originates, how it is used, and who has access — even after it leaves their boundaries. Identity and policy will travel with the data, embedded through persistent controls, telemetry, and rich metadata. Dynamic permissions such as ‘can I share this?’ will evolve into continuous oversight, ensuring compliance online and offline.

Provenance and lifecycle control will also become critical in the age of AI, where transparency and trust are non-negotiable. By embedding identity, custody, and governance controls into the core of digital ecosystems, organizations will achieve stronger, adaptive security that protects without adding friction.

Future-proof your print security in 2026 to secure the Future of Work

As the threat to print ecosystems escalate, quantum advances loom, and identity management fatigue sets in, reassessing printer security posture in 2026 will be essential to protecting the Future of Work. Embedding security within printers remains one of the most effective defences for the year ahead.

Boston, which recently raised its annual profit forecast on strong demand for its heart devices, said the inclusion of Penumbra's products will help it improve ""revenue and margins over time"".

Penumbra has developed a comprehensive portfolio that includes differentiated devices to treat conditions such as pulmonary embolism, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, acute limb ischemia, heart attack and aneurysms.

The deal values Penumbra at $374 per share, a premium of about 19.3% to its last close.

The transaction is expected to be completed in 2026.

Three people close to the matter told Reuters on Monday that UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel had expressed interest in the Monte dei Paschi (MPS) stake held by Delfin during meetings with Francesco Milleri, the head of the Italian holding company.

The sources said UniCredit was also potentially interested in Delfin's stake in insurer Generali (GASI.MI), opens new tab.

UniCredit's statement said that it was the job of the bank's internal M&A team to study all possible growth options, including external ones.

""This at any one time will involve discussions with, and assessment and analysis of, the target in question, none of which is indicative of the likelihood of a transaction taking place,"" it said.

Italian financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported on Thursday that a new meeting between Milleri and Orcel could take place as early as this weekend, adding that the Delfin chairman had reservations about the transaction.

In expressing its disappointment about ""recent rumours and constant noise"" about its alleged interest in the MPS and other stakes, Italy's second-largest bank said that, at present, these were ""pure invention"" and served no purpose other than to distort and confuse the market.

Under veteran M&A banker Orcel, UniCredit has worked to deploy part of its large reserves of capital to buy stakes in Germany's Commerzbank (CBKG.DE), opens new tab and Greece's Alpha Bank (ACBr.AT), opens new tab, but it has failed so far to clinch a merger.

MARLBOROUGH, Mass. and ALAMEDA, Calif., Jan. 15, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) and Penumbra, Inc., (NYSE: PEN) today announced the companies have entered into a definitive agreement under which Boston Scientific will acquire Penumbra in a cash and stock transaction that values Penumbra at $374 per share, reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $14.5 billion.i

""Penumbra is a well-established company with an experienced, high-performing team and this acquisition offers Boston Scientific an opportunity to enter new, fast-growing segments within the vascular space,"" said Mike Mahoney, chairman and chief executive officer, Boston Scientific. ""I'm thrilled to combine the talents and shared values of our teams – including welcoming Penumbra's chairman and chief executive officer, Adam Elsesser, to our board of directors upon close. The addition of Penumbra can expand access for these novel technologies to more patients and customers around the world, further enhancing our revenue and margins over time with proven offerings that have a history of growth and innovation.""

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globallyii and include disorders of the heart and blood vessels that can restrict blood flow and increase the risk of clots throughout the body. To address the escalating prevalence of these complex diseases, Penumbra has developed a comprehensive portfolio that includes differentiated devices to treat conditions such as pulmonary embolism, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, acute limb ischemia, heart attack and aneurysms.

Penumbra offers innovative mechanical thrombectomy products for use in peripheral vascular procedures to remove blood clots causing blockages in arterial, venous and pulmonary vessels, including the Lightning Bolt® and Lightning Flash® computer assisted vacuum thrombectomy (CAVT™) systems. The company's vascular portfolio also includes a minimally invasive peripheral embolization system, which is designed to stop blood flow to control hemorrhaging and bleeding or to close blood vessels.

Neurovascular offerings from Penumbra currently include differentiated solutions for access, stroke revascularization and neuro embolization. The company is continuing to innovate in these areas and add meaningful clinical evidence to support expanded access for more patients worldwide.

""Our decades-long development of therapies for challenging medical conditions has focused on deep innovation for complex diseases so that we can offer physicians novel solutions to transform patient care,"" said Adam Elsesser. ""I am grateful for the amazing people who have contributed to this work and look forward to uniting our efforts and shared values as we come together with Boston Scientific.""

Penumbra expects to deliver fourth quarter reported revenue growth in the range of approximately 21.4% - 22.0% and full year 2025 reported revenue of approximately $1.4 billion, representing growth in the range of approximately 17.3% - 17.5% over the prior fiscal year.iii Penumbra continues to advance its technologies with a multi-year research and development plan and ongoing clinical programs.

Under the terms of the agreement, which has been approved by the board of directors of each company, the transaction values each Penumbra share at $374, with Penumbra stockholders having the right to elect to receive $374 in cash or 3.8721 shares of Boston Scientific common stock (valued at $374 based on the volume weighted average price of Boston Scientific common stock over the last 10 trading days, as of January 13, 2026), subject to proration, so that the total transaction consideration is paid approximately 73% in cash and approximately 27% in shares of Boston Scientific common stock. Adam Elsesser has indicated that he will elect to receive Boston Scientific shares for all his Penumbra shares.

Boston Scientific expects to finance the approximately $11 billion cash portion of the transaction consideration with a combination of cash on hand and new debt. The transaction is expected to be $0.06-0.08 dilutive to adjusted earnings per share for Boston Scientific in the first full year following the close of the acquisition, neutral to slightly accretive in the second year and more accretive thereafter. The impact to GAAP earnings per share is expected to be dilutive in the first full year following the close, and less dilutive or increasingly accretive thereafter, as the case may be, due to amortization expense and acquisition-related net charges.

The transaction is expected to be completed in 2026, subject to receipt of Penumbra's stockholder approval and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants his engineers to spend exactly zero percent of their time writing code. In a recent appearance on the No Priors AI podcast, Huang revealed that every engineer at the $3 trillion chipmaker now uses Cursor, an AI coding assistant, throughout their workday. His goal? Free them entirely from what he calls 'syntax' so they can focus on finding and solving problems that haven't been cracked yet.

The idea is simple: coding is the task, but discovering and solving novel problems is the purpose. AI should handle the former so humans can concentrate on the latter.

Why radiologists didn't disappear, and why engineers might not either

Huang points to radiology as proof this approach creates jobs rather than eliminates them. Years ago, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton predicted radiologists would be obsolete within five years because computers could scan images faster than humans. Instead, radiologist numbers have grown. The reason, Huang argues, is that reading scans was always just a task—the real purpose is diagnosing disease and improving patient outcomes. When AI took over the grunt work, demand for the human expertise behind it actually expanded. At Nvidia's recent all-hands meeting, Huang reportedly pushed back hard against managers who were telling teams to dial back AI usage. ""Are you insane?"" he said, according to Business Insider. He promised employees they'd still have work to do—just more ambitious work.

Vibe coding pioneers warn Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s approach has limits

Not everyone shares Huang's unbridled optimism. Michael Truell, CEO of Cursor itself—the $29 billion startup whose AI tool Nvidia has embraced—recently cautioned against 'vibe coding,' where developers let AI build software without reviewing the output. ""If you close your eyes and don't look at the code and have AIs build things with shaky foundations, things start to kind of crumble,"" Truell told Fortune's Brainstorm AI conference. Even Andrej Karpathy, the former Tesla AI director who coined the term 'vibe coding,' admitted his recent Nanochat project was ""basically entirely hand-written"" because AI agents ""just didn't work well enough."" He recently warned fellow programmers: ""I've never felt this much behind. The profession is being dramatically refactored."" For now, Huang's betting big that humans who focus on purpose rather than tasks will come out ahead. Whether that bet pays off for the millions of developers who actually write code for a living remains the undiscovered problem.

ID39,S&P Global,2026-01-15 11:31:16+00:00,the Guardian,'The consumers are still out there': why a bankruptcy for Saks Global may not spell the end,"Lauren Aratani, www.theguardian.com, lauren-aratani",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/15/saks-global-bankruptcy,"After the acquisition, the newly created Saks Global company would oversee three luxury department store brands: Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue.
Hudson’s Bay spun off Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks Off 5th, Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus into a separate company, Saks Global, in 2024.
But after the Neiman Marcus deal, Saks Global struggled to pay back its vendors.
Saks Global CEO Marc Metrick, a longtime executive with nearly 30 years at the company, abruptly announced his departure.
“The merchandising and vendor relations makes it what it is for the consumer.” Baker, through Saks Global, did not respond to a request for comment.","Every year, the stores down Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue dress up their windows at Christmastime. Tourists from all over the world come to gawk at all the glitter, lace, ruffles and bows.

Saks’s Fifth Avenue location, so iconic that it’s embedded in the brand’s name, is usually dressed top to bottom during the holidays. In 2023, the store partnered with Christian Dior to display a giant zodiac calendar. As part of the light show, fireworks were released from the top of the store to the oohs and aahs of spectators.

But in 2024, the show went dark. Saks Fifth Avenue was without its extravagant lights throughout the holiday season, for the first time since the show debuted in 2004.

Money was tight that year. The company had just announced a $2.7bn deal to acquire competitor Neiman Marcus. To fund the deal, Saks borrowed $2.2bn.

It was a “challenging year for luxury”, Saks told the New York Post at the time, but the company voiced optimism for the new year. After the acquisition, the newly created Saks Global company would oversee three luxury department store brands: Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue.

But just more than a year after this new luxury behemoth was formed, Saks Global on Wednesday announced that it had filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, amid problems paying off its debts. While filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy doesn’t force a company into liquidation, it’s a major hit to a brand that was once among the most prestigious in retail.

The bankruptcy appears to mark the latest in a string of once-quintessential American retail giants now struggling to pay their bills. Many companies that rely on bricks-and-mortar stores have struggled to compete with online retailers. Saks is no exception.

But that’s just part of the story. The changing retail environment has shaken many companies, but some – even department stores – are learning to survive. Saks competitors Bloomingdale’s and Nordstrom both reported revenue growth last year.

So what happened to Saks? To those who have been following the company over the last year, bankruptcy almost seemed inevitable. Not because of retail’s shifting reality – though that hasn’t helped the company – but because of a string of decisions made by company executives over the last few years.

Saks is the third department store firm owned by former parent company Hudson’s Bay that has filed for bankruptcy. Hudson’s Bay spun off Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks Off 5th, Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus into a separate company, Saks Global, in 2024.

Hudson’s Bay acquired Lord & Taylor in 2006, and while the company held strong for years, it eventually sold the chain’s flagship Fifth Avenue store to WeWork, and the entire brand in 2019. The company closed its remaining stores in 2020.

Last year, Hudson’s Bay – the Canadian department store that gave its namesake to its parent company – liquidated all of its stores after filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing struggles to pay back its lenders and suppliers.

Analysts agree that Saks made a huge bet buying Neiman Marcus, especially with $2.2bn of borrowed funds. “As soon as you put debt into the equation in this kind of environment, it just crunches your ability to operate,” said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData Retail.

This is especially true for department stores that rely on relationships with vendors to stock their stores. With everything imaginable available online, the draw of a bricks-and-mortar store is the curated selection they can offer consumers.

But after the Neiman Marcus deal, Saks Global struggled to pay back its vendors. In its bankruptcy petition, the company listed luxury firms including Chanel and Kering, owner of Gucci, as some of their creditors, with the company owing them tens of millions of dollars in unpaid invoices. In a recent note to investors, analysts at S&P Global said Saks had experienced “significant inventory challenges” over the last three years.

Dwindling stock in stores hit on Saks’s bottom line last year. In the second quarter, the company’s revenue dropped 13%.

Come the turn of the year, things started to look dire. Saks Global CEO Marc Metrick, a longtime executive with nearly 30 years at the company, abruptly announced his departure. It emerged soon after that the company had missed a multimillion-dollar interest payment on its loans at the end of 2025.

To some industry observers, that’s the catch. What may seem like a retail company on the surface is likely serving another purpose for company executives.

“They certainly will talk about the intention to be a global retailer, but they also see a group that has very large real estate assets. It owns some of the properties that it trades from in very prime locations,” Saunders said. “And they will say, look, if we can’t make the retail bit work, does it really matter?”

Saunders pointed to longtime Sears CEO Eddie Lampert, who oversaw the liquidation of the company’s store while still maintaining control of its real estate holdings through a separate company, which he owned.

“Their mindset is deal-making, it’s asset monetization,” said Saunders. “It’s not, hey, here are a couple of retail brands that we need to protect, cherish and grow.”

When announcing its chapter 11 filing, Saks Global also said that executive chair Richard Baker would step away from the company. Baker is also the longtime CEO of Hudson’s Bay, and of leading real estate and investment company NRDC Equity Partners.

It’s a sign Saks Global is planning to pivot back into its retail origins. Geoffroy van Raemdonck, Neiman Marcus CEO from 2018 to 2024, has taken Baker’s place.

“Richard Baker is all about real estate,” said Shelley Kohan, a former Saks executive. “He’s not about retail. He’s never been a retailer.”

“For a high-end luxury company, you need a merchant running [the business] and a merchant that has a deep connection with a vendor community, that understands at the end of the day [that] a department store like Saks is all about product,” added Kohan, a professor of fashion business management at the Fashion Institute of Technology. “The merchandising and vendor relations makes it what it is for the consumer.”

Baker, through Saks Global, did not respond to a request for comment.

Experts point to Macy’s CEO Tony Spring as a retail leader who is considered a “merchant”. Under him, Bloomingdale’s – which is owned by Macy’s – has been expanding through stores with a smaller physical footprint than the typical multifloor department store, a strategy also taken on by competitor Nordstrom.

“His view is, I want to grow it over time, and protect it,” Saunders said. “It’s a very, very different mindset [from Baker]. Neither of them are completely wrong, but they come from very different positions.”

In its announcement Wednesday, Saks Global said incoming CEO van Raemdonck will be “appointing industry veterans and former Neiman Marcus Group leaders” to join him as Saks executives.

Saks’s bankruptcy is not the end of the company, but a fork in the road for the luxury department store brand.

“I think there’s a lot of opportunity for Saks to more consistently put their business decisions in the eyes of the customer,” Kohan said, adding that she’s a “firm believer” in physical retail: “The consumers are still out there.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e20962bcb81f6379e919a82bda0e7cab1f06c37/356_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a7b3abb46f85e07ae05f533575d67583",N,,2026-01-15 10:04:12.611214

Even after this strong run—and despite what is clearly a premium valuation—I believe Walmart still has room to run over the long term. The key driver is the company’s accelerating transformation into a technology-enabled, data-driven enterprise that extends well beyond traditional retail.

Walmart is no longer simply a scale retailer competing on price. It is evolving into a hybrid consumer platform, logistics powerhouse, and AI-driven commerce ecosystem, and that shift underpins a bullish long-term outlook.

A Durable Long-Term Growth Algorithm

I believe management remains well positioned to deliver on Walmart’s long-term financial algorithm of roughly 4% annual sales growth and 4%–8% operating income growth. That may sound modest on the surface, but when combined with Walmart’s scale, improving mix, and growing contribution from higher-margin businesses, it creates meaningful earnings and free cash flow leverage over time.

After several years of multiple expansion, the stock’s bull run is likely closer to the middle or later innings rather than the early stage. In the very near term, the setup is somewhat tricky, as management could adopt a conservative tone when it introduces full-year guidance alongside Q4 earnings in mid-February.

However, from a multi-year perspective, Walmart’s fundamentals remain exceptionally strong, supported by continued market share gains, improving profitability in e-commerce, and rapid growth in alternative revenue streams.

Technology, Automation, and AI as Structural Tailwinds

Walmart’s ongoing digital transformation is one of the most underappreciated aspects of the story. The company is leveraging automation, data, and artificial intelligence across its stores, warehouses, and digital platforms to drive productivity and improve the customer experience. AI-enabled tools are improving inventory accuracy, accelerating delivery times, and boosting associate efficiency in both stores and fulfillment centers.

Walmart is also rapidly evolving into an AI-driven shopping destination. Its generative and agentic AI initiatives increasingly support multimodal shopping experiences that blend text, voice, images, and live assistance. The company’s Sparky AI assistant already helps customers search, summarize reviews, build baskets, and personalize recommendations, while also emerging as a new advertising surface.

Strategic partnerships further reinforce this trajectory. Walmart now enables customers to shop and check out directly through conversational interfaces such as ChatGPT, and it has recently partnered with Google (GOOGL) to integrate Gemini into Walmart and Sam’s Club shopping experiences. These integrations enable customers to discover products via natural-language prompts, receive personalized recommendations linked to their Walmart accounts, and complete purchases without opening the Walmart app. This kind of conversational commerce positions Walmart at the forefront of how AI reshapes consumer behavior.

Alternative Revenue Streams Still in Early-to-Mid Innings

One of the most compelling elements of the Walmart story is the long runway in alternative revenue streams. Retail media through Walmart Connect, marketplace expansion, membership income from Walmart+, fulfillment services, and data monetization through platforms such as Scintilla are increasingly significant contributors to growth and profitability.

While Walmart has already made significant progress in these areas, management commentary suggests that there remains substantial opportunity. These businesses are higher-margin and more capital-light than traditional retail, and their growth enables Walmart to reinvest aggressively in price, convenience, and technology while still expanding operating margins. Over time, this mix shift should structurally improve Walmart’s earnings power and cash flow profile.

Valuation

I estimated Walmart’s fair value by averaging the results of 14 different valuation models, including P/E multiples, a 10-year DCF with a revenue exit, and a multi-stage DDM. Based on this analysis, I arrived at a fair value of approximately $90 per share, implying roughly 25% downside from the current stock price. That said, valuation alone does not fully capture Walmart’s strategic positioning.

There is no question that Walmart trades at a premium valuation. Shares currently command a P/E of roughly 46x and an EV/EBITDA multiple above 23x, above sector medians of 16x and 11x, respectively.

However, I believe that the premium is justified. Walmart’s combination of scale, AI-driven efficiency, alternative revenue growth, and consistent market share gains supports a structurally higher multiple than traditional retailers. This is increasingly a technology-enabled consumer platform with durable cash flow and defensive characteristics, not just a low-margin big-box chain.

Is WMT a Good Stock to Buy Now?

Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about Walmart. Data from TipRanks shows a consensus rating of Strong Buy, supported by 25 Buy ratings, one Hold, and no Sell recommendations. Among the 26 analysts who have issued 12-month price targets for Walmart, the average stock price target is $125.88, implying a ~5% upside in 2026.

Walmart’s Transformation Is Accelerating

In short, Walmart’s reinvention is both real and picking up speed. Its investments in AI, automation, omnichannel infrastructure, and higher-margin revenue streams are strengthening the core business and expanding long-term earnings potential. Even with a richer valuation, I still view Walmart as one of the highest-quality long-term compounders in retail—and I remain bullish on the stock.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2713035715-750x406.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 08:01:47.315222

'This transaction demonstrates how InvestEU can be deployed at scale to deliver tangible impact for Europe's Small and Mid-sized Enterprises,' said EIF Chief Executive Marjut Falkstedt. 'By significantly expanding our partnership with UniCredit, we are supporting thousands of businesses in Central and Eastern Europe as they invest in sustainability, innovation and digital transformation. The strong utilisation of the previous guarantee confirms both the demand and the effectiveness of this approach, and we are proud to support its further expansion.'

'SMEs in EU CEE employ over 65% of people in the region and deliver more than 55% of the economic value, but some of their ambitions still outpace their access to affordable finance,' highlighted Teodora Petkova, Head of UniCredit for Central and Eastern Europe. 'By extending our InvestEU partnership with EIF, we are increasing lending volumes and providing tangible benefits: better terms, longer horizons, and now access to capital markets through minibonds. This way entrepreneurs with good ideas can invest, innovate and scale faster, with fewer constraints, while boosting CEE regions growth and opportunities.'

The extended agreement introduces minibonds as an eligible financing instrument, supporting SMEs' access to debt capital markets and diversifying funding sources beyond traditional bank lending.

IRVINE, Calif., Jan. 14, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biomerica, Inc. (Nasdaq: BMRA), (the “Company”) a global provider of advanced medical diagnostic and therapeutic products today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 ended November 30, 2025.

Key Highlights:

Management Commentary

Zack Irani, CEO said, ""We are executing a deliberate strategic pivot from legacy, lower-margin products to higher-value, higher-margin diagnostic-guided therapy products. The current revenue softness reflects this transition, not fundamental business deterioration. With our fixed cost structure largely in place, we believe incremental revenue from inFoods® IBS and new partnerships such as Henry Schein as well as hp+detect™ opportunities should drive significant margin expansion. Additionally, our contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) expansion leverages existing infrastructure to generate higher-margin revenue while diversifying our revenue base.""

""While second quarter revenue reflected expected variability across our established product lines, Biomerica continued to strengthen its financial foundation through successful capital raising activities and disciplined cost management,” said Gary Lu, CFO of Biomerica. “Earlier in the fiscal year, the Company also received approximately $1.10 million in Employee Retention Credit (ERC) refunds, which, together with our financing initiatives, contributed to a $457,000 year-to-date improvement in working capital and an increase in our cash position to $2.5 million. As we advance key programs from development into commercialization, we are prudently reallocating resources, which resulted in a 27% reduction in research and development expenses, while continuing to invest in the commercial launch of high-value diagnostic programs, including inFoods® IBS and hp+detect™. We maintain access to additional capital through our existing shelf registration to support future growth initiatives.”

Second Quarter and Year-to-Date Fiscal 2026 Financial Results

Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 were $1.21 million, compared to $1.64 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease primarily reflects the absence of large initial distributor stocking orders in the Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”) region recorded in the prior year period, as the Company’s regional partner ramped up its initial market rollout. While Biomerica continues to generate recurring revenue from the region, the prior year quarter benefited from these upfront inventory purchases. The quarter also reflects normal timing variability in international shipments as well as lower contract manufacturing activity. These impacts were partially offset by continued growth in inFoods® IBS sales.

For the six months ended November 30, 2025, net sales were $2.59 million, compared to $3.44 million in the prior year period. Gross margin for the six-month period was 18%, compared to 21% in the prior year, reflecting lower overall sales volume as the Company transitions from legacy products to higher-margin diagnostic-guided therapy offerings. Management expects gross margins to expand as inFoods® IBS and hp+detect™ sales scale and added CDMO services.

Operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 were $1.42 million, compared to $1.43 million in the same period last year. For the six months ended November 30, 2025, operating expenses decreased approximately 4% to $2.96 million, compared to $3.09 million in the prior year period. This performance reflects Biomerica’s continued focus on cost discipline and operational efficiency, including targeted reductions across administrative, research, and manufacturing. Notably, when excluding professional service fees related to Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) filings, which contributed to the Company's increase in cash, normalized operating expenses for the six-month period decreased by approximately 7% compared to the prior year. With the Company's fixed cost structure now largely optimized, management expects incremental revenue from new product launches and strategic partnerships to drive meaningful operating leverage and margin expansion.

Net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 was $1.32 million, compared to $0.95 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting lower revenue and gross margin during the period. For the six months ended November 30, 2025, net loss improved to $1.31 million, compared to $2.27 million in the prior year period, primarily due to sustained expense discipline and the recognition of a non-recurring tax credit earlier in the fiscal year. Biomerica continues to prioritize operational efficiency and disciplined cost management while selectively investing in core diagnostic programs designed to drive long term value. The Company's strategic focus on transitioning its revenue mix toward higher-margin products, combined with its optimized cost structure, positions Biomerica to benefit from significant operating leverage as inFoods® IBS, hp+detect™, and CDMO services gain commercial traction.

About inFoods®

The inFoods IBS test involves a simple blood collection procedure and is designed to assess a patient’s above normal immunoreactivity to specific foods. Instead of difficult to manage broad dietary restrictions, physicians can now use the inFoods IBS information to make targeted, patient-specific recommendations about specific foods that, when removed from the diet, may alleviate IBS symptoms such as pain, bloating, diarrhea and constipation. Further information about Biomerica’s patented inFoods® Technology Platform can be found at: https://biomerica.com/inFoods/our-technology/. The inFoods IBS clinical study was performed at several prominent centers including Mayo Clinic, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Inc. - a Harvard Medical School Teaching Hospital, Houston Methodist Hospital, and the University of Michigan. The clinical results for improvement in the Abdominal Pain Intensity (API) responder endpoint of >30%, for IBS patients in the treatment diet arm had a statistically significant improvement over patients in the placebo diet arm (p-value of 0.0246). The improvement for patients in the treatment arm versus the placebo arm is considered clinically significant and is similar and, in some cases, better than the current drugs in the market.

ID18,Eli Lilly,2026-01-15 10:12:58+00:00,The News Journal,Delaware latest to sue pharmaceutical companies over insulin prices,Isabel Hughes,,,,,https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/local/2026/01/14/de-lawsuit-claims-greed-big-pharma-insulin-eli-lilly-novo-nordisk-cvs-caremark-express-scripts/88181042007/,"It argues that the companies ""conspired to increase insulin prices by as much as 1,000% over the past 15 years.""
According to the court filing, prices began ticking up in 2003 when pharmacy benefit managers ""began their rise to power.""
Pharmacy benefit managers act as middlemen between health insurance companies, drug manufacturers and pharmacies to manage prescription drug benefits and negotiate prices.
Other states file similar suits Numerous other states have filed similar lawsuits in recent years.
Mississippi was the first state to initiate litigation against both insulin manufacturers and pharmacy benefit managers, filing suit in 2021.","Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings is suing several drug manufacturers and pharmacy benefit managers for reported insulin price gouging, following similar legal action taken by other states in recent years.

The Delaware Department of Justice announced the suit Jan. 14, though it was filed on Jan. 13 in Delaware's Court of Chancery. It argues that the companies ""conspired to increase insulin prices by as much as 1,000% over the past 15 years.""

Those named in the suit include the nation’s three primary insulin manufacturers − Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi − and the three largest pharmacy benefit managers: CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx.

According to the state Department of Justice, more than 110,000 Delawareans live with diabetes and 130,000 live with prediabetes, a condition defined by elevated blood sugar that puts them at risk for developing diabetes in the future.

""The disease costs Delaware’s economy roughly $1.1 billion per year,"" a state Department of Justice news release said. ""The uninsured population has a diabetes prevalence rate of nearly twice the state’s average, which has left them especially susceptible to injury from the illegal pricing scheme. Nearly all diabetics in Delaware rely on daily insulin treatments to survive.""

Jennings, in a statement, blamed the pricing on greed.

“The level of greed that would drive someone to price-gouge consumers over life-saving diabetes medicine is almost unfathomable,” Jennings said in a statement. “It is an avarice that not only hurts diabetics across the country financially, but in many cases leads to medication hoarding and preventable deaths.""

What does the lawsuit claim?

According to the court filing, prices began ticking up in 2003 when pharmacy benefit managers ""began their rise to power."" Pharmacy benefit managers act as middlemen between health insurance companies, drug manufacturers and pharmacies to manage prescription drug benefits and negotiate prices.

This allows them to ""exert tremendous influence over what drugs are available throughout Delaware and at what prices,"" the suit says.

By 2016, the lawsuit claims, the average monthly price of the four most popular types of insulin rose to $450. Specific insulins saw even greater increases.

One type of insulin sold by Eli Lilly, Humulin R, increased from $165 in 1997 to $1,784 in 2023, the suit says.

""....costs continue to rise, so much so that now one in four diabetics are skimping on or skipping lifesaving doses,"" the court filing says. ""This behavior is dangerous to a diabetic’s health and can lead to a variety of complications and even death.""

The suit also claims that on more than a dozen occasions since 2009, ""competitors Sanofi and Novo Nordisk raised the list prices of their insulins, Lantus and Levemir, in tandem, taking the same price increase down to the decimal point within a few days of each other.""

The suit also notes similar practices with GLP-1 medications, which have become increasingly popular weight loss and diabetes-control tools in recent years. It says Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have more than tripled the prices of Victoza, Ozempic and Trulicity since their release.

Other states file similar suits

Numerous other states have filed similar lawsuits in recent years.

Most recently, Oregon's attorney general filed suit against the same parties. Indiana's attorney general also filed a nearly identical lawsuit in late December.

Mississippi was the first state to initiate litigation against both insulin manufacturers and pharmacy benefit managers, filing suit in 2021. The case was later consolidated with other similar actions and is being litigated as part of ongoing multidistrict court proceedings.

OpenAI is partnering with Sam Altman-backed AI chipmaker Cerebras to deploy 750 MW of its wafer-scale systems to make OpenAI’s chatbots faster.

Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman calls this the “largest high-speed AI inference deployment in the world”. Sources tell The Wall Street Journal that the deal is worth more than $10bn.

The AI system will be deployed in multiple stages beginning this year, and capacity is expected to come online in multiple tranches through 2028, the two companies have said.

Cerebras has a faster-is-better approach to AI chips. The company is behind WSE-3, the “largest” AI chip ever built, with 19-times more transistors and 28-times more compute that the Nvidia B200.

“Reasoning that take minutes on Nvidia GPUs take a single second on Cerebras,” Feldman said last year, announcing OpenAI’s gpt-oss-120B that runs on Cerebras.

Cerebras’ speed comes from its massive chip that combines compute, memory and bandwidth, eliminating bottlenecks that slow inference on conventional hardware, explains OpenAI. The company already works with the likes of Meta, powering some of its Llama models.

“Just as broadband transformed the internet, real-time inference will transform AI, enabling entirely new ways to build and interact with AI models,” said Feldman.

OpenAI CEO Altman was an early investor in Cerebras, and the two companies met frequently over the last decade to explore opportunities to work together.

“Cerebras adds a dedicated low-latency inference solution to our platform. That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people,” said Sachin Katti, who develops OpenAI’s compute infrastructure.

Since its early days, OpenAI has been a voracious consumer of Nvidia’s AI technology. Recently, however, it has been looking for alternatives. Last year, AMD and OpenAI signed a 6GW agreement to power OpenAI’s AI infrastructure across multiple generations of AMD Instinct GPUs.

In September, Nvidia signed a deal to sell up to 10 GW of its chips to OpenAI, but that hasn’t materialised yet. While a separate $300bn deal with Oracle would give OpenAI Oracle’s cloud compute power for a five year period.

Earlier this week, The Information reported that Cerebras is in discussions to raise $1bn at a $22bn valuation. Last September, it raised $1.1bn in a Series G round at a $8.1bn post-money valuation, with backers including Fidelity Management and Research Company; Atreides Management; Altimeter; Alpha Wave Global; and Benchmark.

Meanwhile, according to a Wall Street Journal report from December, OpenAI is in the early stages of a funding round that could value the company at $830bn.",https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AdobeStock_564087424_Editorial_Use_Only.jpeg,N,,2026-01-15 06:00:30.684231

A joint venture equally owned by TotalEnergies and Air Liquide, the company opened seven new stations during the year, adding to the infrastructure required for hydrogen‑powered heavy trucks.

Two new French stations—located in Marseille‑Fos and Reims—became operational in late 2025. Both offer round‑the‑clock service and can dispense up to one tonne of hydrogen per day at 350 and 700 bar, the pressures required for commercial vehicles. These sites join existing infrastructure outside Paris. Beyond France, five additional stations opened in Germany and the Netherlands, contributing to a footprint that now includes 15 locations across five countries.

TEAL Mobility plans further expansion in 2026, including projects in Mulhouse, Antwerp, Rotterdam, Berlin and Duisburg, areas positioned near major freight corridors and ports.

Measures of AI success broaden beyond productivity to growth, risk management, and customer experience

Two-thirds of CXOs say that clearer governance and accountability frameworks would help them better leverage AI in decision-making

Paris, January 15, 2026 – New research shows that after an era of ‘AI hype’, business leaders are now increasingly realistic and pragmatic about their AI strategies, and have started using it in their decision-making. The Capgemini Research Institute publishes today a report on AI perspectives, The multi-year AI advantage: Building the enterprise of tomorrow, along with a spotlight report on AI and decision-making, How AI is quietly reshaping executive decisions. As organizations enter 2026, the research suggests that organizations and their leaders will need to be more deliberate about governance, skills, accountability and human-AI chemistry to realize the full transformative value of AI.

As AI adoption is growing, businesses are accelerating AI investments for competitiveness and long-term value creation

According to The multi-year AI advantage: Building the enterprise of tomorrow, which surveyed 1,505 executives at large organizations globally, 38% of organizations already operationalize generative AI use cases, while six in ten organizations are now exploring agentic AI applications. Nearly half of Chinese organizations are piloting or deploying agentic AI, ahead of US and European ones. Two thirds of business leaders believe that if they fail to scale AI as rapidly as their competitors, they risk missing strategic opportunities and losing their competitive edge.

Meanwhile, the way organizations measure AI success is evolving. Operational efficency and cost reduction are no longer the sole benchmarks: new measures of ROI include revenue growth, risk management and compliance, knowledge management and customer experience and personalization. Business leaders globally are more mindful than ever of the need to maintain control over their critical assets. More than half of organizations now prioritize data sovereignty, ensuring that sensitive or regulated data remains under their control.

Looking ahead, organizations are planning to accelerate AI investments, prioritizing functions with well-defined processes and measurable outcomes, and signaling a shift from experimentation towards long-term value creation. Nearly two thirds say they have started pausing lower-value AI projects to redirect their efforts toward high-impact areas. On average, they expect to allocate 5% of their annual business budget1 to AI initiatives in 2026, up from 3% in 2025, and aim to focus on infrastructure, data, governance, and workforce upskilling, laying a strong foundation for AI adoption and impact.

“We have now entered a new, more pragmatic and realistic era of AI-driven transformation, focused on longer-term, enterprise-wide implementations, to improve not just productivity , but revenue, customer experience, risk management, innovation, or decision-making,” says Pascal Brier, Chief Innovation Officer at Capgemini and Member of the Group Executive Committee. “AI has now crossed a critical threshold: the question is no longer whether to pursue AI, but how to embed it into the fabric of the enterprise. As we enter 2026, many organizations are rightly prioritizing strong AI foundations – data, governance, and human-AI chemistry – but one other area stands out as a critical factor in successful AI deployments – leadership readiness. AI use is also now informing strategic decision-making. How leaders set a clear vision for its use across the enterprise and take responsibility for it will be key to effectively harness its transformative power.”

AI is reshaping decision-making

In addition, a spotlight report on decision-making, How AI is quietly reshaping executive decisions, surveyed 500 CXOs including 100 CEOs. It finds that more than half of CXOs are using AI to support or inform their strategic decision-making today, either “actively” – a trend expected to more than double within the next three years – or “selectively”, with close to another third currently “experimenting” with it. If these CXOs are currently mostly using AI to help with emails, meeting notes and documents, and research and analysis, in 3 years they expect to use it primarily to augment and challenge strategic thinking.

Early adoption is already delivering value. More than half of CXOs report reduced time and cost to make decisions, and improvements in creativity and foresight through the use of AI. At the same time, leaders are clear that AI remains an input rather than a replacement for human judgment. Just 1% of CXOs believe AI could autonomously make certain strategic decisions in the next one to three years.

CEOs, CFOs and COOs are also mindful of the ramifications of AI-driven decision making. Just 41% of them report an above-average level of trust in AI for executive decision-making, with the main concerns for all CXOs being legal and security risks as well as difficulty to explain AI-influenced decisions. In addition, many senior leaders remain reluctant to discuss their own use of AI publicly. Only 11% of CXOs say they currently highlight or plan to highlight the use of AI in business decisions. Those who prefer not to disclose AI use cite concerns about reputational risk if AI-influenced decisions go wrong and uncertainty around how clients, partners and the public perceive AI use.

Methodology of the reports

For The multi-year AI advantage: Building the enterprise of tomorrow report, 1,505 executives at organizations with more than $1 billion in annual revenue across 15 industries in North America, Europe, APAC, and Latin America were surveyed. All these organizations have already deployed AI at limited or full scale and executives surveyed were director-level and above. The survey was conducted in November 2025.

For the How AI is quietly reshaping executive decisions report, the Capgemini Research Institute conducted a quantitative survey of 500 C-suite executives, including 100 CEOs. Executives surveyed were employed at organizations with annual revenue exceeding $10 billion, spanning 16 countries and 13 industries. The survey was conducted in August and September 2025. The survey findings were complemented with insights from in-depth interviews with 6 C-level executives.

Do you think there's more to the story for Hewlett Packard Enterprise?","In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk tend to justify a higher “normal” or “fair” P/S multiple, while slower growth and higher risk usually point to a lower one. The context around the business therefore matters as much as the raw number.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise currently trades on a P/S of 0.86x. That sits below the broader Tech industry average of 1.84x and also below the peer group average of 4.39x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Hewlett Packard Enterprise is 2.44x, which is their estimate of an appropriate P/S multiple given factors such as the company’s growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics.

This Fair Ratio is designed to be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the industry because it incorporates those company specific drivers rather than relying only on broad group averages. Comparing Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current 0.86x P/S to the 2.44x Fair Ratio, the shares screen as undervalued on this measure.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Hewlett Packard Enterprise Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. On Simply Wall St’s Community page you can use Narratives, where you and other investors link a clear story about Hewlett Packard Enterprise to concrete forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins. You can then compare the resulting Fair Value estimate with the current price to decide whether it looks like a buy or a sell for your personal view, and see that Fair Value update automatically as new news or earnings arrive. Some investors might build a higher value story around AI, networking and cloud growth. Others, looking at the same company, may set a lower value because they focus more on hardware, memory cycle risk and integration challenges.

ID4,Albertsons,2026-01-15 08:39:02+00:00,Investing.com,Morgan Stanley downgrades Albertsons stock rating to Underweight on grocery wars risk,Not Available,,,,,https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/morgan-stanley-downgrades-albertsons-stock-rating-to-underweight-on-grocery-wars-risk-93CH-4448763,"Investing.com - Morgan Stanley downgraded from Equalweight to Underweight on Thursday, while significantly lowering its price target to $14.00 from $20.00.
Morgan Stanley believes Albertsons faces the highest risk among food retailers in ""intensifying grocery wars,"" potentially leading to deeper market share losses in 2026.
Albertsons’ substantial pharmacy business represents another concern, as the company has the largest pharmacy mix in Morgan Stanley’s coverage universe.
According to InvestingPro, Albertsons’ current EV/EBITDA ratio is 6.74, with the stock trading close to its Fair Value.
Goldman Sachs also revised its price target to $24.00, maintaining a Buy rating on the stock.","Investing.com - Morgan Stanley downgraded from Equalweight to Underweight on Thursday, while significantly lowering its price target to $14.00 from $20.00. This comes as InvestingPro data shows 12 analysts have recently revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, despite the stock currently trading at a P/E ratio of 11.57.

The investment firm cited three key factors behind the downgrade, with grocery market competition topping the list. Morgan Stanley believes Albertsons faces the highest risk among food retailers in ""intensifying grocery wars,"" potentially leading to deeper market share losses in 2026.

Albertsons’ substantial pharmacy business represents another concern, as the company has the largest pharmacy mix in Morgan Stanley’s coverage universe. The firm expects industry-wide pharmacy headwinds of 85-155 basis points could impact Albertsons more severely than competitors.

The downgrade also reflects limited top-line growth drivers for Albertsons in 2026, as the company’s recent sales growth has been primarily driven by pharmacy sales rather than core food sales, unlike other retailers in the sector. InvestingPro data reveals the company’s revenue growth was just 2.24% in the last twelve months.

Morgan Stanley further anticipates Albertsons will face margin pressure in 2026 after excluding benefits from IRA rebates, though it acknowledged the stock’s undemanding valuation at approximately 4.6x next-twelve-months EV/EBITDA could provide some support if inflation or unit growth rebounds more than expected. According to InvestingPro, Albertsons’ current EV/EBITDA ratio is 6.74, with the stock trading close to its Fair Value. Investors can access Albertsons’ comprehensive Pro Research Report, along with additional financial insights available for over 1,400 US equities.

In other recent news, Albertsons Companies reported its third-quarter earnings for fiscal year 2025, revealing an earnings per share (EPS) of $0.72, which exceeded analyst projections of $0.68. However, the company’s revenue slightly fell short of expectations, coming in at $19.12 billion compared to the anticipated $19.18 billion. Despite the EPS beat, concerns over the revenue shortfall and declining gross margins were noted. Following these results, UBS lowered its price target for Albertsons to $23.00, citing delayed turnaround efforts in a challenging macroeconomic environment, while maintaining a Buy rating. Similarly, BMO Capital adjusted its price target to $23.00, noting solid third-quarter results but highlighting sluggish industry volumes. Goldman Sachs also revised its price target to $24.00, maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. These developments reflect ongoing challenges and adjustments in analyst expectations for Albertsons.

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

With Creator Studio, however, Apple has put a bunch of tools into a brown paper bag of confusion: The assortment is too complex for the Canva crowd yet underpowered compared to the Adobe suite.

With Creator Studio, however, Apple has put a bunch of tools into a brown paper bag of confusion: The assortment is too complex for the Canva crowd yet underpowered compared to the Adobe suite.

Stiff competition

Adobe CC is the true bundle for creators. It covers every industry: design, publishing, motion design, video, audio, and even office productivity via Acrobat. For $70 per month—no perpetual, one-time-payment licenses available anymore—you get all you need, plus Adobe’s AI, Firefly. In fact, for most people it’s overkill. Not many people do even a third of what Adobe CC covers. This is why so many people are fed up with their subscription model (worth noting: It still has about 41 million paying users).

Canva is an all-in-one bundle for everyday creators: a browser-first suite that makes it easy to design social posts, presentations, simple videos, print materials, and brand kits without needing pro expertise. It’s built around a cloud account with a big free tier, plus paid plans ($15/month for individuals and $10/month per user for the teams version) that include AI tools. For a while, Canva was “enough” for 90% of what people make, and anything heavier—like advanced photo compositing, full motion graphics pipelines, high-end audio—usually lived elsewhere. Now, however, they’ve added free perpetual licenses for the Affinity suite, which competes with Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign.

Both of them are coherent in their focus and power in their own way. That’s not really something you can say about Apple’s new $13 monthly subscription package. Apple is asking us to pay for a hodgepodge of apps where the flagship video editor, Final Cut Pro (FCP), may not even be the runner-up anymore. Outside of very high-end video editing—still dominated by Avid—Adobe Premiere Pro sits comfortably at the top of the market share charts with an estimated 30 million users in 2024. I say “estimated,” because Adobe hasn’t released official numbers. Like Apple, which last claimed Final Cut Pro had 2.5 million users in 2018. A lot has changed since that year, and many video editors now argue that Blackmagic Design’s Resolve is the best video editor (and it is free).

Another main plate in the Creator Studio is the newly acquired Pixelmator Pro, which Apple is seemingly positioning as its Photoshop killer. If you want a potential Adobe killer, you look at Affinity. Now owned by Canva, the Affinity suite (Photo, Designer, Publisher) is a genuine triple-threat that rivals Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign with a free (again, there are free options for most of the Apple and Adobe apps) price tag.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/01/p-1-91474571-apple-creator-studio.jpg",N,,2026-01-15 05:59:29.485969

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

The Talent Pool is Overflowing: The world’s brightest minds are flocking to AI.

From computer scientists to mathematicians, the next generation of innovators is pouring its energy into this field.

This influx of talent guarantees a constant stream of groundbreaking ideas and rapid advancements.

By investing in AI, you’re essentially backing the future.

The future is powered by artificial intelligence, and the time to invest is NOW.

Don’t be a spectator in this technological revolution.

Dive into the AI gold rush and watch your portfolio soar alongside the brightest minds of our generation.

This isn’t just about making money – it’s about being part of the future.

Three people close to the matter told Reuters on Monday that UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel had expressed interest in the Monte dei Paschi (MPS) stake held by Delfin during meetings with Francesco Milleri, the head of the Italian holding company.

The sources said UniCredit was also potentially interested in Delfin's stake in insurer Generali (GASI.MI), opens new tab.

UniCredit's statement said that it was the job of the bank's internal M&A team to study all possible growth options, including external ones.

""This at any one time will involve discussions with, and assessment and analysis of, the target in question, none of which is indicative of the likelihood of a transaction taking place,"" it said.

Italian financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported on Thursday that a new meeting between Milleri and Orcel could take place as early as this weekend, adding that the Delfin chairman had reservations about the transaction.

In expressing its disappointment about ""recent rumours and constant noise"" about its alleged interest in the MPS and other stakes, Italy's second-largest bank said that, at present, these were ""pure invention"" and served no purpose other than to distort and confuse the market.

Under veteran M&A banker Orcel, UniCredit has worked to deploy part of its large reserves of capital to buy stakes in Germany's Commerzbank (CBKG.DE), opens new tab and Greece's Alpha Bank (ACBr.AT), opens new tab, but it has failed so far to clinch a merger.

The line, which is slated to launch in the spring, is a stylish testament to McCartney’s continuing dialogue on ethics and transparency in the fashion industry.

McCartney (yes, the daughter of The Beatles guitarist Paul McCartney) is known for her responsible luxury maverick status and penchant for sustainable innovation. Last Paris Fashion Week, the designer made waves for debuting plant-based feathers on the runway, which were reported to move with all the drama of real feathers while remaining animal cruelty-free. Her pieces can be found in the closets of fashion figures Emily Ratajkowski and Amelia Gray, beloved for their singular style.

Her latest collaboration with H&M carries on her legacy of sustainable fashion, bucking traditional textiles for lower-impact alternatives that avoid generating unnecessary waste. Ethical fashion enthusiasts will be excited to hear that the line is made chiefly from certified, recycled materials, proof that style doesn’t have to come at the cost of a living planet. Amid news of fast fashion’s role in fueling the global waste crisis, McCartney’s dedication to innovating design feels like a much-needed step towards the right direction.

“Stella is a true ground breaker,” says Ann-Sofie Johansson, Creative Advisor for H&M. “From the start, she disrupted fashion with designs that put forward a rule-breaking femininity. This collection is full of must-have pieces that nod to that legacy. Stella’s moral compass and tireless commitment to sustainable practices have long inspired all of us at H&M, so it’s an honour to partner with her on such an ambitious project.”

Walking The Sustainability Talk

With McCartney, H&M reconceptualizes the idea of collaboration. Beyond a meeting of creative minds, the collection is also a breeding ground for impactful, long-lasting action and a platform to foster hope for the future.

McCartney’s latest collaboration introduces an “Insights Board,” a forum open to different stakeholders across the apparel value chain — from raw material suppliers to all the way to retailers — to brainstorm, ideate, and discuss how to make their industry more sustainable, ecological, and attuned to animal welfare.

Of her latest H&M collection, McCartney says, “This second partnership feels like a chance to look at how far we’ve come on sustainability, cruelty-free practices, and conscious designs — and to stay honest about how far we still have to go, together. I am thrilled to have H&M join me on this road; real change only happens when we push from both the outside and the inside, and I’ve always believed in infiltrating from within to move the industry forward.”

From London To The World

During the 2025 Fashion Awards in London, the world saw its first glimpse of the second H&M x Stella McCartney collection. Models, entrepreneurs, and artists such as Gray, Ratajkowski, Anitta, Yasmin Wijnaldum, Bel Priestley, Alton Mason, and Kiara Nirghin donned pieces from the line, cutting through the carpet with McCartney’s design DNA: lace, sparkles, and striking nods to the early aughts.

“It was an honour to wear this amazing look and give people a sneak peek of the Stella McCartney H&M collection,” says Brazilian singer-songwriter Anitta. “I felt amazing in red. This feels like another perfect match, between two very beloved brands.”

A scrap storage hall, including extended outdoor areas, is now ready for operation.

Once the final interior installations are completed in early 2026, the facility will go online and strengthen the company's recycling capabilities.

The new hall enables segregated storage of different aluminium scrap grades, aluminium pieces, and primary metal such as T-bars, ingots, and sows.

Together with the new outdoor storage areas, the facility ensures precise material separation, improved quality control, and more efficient workflows.

With an added capacity of around 16,000 tons, it enhances logistics and material flow.

The building also houses modern offices, social areas, and a workshop, along with designated parking for industrial vehicles.

Short distances between material intake, storage, and casting improve efficiency and reduce handling time.

A covered sampling station ensures safe access for inspecting incoming trucks.

Materials are visually checked and analysed here using spectrometers to detect differences in aluminium content, impurities, and piece size.

At a latest share price of £4.80, Barclays has seen a 26.5% 90 day share price return, while its 1 year total shareholder return of 75.3% points to momentum that has built over a longer stretch.

If bank stocks like Barclays are on your radar, it can also be useful to compare them with other financial names and ideas through .

With the shares up sharply and trading only about 1.8% below the latest analyst target, yet with an estimated intrinsic value implying a 44.9% discount, you have to ask yourself: is there still a buying opportunity here, or is the market already pricing in future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 4.1% Overvalued

With Barclays last closing at £4.80 against a narrative fair value of £4.61, the story is built around earnings quality rather than extreme optimism.

Ongoing investments in digital banking and technology platforms including integration of fintech partnerships and sustained client onboarding in corporate banking are expected to drive operational efficiency and expand Barclays' digital revenue streams, supporting stronger net margins.

Want to see what is sitting behind that modest premium tag? The narrative focuses on revenue, margins and valuation. Curious how those moving parts combine into a single fair value number?

Result: Fair Value of £4.61 (OVERVALUED)

However, there are still pressure points to watch, including tougher competition for UK deposits and loans, as well as ongoing regulatory reviews that could reshape Barclays' capital and costs.

Another Angle On Valuation

The narrative fair value suggests Barclays is 4.1% overvalued at £4.80, but the current P/E of 11.1x tells a slightly different story. It sits just under the European Banks average of 11.3x and below peers at 13.9x, yet above the fair ratio of 9.9x. That mix points to some valuation risk if the market drifts closer to the fair ratio. How much of a premium are you comfortable with?

Dive Brief:

IBM on Thursday launched Sovereign Core, a purpose-built software platform letting customers create, deploy and manage cloud and AI workloads under an organization’s own authority.

Instead of adding sovereignty controls to existing architectures, IBM Sovereign Core “makes sovereignty an inherent property of the software itself,” the company said. Regulatory risks are pushing CIOs to adjust their infrastructure and innovation strategies to consider local data or sovereignty requirements.

“It is addressing what we’ve seen for a lot of corporations, a lot of CIOs, is a major challenge,” Rick Villars, group VP of worldwide research at IDC, told CIO Dive. The platform will be available in tech preview starting in February, with full general availability planned for mid-year.

Dive Insight:

CIOs are facing mounting pressure to embed AI into processes throughout the organization. Yet AI deployment at scale can prove challenging, particularly for multinational companies facing digital sovereignty requirements in countries outside of the U.S.

Countries in the European Union, Canada, Germany, India, Australia and many more have enacted a wide range of laws governing digital infrastructure, often enforcing data localization requirements and other measures protecting data and technology infrastructure.

Vendors are responding. SAP, for example, deployed its EU AI Cloud in December to help support customers with their AI deployments in countries with strict regulatory environments.

Enterprises with a multinational presence are realizing that digital sovereignty requirements make it “virtually impossible for them to think about implementing consistency or scale in their AI investments,” Villars said.

Gartner predicts more than 75% of enterprises outside of the U.S. will adopt a digital sovereignty strategy supported by a sovereign cloud strategy, according to a survey of 241 CIOs and IT leaders in Western Europe. Of those surveyed, 61% cited geopolitical factors as a driving force toward local or regional cloud providers.

Sovereign clouds can help companies meet local data requirements piecemeal, but often lack the consistency needed to replicate an AI investment across different parts of the organization, Villars said. It’s a significant barrier preventing enterprises from thinking about large AI deployments, he added.

“What IBM has announced for this system is an approach that allows companies to bring some of that consistency back,” Villars said.

IBM Sovereign Core is built on Red Hat’s open source foundation. It provides a customer-operated control plane allowing enterprises to maintain direct authority over operations, deployments and system configurations, the company said.

The platform enables ongoing compliance by generating evidence of data being stored and managed within a sovereign boundary and allows for AI model deployment, local inference execution and agent operations under local governance without exporting data to external providers, according to IBM.

Customers can deploy the product in on-premises data centers, in-region cloud infrastructure or via IT service providers.

“This is sovereign by design,” Priya Srinivasan, general manager of IBM software products, told CIO Dive. While the product’s compliance center will come pre-loaded with sovereign frameworks specific to each country with such rules, it also allows for customizations, Srinivasan said.

There’s not a singular fix for every sovereignty need — and IBM Sovereign Core isn’t as comprehensive as a full suite of cloud services, Villars said. However, the product is a standard building block allowing enterprises to construct data “islands in isolation” from the same foundation.

As CIOs struggle to manage AI deployments due to sovereignty constraints, hyperscalers and infrastructure companies will be looking to provide products like IBM Sovereign Core and SAP EU AI Cloud to navigate those challenges.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/j_YwDejyl-xmlrFVCvmh69y0ikgovJSjMbK6GkFsK2M/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE2MjAxOTQ4LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-15 02:59:36.999485

Trigger Jump Securities Based on the Performance of the Common Stock of Micron Technology, Inc. due August 4, 2027

Principal at Risk Securities

Unlike conventional debt securities, the securities will pay no interest and do not guarantee the return of the full principal amount at maturity. Instead, if the final underlier value is greater than or equal to 60% of the initial underlier value, which we refer to as the trigger value, at maturity investors will receive the stated principal amount plus a positive return equal to the fixed percentage, which will be determined on the pricing date and will be at least 41.20%. However, if the final underlier value is less than the trigger value, at maturity investors will lose 1% of the stated principal amount for every 1% that the final underlier value is less than the initial underlier value. Under these circumstances, the amount investors receive will be less than 60% of the stated principal amount and could be zero. The securities are for investors who are willing and able to risk their principal and forgo current income in exchange for the opportunity to receive a return equal to the fixed percentage if the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value. Investors may lose their entire initial investment in the securities. Any positive return on the securities will be limited to the fixed percentage and you will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the underlier above the fixed percentage, which may be significant. The securities are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of Barclays Bank PLC. Any payment on the securities, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC and is not guaranteed by any third party. If Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its payment obligations or become subject to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power (as described on page 5 of this document) by the relevant U.K. resolution authority, you might not receive any amounts owed to you under the securities. See “Risk Factors” and “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this document and “Risk Factors” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

In connection with this offering, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management is acting in its capacity as a selected dealer.

Additional Information Regarding Our Estimated Value of the Securities

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables, such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the pricing date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the securities might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the securities on the pricing date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the securities. The difference between the initial issue price of the securities and our estimated value of the securities is expected to result from several factors, including any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the securities, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the securities, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the securities. These other costs will include a fee paid to LFT Securities, LLC, an entity in which an affiliate of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management has an ownership interest, for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.

Our estimated value on the pricing date is not a prediction of the price at which the securities may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the securities in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the securities in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the pricing date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the pricing date for a temporary period expected to be approximately 40 days after the initial issue date of the securities because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the securities and other costs in connection with the securities that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the securities. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the securities and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the securities. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial issue date of the securities based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read “Risk Factors” beginning on page 11 of this document.

You may revoke your offer to purchase the securities at any time prior to the pricing date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the securities prior to their pricing date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the securities, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.

Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the securities or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the securities (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the securities), by acquiring the securities, each holder or beneficial owner of the securities acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the securities; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the securities into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the securities of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the securities and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the securities, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the securities, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the securities solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the securities further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the securities are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the securities may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You may lose some or all of your investment if any U.K. bail-in power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in this document as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Investment Summary

Trigger Jump Securities

Principal at Risk Securities

The Trigger Jump Securities Based on the Performance of the Common Stock of Micron Technology, Inc. due August 4, 2027 (the “securities”) can be used:

§As an alternative to direct exposure to the underlier that provides for the potential of a fixed positive return if the underlier appreciates, remains flat or depreciates, but only if the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value, in lieu of full participation in any appreciation of the underlier

§To enhance returns and potentially outperform the underlier in a moderately bullish or bearish scenario

Any positive return on the securities will be limited to the fixed percentage and you will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the underlier above the fixed percentage, which may be significant.

If the final underlier value is less than the trigger value, the securities are exposed on a 1:1 basis to the negative performance of the underlier.

Maturity: Approximately 1.5 years Fixed percentage: At least 41.20%. The actual fixed percentage will be determined on the pricing date. Trigger value: 60% of the initial underlier value Minimum payment at maturity: None. Investors may lose their entire initial investment in the securities. Interest: None

Key Investment Rationale

The securities are for investors who are willing and able to risk their principal and forgo current income in exchange for the opportunity to receive a return equal to the fixed percentage if the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value. Investors may lose their entire initial investment in the securities.

The following scenarios reflect the potential payment on the securities, if any, at maturity:

Upside Scenario The final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value. In this case, at maturity, the securities pay the stated principal amount of $1,000 plus a positive return equal to the fixed percentage of at least 41.20%. The actual fixed percentage will be determined on the pricing date. Downside Scenario The final underlier value is less than the trigger value. In this case, at maturity, the securities pay less than 60% of the stated principal amount and the percentage loss of the stated principal amount will be equal to the percentage decrease from the initial underlier value to the final underlier value. For example, if the final underlier value is 55% less than the initial underlier value, the securities will pay $450.00 per security, or 45% of the stated principal amount, for a loss of 55% of the stated principal amount. There is no minimum payment at maturity on the securities. Accordingly, investors could lose their entire investment in the securities.

Selected Purchase Considerations

The securities are not appropriate for all investors. The securities may be an appropriate investment for you if all of the following statements are true:

§You do not seek an investment that produces periodic interest or coupon payments or other sources of current income.

§You anticipate that the final underlier value will be greater than or equal to the trigger value, and you are willing and able to accept the risk that, if it is not, you will lose a significant portion, and possibly all, of the stated principal amount of the securities.

§You understand and accept that any potential upside return on the securities is limited to the fixed percentage, and you will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the underlier above the fixed percentage, which may be significant.

How the Trigger Jump Securities Work

Payoff Diagram

The payoff diagram below illustrates the payment at maturity on the securities based on the following terms:

Stated principal amount: $1,000 per security Hypothetical fixed percentage: 41.20%. The actual fixed percentage will be determined on the pricing date. Trigger value: 60% of the initial underlier value Minimum payment at maturity: None. You could lose your entire initial investment in the securities.

Trigger Jump Securities Payoff Diagram

Scenario Analysis

§Upside Scenario. If the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value, at maturity investors will receive the $1,000 stated principal amount plus a positive return equal to the hypothetical fixed percentage of 41.20%.

§For example, if the underlier appreciates by 5%, at maturity investors would receive a return equal to the hypothetical fixed percentage of 41.20%, or $1,412.00 per security.

§If the underlier appreciates by 50%, at maturity investors would receive a return equal to the hypothetical fixed percentage of 41.20%, or $1,412.00 per security, even though the underlier has appreciated by more than the fixed percentage.

§If the underlier depreciates by 10%, at maturity investors would receive a return equal to the hypothetical fixed percentage of 41.20%, or $1,412.00 per security, even though the underlier has depreciated.

§Downside Scenario. If the final underlier value is less than the trigger value, at maturity investors will receive an amount that is less than 60% of the $1,000 stated principal amount and that will reflect a 1% loss of principal for each 1% decline in the underlier. Investors may lose their entire initial investment in the securities.

§For example, if the underlier depreciates by 55%, investors would lose 55% of their principal and receive only $450.00 per security at maturity, or 45% of the stated principal amount.

What Is the Total Return on the Securities at Maturity, Assuming a Range of Performances for the Underlier?

The following table and examples illustrate the hypothetical payment at maturity and hypothetical total return at maturity on the securities. The “total return” as used in this document is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results from comparing the payment at maturity per $1,000 stated principal amount to $1,000.00. The table and examples set forth below assume a hypothetical initial underlier value of $100.00, a hypothetical trigger value of $60.00 (or 60% of the hypothetical initial underlier value) and a hypothetical fixed percentage of 41.20%. The hypothetical initial underlier value of $100.00 has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and may not represent a likely actual initial underlier value. Please see “Micron Technology, Inc. Overview” below for recent actual values of the underlier. The actual initial underlier value, trigger value and fixed percentage will be determined on the pricing date. Each hypothetical payment at maturity or total return set forth below is for illustrative purposes only and may not be the actual payment at maturity or total return applicable to a purchaser of the securities. The numbers appearing in the following table and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The table and examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the securities.

Hypothetical Examples of Amount Payable at Maturity

The following examples illustrate how the payment at maturity and total return in different hypothetical scenarios are calculated.

Example 1: The value of the underlier increases from the initial underlier value of $100.00 to a final underlier value of $150.00.

Because the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value, the payment at maturity is calculated as follows:

$1,000 + ($1,000 × fixed percentage)

= $1,000 + ($1,000 × 41.20%)

= $1,412.00

Because the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value, the payment at maturity is equal to $1,412.00 per security, representing a total return of 41.20% on the securities, even though the underlier appreciated by 50.00% from its initial underlier value to its final underlier value.

Example 2: The value of the underlier decreases from the initial underlier value of $100.00 to a final underlier value of $90.00.

Because the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value, the payment at maturity is calculated as follows:

$1,000 + ($1,000 × fixed percentage)

= $1,000 + ($1,000 × 41.20%)

= $1,412.00

Although the underlier depreciated by 10.00% from its initial underlier value to its final underlier value, because the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value, the payment at maturity is equal to $1,412.00 per security, representing a total return of 41.20% on the securities.

Example 3: The value of the underlier decreases from the initial underlier value of $100.00 to a final underlier value of $40.00.

Because the final underlier value is less than the trigger value and the underlier performance factor is 40.00%, the payment at maturity is equal to $400.00 per security, calculated as follows:

$1,000 × underlier performance factor

= $1,000 × (final underlier value / initial underlier value)

= $1,000 × ($40.00 / $100.00) = $400.00

The total return on the securities is -60.00%.

Risk Factors

An investment in the securities involves significant risks. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the securities. Investing in the securities is not equivalent to investing directly in the underlier. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the securities are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the securities generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the securities unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the securities.

Risks Relating to the Securities Generally

§The securities do not pay interest or guarantee the return of any principal. The terms of the securities differ from those of ordinary debt securities in that the securities do not pay interest or guarantee the return of any of the stated principal amount at maturity. Instead, if the final underlier value is less than the trigger value, which is 60% of the initial underlier value, the payment at maturity will be an amount in cash that is less than the $1,000 stated principal amount of each security by a percentage equal to the percentage decrease from the initial underlier value to the final underlier value. There is no minimum payment at maturity on the securities and, accordingly, you could lose your entire initial investment in the securities.

§The potential return on the securities is limited to the fixed percentage. Any positive return on your securities will not exceed the fixed percentage, regardless of any appreciation in the value of the underlier, which may be significant. If the underlier has appreciated since the pricing date by more than the fixed percentage, you will receive a lower return on the securities than you would have received if you had invested directly in the underlier.

§The fixed percentage provides an enhanced return only for a limited range of positive performance of the underlier. The fixed percentage enhances returns of the underlier only when the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the trigger value and the underlier has not appreciated by more than the fixed percentage. Accordingly, if the underlier depreciates below the trigger value or if the underlier appreciates by more than the fixed percentage from the pricing date to the valuation date, the fixed percentage will not enhance the return on the securities as compared to the return of the underlier.

§Any payment on the securities will be determined based on the closing prices of the underlier on the dates specified. Any payment on the securities will be determined based on the closing prices of the underlier on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable value of the underlier determined at any other time.

§Investing in the securities is not equivalent to investing in the underlier. Investors in the securities will not own the underlier or have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the underlier.

§The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the securities are uncertain. There is no direct legal authority regarding the proper U.S. federal income tax treatment of the securities, and we do not plan to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). Consequently, significant aspects of the tax treatment of the securities are uncertain, and the IRS or a court might not agree with the treatment of the securities as prepaid forward contracts, as described below under “Additional provisions—Tax considerations.” If the IRS were successful in asserting an alternative treatment for the securities, the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the securities could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, in 2007 the Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on various issues regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. Any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the securities, possibly with retroactive effect. You should review carefully the sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders,” and consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the securities (including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by the 2007 notice), as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

§Credit of issuer. The securities are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the securities, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the securities and, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you might not receive any amount owed to you under the terms of the securities.

§You may lose some or all of your investment if any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the securities or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the securities (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the securities), by acquiring the securities, each holder or beneficial owner of the securities acknowledges, accepts,

agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this document. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the securities losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the securities or receiving a different security from the securities, which may be worth significantly less than the securities and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the securities. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the securities will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the securities. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this document as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underlier

§No affiliation with the issuer of the underlier. The issuer of the underlier is not an affiliate of ours, is not involved with this offering in any way, and has no obligation to consider your interests in taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of the securities. We have not made any due diligence inquiry with respect to the issuer of the underlier in connection with this offering.

§Single equity risk. The price of the underlier can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to the underlier and its issuer, such as stock price volatility, earnings, financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political conditions. We urge you to review financial and other information filed periodically with the SEC by the issuer of the underlier.

§Anti-dilution protection is limited, and the calculation agent has discretion to make anti-dilution adjustments. The calculation agent may in its sole discretion make adjustments affecting the amounts payable on the securities upon the occurrence of certain corporate events (such as stock splits or extraordinary or special dividends) that the calculation agent determines have a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of the underlier. However, the calculation agent might not make such adjustments in response to all events that could affect the underlier. The occurrence of any such event and any adjustment made by the calculation agent (or a determination by the calculation agent not to make any adjustment) may adversely affect the market price of, and any amounts payable on, the securities. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

§Reorganization or other events could adversely affect the value of the securities or result in the securities being accelerated. Upon the occurrence of certain reorganization events or a nationalization, expropriation, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or de-listing of the underlier, the calculation agent may replace the underlier with shares of another company identified as described in the prospectus supplement or, in some cases, with shares, cash or other assets distributed to holders of the underlier upon the occurrence of that event. In the alternative, the calculation agent may accelerate the maturity date for a payment determined by the calculation agent or may make other changes to the terms of the securities to account for the occurrence of that event. Any decision by the calculation agent to replace the underlier, to accelerate the securities or to otherwise adjust the terms of the securities could adversely affect the value of, and any amount payable on, the securities, perhaps significantly, and could result in a significantly lower return on the securities than if the calculation agent had made a different decision. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

§Governmental legislative or regulatory actions, such as sanctions, could adversely affect your investment in the securities. Governmental legislative or regulatory actions, including, without limitation, sanctions-related actions by the U.S. or a foreign government, could prohibit or otherwise restrict persons from holding the securities or the underlier, or engaging in transactions in them, and any such action could adversely affect the value of the underlier. These legislative or regulatory actions could result in restrictions on the securities or the de-listing of the underlier. You may lose a significant portion or all of your initial investment in the securities if the underlier is de-listed or if you are forced to divest the securities due to government mandates, especially if such de-listing occurs or such divestment must be made at a time when the value of the securities has declined. See “—Reorganization or other events could adversely affect the value of the securities or result in the securities being accelerated” above.

§We may accelerate the securities if a change-in-law event occurs. Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the securities or the underlier, or engaging in transactions in them, the calculation agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the maturity date for a payment determined by the calculation agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be

significantly less than any amount that would be due on the securities if they were not accelerated. However, if the calculation agent elects not to accelerate the securities, the value of, and any amount payable on, the securities could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

§We may engage in business with or involving the issuer of the underlier without regard to your interests. We or our affiliates may presently or from time to time engage in business with the issuer of the underlier without regard to your interests and thus may acquire non-public information about the issuer of the underlier. Neither we nor any of our affiliates undertakes to disclose any such information to you. In addition, we or our affiliates from time to time have published and in the future may publish research reports with respect to the issuer of the underlier, which may or may not recommend that investors buy or hold the underlier.

§Hedging and trading activity by the issuer and its affiliates could potentially adversely affect the value of the securities. Hedging or trading activities of the issuer’s affiliates and of any other hedging counterparty with respect to the securities could adversely affect the value of the underlier and, as a result, could decrease the amount an investor may receive on the securities at maturity, if any. Any of these hedging or trading activities on or prior to the pricing date could potentially increase the initial underlier value and, as a result, the trigger value, which is the price at or above which the underlier must close on the valuation date so that the investor does not suffer a loss on their initial investment in the securities. Additionally, such hedging or trading activities during the term of the securities, including on the valuation date, could potentially affect the price of the underlier on the valuation date and, accordingly, the amount of cash an investor will receive at maturity, if any.

§We and our affiliates, and any dealer participating in the distribution of the securities, may engage in various activities or make determinations that could materially affect your securities in various ways and create conflicts of interest. We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the securities, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the securities.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the securities, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the underlier. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the securities. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the securities into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the securities.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the securities, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the securities. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the securities and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the securities instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the securities for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

Furthermore, the selected dealer or its affiliates will have the option to conduct a material portion of the hedging activities for us in connection with the securities. The selected dealer or its affiliates would expect to realize a projected profit from such hedging activities, and this projected profit would be in addition to any selling concession that the selected dealer realizes for the sale of the securities to you. This additional projected profit may create a further incentive for the selected dealer to sell the securities to you.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the calculation agent for the securities. As calculation agent, we will determine any values of the underlier and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the securities. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underlier” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the securities, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the securities.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Securities and the Secondary Market

§The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange, and secondary trading may be limited. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to offer to purchase the securities in the secondary market but are not required to do so and may cease any such market making activities at any time, without notice. Even if a secondary market develops, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the securities easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the securities, the price, if any, at which you may be able to trade your securities is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the securities. In addition, Barclays Capital Inc. or one or more of our other affiliates may at any time hold an unsold portion of the securities (as described on

the cover page of this document), which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the securities. The securities are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your securities to maturity.

§The market price of the securities will be influenced by many unpredictable factors. Several factors will influence the value of the securities in the secondary market and the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC may be willing to purchase or sell the securities in the secondary market. Although we expect that generally the value of the underlier on any day will affect the value of the securities more than any other single factor, other factors that may influence the value of the securities include:

othe volatility (frequency and magnitude of changes in value) of the underlier;

odividend rates on the underlier;

ointerest and yield rates in the market;

otime remaining until the securities mature;

osupply and demand for the securities;

ogeopolitical conditions and economic, financial, political, regulatory and judicial events that affect the underlier and that may affect the final underlier value; and

oany actual or anticipated changes in our credit ratings or credit spreads.

The value of the underlier may be, and has recently been, volatile, and we can give you no assurance that the volatility will lessen. See “Micron Technology, Inc. Overview” below. You may receive less, and possibly significantly less, than the stated principal amount if you try to sell your securities prior to maturity.

§The estimated value of your securities is expected to be lower than the initial issue price of your securities. The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your securities. The difference between the initial issue price of your securities and the estimated value of the securities is expected as a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the securities, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the securities, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the securities. These other costs will include a fee paid to LFT Securities, LLC, an entity in which an affiliate of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management has an ownership interest, for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.

§The estimated value of your securities might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market. The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated values referenced above might be lower if such estimated values were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

§The estimated value of the securities is based on our internal pricing models, which may prove to be inaccurate and may be different from the pricing models of other financial institutions. The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the securities may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions that may be purchasers or sellers of securities in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your securities may be materially different from the estimated value of the securities determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

§The estimated value of your securities is not a prediction of the prices at which you may sell your securities in the secondary market, if any, and such secondary market prices, if any, will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your securities and may be lower than the estimated value of your securities. The estimated value of the securities will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the securities from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your securities in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the securities. Further, as secondary market prices of your securities take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the securities such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the securities, secondary market prices of your securities will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your securities. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the securities from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your securities, and any sale prior to the maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you.

§The temporary price at which we may initially buy the securities in the secondary market and the value we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may not be indicative of future prices of your securities. Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the pricing date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the securities, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the securities on the pricing date, as well as the secondary market value of the securities, for a temporary period after the initial issue date of the securities. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your securities.

Additional Information about the Securities

Please read this information in conjunction with the terms on the cover page of this document.

Additional provisions: Minimum ticketing size: $1,000 / 1 security Tax considerations:

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion, when read in combination with those sections, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the securities.

Based on current market conditions, in the opinion of our special tax counsel, the securities should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with respect to the underlier. Assuming this treatment is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the securities (including redemption at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the securities, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the securities. This gain or loss on your securities should be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if you hold your securities for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of securities at the original issue price. However, the IRS or a court may not respect this treatment, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the securities could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the “constructive ownership” regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the securities, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the securities, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the securities do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the securities with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the securities. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the securities.

When the heart pumps blood into the aorta to go across the entire body, the first exit it takes is towards the coronary arteries.
You implant it in the coronary artery when there is a lesion.
When it comes to value, the value of the Bioadaptor is for all patients that have coronary artery disease.","Coronary stents were first developed in the mid 1980s, revolutionizing coronary artery disease treatment for patients.

While stents are still used in patients today, only incremental developments in their technology have been made over the last 30 to 40 years. One company, Elixir Medical, is trying to change that.

The company focuses on re-imagining how new medical technologies will breathe new life into vascular interventions, reshaping the space for decades to come, and developing disruptive platforms to treat coronary and peripheral artery disease.

Elixir’s newest device, the DynamX Bioadaptor, aims to not only improve clogged arteries for patients, but over time actually make the artery stronger.

The novel scaffolding device is readily available in Europe and parts of Asia, it is currently undergoing FDA testing in the U.S.

Vinayak Bhat, COO of Elixir Medical, connected with MD+DI about the adverse events rates of traditional coronary stents, how the DynamX Bioadaptor differs from conventional stents and what vessel restoration means for aging patients and long-term health outcomes, and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical trials of the device.

Can you explain in practical terms how the DynamX Bioadaptor's ""vessel restoration"" mechanism works differently from traditional stents?

Bhat: When plaque builds up in the arteries with coronary artery disease, stents have done a great job in terms of restoring blood flow to these coronary arteries. But what it does not necessarily do is restore the entire functionality of the heart. When the heart pumps blood into the aorta to go across the entire body, the first exit it takes is towards the coronary arteries. So it supplies blood there first before it goes to the brain or rest of the body. Like on an airplane, they say if the mask drops down, even if you love your child more than yourself, you first put the mask on yourself and then on the child. It is the same way here. Nature has designed the coronary arteries in a certain way and the functions, there is hemodynamic modulation in the heartbeat, and with every beat the vessel expands and contracts, there are sheer stressors, which are the communication channel for cells to respond to the changes.

So the functionality of the arteries is not just to pass blood, but also do all of these other things in terms of modulation for the entire functionality of the coronary structure. When we put in a stent, like we have been doing for the last 30+ years, you restore blood flow but take away the natural ability of arteries to expand and contract with every heart beat. That is the important functionality of the vessel. This has an impact on clinical events down the line. What we have designed with the Bioadaptor is an implant that is three coils held together by a bioresorbable polymer coating. You implant it in the coronary artery when there is a lesion. Six months after implantation, for the first six months it works like a stent to restore blood flow, but once that job is done, the bioresorbable polymer coating is gone and these coils unlock from each other, allowing restoration of the arteries.

With every heartbeat, now the vessel expands and contracts like it's supposed to do. Because of that, you have an impact on the plaque that is behind, there is no compliance mismatch. All of these have an important function in terms of reducing coronary events down the line. Currently with traditional stents, every year after the first year, there is a 2-3% chance of clinical events. Events like repeat heart attack, hospitalization, etc. By restoring the functionality by treating it with a Bioadaptor, we have impacted and made a change to that. And now we have clinical data to essentially prove that, from randomized clinical studies.

With over 35 patents behind this technology, what were the most critical engineering breakthroughs that enabled this scaffolding approach? What technical challenges did you have to overcome?

Bhat: We had the good fortune of being around for two decades in this space. We have developed stents, fully bio dissolvable scaffolds, and we have a unique group of individuals with medical backgrounds, strong technical backgrounds, drug delivery and polymer science experts, so if you look at problem statements holistically and then come up with solutions that can address the root cause of the issue. So when we set out to develop the Bioadaptor, it took us over 100 iterations just in terms of coming up with the right configuration to ensure that the restoration will be clinically similar to what a natural coronary artery gets. So all of these iterations on the bench, and we develop multiple versions.

One version that can unlock within three months, one version that can unlock within six months, really to have an understanding of what it takes to ensure restoring of the natural modulation of the artery. Over multiple iterations, a huge challenge was being in a space that has so many stents with just incremental iterations. To take that function and create a new category of device was a pretty interesting challenge. We went about doing the development on the bench, development in preclinical trials, then moving on to multiple clinical studies where we were looking at proof of concept mechanistically to show that it would work. Only then did we go on to do not one, but two randomized clinical studies in two different geographies to show the effect of this device on patients.

What does the long-term safety profile look like for the DynamX Bioadaptor beyond the six-month landmark analysis?

Bhat: We have now two first-in-man smaller studies, 50 patients each. After that, we did a 450 patient randomized clinical study, which now has 3-year follow up data. After that, we did a 2,400 patient randomized study in much sicker patients. Those patients now have a 2-year follow up. Long term data now shows not just safety but excellent efficacy of the Bioadaptor as compared to the traditional standard of care. The second study showed superiority in a landmark analysis. The first study showed an over 50% reduction in clinical events at three years. The second study showed the same. So two independent randomized studies showing a significant impact in terms of superior outcomes. Now, long-term data gives us great confidence in new technology. In addition to these new studies, we have also conducted a post-market, 5,000 patient global study which is ongoing. A lot of physicians are doing their own studies with the device. There is a wealth of data in terms of long-term safety on the Bioadaptor in addition to efficacy.

What's the adoption experience been like in European and Asian markets?

Bhat: When we initially started with the Bioadaptor, every physician who looks at it says it makes a lot of sense. When nature wants the vessel to hemodynamically modulate, we should be using devices that essentially mimic that. But, they were not really certain that just by making these changes we would impact, because traditional stents have been around for the last 30 years and people felt that that was as good as it can get. They thought these other clinical events we were seeing were just disease progression. Initially there was hesitation, but as there is more clinical data that comes out, the adoption has been excellent. We have tens of thousands of patients in the Middle East and Europe who have been treated. In Asia, patients have a say in which devices they get. A lot of patients come into physicians saying they want our Bioadaptor. They want a device that has long-term benefits. So it is getting a lot of traction moving in that direction.

What does the competitive landscape look like? How are established stent manufacturers responding to this disruptive technology?

Bhat: The competitive landscape as we entered the market, we didn't want to compete with the stent as just another product with incremental value. Now that we have clinical data showing superiority, we are positioning ourselves as a premium product from a pricing and outcomes perspective. We have no direct competitors to what the Bioadaptor can do. There are 20 to 30 companies that work in the drug-eluting stent space, and we are not necessarily competing with them, but creating a new category of therapy for patients. When it comes to value, the value of the Bioadaptor is for all patients that have coronary artery disease. Given this is a premium product, in many cases, physicians are using the Bioadaptor for more complex cases.

Those neurosurgery and diabetes updates come as Medtronic’s share price sits at US$98.74, with a 3.9% 90 day share price return and a 19.3% 1 year total shareholder return. This suggests momentum has been building over time.

If these medical device moves have your attention, this could be a good moment to scan other opportunities in and see what else fits your watchlist.

With Medtronic generating US$34,758.0m in revenue and US$4,764.0m in net income, plus a 1 year total return of 19.3% and a solid value score of 4, the key question now is whether shares are still undervalued or if the market is already pricing in future growth.

Most Popular Narrative: 11.1% Undervalued

With Medtronic last closing at US$98.74 against a narrative fair value of about US$111, the current price sits meaningfully below that implied level.

Strengthening the innovation pipeline (for example, Sphere-360, new carotid and thrombectomy devices, next-generation Ardian), combined with an enhanced governance and capital allocation structure and intensified R&D investment, is positioned to support higher long-term earnings growth through both new product launches and share gains in multi-billion-dollar addressable markets.

Curious what sits behind that upside gap? The narrative focuses on steady top line expansion, thicker margins, and a future earnings multiple that still trails many peers.

Result: Fair Value of $111.05 (UNDERVALUED)

However, execution hiccups around new product launches or extended margin pressure in underperforming units like U.S. Diabetes could quickly challenge that 11.1% upside story.

Principal at Risk Securities

Unlike conventional debt securities, the securities will pay no interest and do not guarantee the return of the full principal amount at maturity. Instead, if the closing level of each underlier is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value on any determination date (quarterly, beginning January 26, 2027) other than the final determination date, the securities will be automatically redeemed for an amount per security equal to the stated principal amount plus the call premium applicable to that determination date, as set forth below. If the securities are not automatically redeemed prior to maturity and the final underlier value of each underlier is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value, at maturity investors will receive the stated principal amount plus the maturity date premium, as set forth below. The call premium applicable to each determination date (other than the final determination date) and the maturity date premium applicable to the final determination date will be determined on the pricing date and will each be based on a return of at least approximately 14.45% per annum. If the securities are not automatically redeemed prior to maturity and the final underlier value of the worst performing underlier is less than its initial underlier value but greater than or equal to 70% of its initial underlier value, which we refer to as a trigger value, at maturity investors will receive the stated principal amount, but will not receive any premium. However, if the securities are not automatically redeemed prior to maturity and the final underlier value of any underlier is less than its trigger value, at maturity investors will lose 1% of the stated principal amount for every 1% that the final underlier value of the worst performing underlier is less than its initial underlier value. Under these circumstances, the amount investors receive will be less than 70% of the stated principal amount and could be zero. Because any payment on the securities is based on the worst performing of the underliers, a decline in the closing level of any underlier below its initial underlier value on any determination date (other than the final determination date) will result in the securities not being automatically redeemed prior to maturity, and a decline in the final underlier value of any underlier below its trigger value on the final determination date will result in a significant loss of your investment, in each case, even if the other underliers appreciate or have not declined as much. The securities are for investors who are willing and able to risk their principal and forgo current income and participation in any appreciation in the value of any underlier in exchange for the potential fixed call premium or maturity date premium and the limited protection against loss that applies only if the securities are not automatically redeemed and if the final underlier value of each underlier is greater than or equal to its trigger value. Investors may lose their entire initial investment in the securities. Any positive return on the securities will be limited to the applicable call premium or maturity date premium, as applicable, and you will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any underlier, which may be significant. The securities are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of Barclays Bank PLC. Any payment on the securities, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC and is not guaranteed by any third party. If Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its payment obligations or become subject to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power (as described on page 5 of this document) by the relevant U.K. resolution authority, you might not receive any amounts owed to you under the securities.

If the securities are not automatically redeemed prior to maturity, you will receive on the maturity date a cash payment per security determined as follows:

· If the final underlier value of each underlier is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value:

$1,000 + maturity date premium

· If the final underlier value of the worst performing underlier is less than its initial underlier value but greater than or equal to its trigger value:

$1,000

· If the final underlier value of any underlier is less than its trigger value:

$1,000 × underlier performance factor of the worst performing underlier

Under these circumstances, the payment at maturity will be less than the stated principal amount of $1,000 and will represent a loss of more than 30%, and possibly all, of an investor’s initial investment. Investors may lose their entire initial investment in the securities. Any payment on the securities, including any repayment of principal, is not guaranteed by any third party and is subject to (a) the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC and (b) the risk of exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Additional Information Regarding Our Estimated Value of the Securities

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables, such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the pricing date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the securities might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the securities on the pricing date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the securities. The difference between the initial issue price of the securities and our estimated value of the securities is expected to result from several factors, including any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the securities, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the securities, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the securities. These other costs will include a fee paid to LFT Securities, LLC, an entity in which an affiliate of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management has an ownership interest, for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.

Our estimated value on the pricing date is not a prediction of the price at which the securities may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the securities in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the securities in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the pricing date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the pricing date for a temporary period expected to be approximately 40 days after the initial issue date of the securities because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the securities and other costs in connection with the securities that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the securities. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the securities and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the securities. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial issue date of the securities based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read “Risk Factors” beginning on page 13 of this document.

You may revoke your offer to purchase the securities at any time prior to the pricing date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the securities prior to their pricing date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the securities, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.

Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the securities or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the securities (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the securities), by acquiring the securities, each holder or beneficial owner of the securities acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the securities; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the securities into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the securities of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the securities and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the securities, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the securities, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the securities solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the securities further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the securities are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the securities may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You may lose some or all of your investment if any U.K. bail-in power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in this document as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Investment Summary

Trigger Jump Securities with Auto-Callable Feature

Principal at Risk Securities

The Trigger Jump Securities with Auto-Callable Feature due January 19, 2029 Based on the Value of the Worst Performing of the Nasdaq-100 Index®, the Russell 2000® Index and the S&P 500® Index (the “securities”) can be used:

§To provide for the possibility of an automatic call of the securities at a fixed call premium if the closing level of each underlier on any determination date (other than the final determination date) is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value.

§To provide for the possibility of a return equal to the maturity date premium if the securities are not automatically redeemed prior to maturity and the final underlier value of each underlier is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value.

§As an alternative to direct exposure to the worst performing underlier that provides for the potential of a fixed positive return if the closing level of each underlier is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value as of any determination date in lieu of full participation in any potential appreciation in the value of any underlier.

§If the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity, to provide limited protection against a loss of principal in the event of a decline of any underlier from its initial underlier value to its final underlier value, but only if the final underlier value of each underlier is greater than or equal to its trigger value.

Any positive return on the securities will be limited to the applicable call premium or maturity date premium, as applicable, and you will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any underlier, which may be significant. If the final underlier value of any underlier is less than its trigger value, the securities are exposed on a 1:1 basis to the negative performance of the worst performing underlier from its initial underlier value.

Maturity: Approximately three years (unless redeemed earlier) Early redemption payment: If payable, the early redemption payment will be an amount equal to the sum of (i) the stated principal amount and (ii) the applicable call premium. Trigger value: For each underlier, 70% of its initial underlier value Minimum payment at maturity: None. Investors may lose their entire initial investment in the securities if not automatically redeemed prior to maturity. Interest: None

Key Investment Rationale

The securities are for investors who are willing and able to risk their principal and forgo current income and participation in any appreciation in the value of any underlier in exchange for the potential fixed call premium or maturity date premium and the limited protection against loss that applies only if the securities are not automatically redeemed and if the final underlier value of each underlier is greater than or equal to its trigger value. Investors may lose their entire initial investment in the securities. Any positive return on the securities will be limited to the applicable call premium or maturity date premium, as applicable, and you will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any underlier, which may be significant.

Automatic Early Redemption Scenario If the closing level of each underlier on any determination date (other than the final determination date) is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value, the securities will be automatically redeemed for an amount per security equal to the early redemption payment applicable to that determination date based on a return of at least approximately 14.45% per annum. No further payments will be made on the securities after they have been redeemed. Trigger Feature At maturity, even if the value of each underlier has declined over the term of the securities, investors may receive their stated principal amount, but only if the final underlier value of each underlier is greater than or equal to its trigger value. Upside Scenario at Maturity The securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the final underlier value of each underlier is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value. In this case, at maturity, the securities pay the stated principal amount of $1,000 plus the maturity date premium of $1,000 × at least 43.35%. Par Scenario at Maturity The securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the final underlier value of the worst performing underlier is less than or equal to its initial underlier value but greater than or equal to its trigger value. In this case, at maturity, the securities pay the stated principal amount of $1,000 per security even though the value of the worst performing underlier has declined. Downside Scenario at Maturity The securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the final underlier value of at least one underlier is less than its trigger value. The payment due at maturity will be equal to the stated principal amount times the underlier performance factor of the worst performing underlier. In this case, at maturity, the securities pay less than 70% of the stated principal amount and the percentage loss of the stated principal amount will be equal to the percentage decrease in the final underlier value of the worst performing underlier from its initial underlier value. For example, if the final underlier value of the worst performing underlier is 50% less than its initial underlier value, the securities will pay $500.00 per security, or 50% of the stated principal amount, for a loss of 50% of the stated principal amount. There is no minimum payment at maturity on the securities. Accordingly, investors could lose their entire investment in the securities.

Selected Purchase Considerations

§You do not seek an investment that produces periodic interest or coupon payments or other sources of current income.

Neither the issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the appropriateness of the securities for investment.

Hypothetical Examples

The following tables and examples illustrate the hypothetical payment at maturity or early redemption payment upon an automatic call and hypothetical total return at maturity or upon an automatic call on the securities. The “total return” as used in this document is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results from comparing the payment at maturity or early redemption payment upon an automatic call per $1,000 stated principal amount to $1,000.00. The tables and examples set forth below assume, for each underlier, the following hypothetical values and assume call premiums and a maturity date premium based on a return of approximately 14.45% per annum:

Hypothetical Initial Underlier Values: With respect to each underlier: 100.00 Hypothetical Trigger Values: With respect to each underlier: 70.00, which is 70% of its hypothetical initial underlier value

The hypothetical initial underlier value of 100.00 for each underlier has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and may not represent a likely actual initial underlier value for any underlier. Please see “Nasdaq-100 Index® Overview,” “Russell 2000® Index Overview” and “S&P 500® Index Overview” below for recent actual values of the underliers. The actual initial underlier values, trigger values, call premiums and maturity date premium applicable to the securities will be determined on the pricing date. The table and examples below are based on the worst performing underlier. We make no representation or warranty as to which of the underliers will be the worst performing underlier for the purpose of calculating the payment at maturity. The “worst performing underlier” is the underlier with the lowest underlier performance factor. Each hypothetical payment at maturity or total return set forth below is for illustrative purposes only and may not be the actual payment at maturity or total return applicable to a purchaser of the securities. The numbers appearing in the following table and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The table and examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the securities.

What Is the Total Return on the Securities upon Automatic Call if the Securities Are Automatically Redeemed Prior to Maturity?

The following table and examples illustrate the hypothetical total return on the securities if the securities are automatically redeemed on a determination date (other than the final determination date). The securities will be automatically redeemed if the closing level of each underlier on any determination date (other than the final determination date) is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value for an early redemption payment equal to the stated principal amount plus the call premium applicable to that determination date, as set forth in the table below.

Determination Date Hypothetical Call Premium Early Redemption Payment Total Return on the Securities 1st determination date $1,000 × 14.4500% $1,144.500 14.4500% 2nd determination date $1,000 × 18.0625% $1,180.625 18.0625% 3rd determination date $1,000 × 21.6750% $1,216.750 21.6750% 4th determination date $1,000 × 25.2875% $1,252.875 25.2875% 5th determination date $1,000 × 28.9000% $1,289.000 28.9000% 6th determination date $1,000 × 32.5125% $1,325.125 32.5125% 7th determination date $1,000 × 36.1250% $1,361.250 36.1250% 8th determination date $1,000 × 39.7375% $1,397.375 39.7375% 9th determination date $1,000 × 43.3500% $1,433.500 43.3500%

Example 1: The value of the worst performing underlier increases from its initial underlier value of 100.00 to a closing level of 105.00 on the first determination date, an increase of 5.00%.

Because the closing level of each underlier on the first determination date is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value, the securities are automatically redeemed on the first determination date for an early redemption payment on the related early redemption date of $1,144.500 per $1,000 stated principal, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + call premium applicable to the first determination date

= $1,000 + ($1,000 × 14.4500%)

= $1,000 + $144.500 = $1,144.500

The total return on the securities is 14.4500%, which represents a return of approximately 14.45% per annum.

Example 2: The securities are not automatically redeemed on the first determination date, and the value of the worst performing underlier increases from its initial underlier value of 100.00 to a closing level of 140.00 on the second determination date, an increase of 40.00%.

Because the securities were not redeemed on the first determination date and the closing level of each underlier on the second determination date is greater than or equal to its initial underlier level, the securities are automatically redeemed on the second determination date for an early redemption payment on the related early redemption date of $1,180.625 per $1,000 stated principal, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + call premium applicable to the second determination date

= $1,000 + ($1,000 × 18.0625%)

= $1,000 + $180.625= $1,180.625

The total return on the securities is 18.0625%, which represents a return of approximately 14.45% per annum. Even though the worst performing underlier appreciated by 40.00% from its initial underlier value to its final underlier value in this example, your return is limited to the call premium of 18.0625%.

If Not Redeemed Prior to Maturity, What Is the Total Return on the Securities at Maturity, Assuming a Range of Performances for the Underliers?

The following table and examples illustrate the hypothetical total return on the securities at maturity if the securities are not automatically redeemed.

Final Underlier Value of the Worst Performing Underlier Underlier Appreciation / Depreciation of the Worst Performing Underlier Underlier Performance Factor of the Worst Performing Underlier Payment at Maturity Total Return on the Securities 200.00 100.00% N/A $1,433.50 43.35% 175.00 75.00% N/A $1,433.50 43.35% 150.00 50.00% N/A $1,433.50 43.35% 143.35 43.35% N/A $1,433.50 43.35% 120.00 20.00% N/A $1,433.50 43.35% 110.00 10.00% N/A $1,433.50 43.35% 100.00 0.00% N/A $1,433.50 43.35% 99.99 -0.01% N/A $1,000.00 0.00% 95.00 -5.00% N/A $1,000.00 0.00% 90.00 -10.00% N/A $1,000.00 0.00% 85.00 -15.00% N/A $1,000.00 0.00% 80.00 -20.00% N/A $1,000.00 0.00% 70.00 -30.00% N/A $1,000.00 0.00% 69.99 -30.01% 69.99% $699.90 -30.01% 60.00 -40.00% 60.00% $600.00 -40.00% 50.00 -50.00% 50.00% $500.00 -50.00% 40.00 -60.00% 40.00% $400.00 -60.00% 30.00 -70.00% 30.00% $300.00 -70.00% 20.00 -80.00% 20.00% $200.00 -80.00% 10.00 -90.00% 10.00% $100.00 -90.00% 0.00 -100.00% 0.00% $0.00 -100.00%

Hypothetical Examples of Amount Payable at Maturity

The following examples illustrate how the payment at maturity and total return in different hypothetical scenarios are calculated assuming the securities are not automatically redeemed.

Example 1: The securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the value of the worst performing underlier increases from its initial underlier value of 100.00 to a final underlier value of 175.00, an increase of 75.00%.

Because the final underlier value of each underlier is greater than or equal to its initial underlier value, the investor receives a payment at maturity of $1,433.50 per $1,000 stated principal amount, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + maturity date premium

= $1,000 + ($1,000 × 43.35%)

= $1,000 + $433.50 = $1,433.50

The total return on the securities is 43.35%, which represents a return of approximately 14.45% per annum. Even though the worst performing underlier appreciated by 75.00% from its initial underlier value to its final underlier value in this example, your return is limited to the maturity date premium of 43.35%.

Example 2: The securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the value of the worst performing underlier decreases from its initial underlier value of 100.00 to a final underlier value of 90.00, a decrease of 10.00%.

Because the final underlier value of the worst performing underlier is less than its initial underlier value but greater than or equal to its trigger value, the investor receives a payment at maturity equal to the stated principal amount of $1,000.00 per security.

The total return on the securities is 0.00%.

Example 3: The securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the value of the worst performing underlier decreases from its initial underlier value of 100.00 to a final underlier value of 40.00, a decrease of 60.00%.

Because the final underlier value of the worst performing underlier is less than its trigger value, the payment at maturity is equal to $400.00 per security, calculated as follows:

$1,000 × underlier performance factor of the worst performing underlier

= $1,000 × (final underlier value of the worst performing underlier / initial underlier value of the worst performing underlier)

= $1,000 × (40.00 / 100.00) = $400.00

The total return on the securities is -60.00%. Because the final underlier value of the worst performing underlier is less than its trigger value, you are fully exposed to the decline in the closing level of the worst performing underlier, even though the other underliers may have appreciated or have not declined below their respective trigger values.

Risk Factors

An investment in the securities involves significant risks. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the securities. Investing in the securities is not equivalent to investing directly in any or all of the underliers or the securities composing the underliers. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the securities are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the securities generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the securities unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the securities.

Risks Relating to the Securities Generally

§The securities do not pay interest or guarantee the return of any principal. The terms of the securities differ from those of ordinary debt securities in that the securities do not pay interest or guarantee the return of any of the stated principal amount at maturity. Instead, if the securities have not been automatically redeemed prior to maturity and if the final underlier value of any underlier is less than its trigger value, you will be exposed to the decline in the closing level of the worst performing underlier, as compared to its initial underlier value, on a 1-to-1 basis and you will receive for each security that you hold at maturity an amount in cash equal to the stated principal amount times the underlier performance factor of the worst performing underlier. Under these circumstances, your payment at maturity will be less than 70% of the stated principal amount and could be zero. There is no minimum payment at maturity on the securities.

§The potential return on the securities is limited to the applicable call premium or the maturity date premium, as applicable. Any positive return on your securities will not exceed the applicable call premium or maturity date premium, regardless of any appreciation in the value of any underlier, which may be significant. If, as of any determination date, the worst performing underlier has appreciated since the pricing date by more than the percentage represented by the applicable call premium or the maturity date premium, as applicable, you will receive a lower return on the securities than you would have received if you had invested directly in the worst performing underlier.

§You are exposed to the market risk of each underlier. Your return on the securities is not linked to a basket consisting of each underlier. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each underlier. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to each underlier. Poor performance by any underlier over the term of the securities may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by any positive performance by the other underliers. In addition, if the securities have not been automatically redeemed early and any underlier has declined to below its trigger value as of the final determination date, you will be fully exposed to the decline in the worst performing underlier over the term of the securities on a 1-to-1 basis, even if the other underliers have appreciated or have not declined as much. Under this scenario, the value of any such payment will be less than 70% of the stated principal amount and could be zero. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of each underlier.

§Because the securities are linked to the performance of the worst performing underlier, you are less likely to receive a positive return on your investment, and you are exposed to greater risks of sustaining a significant loss on your investment, than if the securities were linked to just one underlier. The likelihood of receiving a positive return is lower, and the risk that you will suffer a significant loss on your investment is greater, if you invest in the securities as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of just one underlier. With three underliers, it is more likely that at least one underlier will close below its initial underlier value on any determination date or its trigger value on the final determination date than if the securities were linked to only one underlier, and therefore it is less likely that you will receive a positive return and more likely that you will suffer a significant loss on your investment.

§Automatic early redemption risk. The term of your investment in the securities may be limited to as short as approximately one year by the automatic early redemption feature of the securities. If the securities are redeemed prior to maturity, you will receive no further payments and you may be forced to reinvest in a lower interest rate environment. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the securities in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the securities are redeemed prior to the maturity date. In addition, if the securities are automatically redeemed on an earlier determination date, you will receive a lower call premium than if the securities were redeemed on a later determination date or if the securities were held to maturity and the final underlier value of each underlier were greater than or equal to its initial underlier value. Accordingly, you will not receive the highest premium if the securities are automatically redeemed prior to the final determination date.

§Any payment on the securities will be determined based on the closing levels of the underliers on the dates specified. Any payment on the securities will be determined based on the closing levels of the underliers on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the underliers determined at any other time.

§Contingent repayment of principal applies only at maturity or upon any automatic early redemption. You should be willing and able to hold the securities to maturity or any automatic early redemption. If you sell the securities prior to maturity in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell the securities at a loss relative to your initial investment even if the level of each underlier is above its trigger value.

§Investing in the securities is not equivalent to investing in any or all underliers or the securities composing the underliers. Investors in the securities will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the securities composing the underliers.

§The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the securities are uncertain. There is no direct legal authority regarding the proper U.S. federal income tax treatment of the securities, and we do not plan to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). Consequently, significant aspects of the tax treatment of the securities are uncertain, and the IRS or a court might not agree with the treatment of the securities as prepaid forward contracts, as described below under “Additional provisions—Tax considerations.” If the IRS were successful in asserting an alternative treatment for the securities, the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the securities could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, in 2007 the Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on various issues regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. Any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the securities, possibly with retroactive effect. You should review carefully the sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders,” and consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the securities (including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by the 2007 notice), as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

§Credit of issuer. The securities are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the securities, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the securities and, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you might not receive any amount owed to you under the terms of the securities.

§You may lose some or all of your investment if any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the securities or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the securities (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the securities), by acquiring the securities, each holder or beneficial owner of the securities acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this document. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the securities losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the securities or receiving a different security from the securities, which may be worth significantly less than the securities and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the securities. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the securities will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the securities. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this document as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underliers

§Adjustments to the underliers could adversely affect the value of the securities. The sponsor of an underlier may add, delete, substitute or adjust the securities composing that underlier or make other methodological changes to that underlier that could affect its performance. The calculation agent will calculate the value to be used as the closing level of an underlier in the event of certain material changes in or modifications to that underlier. In addition, the sponsor of an underlier may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of that underlier at any time. Under these circumstances, the calculation agent may select a successor index that the calculation agent determines to be comparable to the discontinued underlier or, if no successor index is available, the calculation agent will determine the value to be used as the closing level of that underlier. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the relevant underlier and, consequently, the value of the securities. See “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

§There are risks associated with investments in securities linked to the value of non-U.S. equity securities with respect to the NDX Index. Some of the equity securities composing the NDX Index are issued by non-U.S. companies. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities involve risks associated with the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws.

§The securities are subject to small-capitalization companies risk with respect to the RTY Index. The RTY Index tracks companies that are considered small-capitalization companies. These companies often have greater stock price volatility, lower trading volume and less liquidity than large-capitalization companies, and therefore securities linked to the RTY Index may be more volatile than an investment linked to an index with component stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less stable financially than large-capitalization companies and may depend on a small number of key personnel, making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies are often subject to less analyst coverage and may be in early, and less predictable, periods of their corporate existences. Such companies tend to have smaller revenues, less diverse product lines, smaller shares of their product or service markets, fewer financial resources and less competitive strengths than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.

§Governmental legislative or regulatory actions, such as sanctions, could adversely affect your investment in the securities. Governmental legislative or regulatory actions, including, without limitation, sanctions-related actions by the U.S. or a foreign government, could prohibit or otherwise restrict persons from holding the securities or securities included in any underlier, or engaging in transactions in them, and any such action could adversely affect the value of that underlier. These legislative or regulatory actions could result in restrictions on the securities. You may lose a significant portion or all of your initial investment in the securities if you are forced to divest the securities due to government mandates, especially if such divestment must be made at a time when the value of the securities has declined.

§We may accelerate the securities if a change-in-law event occurs. Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the securities or an underlier or its components, or engaging in transactions in them, the calculation agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the maturity date for a payment determined by the calculation agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the securities if they were not accelerated. However, if the calculation agent elects not to accelerate the securities, the value of, and any amount payable on, the securities could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

§Hedging and trading activity by the issuer and its affiliates could potentially adversely affect the value of the securities. Hedging or trading activities of the issuer’s affiliates and of any other hedging counterparty with respect to the securities could adversely affect the values of the underliers and, as a result, could decrease the amount an investor may receive on the securities at maturity, if any. Any of these hedging or trading activities on or prior to the pricing date could potentially increase the initial underlier values and, as a result, the trigger values, which are the values at or above which the respective underliers must close on the final determination date in order for you to avoid being exposed to the negative performance of the worst performing underlier at maturity. Additionally, such hedging or trading activities during the term of the securities, including on the determination dates, could potentially affect the values of the underliers on the determination dates and, accordingly, whether the securities are automatically redeemed prior to maturity and, if the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity, the payment at maturity, if any.

§We and our affiliates, and any dealer participating in the distribution of the securities, may engage in various activities or make determinations that could materially affect your securities in various ways and create conflicts of interest. We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the securities, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the securities.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the securities, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to an underlier or its components. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the securities. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the securities into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the securities.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the securities, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the securities. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the securities and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the securities instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the securities for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

Furthermore, the selected dealer or its affiliates will have the option to conduct a material portion of the hedging activities for us in connection with the securities. The selected dealer or its affiliates would expect to realize a projected profit from such hedging activities, and this projected profit would be in addition to any selling concession that the selected dealer realizes for the sale of the securities to you. This additional projected profit may create a further incentive for the selected dealer to sell the securities to you.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the calculation agent for the securities. As calculation agent, we will determine any values of the underliers and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the securities. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underliers” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the securities, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the securities.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Securities and the Secondary Market

§The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange, and secondary trading may be limited. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to offer to purchase the securities in the secondary market but are not required to do so and may cease any such market making activities at any time, without notice. Even if a secondary market develops, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the securities easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the securities, the price, if any, at which you may be able to trade your securities is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the securities. In addition, Barclays Capital Inc. or one or more of our other affiliates may at any time hold an unsold portion of the securities (as described on the cover page of this document), which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the securities. The securities are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your securities to maturity.

§The market price of the securities will be influenced by many unpredictable factors. Several factors will influence the value of the securities in the secondary market and the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC may be willing to purchase or sell the securities in the secondary market. Although we expect that generally the values of the underliers on any day will affect the value of the securities more than any other single factor, other factors that may influence the value of the securities include:

othe volatility (frequency and magnitude of changes in value) of each underlier;

owhether the final underlier value of any underlier is expected to be below its trigger value;

ocorrelation (or lack of correlation) of the underliers;

odividend rates on the securities composing the underliers;

ointerest and yield rates in the market;

otime remaining until the securities mature;

osupply and demand for the securities;

ogeopolitical conditions and economic, financial, political, regulatory and judicial events that affect the securities composing the underliers and that may affect the final underlier values; and

oany actual or anticipated changes in our credit ratings or credit spreads.

The values of the underliers may be, and have recently been, volatile, and we can give you no assurance that the volatility will lessen. See “Nasdaq-100 Index® Overview,” “Russell 2000® Index Overview” and “S&P 500® Index Overview” below. You may receive less, and possibly significantly less, than the stated principal amount if you try to sell your securities prior to maturity.

§The estimated value of your securities is expected to be lower than the initial issue price of your securities. The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your securities. The difference between the initial issue price of your securities and the estimated value of the securities is expected as a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the securities, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the securities, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the securities. These other costs will include a fee paid to LFT Securities, LLC, an entity in which an affiliate of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management has an ownership interest, for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.

§The estimated value of your securities might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market. The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated values referenced above might be lower if such estimated values were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

§The estimated value of the securities is based on our internal pricing models, which may prove to be inaccurate and may be different from the pricing models of other financial institutions. The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the securities may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions that may be purchasers or sellers of securities in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your securities may be materially different from the estimated value of the securities determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

§The estimated value of your securities is not a prediction of the prices at which you may sell your securities in the secondary market, if any, and such secondary market prices, if any, will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your securities and may be lower than the estimated value of your securities. The estimated value of the securities will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the securities from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your securities in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the securities. Further, as secondary market prices of your securities take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the securities such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the securities, secondary market prices of your securities will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your securities. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the securities from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your securities, and any sale prior to the maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you.

§The temporary price at which we may initially buy the securities in the secondary market and the value we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may not be indicative of future prices of your securities. Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the pricing date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the securities, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the securities on the pricing date, as well as the secondary market value of the securities, for a temporary period after the initial issue date of the securities. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your securities.

Additional Information about the Securities

Please read this information in conjunction with the terms on the cover page of this document.

Additional provisions: Minimum ticketing size: $1,000 / 1 security Tax considerations:

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion, when read in combination with those sections, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the securities.

Based on current market conditions, in the opinion of our special tax counsel, the securities should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with respect to the underliers. Assuming this treatment is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the securities (including redemption upon an automatic call or at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the securities, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the securities. This gain or loss on your securities should be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if you hold your securities for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of securities at the original issue price. However, the IRS or a court may not respect this treatment, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the securities could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the “constructive ownership” regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the securities, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the securities, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the securities do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the securities with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the securities. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the securities.

In addition, Microsoft has increased its focus on selling its cloud customers Anthropic AI models, which could drive more revenue for both firms.

The company recently informed salespeople in its Azure cloud business that selling Anthropic AI models to Microsoft cloud customers will count toward their sales goals just like Microsoft-made software, two Microsoft employees told The Information.

Because Microsoft has offered the same incentive for sales staff for selling OpenAI products, the new quota system means sales people have as much incentive to sell Anthropic models as ones from its main competitor, the sources said.

As the report noted, Microsoft’s increasing ties to Anthropic follow its decision in September to make an up-to-$5 billion investment in the company. Microsoft has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI, giving it a 27% stake in the startup.

But while Microsoft keeps 80% of sales of OpenAI models to Azure customers, it retains a smaller percentage of its sales of Anthropic’s AI models, a source briefed on the situation told The Information.

OpenAI announced in October that it had transformed its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation, an arrangement that provides Microsoft with a 27% stake — worth roughly $135 billion — in that unit.

“What began as an investment in a research organization has grown into one of the most successful partnerships in our industry,” the ChatGPT maker wrote on its blog at the time.

In other Microsoft news, PYMNTS wrote this week about the company’s new agentic AI capabilities, which it says are designed to help retailers move faster, operate with greater efficiency and engage shoppers with more relevance by enhancing human decision-making.

“The approach focuses on connecting traditionally fragmented functions — merchandising, marketing, store operations and fulfillment — into coordinated workflows that can anticipate needs and act in real time,” the report added.

Microsoft said this shift reflects a wider move within the industry toward intelligence-driven retail operating models created for speed, resilience and scale.

As PYMNTS wrote, it shows how the company is pushing AI “deeper into retail operations, positioning intelligent automation as a unifying layer across the entire retail value chain.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Microsoft-.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 22:59:55.000414

The Paris Stock Exchange moved within a narrow range on Wednesday, ending slightly in negative territory at 8,330.97 points, down by 0.19%. The session unfolded in a typically cautious atmosphere, with no major news to guide the markets and trading volumes particularly low. This lethargy is part of an uncertain start to the year 2026, as investors remain cautious following the end-of-year movements in 2025.

The Paris market lacked clear direction throughout the day. With 21 stocks rising, 17 falling, and 2 stable out of the 40 components of the index, the varied performances illustrate the absence of a dominant trend. Traders favored a cautious approach, awaiting more concrete elements likely to set a course for the markets. This phase of hesitation reflects a climate where sectoral arbitration prevails over a broader dynamic, with investors remaining cautious in mid-January.

Orange and Sanofi boost defensive stocks, while tech stocks fall

Telecom and healthcare sectors managed to stand out in this lackluster session. Orange took the top spot on the leaderboard with a gain of 2.83% at 14.54 euros, closely followed by Sanofi, which rose by 2.55% to 82.55 euros. Air Liquide rounded out this leading trio with an increase of 2.28% to 161.56 euros. These three defensive stocks, known for their stability and dividends, benefited from sector rotation in an uncertain environment. Bouygues (+1.55% to 45.27 euros) and Société Générale (+1.46% to 70.7 euros) were also among the day's top performers.

In contrast, technology and industrial stocks suffered. Schneider Electric dropped 3.12% to 231 euros, recording the largest decline on the Paris market. STMicroelectronics fell by 2.43% to 24.13 euros, hit like the entire semiconductor sector. Aerospace leaders also slid, with Airbus down 2.16% to 215.45 euros and Safran decreasing by 1.72% to 320.2 euros. Accor lost 2.15% to 45.99 euros. These declines in cyclical and technology stocks contrast with the resilience of defensive stocks, reflecting a cautious repositioning of portfolios.

Europe in Sync, Wall Street Searching for Direction

Other European markets experienced a similar climate of indecision this Wednesday. The Paris stock exchange ended the session on a neutral note, perfectly illustrating the sluggish start to the year 2026. Without any immediate catalysts and with skeletal trading volumes, the CAC 40 drifted with sector rotations, as investors favored caution in mid-January. The Paris market remains in a phase of observation, waiting for more tangible elements to regain conviction.

It’s called “surveillance pricing,” when companies set different prices for different customers.
“But to me that’s problematic.” No one really knows how common surveillance pricing is.
In a statement, the retailer said: Because prices can vary by market, customers may occasionally see slight differences as price matches and changes are executed in real time.
All this to say, personalized pricing or not, there’s some kind of algorithmic something happening here.","My husband, John, and I decided to try a little experiment the other day. We’d just finished shopping at a supermarket in Queens and wondered: How much would an Uber cost to get home?

We each typed in our address and on the count of three, confirmed the ride. John’s price was $8.91. I was given $9.96.

“I don’t really use Uber, so maybe it’s trying to get me to use it more?” guessed John.

That’s one theory. But the company said it does not personalize fares. In a statement, Uber said variations in prices reflect things like how many drivers are active and how many customers are requesting similar trips.

In general though, companies now know more than ever about our habits. That’s powerful information — not just for advertising, but to understand how much any given person might pay for something beyond the realities of dynamic pricing. It’s called “surveillance pricing,” when companies set different prices for different customers. After much backlash, Instacart recently ended a pilot that allowed retailers to charge different prices for people living in the same city.

Personalized pricing isn’t new. In fact, it’s been around in some form as long as commerce has.

“People think that personalization is a 21st-century phenomenon due to the internet. It goes back to peddlers and before,” said Joseph Turow, author of “The Voice Catchers: How Marketers Listen In to Exploit Your Emotions, Your Privacy, and Your Wallet.”

Shopkeepers would game out what customers were willing to pay.

“They would actually keep notebooks on the people they spoke to and would write down specific characteristics,” like what kind of clothes you wore or who your friends and family were, said Turow.

The difference is before, a business owner had to guess if a woman’s baby bump was indeed a baby bump. Now, a retailer knows the instant she adds prenatal vitamins to her cart.

“It’s legal to do it, and some economists would say that price differentiation is just part of the way that economics works,” said Turow, adding that a lot of consumers have no idea surveillance pricing is happening. “But to me that’s problematic.”

No one really knows how common surveillance pricing is. But what is clear is that retailers are watching us closely.

“Behavior patterns, their browsing history, their loyalty that they might have, whether it’s through credit card or through points,” said Shikha Jain, a retail partner at the consulting company Simon Kucher. “And so you do see that happening more and more.”

Often retailers are using that information not for surveillance pricing, but surveillance discounting: Here’s a coupon for being a member or 10% off that immersion blender sitting in your cart. It’s why, as a consumer, it’s more difficult than ever to figure out if you’re getting the best price.

“Price discrimination sounds really scary, but effectively it means that it’s good for some consumers and not so good for others,” said Garrett Johnson, a marketing professor at Boston University.

If you want to compare prices, said Johnson, you kind of need to hide.

“So you can open the website in incognito mode, using your mobile phone, you know, maybe even turn off your wifi,” he said.

But are we really going to do this dance every time we buy something as mundane as toothpaste?

I decided to shop for toothpaste at Walmart online, on two different browsers. On one, I signed into my account, which had my information. On the other, I was anonymous, but added my shipping address for an exact location comparison.

I scrolled through the search results and saw a few price discrepancies, including a tube of Colgate toothpaste. On both searches, I was given the same type, same cool mint flavor and same 6.3 oz. size — at different prices. On the page where I was not signed into my account, the tube was $3.74. On the page where I was signed in, it was $3.96.

I reached out to Walmart about their pricing policy. In a statement, the retailer said: Because prices can vary by market, customers may occasionally see slight differences as price matches and changes are executed in real time.

All this to say, personalized pricing or not, there’s some kind of algorithmic something happening here. Turns out, companies know a lot about us. But we don’t know so much about them — or how they decide what we pay.",https://img.apmcdn.org/c636483cda7e13feee83cb261935645de7b2bf43/widescreen/b3dc9c-20260113-a-shopping-cart-with-cereal-coffee-and-tissues-2000.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 19:02:45.269802

The partnership is valued at over ten billion dollars and extends over three years, with implementation scheduled in multiple phases through 2028.
Cerebras withdrew the planned IPO and instead raised 1.1 billion dollars privately, which corresponded to a valuation of 8.1 billion dollars.
The company generated approximately 13 billion dollars in revenue last year, while it signed cloud contracts with Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon totaling approximately 600 billion dollars.
OpenAI is in an early phase of another massive funding round that could value the company at 830 billion dollars before the new investment.","OpenAI has reached a multi-year agreement with chip startup Cerebras Systems that provides for the deployment of 750 megawatts of computing power based on Cerebras systems. The partnership is valued at over ten billion dollars and extends over three years, with implementation scheduled in multiple phases through 2028. This deployment will roll out in multiple stages beginning in 2026.

According to both companies, the agreement marks the world’s largest deployment of high-speed AI inference. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is personally involved as an investor in Cerebras, and the two companies have been holding regular discussions about a possible collaboration since 2017.

Inference is not about training new AI models, but about running existing ones – that is, when users send requests via ChatGPT and these should be answered as quickly and well as possible.

Speed as a Competitive Advantage

Cerebras develops AI processors at wafer scale that, according to the company, generate answers significantly faster than GPU-based systems. The technology integrates massive computing capacity, memory, and bandwidth on a single large-format chip, thereby eliminating bottlenecks in conventional hardware.

For applications such as coding agents or language chats, large language models on Cerebras systems deliver results up to 15 times faster than on comparable GPU platforms. This speed fundamentally transforms the user experience and enables real-time interactions that promote longer engagement times and more productive workflows.

OpenAI faces significant challenges in procuring sufficient computing capacity. The company has more than 900 million weekly users and has repeatedly pointed to a severe shortage of computing resources.

The integration of Cerebras technology is targeted specifically for workloads where low latency is critical. An infrastructure executive at OpenAI explained that the company’s compute strategy aims to optimally align different systems with specific tasks. Negotiations between the two companies began in the fall and led to the signing of a term sheet by Thanksgiving. Generally, they know each other well; since 2017 there have been regular meetings between the two companies.

Financial Dimension and Market Context

According to information from company circles, Cerebras is in discussions about a funding round of one billion dollars that would value the company at 22 billion dollars – nearly a tripling compared to the previous valuation. The startup, founded about ten years ago, has faced challenges in the past:

In preparation for an IPO in 2024, the company disclosed that the majority of its revenue came from a single customer, G42, based in Abu Dhabi. Cerebras withdrew the planned IPO and instead raised 1.1 billion dollars privately, which corresponded to a valuation of 8.1 billion dollars. In the meantime, the company has concluded new agreements with IBM and Meta, thereby diversifying its customer base – now also with OpenAI.

OpenAI is pursuing a broad-based chip strategy to break free from the dominance of individual suppliers. The company is developing a custom chip jointly with Broadcom and has signed an agreement for the use of AMD’s new MI450 chip. Nvidia, the leading provider of AI chips, had reached a preliminary agreement with OpenAI in September for the sale of up to ten gigawatts of chips, which has not yet been finalized. In parallel, Nvidia concluded a 20 billion dollar licensing agreement with inference startup Groq in December. The market for specialized inference chips is gaining momentum as AI companies seek fast and cost-efficient alternatives to conventional GPU systems.

OpenAI’s financial commitments are increasingly raising questions among investors. The company generated approximately 13 billion dollars in revenue last year, while it signed cloud contracts with Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon totaling approximately 600 billion dollars. Sam Altman emphasizes that the company will finance these commitments, staggered over several years, through future revenue growth. OpenAI is in an early phase of another massive funding round that could value the company at 830 billion dollars before the new investment. The financing is intended to prepare for a planned IPO and support the company’s extensive growth plans.",https://www.trendingtopics.eu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 19:02:49.058540

Trump doubled down on his attacks against Powell, arguing that interest rates should be sharply lower and suggesting Dimon’s defense of the Fed was driven by self-interest.
“We should have lower interest rates,” Trump said during remarks Tuesday, adding that Dimon “probably wants higher rates” and suggesting the JPMorgan chief executive benefits from elevated borrowing costs.
Dimon, the head of the nation’s largest bank, had warned earlier that any move that chips away at the Fed’s independence could backfire, raising inflation expectations and ultimately pushing interest rates higher.
“Everyone we know believes in Fed independence,” Dimon told reporters Tuesday.","President Trump lashed out at JPMorgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon on Tuesday, flatly dismissing the Wall Street titan as “wrong” for warning that the Justice Department’s criminal probe of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell threatens the central bank’s independence.

“I think he’s wrong,” Trump said when asked about Dimon’s criticism, defending the Justice Department’s investigation and insisting his administration was not undermining the Federal Reserve, even as the probe has sparked market turmoil and drawn bipartisan backlash.

“I think it’s fine what I’m doing. And we have a bad Fed person,” the president said.

Trump doubled down on his attacks against Powell, arguing that interest rates should be sharply lower and suggesting Dimon’s defense of the Fed was driven by self-interest.

“We should have lower interest rates,” Trump said during remarks Tuesday, adding that Dimon “probably wants higher rates” and suggesting the JPMorgan chief executive benefits from elevated borrowing costs.

Dimon, the head of the nation’s largest bank, had warned earlier that any move that chips away at the Fed’s independence could backfire, raising inflation expectations and ultimately pushing interest rates higher.

“Everyone we know believes in Fed independence,” Dimon told reporters Tuesday.

“Anything that chips away at that is probably not a good idea. In my view, it will have the reverse consequences. It will probably raise inflation expectations and probably increase rates over time.”

Trump also said he would press ahead with plans to name Powell’s replacement within weeks, despite the backlash to the probe from Wall Street executives and Republican lawmakers.

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), who sits on the powerful Senate Banking Committee, has vowed to block any new Federal Reserve nominees until the investigation is resolved.

Other executives echoed Dimon’s concerns, warning that threatening the Fed’s autonomy could rattle bond markets and undermine confidence, with Bank of New York Mellon CEO Robin Vince cautioning that political pressure on the central bank risks pushing interest rates higher rather than lower.

“Independent central banks with the ability to independently set monetary policy in the long-term interests of the nation is a pretty well-established thing that we’ve seen all around the world over a very long period of time,” Vince told reporters Tuesday.

“Let’s not shake the foundation of the bond market ⁠and potentially do something that could cause interest rates to actually get pushed up because somehow there’s ‍lack of confidence in the Fed’s independence.”

Other Wall Street big shots echoed the sentiment.

“The attempt to kill the Fed’s independence by criminal investigation is not good for that institution, and maybe even worse for the Justice Department,” former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein wrote on X.

“Feels like an attempt at murder-suicide.”

The Justice Department investigation centers on Powell’s June testimony to Congress about the Federal Reserve’s $2.5 billion renovation of its Washington headquarters, including whether he misled lawmakers about the project’s scope and cost.

Prosecutors have reviewed Powell’s public statements and internal Fed spending records after Republicans accused him of downplaying luxury features that appeared in earlier planning documents.

Powell has forcefully rejected the allegations, confirming that the Fed was served with grand jury subpoenas and calling the probe “unprecedented.”

He has said the renovation is funded entirely by the central bank, not taxpayers, and warned the investigation threatens the Fed’s ability to set interest rates free from political pressure.

Trump, who nominated Powell during his first term, has defended the probe as a matter of accountability, accusing the Fed chair of incompetence and insisting the investigation has nothing to do with monetary policy.

The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, claims that the defendants used their dominant market positions to discourage healthcare providers, telehealth platforms, and patients from prescribing or accessing compounded GLP-1 therapies. Strive argues that these actions harmed the compounding pharmacy sector, which it views as a legitimate and vital part of the U.S. healthcare system.

The full complaint can be found here: https://www.strivepharmacy.com/antitrustlawsuit

According to the filing, compounding pharmacies play a vital role by providing patient-specific medications when commercially manufactured products are unavailable, unsuitable, or in shortage. Strive argues that limiting access to compounded GLP-1s reduces competition and hinders clinical decision-making between providers and patients.

“For us, this is more than just a business dispute; it’s a fight for the right of every patient to have access to the medicine their doctor prescribes,” said Nate Hill, co-founder and CEO of Strive Compounding Pharmacy, in a statement. Hill added that the lawsuit seeks to protect fair competition and preserve access to customized therapies relied upon by many patients.

Summary

Eli Lilly (LLY) is downgraded to Sell due to overstretched valuation and intensifying competition in the weight-loss drug market.

LLY's heavy reliance on high-margin US sales from Zepbound and Mounjaro exposes it to pricing and market-share risks, especially as competitors cut prices.

The upcoming launch of orforglipron faces challenges from Novo Nordisk's aggressive pricing and first-mover advantage in oral weight-loss treatments.

LLY's valuation metrics are priced to perfection, with a P/E of 48.99 and FCF yield of 0.9%, making downside risk significant if growth falters.

Introduction

A lot has happened since I rated Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) a Hold back in early August, as it appreciated by nearly 42% and reached a $1T market cap, the first in the pharmaceutical industry. With

As a detail-oriented investor with a strong foundation in finance and business writing, I focus on analyzing undervalued and disliked companies or industries that have strong fundamentals and good cash flows. I have a particular interest in sectors such as Oil&Gas and consumer goods. Basically, anything that has been unloved for unjustified reasons that could offer substantial returns. Energy Transfer is one of those companies that I came across when no one wanted to touch it and now I can't resolve myself to sell it. I will always focus more on long-term value investing but I can sometimes lose myself in possible deal arbitrage such as with Microsoft/ Activision Blizzard, Spirit Airlines/Jetblue (that one still hurts), and Nippon/U.S. Steel (perfect exit at $50.19). I tend to shun businesses that I can't understand either high-tech or certain consumer goods such as fashion (give me a Levi's jeans). I don't understand why anyone would invest in cryptocurrencies as well. Through Seeking Alpha, I aim to connect with like-minded investors, share insights, and build a collaborative community of individuals seeking superior returns and informed decision-making, currently on a quest to review every public company.

Potentially joining other high-valued startups like Anthropic and SpaceX to make 2026 a mega year for IPOs. Here with more, our very own Laura Brad. So Laura, uh Sam Altman has said he is 0%, 0% excited about leading a public company. What do you make of that?

Yeah. Um, I think there's some nervousness about what uh OpenAI publicly releasing some of its earnings statements would bring um for the company. But OpenAI needs to raise capital. It needs money. Um it's committed to about 1.4 trillion worth of commitments over the next eight years. And at the same time, its revenue uh reported by The Information and The Times was just about 13 billion. So there's really a gap that it needs to fill. Um and going public could could help sort of like narrow the the gap. In in December, they were in talks for a private funding round um valued at about 750 billion, putting putting the company at a 750 billion valuation. Um and the New York Times report said that OpenAI would be valued at 500 billion, so I'd be curious to see what that valuation ends up coming in at.

Also you had this other story where Apple decides, okay, we're going to go with Google over OpenAI for our AI features. What do you make of that?

Yeah, so, um, you know, with the release of Gemini 3, that really put OpenAI on edge. Sam Altman declared a code red, um, and that made news. Um and so, you know, OpenAI had seemed poised to partner with Apple because they had that partnership. Apple rolled out ChatGPT on iPhones in 2024. Um but then OpenAI appeared to take a swing at Apple by um, you know, merging with the startup of its former chief designer, Johnny Ive, and they're trying to

Sir Johnny Ive. Yes.

Yes, Sir Johnny Ive. Yes. And they're trying to release a consumer hardware device. Um and analysts sort of speculate that that put Apple on edge and pushed them towards going with Google. They also have the benefit of, you know, leveraging Google's infrastructure. Google has TPUs or AI chips. Um they have the cloud. And so, um, you know, OpenAI is really losing out on distribution here. Um you know, it's going to be big for Google to have that brand visibility being on every iPhone in the world.

So plenty of competition. What's what's a win for OpenAI in the year ahead?

Yeah, there there's a lot that OpenAI could win. Um there's a lot of concern in the market about OpenAI succeeding, whether it will succeed or not. Um they really need to find a business model that will work right now. OpenAI is essentially subsidizing users and at some point they're going to need to generate revenue, whether that's, you know, figuring out the ad format that's going to work for them to generate ad revenue or pushing further into the enterprise space. That's really something that Anthropic has gone super heavily into. Um and, you know, they need to release new models that are on the cutting edge that can rival Google and, you know, so as not to get displaced by Google. Um and then the last thing I'll say is that they they really need to secure enough power for their data centers because that's a concern that there's not going to be enough power in the market uh for these data centers and then, you know, that's going to have ripple effects across the entire market because um OpenAI's growth is uh really important for companies like Oracle and CoreWeave. OpenAI has deals across the ecosystem. So it's really important for OpenAI to meet its goals.

All right, Laura, thank you. As always appreciate it.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pxOF2XcbVfKGosENiWPeqw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/45ed3c60-f192-11f0-9d5d-db4ea2bbbdd4,N,,2026-01-14 21:02:07.511853

KEY QUOTES: “OpenAI’s compute strategy is to build a resilient portfolio that matches the right systems to the right workloads.
That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people.” Sachin Katti, OpenAI “We are delighted to partner with OpenAI, bringing the world’s leading AI models to the world’s fastest AI processor.

Multiple reports cited that the deal is valued at over $10 billion.

Cerebras builds purpose-built AI systems to accelerate long-form outputs from AI models. The company’s approach centers on placing large amounts of compute, memory, and bandwidth onto a single, giant chip to reduce the bottlenecks that can slow inference on conventional hardware.

OpenAI said the integration is intended to improve real-time performance across its products by shortening the request-response loop behind complex tasks such as answering difficult questions, generating code, creating images, and running AI agents. The company argues that faster, more natural response times can increase engagement and support higher-value workloads.

According to OpenAI, the Cerebras capacity will be integrated into its inference stack in phases and expanded across workloads over time. The additional compute is expected to come online in multiple tranches through 2028.

The partnership aligns with OpenAI’s broader compute strategy of maintaining a portfolio of systems matched to specific workload needs, with Cerebras positioned as a dedicated option for low-latency inference.

KEY QUOTES:

“OpenAI’s compute strategy is to build a resilient portfolio that matches the right systems to the right workloads. Cerebras adds a dedicated low-latency inference solution to our platform. That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people.”

PR Newswire (US)

PITTSBURGH, Aug. 8 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- A slumping stock market and a sharp drop in interest rates in July caused a decline of 4.4 percentage points in the funded status of a typical U.S. pension plan, according to BNY Mellon Asset Management, which tracks the health of U.S. pension plans through its BNY Mellon Pension Liability Indexes. Despite the severity of the July decline, the typical plan had improved its status by nearly three percentage points during the first seven months of the year. ""Stocks had their worst month in three years, dropping more than three percent,"" according to Peter Austin, executive director of BNY Mellon Pension Services. ""At the same time, long Treasury bond yields declined 22 basis points, significantly increasing the value of pension liabilities."" Assets of a moderate risk pension portfolio decreased 1.5 percent in July, while the value of typical pension liabilities rose 2.9 percent. For the year to date, however, moderate risk assets are up 3.4 percent while typical pension liabilities are up 0.5 percent. Lower interest rates increase liabilities and the value of bonds. Unexpected changes in a plan's demographics, among other factors, also affect the size of the benefit liability. The BNY Mellon Pension Liability Indexes, which were launched in March 2006, are designed to track the market values and returns of pension liabilities for young, average and mature pension plans.

The arrangement is worth over $10 billion, according to people close to the company.

The deal will help diversify Cerebras away from the United Arab Emirates' G42, which accounted for 87% of revenue in the first half of 2024.

Cerebras has built a large processor that can train and run generative artificial intelligence models. That makes it a challenger to Nvidia , which sells large quantities of its chips to cloud providers such as Amazon and Microsoft — those companies then rent the graphics cards to clients by the hour. Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization in October, as investors sought to capitalize on further AI growth.

In December, Cerebras rival Groq said Nvidia had signed a non-exclusive licensing agreement that would result in some employees moving to Nvidia. Groq's cloud service is not part of the deal, which CNBC reported is worth $20 billion in cash, making it Nvidia's largest transaction to date.

""Cerebras adds a dedicated low-latency inference solution to our platform,"" Sachin Katti, who works on compute infrastructure at OpenAI, wrote in the blog. ""That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people.""

The deal comes months after OpenAI worked with Cerebras to ensure that its gpt-oss open-weight models would work smoothly on Cerebras silicon, alongside chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices .

Cerebras filed for an initial public offering in September 2024, revealing that revenue in the second quarter of that year approached $70 million, up from about $6 million in the second quarter of 2023. The company's net loss swelled to almost $51 million, from $26 million a year earlier.

Investment banks that typically participate in the top technology IPOs were missing from the prospectus, and the company used an auditor other than the so-called Big Four accounting firms.

Cerebras withdrew the paperwork in October, days after announcing a $1.1 billion round of funding that valued it at $8.1 billion. The company said it pulled the prospectus because details were out of date.

""Given that the business has improved in meaningful ways we decided to withdraw so that we can re-file with updated financials, strategy information including our approach to the rapidly changing AI landscape,"" Cerebras' co-founder and CEO Andrew Feldman wrote in a LinkedIn post. A revised filing will provide a better explanation of the business to potential investors, he wrote.

Cerebras' customer list includes Cognition, Hugging Face, IBM and Nasdaq, and in March 2025, the company said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States had approved Cerebras' request to sell shares to G42.

What's the story

Ammobia, a start-up, is significantly improving the production of ammonia, a key ingredient in fertilizers and other industries. The company has tweaked the Haber-Bosch process, which has been used for over a century to produce ammonia. Ammobia's innovation could cut production costs by as much as 40%. The start-up has raised $7.5 million in seed funding from investors including Air Liquide's venture arm ALIAD, Chevron Technology Ventures, Shell Ventures, Chiyoda Corporation, and MOL Switch.

Industrial applications

Ammonia's potential beyond fertilizers

Ammonia is being explored as a possible alternative to hydrogen for decarbonizing various industries. Countries like Japan and South Korea have even drawn up industrial and transportation plans centered around ammonia. ""The big advantage of ammonia is that it's much easier and more cost-effective to transport and store,"" said Karen Baert, co-founder and CEO of Ammobia.

Pollution concerns

Ammonia production's environmental impact

The Haber-Bosch process, while effective, is also a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. It accounts for nearly 2% of the world's total greenhouse gases. The traditional method uses an iron catalyst to combine nitrogen and hydrogen under high heat (500 degree Celsius) and pressure (around 200 bar or 2,900 psi), both typically provided by burning fossil fuels. This makes ammonia production a significant source of pollution globally.

Innovative approach

Ammobia's process: A cleaner alternative

Ammobia's process operates at a much lower temperature and pressure, resulting in less pollution even if fossil fuels are still used. The start-up also claims its method is cheaper as it can use less expensive pumps and equipment due to the lower temperature and pressure requirements. This could give producers an edge since most ammonia producers have only two ways to cut costs: find a cheaper heat source or hydrogen source.

Compatibility with renewable energy

Ammobia's process is compatible with any hydrogen or heat source, including renewables. The start-up says its technology works best when there's excess electricity production to make cheap hydrogen and thus cheap ammonia.

Expansion strategy

Ammobia's commercial-scale unit and future plans

Ammobia's commercial-scale unit will generate 250 tons of ammonia per day, much smaller than the typical Haber-Bosch plant which produces between 1,000 and 3,000 tons per day. The company has been running a small unit for about a year now. The new funding will help build a pilot plant with all features of the commercial model on a smaller scale (about 10 tons per day).

Amy Duong — January 14, 2026 — Lifestyle

The Heinz Dipper fry box is a patent-pending package that integrates a dedicated compartment for ketchup or other condiments into the fries container. The format keeps the sauce separated from the fries until use and removes the need for separate dip cups or packets. Heinz developed the concept as a packaging update to its familiar fry box shape. The design is presented in versions tailored to different condiment preferences, including ketchup and mayonnaise.

Heinz is rolling out the packaging through participating restaurants and sports stadiums across eleven countries. The launch spans select locations in the United States and additional markets, including Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Portugal, the Philippines, Thailand, China, and Kuwait. The release is supported by a global campaign developed with the agency Rethink and is available while supplies last.
