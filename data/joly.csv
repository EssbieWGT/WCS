Ad fraud is a major problem for advertisers, says UKSAFC.
Estimates put the cost of ad fraud at up to $100 billion and suggest that almost half of ad spend drives no results.
UKSAFC is committed to continuing to push action on ad fraud during 2025.

Ad fraud is a major problem for advertisers, says UKSAFC. Estimates put the cost of ad fraud at up to $100 billion and suggest that almost half of ad spend drives no results. While there is no single measure to combat ad fraud, UKSAFC says it believes the scale of the problem could be significantly reduced if advertisers and their agencies took the time to verify the credentials of the publishers and websites on which their ads appear.

The UKSAFC’s Know Your Customer (KYC) initiative will invite all players in the programmatic advertising supply chain to carry out due diligence checks on every company they deal with - requiring them to provide independent verification of the company’s name, registered address and company number, company directors, and the company’s bank details. Companies that get behind the initiative will benefit from increased trust and investment in their platforms from brands, added UKSAFC.

UKSAFC says the initiative stems from discussions held at its meetings throughout 2024 - a year in which significant progress was made at both an industry and government level. The riots which occurred in the summer, and the part played by fraudulent MFA (Made For Advertising) sites in fuelling the violence, raised awareness among politicians of the ad fraud issue and its consequences. UKSAFC is committed to continuing to push action on ad fraud during 2025.

“The fight against ad fraud is a journey, not a destination,” said UKSAFC spokesperson Ian Moss. “If advertisers and their agencies have better control over where their money is going, we feel we could eliminate many of the bad actors at a stroke. The Know Your Customer initiative will go a long way towards cleaning up ad networks. Now we need everyone in the industry to get on board.”

The UKSAFC says it will be undertaking consultations with the industry trade bodies, platforms, agencies and brands over the coming months to get their feedback and support.

The UKSAFC was set up in 2023 to highlight the scale of advertising fraud and the threat it represents, and to coordinate a multi-stakeholder approach to addressing the issue. The UKSAFC’s taskforce, which consists of advisors from the industry, has come together to tackle the problem in the UK and aims to provide a template the rest of the world can follow.",https://www.inpublishing.co.uk/images/articles/main/uksafc-kyc-stock-copy-100-29269.jpg,N

Mixue Bingcheng was founded in 1997 by Zhang Hongchao, and originally started out as a store selling shaved ice and cold drinks.
Although Mixue Bingcheng does have the highest number of locations worldwide, its revenue is still behind other large drink chains in the U.S., such as Starbucks and Tim Hortons.
Its revenue increased 21 percent to 18.7 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) in the first nine months of 2024.

Mixue Bingcheng is a Chinese bubble tea and ice cream chain with more than 45,000 restaurants worldwide as of September 2024, while the number of McDonald’s restaurants all over the world is around 41,800, according to Statista via Chowhound.

The Asia-based fast-food chain is known for selling soft-serve ice cream cones for one yuan (15 cents) and drinks ranging from between 2 to 8 yuan (30 cents to $1.20).

Despite its huge number of locations, 90 percent of them are in China. There are also outlets in Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaysia. There isn’t a single location in the United States.

Mixue Bingcheng was founded in 1997 by Zhang Hongchao, and originally started out as a store selling shaved ice and cold drinks.

“Let people around the world eat well and drink well for just two American dollars,” Hongchao previously told Chinese state media about his strategy for the business.

Over 99 percent of the bubble tea chain’s stores are franchised, with most of their revenue coming from selling food materials, equipment, and packaging to its franchisees.

Although Mixue Bingcheng does have the highest number of locations worldwide, its revenue is still behind other large drink chains in the U.S., such as Starbucks and Tim Hortons.

Its growth is rapid, though. According to its prospectus, Mixue’s net profit jumped 42 percent to 3.49 billion yuan ($479 million) in the first nine months of 2024 from the same period in the previous year. Its revenue increased 21 percent to 18.7 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) in the first nine months of 2024.

Earlier this week, McDonald’s revealed the breakfast orders of various celebrities the day after the Oscars celebrations. The commercial started with the time stamp of 9:14 a.m. at a McDonald’s restaurant in Hollywood.

The clip showed a receipt machine churning out the orders, such as Colman Domingo’s Egg McMuffin meal — which comes with hash browns and a coffee — with strawberry jelly and ketchup on the side.

Actor Teyana Taylor, who attended the Vanity Fair Oscar Party on Sunday, scarfed down McDonald’s Hotcakes (pancakes) with egg and sausage, a McChicken Biscuit with cheese, and a side of strawberry jelly and butter.

Singer Rosalía, who also attended the after-party, ordered a McGriddles — a breakfast sandwich with bacon, egg, and cheese — with a mango-pineapple smoothie and a mayo packet.

In February, McDonald’s reported a fourth-quarter net income of $2.02 billion, or $2.80 per share, down from $2.04 billion, or $2.80 per share, a year earlier.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/03/06/22/01/GettyImages-2163067773.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N

The deal, revealed on Thursday, is expected to expand Publicis’ data capabilities and global reach.
Publicis says incorporating Lotame into Epsilon will allow it to reach 91% of adult internet users worldwide and access 4 billion customer profiles.
This suggests that, despite the acquisition, Lotame may maintain some level of independence within its new structure.

The deal, revealed on Thursday, is expected to expand Publicis’ data capabilities and global reach.

Lotame, founded in 2006, provides identity-based data solutions and management tools, working across 109 countries. With the decline of third-party cookies, its proprietary identity system has proven useful, generating 1.6 billion unique IDs, serving clients such as PepsiCo and Carat. Publicis says incorporating Lotame into Epsilon will allow it to reach 91% of adult internet users worldwide and access 4 billion customer profiles.

Publicis has spent around $1.5 billion on mergers and acquisitions over the past six months, including purchases of Influential, Mars United Commerce, and BR Media. The company has earmarked a further $800 to $900 million for M&A in 2025, prioritising first-party data, digital media, and AI-driven marketing technology.

While financial details of the Lotame deal have not been disclosed, Publicis CEO Arthur Sadoun said the acquisition aligns with the group’s long-term strategy to strengthen its first-party data stack. He also confirmed that Lotame will operate under the Epsilon umbrella but may retain its branding in some regions, such as APAC.

Lotame’s 150+ employees will transition to Publicis, and the company will continue serving its existing 4,000 clients, including businesses outside Publicis’ network. This suggests that, despite the acquisition, Lotame may maintain some level of independence within its new structure.

The purchase also bolsters Publicis’ CoreAI, an artificial intelligence-driven operating system designed to assist with media planning, creative execution, and data analysis. While Lotame itself is not an AI company, its data assets will feed into CoreAI, which Publicis launched in 2024 with a $320 million investment.

Scott Hagedorn, Publicis’ global chief solutions architect, noted that while Epsilon has strong coverage in the US and Europe, Lotame will help extend its presence in APAC and EMEA, supporting Publicis’ international growth ambitions.",https://hellopartner.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/03/publicis-lotame.png,N

The connector makes it much easier for service providers to manage and control a diverse range of home devices. It is built with AWS IoT Device Management capabilities and enables the secure bidirectional connection between smart home devices and OEM cloud.

Many service providers face the challenge of offering a holistic service wrap for home devices. The IoT Smart C2C Connector solves this. Connecting to a larger array of products from various manufacturers. That diversity is increasing rapidly. Thus building a platform to support the connections with APIs is possible but expensive and time-consuming.

The R Systems device connector enables service providers to deliver a constant device management platform with a simple user experience.

While it isn’t clear is which OEM clouds are supported. R Systems has revealed that it supports a connection between AWS Cloud to Philips Hub for Hue Devices (Bulb, Switch, Sensor). That connection allows service providers to access device-specific features such as Power On/Off, Light intensity, and Light colour (for Philips Hue lights).

The platform ensures that the user experience is consistent no matter which Philips smart device is controlled. It looks after the relevant API calls even if they differ.

Srikara Rao, Chief Technology Officer – Cloud, Cyber Security Services, R Systems, commented, “Smart home ecosystems are evolving rapidly, and seamless connectivity is key to driving exceptional user experiences.

“With the launch of our IoT Smart C2C Connector, we are enabling solution providers to integrate and manage smart home devices effortlessly, leveraging secure cloud-based communication and unified API controls,”

More About the IoT Smart C2C Connector

The solution is available now on the AWS Marketplace, and pricing is bespoke and based on individual requirements.

The C2C connector does not store any user data (like PII, access tokens, or device information), thus reinforcing security and compliance. The connector takes advantage of AWS Lambda for deployment, which optimises compute time and minimises costs.

User data, such as personally identifiable information (PII), access tokens, or device data, is never stored within AWS. The connector enables OAuth authentication between the OEM Cloud and the devices.

R Systems called out the key benefits of the solution:

Simplified Smart Home Connectivity: Supports connectivity with AWS IoT Device Management.

Secure & Compliant Communication: Ensures data integrity and privacy through OAuth authentication.

Optimized Cost & Performance: AWS Lambda deployment reduces costs while maintaining high performance. It is hosted within the service provider’s AWS account.

Ease of Integrations: It supports a unified interface through pre-defined data models in AWS IoT Device Management. The Matter Data format is fully supported, and each C2C Connector is designed individually for a specific OEM and device type.

Enterprise Times: What does this mean?

The new R Systems solution has huge potential. But the company needs to deliver a live solution to demonstrate the benefits it can deliver to service providers. Philips is no stranger to IoT solutions and has already delivered in partnership with Salesforce, the HealthSuite digital platform.

With many in real estate organisations looking for smart devices to cut energy costs, the idea of a single platform for many of the varied locations they manage could be very attractive. It means that they can manage a wide range of devices within buildings without worrying about updated or different protocols.

However, R Systems will need to work with other OEM clouds to make this a workable solution for many. The first step will be to attract a launch customer and to demonstrate the benefits the connector has delivered.",https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/light-bulb-8804312_1280.jpg,N

Investors don't enjoy seeing the market lose gains, but this could present some buying opportunities for the savvy investor. The market has been looking expensive lately, and this might be the reset you've been waiting for.

If you're looking for an incredible growth stock with massive opportunities, consider On Holding (ONON -1.80%). It just reported another fabulous quarter, but its stock is down year to date, and this looks like a great time to buy the stock.

Why On

On sells sneakers and other athleticwear, but it's differentiated from similar companies by its distinctive sole design. At this point, it has many products that don't look different from any other brand, but people know it for its original On Cloud shoe.

As a premium brand, On targets an affluent clientele. But it's resonating with a mass audience through its athlete endorsers, who run the gamut of professional sports and might only be recognizable to those ""in the know"" about these sports, as well as a strategic partnership with actress Zendaya.

It's still rolling out across the world, and it has low brand awareness in many locations. However, it's growing quickly in the areas where it's launched. That gives it an incredible market opportunity and a long growth runway.

On has consistently reported strong operating results. That would be impressive on its own, but even more impressive is that it's at a time when inflation has been hitting pocketbooks, and many companies' results -- including other premium athleticwear brands like Nike and Lululemon Athletica -- are feeling pressure. That implies On's constituency is resilient, and that it might be pulling market share from competitors.

This past week, On released a blowout fourth-quarter earnings report, beating its own and Wall Street's expectations. Revenue increased 40% year over year (currency neutral), with a 49% increase in direct-to-consumer sales. On has a careful mix of direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels, as well as a robust digital presence. It also has 50 physical stores in strategic locations that it feels are a ballast of the network, where customers get to see it in real time.

It has the highest gross margin in the industry, and it's getting higher, increasing from 60.4% to 62.1% year over year. It charges premium prices, and as its name catches on worldwide, its more affluent target customer is willing to pay for its products, strengthening the margins.

Down to the bottom line, net income increased 436% from a loss the previous year. Earnings per share (EPS) were $0.33, beating Wall Street's average consensus of $0.18.

Why now

On stock was lifted on the excellent report, but it's still down 8% year to date. At the current price, it trades at a forward 1-year P/E ratio of 32, which looks quite reasonable for a growth stock.

Management said that it's still working with the strategy it outlined in its 2023 investor presentation, the pillar of which is generating brand awareness. The other elements are expanding its global footprint, innovating with product, and maintaining operational excellence. It made great strides in all of those areas last year, but there's plenty more to accomplish this year and beyond.

One area that's incredibly promising is outside of footwear. Shoe sales increased 39% year over year in the fourth quarter, while apparel was up 83% and accessories were up 86%. That means customers are loving its brand right now, not just its shoes.

Management is guiding for sales to increase 27% in 2025, ahead of its previous guidance. If inflation chills, On's results could stay elevated. As it amplifies its brand and expands its reach, On could be a standout stock this year and beyond.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/810018/on-running-shoes.jpg,N

Its premium-priced coffee has enabled the business to experience strong profit growth over the years. However, it has experienced a slowdown in its growth recently amid worsening global economic conditions. Last year, it brought on CEO Brian Niccol from Chipotle Mexican Grill, in an effort to turn things around.

Even though those efforts are in their early stages, the stock has been doing well since then. It rallied more than 20% in the past six months, hitting a new 52-week high of $117.46 last week. Could this be the start of even larger gains to come for Starbucks stock, or should investors be concerned that it may be approaching a peak?

Starbucks still has a lot of work to do in turning its business around

Starbucks brought on Niccol in the hopes that he could get Starbucks' business back on the right path. Slowing sales numbers have been a concern for investors, and that remains an issue today.

When the company reported earnings in January, its same-store sales were negative for a fourth straight quarter. Same-store sales growth tells investors how much growth the company has achieved when excluding the effect of new store openings and closures. It considers only those stores that were open a year ago.

However, even when considering its overall growth rate, those numbers also haven't been impressive.

Niccol is making some changes that should help the bottom line, such as cutting 30% of the menu and reducing staff, but tariffs could negate some of those cost savings and efficiencies. Under the threat of trade wars and global economic uncertainty, it may not be easy for Starbucks to jump-start its growth rate anytime soon. The problem is, many investors may already be pricing in the stock as if its turnaround is complete.

How expensive is Starbucks stock?

The coffee stock's strong rally in recent months means that investors now have to pay 37 times its trailing earnings to own a piece of the company. For a business that's struggling to generate growth and that faces some tough competition in China from low-cost rivals, that looks like an expensive ask for investors, especially given the more modest earnings multiple Starbucks has averaged in recent years.

Investors are normally willing to pay a premium for a stock that's growing at a fast rate. But in Starbucks' case, that isn't happening, and things may not get better anytime soon.

There's a bit too much optimism priced into Starbucks stock right now

Starbucks looks incredibly expensive given the challenges that lie ahead for the business. Even if the risk and uncertainty related to tariffs prove to be short-lived, Starbucks still hasn't shown that it can find a way to get back to growing its revenue at a rate high enough to justify a high valuation.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/809464/two-business-people-meeting-over-coffee.jpg,N

The satellite segment to maintain its leadership status during the forecast period

Based on payload type, the satellite segment contributed to the largest share in 2020, accounting for around three-fourths of the global carrier rocket market, and is projected to maintain its leadership status during the forecast period. Moreover, this segment is estimated to witness the largest CAGR of 11.8% from 2021 to 2030. This is due to rise in adoption of advanced satellites by telecommunication organizations to implementing high-speed internet services worldwide.

Based on end user, the government segment accounted for the highest share in 2020, holding more than around three-fifths of the global carrier rocket market, and is estimated to continue its lead position during the forecast period. This is due to increase in deployment for defense and monitoring services by government organizations. However, the commercial segment is expected to portray the highest CAGR of 12.4% from 2021 to 2030. This is attributed to surge in initiatives undertaken by commercial space organizations for deploying advanced space payloads and conducting space exploration missions.

In the early 1990s, Germany was at the centre of a re-alignment of the global security system. German unification was the beachhead for replacing Soviet influence in eastern Europe, to be followed over the coming decades by the extension of the European Union (EU) and NATO to countries that had been behind the Iron Curtain. But this came at a financial cost, requiring huge expenditure in Germany to rebuild the east and normalise living standards between the two parts of the country. Bond yields reflected the burden this would put on public finances, and on 1 March 1990, 10-year German bond yields rose by 34 basis points (bp). It took three years for bond yields to fall back to end of December 1989 levels (7.5%).

Pricing the new reality

History does not always repeat itself, but it often rhymes. Germany is again at the centre of the global security system realignment. Except this time, it is because of the potential withdrawal of the US security guarantee for Europe, rather than securing the collapse of Soviet influence. Germany, along with other European countries – including the UK – is having to increase defence spending. Markets do not yet know how big this will be, what form it will take, and over what time horizon it will happen. They do know, however, that there is no choice other than for governments to commit more of their budgets to defence. It will mean more borrowing – either via individual states or through some EU mutualisation. The 10-year German government bond yield rose 30bp on 5 March in the wake of the suggestion that Germany will need to spend €500bn in the coming years to boost defence and rebuild infrastructure. The 10-year yield ended last week at 2.4% - as I write this on Friday morning it stands at 2.84%. To the close of business on Thursday 6 March, the ICE German Government Bond index lost 3.1% since the end of last week.

US away

These political developments are of historical importance. They have been prompted of course by the ongoing Ukraine conflict, and by the stance of the US Trump Administration. Washington has signalled the US is no longer willing to shoulder what it sees as an unfair burden - providing global economic security by playing the role of consumer of last resort, and playing the role of global peacekeeper by providing unlimited security and military aid through NATO funding.

Changing assumptions

All of this is upending global trade and political relations. It is creating uncertainty in markets as well as in diplomatic circles. There are clear investment implications, the most obvious being that the mode of policy making employed by Trump is one that generates uncertainty, reflected in increased volatility in financial markets. The potential for disruption to trade and capital flows is clear, and in turn this will impact consumption and investment decisions, as well as economic policy. Previously held assumptions about growth, inflation, monetary policy, and long-term borrowing costs are all being challenged. What was supposed to be the Trump trade - US bond yields and equities higher - has been turned on its head. Meanwhile, the European narrative is now about fiscal spending, “making Europe great again” growth initiatives, and opportunities for European stocks to continue to outperform. Even though the European Central Bank (ECB) reduced its deposit rate again on 6 March to 2.50%, there is much less certainty that it can continue to cut rates to below 2.0% this year. As ECB President Christine Lagarde said at the press conference following the rate decision, “there is uncertainty everywhere”. Growth and neutral interest rate assumptions may need to be revised higher. That, and the prospect of a huge increase in European government bond supply, is why yields are rising.

Upside-down Trump trade

There is not much spare capacity in the US economy even though there are tentative signs of the data flow softening. The noise around tariffs, DOGE and broader budget initiatives means that convictions on growth, inflation and the path of interest rates cannot be strongly held. If economic activity is disrupted, it becomes harder to value corporate revenues and cashflow. This should mean higher risk premiums on US equities and credit. The S&P 500 equally weighted index price-earnings multiple is around 20 times, according to Bloomberg. The risk is that the multiple will contract and earnings growth forecasts will be lower. For credit, spreads are in the bottom decile of their range of the last 10 years. Given recent years’ good macroeconomic backdrop, US markets are priced for perfection. Perfection, however, is looking somewhat elusive. The consensus earnings per share 12-month growth rate forecast for the S&P 500 peaked in December and has been coming down since. The market is now looking for the Federal Reserve (Fed) to cut rates three times this year.

Euroboost

For Europe, the game changer is the increase in borrowing costs. The rise in yields has been impressive. Only Germany has any real fiscal space to expand debt so other countries will be relying on the EU to provide concessions on how defence-related spending is treated. But borrowing will increase and there might need to be savings found in other areas of spending. As such it is hard to see what the net effect on growth will be. Some argue that pure defence spending has limited multiplier effects. We need to see what the balance is between pure defence and broader infrastructure spending – today’s warfare depends on technology, communications, logistics, as well as manufacturing hardware. But shouldering more of the defence burden and potentially having to adapt and respond to US tariffs could turn out to be positive in terms of the European growth outlook. That is the way European equity investors are viewing things.

3.5% Bunds?

Higher sustained borrowing implies that real interest rates will need to move higher and there will be a structurally higher long-term neutral rate. I suspect rates markets will price in this new reality quicker than credit or equities. It is difficult to say where the necessary real rate will be – German real rates were around 5% in the early 1990s. They don’t need to be that high given Germany’s relatively low level of public debt and high level of household savings. Looking at one of Germany’s legacy inflation-linked bonds, the real yield has been slowly edging up since central banks started hiking, but it is low. Prior to this week it was at 0.5%. Real yields elsewhere have been higher (around 1.2% for French, UK and US inflation-linked). Assuming German real yields move to those levels, this implies a nominal bond yield of close to 3.5% (the current 10-year yield is 2.9%). German yields have not been 3.5% or above since before the global financial crisis.

ECB still easing

Future rate and yield developments also depend on the ECB. The gap between the 10-year German Bund yield and the ECB deposit rate has been above 3.0% before, so even with another 50bp or so of easing following March’s 25bp rate cut, Bund yields could still potentially enter the 3.5%-5.0% range. This is not a forecast, but investors need to think about what might happen. Such an outcome would be difficult for other European countries with weaker fiscal balances. European sovereign spreads versus German bonds have been trending lower over the last year. So have corporate credit spreads. Higher Bund yields will push yields on other government debt higher, prompting new concerns about fiscal sustainability in some countries – especially if they are also going to be raising defence spending. So far, Eurozone corporate bond spreads have been stable, but credit analysts will need to factor in higher overall borrowing costs in this new era.

Euro fixed income becomes less dull

It is more likely to be the case that the market will price a long-term rate which does not endanger another European sovereign debt crisis. Timing and mutualisation can mitigate the market impact. Bund yields above 3.0% and certainly above 3.5% might be seen as high enough. Fixed income markets can quickly re-price. In the short term that means being exposed to duration might lead to negative returns while the shorter maturity end of the bond market is likely to be less impacted. If credit markets remain stable, short duration credit strategies should do better than all maturity bond indices and portfolios. Once the market thinks enough has been done, then fixed income will look attractive again. In 1990, German bond yields rose 170bp. In 1991 they fell 100bp and another 70bp in 1992. Higher bond yields are not great for equities, or economic growth (or a fixed exchange rate mechanism), but they can ultimately provide for attractive fixed income returns.

Growth less sure for equities

I struggle a little more with the equity outlook. The disruption to revenues from a huge shift in trade and political relations which impact on US companies and elsewhere should mean lower valuation multiples for stocks. Easy to write, of course, when the S&P 500 has given back its post-Trump victory gains. The market index level is still 13% to 15% higher than it was a year ago. But betting that political risk disappears, and the previous rally continues is wishful thinking. Trump is not going to become less of a source of uncertainty, there is risk around Ukraine, relations with the EU, China and Russia, and his questionable stance towards Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal. Political risk continues, market volatility continues.

Trump’s world upending everything

Despite comments to the contrary, I suspect President Trump does watch the stock market. The so-called Trump trade is supposed to mean higher stock prices and higher bond yields as the policy mix generated a more inflationary backdrop. The backtracking on tariffs on auto companies is a realisation that tariffs are very disruptive to supply chains, which could also hit output and employment eventually. Meanwhile, front running of imports led to a massive surge in the trade deficit in January. Disruptions to economic data might be temporary, but for thin-skinned traders and financial market commentators, the mood is changing quickly. The market now has three Fed rate cuts priced in for this year and the terminal rate for the cycle has fallen to 3.3%. I suspect bond yields will move below 4.0% at some point, so the gap between US Treasuries and European bond yields will narrow further. That is a signal for a lower dollar also.

Trump’s world will provide people like me no end of things to write about. The trick is trying to see through it all and come to solid views on markets. Not easy. For now, risk aversion is likely to be the best approach until there is more clarity on some of the most important geopolitical events. The US growth outlook is being questioned, so good for Treasuries and bad for the S&P 500; the European growth outlook may be being revised higher, so bad for Bunds and good for Euro Stoxx. If only it were that simple. Stay tuned.

The Rev. Jamal Bryant, senior pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church near Atlanta, organized the “Target Fast” that began Wednesday — the first day of Lent — along with other faith and civil rights leaders. A website for participants points to the spending power of Black Americans and described the boycott as “a spiritual act of resistance.""

“This is a fast for accountability. A fast for justice. A fast for a future where corporations do not bow to pressure at the expense of marginalized communities,"" reads a message on targetfast.org. “Turn your dollars into data, power, and change.”

Target declined to comment directly on the boycott, which runs through April 17. Here's what to know.

What happened with Target's DEI initiatives?

Target announced in January that it would phase out a handful of DEI initiatives, including a program designed to help Black employees build meaningful careers and promote Black-owned businesses.

The Minneapolis-based company, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it long had intended to end the program this year, but its announcement came after other prominent American corporations scaled back their diversity activities.

Target also said it would stop setting hiring and promotion goals for women, members of racial minority groups and other underrepresented communities.

Conservative activists, and more recently, President Donald Trump’s White House, have sought to rid the federal government, schools and private workplaces of DEI policies that were adopted to counter discrimination. Critics maintain the range of goals and programs arising from such policies are themselves discriminatory and counterproductive.

While Target rival Walmart also rolled back its DEI initiatives in November, Target's actions seemed to cause more customer outrage. Numerous calls for boycotts emerged across the country, including from Minneapolis civil rights activists who gathered outside Target's headquarters. The daughters of one of Target's co-founders also expressed shock and alarm.

“The surprise element is what attracted customer ire” said Akshay Rao, a marketing professor at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management. He and others point to Target's previous messaging around DEI and reputation as a strong advocate for the rights of racial minorities and LGBTQ+ people.

Target also faced boycott calls almost 15 years ago after it was revealed that the company donated to an organization that supported Republican Tom Emmer, then a vocal opponent of gay marriage, in his campaign to become Minnesota's governor. Then, as now, Target received more blowback than other companies that made similar donations because its actions ran counter to expectations, Rao said.

What does giving up Target for 40 days involve?

Organizers of the ""Target Fast” urged people who take part to stop shopping at Target and instead redirect their dollars to Black-owned businesses.

Targetfast.org lists the demands of boycotters, which include Target completely restoring its commitments to DEI and honoring a previous pledge to spend over $2 billion with Black-owned businesses by the end of 2025.

Bryant, the pastor spearheading the protest, told The Washington Post on Wednesday that about 110,000 people signed up to participate. Bryant was not immediately available for further comment when The Associated Press contacted his staff on Thursday.

The Rev. Al Sharpton, founder and president of the National Action Network, announced in late January that the civil rights organization would identify two companies in the next 90 days that will be subjected to consumer boycotts for abandoning their DEI pledges.

What impact will the ‘Target Fast’ have?

Time will tell. But experts say boycott appeals reflect the risk companies face when making moves that could potentially alienate their customer base — particularly when the moves go against past corporate messaging.

“One of the ways that you can really upset (consumers) is to claim to be something and then violate that standard that you claim to be,” Americus Reed II, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, said. “It lands really poisonous on people, especially in vulnerable communities where people have put their trust in you. ... And now, you're reversing.""

A sense of betrayal can be a significant motivator for customers to take their money elsewhere, Reed said. And successful boycotts, he adds, need to generate enough energy to “make this not just a moment, but a movement.”

Targeting single companies for a more prolonged period of time may prove effective, but organizers need to provide multiple ways for people to participate, Reed said.

Pledging to avoid large chains like Target or Walmart, for example, may be difficult for those who have fewer alternatives either geographically or because of what they can afford. Reed says targeted “buycotts,” such as trying to only purchase products from the Black-owned brands that large chains stock, could help bridge that gap.

Larger market pressures, such as the tariffs on goods from Canada, China and Mexico that Trump imposed this week — are likely to have bigger implications for Target’s bottom line in the months ahead, Rao said.

Getting consumers to change their buying habits, even for a cause they support, can be very difficult, Reed said. Boycotts that gain traction online also sometimes come across like “virtue signaling as opposed to real change,"" but making them part of the national conversation nonetheless is a huge step, he said.

“A lot of times, you’re in sort of inertia in your life as a consumer. And you’re just rolling along, you’re clicking a button on Amazon and getting your stuff,"" Reed said. ""Then something like this (boycott) comes up, and you’re forced to confront the reality of, ‘OK, what am I going to do?’”",https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2025/03/TARGET-BOYCOTT.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N

Last week, the European Commission unveiled its long-awaited Omnibus package on sustainability. It substantially waters down two directives intended to end social and environmental malpractice along product supply chains, citing a need to simplify the legislation and reduce red tape.

Among the proposals scrapped in line with several of these lobbyists’ requests were a civil liability regime that could have provided some justice to victims of corporate abuse and a minimum cap for financial penalties on companies set at 5 per cent of their global turnover.

In a bid to “regain competitiveness,” both were removed from the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), while other loopholes were introduced to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).

Many of these measures were pushed for by companies that were invited to a ‘reality check’ consultation with the European Commission on 5 February, according to a list of invitees seen by Equal Times.

However, 64 per cent of them – 28 of the 44 – have faced accusations ranging from rape, murder and torture along their supply chains to union busting and denying workers bathroom breaks.

""These companies were allowed to rewrite Europe’s laws through the back door to ensure they made bigger profits at the expense of workers and the planet,” says European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) deputy general secretary Isabelle Schömann. “It is clear that European lawmaking has been captured by corporations with a history of human rights violations and environmental destruction.”

Lobbyist demands

Several changes incorporated into the Commission’s final proposals were requested by trade associations representing 16 of the 28 companies accused of abuses: Airbus, Allianz, DHL, Deutsche Bank, Engie, Eni, Generali, Intesa Sanpaolo, I.CO.P, La Poste, Metro AG, Michelin, Schneider Electric, Société Générale, TotalEnergies and Volkswagen.

The demands were made in a joint position paper by Germany’s BDI, Italy’s Confindustria and the Mouvement des Entreprises de France employers’ associations, dated 25 January 2025 and seen by Equal Times.

“The CSDDD imposes burdensome provisions in terms of scope, applicable rules, liability and sanctions, causing legal uncertainty, excessive bureaucracy and incalculable risks for companies,” the document said.

It called for scrapping the civil liability mechanism and turnover-based financial penalties, limiting the scope of the CSRD to enterprises with more than 1,000 workers, similarly restricting the CSDDD, and limiting due diligence responsibilities to direct suppliers.

The Commission acceded to all these requests, which were largely echoed by the BusinessEurope lobby group, that attended the second day of the consultation.

Other changes made to the CSDDD lengthened the time between company supply chain checks from every year to every five years and weakened the punishment on offending contractors from severance to suspension of relations.

Implementation of the directive’s reporting requirements was delayed for two years – until 2028 – and its scope was limited to firms employing over 1,000 workers, exempting 80 per cent of the businesses that would originally have been covered. The same limitation was imposed on the CSRD.

“Consulting poachers on gamekeeping policy”

“The Commission’s idea of consultation is clearly to gather together some of the worst offenders to justify reckless slashing of its sustainability achievements,” says the Dutch Labour Party MEP Lara Wolters. “It’s like consulting poachers on gamekeeping policy. The fossil fuel industry at the consultation had almost as many representatives as the entirety of European civil society. More credible voices would have told them that we do not need to cause harm to people and planet in order to remain competitive, and that the new plans flagrantly go against industry best practice. Unfortunately, it seems those voices were shut out.”

Some businesses which have already invested in cleaning up their supply chains say they have been put at a competitive disadvantage by the Commission’s volte-face. One forward-looking company, the Dutch chocolate manufacturer Tony’s Chocolonely – which has worked with Wolters – condemned the EU’s retreat.

A company statement said that the EU’s goal “shouldn’t be to simplify and weaken upcoming legislation. Why? ’Cause we all know that strong legislation is the only way to hold business accountable and inspire global change. […] We prove every day that supply chain due diligence is possible – because we do it. And we believe all businesses should do the same.”

These sorts of concerns led Pascal Canfin, a French MEP with the centrist Liste Renaissance, to decry the stakeholders meeting as “a fake consultation process” that was really “a smokescreen for deregulation”.

Paul de Clerk of Friends of the Earth Europe was one of the few civil society voices to gain entry to the consultation, on its second day. He says that oil and gas firms were sat in the front row of a “very friendly meeting,” facilitated by the right-wing European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis and attended by other EU commissioners and senior officials.

“Speakers kept saying they wanted to reduce red tape and administrative burden in a simplified process that would not affect the legislation’s ambition and of course we’ve now seen that this was a complete lie because they’re proposing to completely dismantle the CSDDD,” says De Clerk. “They’ve literally taken all the demands from the position paper ‘wish list’ of the German, French and Italian industry associations.”

Schömann, who also attended the consultation’s second day, tells Equal Times that the consultation marked “a very dangerous turn” in the way that the Commission was pursuing its ‘better regulation’ agenda.

“It is not respecting how social partners from different organisations have to be consulted,” she says. “The room was full of big businesses, multinationals, employers’ organisations and we were only two trades unions – the ETUC and IndustriAll – even though we represent 45 million workers in the EU.”

Schömann said that the 44 companies had been given privileged access to the upper echelons of the Commission the day before (5 February). “We hadn’t had this opportunity and even had to invite ourselves to the roundtable. It’s not acceptable and is very detrimental to any trust we can put in how the Commission listens to social actors,” she added.

For its part, the European Commission said: “The selection of companies was made to get a geographically balanced group of different sizes and sectors forming an overall manageable group. Some business associations have assisted the Commission in the selection of companies. The aim was to interact with practitioners operationally involved with business compliance of the issues under discussion.”

The official pointed out that two trades unions, and eight NGOs had also attended the reality check on 6 February, along with an expanded list of corporates, and over 40 business associations: “The mix of stakeholders reflects the need to gather practical insights from those applying the legislation in question. This balance is essential to improving the legal framework for the benefit of all stakeholders, including citizens and civil society organisations.”

Accusations against companies

Among the 44 companies that attended on the first day, Eni has been accused of ignoring oil spills in Nigeria’s Niger Delta. Deutsche Bank is reportedly one of the biggest lenders to, and investors in, major companies working in ecosystem risk sectors.

DHL faces accusations of suppressing union activities and subjecting workers to inhumane conditions – including being denied bathroom breaks and suffering physical assault. Airbus allegedly broke an arms embargo on Libya.

TotalEnergies has a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique beset by accusations of rape, murder and human rights abuses. Volkswagen faces scrutiny for potentially using Uyghur forced labour in its supply chains as well as for workplace abuses in Serbia. Michelin allegedly used a Belgian rubber supplier implicated in environmental destruction and land grabbing practices across West Africa.

Intesa Sanpaolo, along with Allianz and Deutsche Bank is accused of holding shares and bonds in fossil fuel companies fuelling violence in South Sudan. Amnesty International has accused Generali of heavily investing in extractive companies involved in severe human rights abuses, while I.CO.P officials have been investigated for unauthorised industrial wastewater discharges that polluted aquifers and other waterways.

Metro AG has been accused of union-busting practices, dismissals, harassment and other abuses in Pakistan, while Schneider Electric allegedly sacked workers who tried to join a union. Executives at La Poste were accused of using racist slurs against North African employees in a WhatsApp group.

Société Générale is accused of supplying credit to the Israeli army used for activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Allianz has reportedly provided finance to arms companies exporting to Israel, while an OECD complaint was filed against Engie over its alleged involvement in the mining of ‘blood coal’ in Colombia.

All of the allegations were made in the last five years, with the exception of Eni and La Poste’s in 2018, Schneider Electric’s in 2016 and Generali’s in 2013.

Equal Times approached all the accused companies for a response to their involvement in the consultation, given the accusations against them.

A Deutsche Bank spokesperson said the company “engages in constructive dialogue with its stakeholders including associations, NGOs and policymakers,” and referred further questions to its trade associations, and a LinkedIn statement.

An Allianz representative said: “We appreciate and support the simplification and streamlining proposals of the EU Commission to reduce the regulatory burden and enhance competitiveness.”

A spokesperson for La Poste Group said they aimed to reach net zero emissions by 2040, and “to have a positive impact on society as a whole,” in line with their status as mission-driven company under French law. The company rep added: “La Poste has a particular legitimacy as both a producer and a user of data to share feedback on the extra-financial reporting framework. Moreover, as part of the CSRD first wave companies and as having reported for a couple of years under the EU taxonomy (sustainable classification system), La Poste is in a position to share its first-hand experience on the concrete implementation of these legislation.”

A DHL spokesperson said: “We believe it is reasonable, and even essential, to seek input from European companies that are fully compliant with these regulations. These companies, like DHL Group, can offer valuable insights based on their experience navigating the rules, highlighting both the benefits and potential challenges. Engaging with those who are adhering to the standards ensures that policies are practical, fair and effective, while also fostering a balanced perspective on how regulations impact businesses in real-world settings.”",https://www.equaltimes.org/local/cache-gd2/4a/dd07cf7b5f73d472159727309522ef.jpg?1741331027,N

As analysts are scrambling to identify sectors best positioned to weather President Donald Trump’s trade policies, one common answer keeps coming up: healthcare.

""America is aging, and no tariff will slow that trend,"" said CapWealth Research Director Grant Stark. “There will likely be more demand for advanced medicines, skilled care, and other health-related segments.”

How real is tariff long-term threat?

Tariff talk isn’t new.

Uncertainty has been mounting since Trump’s election. But while analysts widely agree that tariff-related fears are a driving force behind market instability, opinions vary on the long-term impact.

“Tariffs of this size and magnitude haven’t happened in about 100 years,” said Ritholtz Wealth Management’s Callie Cox. “We’re working with a pretty unprecedented change in policy here.”

As trade disputes with Mexico, Canada, and China escalate, markets have responded with a sharp selloff.

The auto industry is particularly exposed due to its reliance on imported parts. A one-month delay on Mexican and Canadian import tariffs announced this week buys U.S. automakers some time.

But Barclays analysts warn that tariffs “could wipe out effectively all profits” for General Motors (GM), Ford (F), and Stellantis (STLA).

“These exemptions don’t do much to resolve the general air of uncertainty,” said BMO Wealth Management Chief Investment Officer Yung-Yu Ma. “Businesses will remain cautious until there’s more clarity on tariffs.”

Investors are expected to follow suit, which is why sectors like healthcare remain attractive to analysts like Stark and Brian Mulberry of Zacks Investment Management. Both recommended CVS Health Corp (CVS) as a potential winner.

Healthcare is one of the few pockets of the market that has stayed afloat while Trump wages a trade war with both adversaries and allies.

Mulberry, who believes the market’s tariff reaction is “a little overdone,” still advised caution when it comes to pharmaceutical firms with overseas operations and health-related companies vulnerable to tariffs.",https://media.investorsobserver.com/images/featured-article/2025/03/pharma-healthcare.jpg,N

Months after Neumora reported a phase 3 flop, J&J has stopped development of its rival drug candidate aticaprant as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD).

Aticaprant and Neumora’s navacaprant are oral opioid kappa receptor antagonists. Navacaprant failed a phase 3 MDD trial in January. Earlier this week, Neumora halted one trial of the candidate and paused two late-stage studies after assessing a data set that was even worse than analysts feared based on the top-line failure.

Neumora has cited phase 2 aticaprant data as evidence that its mechanism works and that its failed trial may be an anomaly. That argument took a hit after the stock market closed Thursday, when J&J said it is stopping a phase 3 aticaprant program because of insufficient efficacy in the target patient population.

J&J is yet to give up on aticaprant.

The Europe sustainable (recycled and green) steel market was valued at $94.09 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.31%, reaching $157.86 billion by 2034

The growing need for low-carbon construction materials and stringent environmental laws are driving this expansion. Technological developments in steel production, such as improved recycling procedures and hydrogen-based reduction techniques, are major factors driving the market. Furthermore, the European steel industry is becoming more carbon-conscious and sustainable as a result of strategic alliances and investments in green infrastructure projects.

The market for sustainable steel in Europe is expanding as businesses move toward green, recycled, and low-carbon steel products to satisfy strict environmental standards and sustainability objectives. In order to lessen CO2 emissions and dependency on fossil fuels, this market includes carbon capture-integrated processes, bio-based steel production, green hydrogen-based steel (H2-DRI), and recycled steel (scrap-based production).

Steelmakers are being pushed toward more environmentally friendly options by major forces such as the European Green Deal, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), and corporate net-zero targets. While investments in electric arc furnaces (EAFs) and direct reduced iron (DRI) technologies are driving market growth, the automotive, construction, and manufacturing industries are increasingly embracing sustainable steel to reduce their carbon footprint.

Despite its high growth potential, challenges such as high production costs, technological limitations, and the availability of green hydrogen impede rapid adoption. Nonetheless, a positive market environment is being created by encouraging policies, carbon pricing schemes, and rising end-user demand. Prominent firms like Voestalpine, SSAB, and Arcelor Mittal are making significant investments in environmentally friendly production techniques.

Due to innovation, regulatory support, and growing corporate commitments to green procurement, the sustainable steel market is expected to grow significantly as Europe approaches climate neutrality by 2050.

How can this report add value to an organization?

Growth/Marketing Strategy: The Europe sustainable steel market has been growing at a rapid pace. The market offers enormous opportunities for existing and emerging market players. Some of the strategies covered in this segment are mergers and acquisitions, product launches, partnerships and collaborations, business expansions, and investments. The strategies preferred by companies to maintain and strengthen their market position primarily include product development.

Competitive Strategy: The key players in the Europe sustainable steel market analyzed and profiled in the study include manufacturers and recyclers.

Executive Search 2025: Balancing AI Innovation with a Human Touch

The executive search industry is entering one of its most transformative eras, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, data analytics, and shifting client needs and expectations. In 2024, firms faced many challenges marked by economic uncertainty, evolving workforce dynamics, and increasing demand for specialized leadership roles. While internal talent mobility and cautious hiring strategies were dominant themes, the need for resilient, adaptable leaders capable of driving innovation has positioned the industry for a pivotal shift in 2025, recruiters tell Hunt Scanlon Media. Firms are stepping up to meet these demands by integrating cutting-edge technology into their workflows while emphasizing the irreplaceable value of human expertise.

Technology, particularly AI, is reshaping how firms identify, evaluate, and connect with top talent. From automating routine tasks to uncovering deeper insights into market trends and candidate fit, these tools enhance efficiency and precision. However, as industry leaders emphasize, the human element remains central to success in this relationship-driven field. By leveraging AI to scale capabilities without sacrificing the personalized touch, executive search firms are not only redefining their processes but also reimagining their role as strategic talent advisors. As 2025 unfolds, the firms that can balance technological innovation with a deep understanding of leadership and culture will set the standard for the future of the industry.

Noto Group is an executive search and consulting firm with expertise in recruiting for director, vice president and C-level roles. Its executive searches span business functions and channels within the outdoor, active performance, sporting goods, food and beverage, fashion and natural products.

Mr. Notowitz founded Noto Group in 2009. He advises his team as well as entrepreneurs, founders, executive teams, investors and boards of fast-growing mission-driven consumer brands and retailers nationwide. Mr. Notowitz maintains a pulse on trends in business strategy, leadership, recruiting and talent selection.

Prior to Noto Group, he was founder and managing partner of executive search firm Generator Group.

Congressman Barney Frank, the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, has asked Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke for at least another 60 days of public comment on the acquisition. He also wants the Fed to hold public hearings on what such a deal would mean for consumers.

It starts to add up

A worry is that if Capital One keeps growing, it might turn into another too-big-to-fail institution. In the last six years it has acquired Hibernia National Bank, North Fork Bank, and Chevy Chase Bank, making it the 11th largest U.S.-based bank by size of deposits. If the $9 billion ING deal goes through, Capital One would jump up to sixth largest, behind JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America (NYS: BAC) , Wells Fargo (NYS: WFC) , Citigroup (NYS: C) , and US Bancorp (NYS: USB) .

Source: BankRegData.com.

Even with the steep falloff in bank deposits from the first four banks to the possible numbers five and six Capital One, it's hard to escape the fear of more future bailout scenarios since Capital One at its current size is already considered ""systemically important.""

If the Fed or Congress does scuttle Capital One's acquisition plans, that could also spell N-O to other bank deals a-brewin'. It's hard to see how PNC's (NYS: PNC) plan to buy the Royal Bank of Canada's U.S. banking and credit card operations for $3.62 billion could survive. That marriage, if consummated, would bring PNC's deposits to around $210 billion, a hair below the potential Capital One deposits.

Credit card worries

And consumer groups, such as the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, already concerned with the increase in high-interest credit card lending, feel that Capital One's recent acquisition of HSBC's U.S. credit card business would be funded by the ING Direct deposits. The group is uneasy about this pushing more consumers into a debt spiral.

Make or break...

On Friday, the Fed decided to grant Congressman Frank's request, and will hold three days of public hearings on the proposed acquisition. It also agreed to allow the period of public comment to continue through Oct. 12.

The deal that started out as a source of annoyance to ING Direct customers unhappy having Capital One become their new banker may become the make-or-break determiner of bank consolidations for the foreseeable future. Keep track of your bank investments by adding them to your Watchlist.

Monument Group’s Zac Williams expects a big spike in European technology deals in 2025, as the region offers more appealing valuations compared with the US.

Next up, we dive into a report from S&P Global Market Intelligence, which shows that while global private equity and venture capital deal value jumped 26.6 percent in February compared with January 2025, it still lagged behind last year’s number, dropping 28 percent from February 2024.

Lastly, ID verification systems are becoming more crucial than ever, fueled by a surge in online fraud, identity theft and tighter regulations like know your customer and anti-money laundering. Also, AI is changing the game for security and cyber threats. Against this backdrop, Corsair Capital has made a move to increase its stake in Munich-based IDnow, securing a majority share.

Favorable valuations

European technology deals will see significant growth in 2025, underpinned by more favorable valuations compared to the US, Zac Williams, partner at Monument Group, told PE Hub. “Major tech hubs such as Berlin, London and Stockholm benefit from deep benches of engineering talent and Europe’s fragmentation fosters a global mindset from the outset, resulting in faster internationalization.”

Climate tech is emerging as a key area to watch, thanks to Europe’s heightened focus on sustainability and its lead in green transition, London-based Williams said.

On the AI front, infrastructure projects continue to attract sizable capital backing and will benefit from “political enthusiasm” to facilitate large projects, he said. However, there is a growing pool of specialized software and deep tech opportunities targeting sectors like healthcare, finance and legal services, where Europe’s established sectors and stricter regulations present a competitive advantage.

“AI also naturally proliferates where its value-added solutions can serve industries increasingly seeking automation and efficiency, such as in high-value manufacturing.”

Bolt-on acquisitions will also play a big role in overall M&A activity, he said. “Looking at this from the reverse angle, with valuations correcting in the venture and growth space, some high-potential companies may find an appealing liquidity route via strategic sales rather than braving the prospect of down-rounds.”

However, the sector does face some challenges, he added. “Fragmented public markets and lower retail investor engagement limits the pool of liquidity options for European firms and navigating a patchwork of regulations across the region remains complex.”

Below are the tech deals we covered this week in Europe:

Main Capital’s Timegrip buys Software4You

LDC sells Blis in a deal valued at $175m

Arcus-backed FixMap picks up Internet Union

Thoma Bravo-backed USU buys Saasmetrix

Main-backed Xitres snaps up Hartje Wonen

Exponent to invest in digital transformation provider Hippo Digital

Equistone to sell stake in Timetoact Group to HIG Capital

Blackstone-and Permira-backed Adevinta to sell Willhaben

Sluggish trend

Global private equity and venture capital deal value in February dropped 28 percent year over year from $52.64 billion in February 2024, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. The number of deals also saw a decline by about 12.7 percent during the same period.

Looking at the first two months of 2025, deal volume and value were down compared to the same period in 2024. Investment value decreased about 20 percent to $67.89 billion and the number of deals were down to 1,670 from 1,788, the report said.

In fact, January marked the slowest start for US dealmaking in over a decade, according to data PE Hub’s analysis of multiple providers.

However, February showed some signs of recovery, with deal value climbing 26.6 percent from January to reach $37.93 billion.

Technology, media and telecommunications led the transactions in February with 278 deals totaling $13.72 billion, followed by the industrials, with $7.41 billion across 103 transactions. These two sectors also led dealmaking in Q4 of 2024, according to PE Hub data.

Six of the top 10 deals during the month were in the US and Canada. The largest PE transaction was Blackstone’s $5.65 billion purchase of Safe Harbor Marinas, followed by Turn/River Management’s $4.42 billion buyout of SolarWinds.

Securely verified

Corsair Capital has acquired a majority stake in IDnow, increasing its investment in the Munich-based identity verification company.

Founded in 2014, IDnow develops proprietary, AI-powered identity verification technologies that address cybersecurity and digital verification needs.

Corsair first invested in IDnow in October 2019 with a minority stake. Since then, IDnow strengthened its technical leadership position, grew its portfolio of differentiated identification systems and completed two strategic acquisitions, which expanded the company into new geographies, including establishing a leadership position in France, a statement read. In 2021, IDnow acquired Ariadnext and Trust Management.

Now, with a controlling stake, Corsair plans to accelerate IDnow’s market position through additional acquisitions, broadening its reach and strengthening its position across multiple geographies, it said.

KIA has received honours due to its excellence in service quality and passenger experience. It was named the Best Airport by Size and Region (2-5 million passengers per year) in Africa by Airports Council International in the 2021 Airport Service Quality (ASQ) Awards, having previously won in the same category in 2019 and 2020.

Originally built as a military airbase during World War II, KIA has transformed over the decades into one of West Africa’s busiest airports.

However, despite its modern facilities and strategic position, Ghana still lacks a national airline—a gap that has persisted for nearly two decades.

KIA’s story dates back to the early 1940s when it served as a crucial airbase for British and Allied forces. Following Ghana’s independence in 1957, the airbase was converted into a civilian airport and named Accra International Airport. In 1969, it was renamed in honor of Lieutenant General Emmanuel Kwasi Kotoka, the military officer who played a role in Ghana’s first coup d’état.

Over the years, Kotoka International Airport (KIA) has undergone significant expansion. It now features three terminals, including the state-of-the-art Terminal 3, completed in 2018, which serves as the primary hub for international flights. With a 3,403-meter runway, KIA can accommodate some of the world's largest aircraft, including the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380. Notably, it has also hosted the Antonov AN-225 Mriya, the largest aircraft ever built.

In 2023, KIA welcomed the U.S. Air Force 2 during the historic visit of U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris to Ghana.

The airport handles approximately 5 million passengers annually, cementing its status as a major hub in the region.

The Struggle of a National Airline

Despite Ghana’s investment in a world-class airport, the absence of a national airline remains a significant gap in its aviation industry. Ghana Airways, established in 1958 as the country’s flag carrier, was initially a partnership between the Government of Ghana (60%) and British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) (40%).

In 2002, the airline faced a severe financial crisis that weakened its staff strength and competitiveness. Much of its troubles stemmed from its earlier decision to become fully independent by purchasing BOAC’s 40% stake. This move, however, led to operational and financial difficulties, including issues with its Boeing fleet after the cancellation of an agreement with BOAC.

The crisis deepened when BOAC, seeking to recover an outstanding £4 million debt, obtained a legal injunction that resulted in the seizure of La Dante DC-10, one of Ghana Airways’ aircraft, at Heathrow Airport according to reports by The Guardian and The Telegraph.

The situation worsened when a £4 million lawsuit from British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) led to one of its aircraft being seized in London.

The aircraft was finally brought home and was turned into a restaurant serving up to 118 people in the Capital. Even as a restaurant, it didn’t survive — The La Tante DC-10 Restaurant was shut down in 2023.

In an attempt to revive the airline, Ghana International Airlines was launched in 2005 as a public-private partnership. However, it too faced financial difficulties and ceased operations in 2010, leaving the country without a national flag carrier.

Unfulfilled Plans for Revival

Over the years, multiple efforts to re-establish a national airline have stalled. In 2019, the government led by former President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Boeing to acquire three 787-9 Dreamliners at a cost of US$877.5 million at the Dubai Air Show, with EgyptAir along in partnering on the project. However, these plans have yet to materialize.

Despite these setbacks, Ghana’s aviation sector continues to thrive, with KIA serving as the gateway to the country. Airlines such as British Airways, Emirates, Delta, Qatar, Kenyan and Ethiopian Airlines operate frequent flights to and from Accra, connecting Ghana to major destinations worldwide.

As Ghana celebrates its heritage during Ghana Month, the question remains: will the country ever reclaim its national airline? While private airlines operate domestically and regionally, a national carrier could serve as a symbol of pride and economic opportunity.

For now, Kotoka International Airport remains a testament to Ghana’s aviation history—modern, busy, and globally connected, yet missing a crucial piece of its identity.",https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WhatsApp-Image-2025-03-06-at-18.32.52.jpeg,N

The company also revealed that it pays around CFA10 billion annually in taxes to the state.

These figures were shared during the Yaoundé Economic Meetings, held on February 26-27, 2025, and organized by the Cameroon Employers’ Association (GICAM).

Speaking at the event, Alain Minoué, Camrail’s Commercial and Marketing Director, highlighted the company’s key contributions: “Beyond our mobility solutions, we help streamline port operations, enhance corridor competitiveness, and stabilize fuel prices. The railway also plays a crucial role in exporting large volumes of goods, including raw and processed timber, cotton fiber, sesame, and gum arabic—many of which come from Chad and the Central African Republic. These exports generate significant foreign exchange earnings.”

Camrail took over Cameroon’s railway operations in 1999 after the privatization of the former state-run company, Regifercam. Initially a subsidiary of the French Bolloré Group, then Africa Global Logistics (AGL), Camrail now manages the country’s 918-kilometer railway network, handling both passenger and freight transport.

Mama Nsounchiat Fit, Deputy Managing Director of AGL Cameroon, emphasized the importance of the event: “Our participation in the Yaoundé Economic Meetings was a valuable opportunity to strengthen dialogue with stakeholders and reaffirm our commitment to modern, efficient, and sustainable logistics. AGL Cameroon remains dedicated to supporting infrastructure and strategic services that drive the country’s growth.”

Fiber fragmentation is a significant topic of concern across the industry, with studies highlighting the potential threat to ecosystems and human health, underscoring the need for the development of effective strategies aimed at mitigating the negative impact of fiber fragments.

In recent years, several domestic and industrial mitigation efforts have been developed to capture fiber fragments before they enter air, water and soil. However, the focus lies in reducing fiber fragments from entering the environment downstream, rather than tackling the problem at the source. The “Behind the Break” project seeks to identify the root causes of fiber fragmentation within manufacturing processes, such as different dye methods, focusing on cotton and polyester knits.

The project includes various testing methods, leveraging the expertise of partners such as Paradise Textiles, the fabric segment of Alpine Group.

“We recognize that the future of the fashion and textile industry hinges on our ability to address challenges like fiber fragmentation head-on,” said Lewis Shuler, head of innovation at Alpine Group and Paradise Textiles. “Our objective is to identify processes and strategies that mitigate fiber pollution through informed textile design and manufacturing processes. We’re excited about continuing this critical work and pioneering innovative technologies that can reshape the industry for the better.”

Many investors believe that this outstanding performance still has room for further improvement. Société Générale SA refers to the seven major Chinese tech giants, including Alibaba and Tencent Holdings, as the ""Seven Giants."" This basket of stocks, compiled on an equal-weight basis, has risen over 40% this year. In contrast, the American ""Seven Giants"" index has fallen by about 10%, and its sluggish performance has pushed the Nasdaq 100 index toward a correction.

This is a dramatic reversal of fortunes in the stock market that few on Wall Street anticipated. At the beginning of 2025, the Nasdaq index was still reaching new highs, while the Chinese stock market was languishing. However, almost overnight, the emergence of DeepSeek disrupted previous perceptions, and the market began to realize that China might not need many years to catch up with the U.S. in the field of artificial intelligence.

Since then, Chinese tech stocks have surged, even those who were long skeptical have turned from pessimism to optimism. This week, with the Chinese government's plans to increase support for tech companies and the launch of a series of new AI tools by companies like Alibaba, this wave of growth has been further propelled.

Charu Chanana, Chief Investment Strategist at Saxo Markets, stated: ""The success of DeepSeek and the launch of a series of AI models in China remind the world that despite the U.S. implementing chip export restrictions, China's innovative strength should not be underestimated. Considering the valuation discount, there is still room for growth in Chinese AI-related stocks.""

Société Générale has listed this Chinese corporate portfolio based on market capitalization and growth trajectory, which also includes Xiaomi, BYD, SMIC, JD.com, and NetEase. Frank Benzimra, a strategist at Société Générale, pointed out in a report on February 28 that this portfolio currently has an expected price-to-earnings ratio of 18 times, which is over 40% lower than that of the American ""Seven Giants.""

On Friday, the Hang Seng Tech Index rose over 1%, with a cumulative increase of about 10% this week, reaching its highest level since the end of 2021.

U.S. vs. China

Now, the previously undervalued Chinese stocks seem to be on an upward trajectory, while U.S. stocks have faced multiple blows. U.S. President Donald Trump has disrupted the global trade order, and a series of tariff measures have left American businesses and consumers worried, shaking the belief that ""the rise of the U.S. stock market is unstoppable,"" a notion stemming from ""American exceptionalism.""

The rise of large U.S. tech stocks, led by NVIDIA, has encountered obstacles after years of growth, and investors have begun to question the reasonableness of their high valuations, demanding higher expectations for earnings surprises.

Despite the rising optimism toward China, the long-standing performance of the Chinese stock market, unexpected policy shifts, and the intensifying geopolitical tensions under Trump's administration still leave some investors cautious Although the Hang Seng Tech Index has risen this year, it is still about 40% lower than its peak in 2021. Its five-year return rate is approximately 18%, which pales in comparison to the over 130% increase of the Nasdaq 100 Index during the same period.

However, as concerns about the U.S. stock market bubble grow, China has become a viable alternative for many investors.

Vey-Sern Ling, Managing Director of Union Bancaire Privee, stated, ""The necessary driving factors for Chinese tech stocks to outperform the market are in place, including high-level government support, earnings recovery, and the structural growth theme of artificial intelligence. U.S. tech stock valuations have risen for two consecutive years, and now earnings are falling short of expectations, along with macro factors driving stock prices down.""

By Bloomberg

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. plunged about 20% after it said profit in the coming year would be hurt by tariffs, weak margins on server sales and execution issues. The company also said it would eliminate about 3,000 jobs.

CompanyValueChange%ChangeBanka Bioloo₹81.3213.5519.99Somi Conveyor Beltings₹184.3130.0619.49Balaxi Pharmaceuticals₹70.9311.0518.45Laxmi Dental₹434.0060.9516.34Compucom Software₹22.503.0415.62

Earnings, excluding some items, will be $1.70 to $1.90 per share in the fiscal year ending in October 2025, HPE said Thursday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated $2.12 a share.

The lower profitability is due largely to issues in HPE’s closely watched server unit, Chief Executive Officer Antonio Neri said in an interview. Discounting during sales, higher-than-realized costs and a buildup of older-generation semiconductors will dent profit in the coming quarters, he said. Tariffs will also weigh on the profitability outlook.

The company is working through these problems, which included “execution performance,” Neri said. Part of that will be a reduction of about 3,000 roles — 2,500 of which will come through job cuts and the rest through attrition, he said. HPE employed 61,000 people as of the end of October. The workforce reduction will cost HPE about $350 million over the next two years, the company said in the statement, although it estimates annual savings of the same amount by fiscal 2027.

Artificial intelligence has fueled a wave of demand for powerful servers from hardware makers like HPE, Dell Technologies Inc., and Super Micro Computer Inc. Still, this business line has been a double-edged sword due to lower margins because of the need to fill those servers with expensive AI chips from Nvidia Corp. and others.

The issues in the server unit leading to lower profits were present in both traditional and AI equipment, Neri said.

The weak outlook suggests problems at the company may go beyond tariffs and weak margins on AI systems, wrote Woo Jin Ho, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “The company’s cost actions, including job cuts, suggest meaningful inefficiencies.”

The shares dropped to a low of $14.32 in extended trading after closing at $17.96 in New York. The stock has declined 16% this year.

Tariffs also weighed on the profit guidance issued last week by computer and printer maker HP Inc., which said it would cut as many as 2,000 jobs.

In the fiscal first quarter, which ended Jan. 31, HPE’s AI Systems revenue was about $900 million, down from $1.5 billion in the previous quarter, the company said in a presentation. Quarterly orders of these systems surged to $1.6 billion. Neri said there was a jump in orders by enterprises, a customer category generally expected by analysts to provide higher margins.

HPE reported total quarterly sales increased 16% to $7.85 billion. Analysts, on average, estimated $7.81 billion. Server revenue was $4.3 billion, also just ahead of estimates.

In the current quarter ending in April, sales will be $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion, compared with an average projection of $7.94 billion.

Adjusted gross margins in the quarter slipped nearly 7 percentage points from the prior year to 29.4%, short of the 31.3% anticipated by analysts. Profit, excluding some items, was 49 cents per share, just shy of estimates.

Last month, the US Justice Department sued to block HPE’s $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks Inc., arguing the tie-up would harm competition in the market for enterprise wireless equipment.

Neri said the company remains “very committed” to the transaction and expects to close the deal by the end of the fiscal year. A trial date for the antitrust lawsuit has been set for July, HPE said in the statement.

This scale combined with unmatched breadth and depth of data allows marketers to find and activate against the right audiences with even greater accuracy, to engage their consumers in more relevant and meaningful ways.

By connecting Lotame to Epsilon, we’re reinforcing our industry-leading identity graph, giving clients the unique competitive advantage of seeing and engaging with 91% of all adults who use the internet, safely and transparently.""

Sadoun added that influencers and digital commerce have completely rewritten the marketing rules. ""With proliferation and fragmentation of channels from channels, networks, platforms, social and creators, it has become harder for marketers to see if their marketing across all of those channels and through the consumer journey is really driving business.""

""By connecting that best-in-class identity to our clients’ data thanks to AI, and leveraging it across their marketing spectrum from their paid, earned, shared, and owned (PESO) media ecosystem to content production all in their owned environments, we are delivering measurable outcomes for their business,"" he added.

Sadoun also explained that CoreAI, housed on its Marcel platform, can connect capabilities to capabilities based on its data foundation and the AI applications it has built over the last year. With this, the advertising group will be able to connect the core capabilities across media, commerce, influencers, customer experience, creative, production, technology, and consultancy, to transform its clients’ marketing and business model.

""It’s how we are making CoreAI a reality, and how we’ve built a category of one for Publicis. That means today, we are the world’s largest advertising group, leading the industry on every KPI. As we continue to invest in the products, services and talent that drive differentiation and growth for our clients, I couldn’t be happier to welcome Andy Monfried and the outstanding teams at Lotame on board,"" he said.

Since its launch in 2020, Capgemini’s Tech 4 Positive Futures initiative has engaged hundreds of colleagues around the world to create tech solutions that can make a positive impact for the planet and society, for example by reducing carbon footprints and protecting biodiversity.

While the winning projects all hope to deliver lasting change, being part of a Tech 4 Positive Futures team also positively impacts careers too.

Christopher Lue Sang, an electrical engineer at Synapse Product Development, part of Capgemini Invent, was a winning team member in the 2023 edition of the initiative. The team prototyped smart nets that could reduce unwanted by-catch in fishing.

“Tech 4 Positive Futures allowed me to align my career goals with my personal passion for making devices that improve the world,” he says. “It’s really cool that there’s an initiative where those two spheres can meet.”

For Christopher, working on the project meant getting an added level of support to develop new skills.

“It gave me more confidence, at a deep level,” he says. “My colleagues really encouraged me to push things forward, and it wasn’t just about developing hard tech skills, it was about improving soft skills too. Whether it’s organising the project or getting buy-in from stakeholders, those skills are also key. It’s been a very positive experience.”

Also part of the smart nets teams was Peter Hauser, head of the New Product Introduction team at Synapse in San Francisco.

“My role in the team was really to understand how to best scale the product,” he says. “That’s what I do in my day-to-day work. But, by working on the project, I learned a lot about micro-manufacturing. How do you create something that you can build with minimal tools and with minimal skills? How could we foster that? I gained a new set of skills.

“I also learned about the importance of having the legal details sorted out, as a priority, before the work starts. That’s often an overlooked piece of work and yet it’s really important because it enables the delivery without hitting roadblocks along the way.

“I think that was my biggest area of learning. It was an eye-opener for me and something I’ve carried over into other parts of my work. I’ve also brought that knowledge into the latest edition of Tech 4 Positive Futures, where I’m now supporting the team as a mentor. It’s been a win-win – I’ve been able to guide the teams with their submissions, and to support the team at Capgemini that is continuing to foster the (Tech 4 Positive Futures) initiative. If we can pass on the knowledge that others can benefit from to continue the programme, then we’ve achieved some real legacy building.”

Hardik Pithadia, an innovation consultant in Capgemini’s Applied Innovation Exchange (AIE), was also part of a winning Tech 4 Positive Futures team in 2023. The team created an app that encouraged people and communities in urban areas in England to grow the native wildflowers that enable pollinators to thrive.

“When you get that sense of satisfaction through what you’ve achieved with your work, and from the support you receive from colleagues, and you know you’ve made a positive difference in the world – that’s a great feeling,” he says.

“From a career point of view, the project also gave us a lot of exposure within Capgemini. It’s a conversation starter with colleagues and at events, and it helps us understand the types of things that are possible in terms of climate-related projects and sustainability initiatives.

“From a skills point of view, I learned a lot because this was the first project of this type for me. My usual role is more to do with the sales side, but with Tech 4 Positive Futures I was part of a delivery team that was creating a technical solution. I learned so much, and since then I’ve worked on three other projects as a product owner. I’m loving it.

“We’ve also taken the knowledge we gained on the project and applied it to other projects as well. So yes, we were looking at the specific topic of bees and pollinators, but I learned so much about sustainability, biodiversity, and the environmental challenges we’re facing.”

Hardik, like Christopher and Peter, feels that the Tech 4 Positive Futures initiative, has provided a focus for the major challenges faced by societies around the world.

“It has changed my perspective on how I can help clients, and I’ve learned how to ensure sustainability is right there at the front and centre. It’s about being prepared for what’s ahead.”

Ultimately, the solutions the teams delivered, and the skills they learned along the way, are a localised way of learning to make a positive difference globally.",https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Inside-stories_WP_T4PF-update-story.jpg,N

Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Chairman SN Subrahmanyan has announced a one-day menstrual leave policy for women employees in the parent group. This move makes L&T one of the first companies in the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) sector to adopt such a measure. Women employees constitute approximately 9% of the company’s 60,000-strong workforce.

Announcement After 90 Hours Work Week Controversy

The announcement has been made after the significant backlash from Subrahmanyan’s earlier remarks advocating for a 90-hour work week. During an internal meeting in early 2025, Subrahmanyan expressed regret about not being able to make employees work on Sundays and suggested that working 90 hours per week was key to success. His comments, which included a controversial remark about “staring at your wife,” sparked public outrage and debates over work-life balance.

After a huge controversy L&T’s HR department replied to Subrahmanyan’s remarks. Sonica Muraleedharan, Head of HR for Domestic Operations, stated in a LinkedIn post that the chairman’s words were taken out of context and were casual in nature, not intended as a directive.

Menstrual Leave Policies In India

L&T’s policy places it among a growing number of Indian companies supporting menstrual leave for female employees.

Zomato had introduced 10 days of paid menstrual leave annually in 2020. Swiggy had also implemented a menstrual leave policy, though specific details are less widely known.

At the state level, Odisha became the first in India to introduce a one-day menstrual leave policy for women workers in government and private sectors in August 2024. Karnataka has proposed six days of paid menstrual leave per year under the Right of Women to Menstrual Leave and Free Access to Menstrual Health Products bill, though its implementation remains uncertain.

(M&M Ltd.), one of India’s leading automotive companies, today announced that it has become the only car manufacturer in the world to achieve a top 1 percent Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) ranking in S&P Global’s prestigious 2025 Sustainability Yearbook.

The 2025 Sustainability Yearbook ranks the top sustainability performers across various sectors based on S&P Global’s annual CSA. This year’s yearbook analysed over 7,690 companies globally, with only 780 earning a place in the exclusive publication. M&M’s inclusion in the top 1% reflects its outstanding performance and dedication to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles and underscores the company’s commitment to sustainability leadership.

Moreover, very recently, the company has achieved leadership status in the DJSI (Dow Jones Sustainability Index) World Index for 2024 within the ‘auto sector’ as part of the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA). Mahindra’s score this year is 82/100, indicating a 12-point jump from last year, and it marks the 4th consecutive year of being part of the DJSI World Index. This achievement makes M&M the first and only Indian company to attain the DJSI world leader status within the automobiles industry, while being ranked 2nd in the Automobile & Component Industry combined globally.

As the only automobile company in the Top 1% of the Sustainability Yearbook, we are setting a new benchmark for the industry and demonstrating that sustainable practices are integral to long-term success.”

Mahindra’s placing in the S&P Global CSA rankings follows the company’s placing as a ‘World Leader’ in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index last month. It also builds on the recognition it earned in last year’s S&P Global CSA rankings where it scored 82 points.

Mahindra’s exceptional performance is particularly notable in key governance areas. The company chalked up a perfect 100 percentile score in Business Ethics, Risk & Crisis Management, and Transparency & Reporting. The company also demonstrated strong environmental stewardship, earning top scores in Environmental Policy & Management and Waste & Pollutant Management. Furthermore, M&M excelled in social responsibility, achieving high scores in Customer Relations, Human Rights, and Human Capital Management.

Mahindra’s commitment to sustainability is embedded in its core values and business strategy.

The strength of the quarterly profit surprised Wall Street, but sales were just below expectations and uncertainty about both the American consumer and new tariffs seeped into the company's outlook for 2025.

Shares dipped 1% in morning trading Thursday.

Macy's joins other retailers including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Abercrombie & Fitch that have grown cautious about their expectations for 2025.

The imposition of new tariffs this week by President Donald Trump against America’s three biggest trading partners resulted in immediate retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China, while roiling financial markets. Tariffs risk reigniting inflation, which in recent weeks appears to have begun to tick higher.

The U.S. slapped 25% taxes, or tariffs, on Mexican and Canadian imports, though he limited the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. It also doubled the tariff Trump announced last month on Chinese products, to 20%.

Possibly raising anxiety further, certain aspects of U.S. trade policy appears to be fluid, making it more difficult for businesses and households to plan ahead. On Wednesday, Trump reversed course and granted a one-month exemption on his new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers.

Macy's executives emphasized that the company is facing lots of uncertainty given the ever-changing tariff policies. But the company is focusing on what it can control and zeroing in on improving its merchandise and services. Company executives told analysts on the earnings call Thursday that Macy's has been working with its suppliers to increase variety and reduce redundant styles, while adding more exclusive offerings. It's also focusing on improving its store label brands.

“We are in that retail therapy business, a place of escapism, an opportunity to get away from all of the political noise that happens every day,” Macy's CEO Tony Spring said. ""And we have to lean into that. And so, I don’t think the consumer is going to feel a sense of relief in the short term. I’m not an economist, I can’t tell you how long it’ll go on. I challenge our teams every day to think about what do we control?""

The uncertainty comes as retailers like Macy's were already dealing with cautious consumer spending though sales at the department store have been improving.

Macy's, which also runs Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, reported net income of $342 million, or $1.21 per share, for the three-month period ended Feb. 1. Adjusted per-share earnings per were $1.80, exceeding analyst expectations of $1.54 per share, according to FactSet, and reversing a $128 million loss last year.

Sales fell 4.3% to $7.77 billion from $8.12 billion in the year-ago period.

Comparable sales at the overall company— established business from physical stores and online channels — rose 0.2%. At Macy's nameplate stores, comparable store sales dipped 1.9%.

Macy's has been on a campaign to modernize stores, and that appears to be working. At the first 50 stores that have been upgraded, comparable sales rose 1.2%. Those initiatives — which include offering more service in shoe departments and more visual displays— have been added to another 75 stores.

Macy's other brands continue to excel, with comparable sales growth at Bloomingdale’s hitting 6.5%, while Bluemercury reported its 16th consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth, the latest at of 6.2%.

Macy's expects to earn $2.05 to $2.25 per share on net revenue of $21 billion to $21.4 billion in the current year. Analysts expect a profit of $2.29 per share on sales of $21.34 billion.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/67d71690-91d1-484b-9696-f9d92726f40e/wirestory_07ad9991e660c62138ebfb0e8e117f30_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N

The event highlighted both promising and challenging aspects of integrating LLMs into financial analysis, with insights into stock performance linked to executive communication styles.

Key Takeaways

Executives who are proactive and on-topic can generate 247 basis points of alpha annually, while reactive and off-topic counterparts face negative 256 basis points.

The analysis covered the Russell 3000 index, using data from January 2008 to September 2024.

Proactive communication is linked to reduced speculative uncertainty and higher valuation multiples.

LLMs are becoming more integrated into investment workflows, though adoption is still in early stages.

A coding notebook was provided to replicate the research and analysis.

Financial Results

Proactive and on-topic managers generate 247 basis points of alpha per year, while reactive and off-topic managers see negative 256 basis points.

Russell 3000 long side generates 190 basis points of alpha with a 61% hit rate; Russell 2000 generates 200 basis points with a 62% hit rate.

Long short strategies yield 390 basis points for Russell 3000 and 450 basis points for Russell 2000, both with a 63% hit rate.

Operational Updates

S&P Global Market Intelligence uses machine-readable transcripts from January 2008 to September 2024, focusing on the Russell 3000 index.

Questions and answers from earnings calls are summarized using Snowflake’s Cortex LLM summarization function.

LLM embeddings vectorize text to maintain semantic meaning, and cosine similarity scores determine on-topic responses.

Portfolios are ranked monthly, with top 20% companies held long and bottom 20% shorted.

Future Outlook

Proactive executives signal strong risk management and operational strength, reducing speculative uncertainty.

Transparent firms with competitive advantages are more likely to communicate clearly and directly.

LLMs are expected to become more integrated into investment management workflows, although still in early adoption stages.

Q&A Highlights

Sector variations are controlled by ensuring equal representation in long and short portfolios.

Cosine scores are used to assess whether responses are on or off-topic, rather than binary assessments.

LLM challenges include structuring input data and fine-tuning for accuracy.

Evasive behavior in executives is a negative indicator for future performance.

Readers are invited to refer to the full transcript for a comprehensive understanding of the methodology and findings.

With that now out of the way, we’re ready to dive in. We have an all star lineup joining us today. Liam Hynes, our Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research will be walking through the team’s work. Henry Chang, Quant Analyst is going to walk us through the code for this research. And Ronan Feldman, Founder of Pronto NLP, which is now an S and P Global Market Intelligence Company, will discuss how Pronto and this research come together.

Liam, take us away.

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Great. Thank you, Dan. Okay. We’re going to jump right into it. There’s a lot of content to cover today.

So first of all, we’re going to start off with a little bit of a history lesson. On 10/16/2001, Enron held their third quarter two thousand and one earnings call. On the Q and A section of that call, one of the questions asked, how confident can we be that these will be the last write offs? Kenneth Lay, Enron’s CEO responded, if we thought we had any other impaired assets, they would be on this list today. But we do still have at least three areas of uncertainty in the company, which you’re aware of.

Of course, one’s California, we’ve got India, and then of course, finally, broadband. Was Kenneth Lay reactive or proactive on this write off topic in his pre prepared remarks? When analysts posed questions on write offs, there were six questions on write offs

Henry Chang, Quant Analyst, S and P Global Market Intelligence: from analysts and

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: write offs were not mentioned once in the pre prepared remarks. That meant that Kenneth Lay was being reactive rather than proactive on the write off topic. Did Kenneth remain on topic to the analyst question? No, he did not. California, India and broadband do not equal write offs.

Kenneth Lay was pivoting and totally off topic to the question asked. I think folks probably know the rest of the story. Enron collapsed in December 2001, wiping around $74,000,000,000 off its shareholder value, costing thousands of employees their jobs and retirement savings. Lay was actually indicted in 02/2004 on charges including fraud and conspiracy, and in May 2006, he was convicted on multiple counts. This exchange with the analyst was actually evidence in the case the Department of Justice brought against Lay, as prosecutors argue that Lay’s statement was intentionally misleading as he failed to disclose Enron’s true financial troubles.

So that gives us a nice segue into some of the hypothesis that we want to test. The first hypothesis is, do firms that remain on topic when answering questions during earnings call Q and A have superior stock performance compared to those that pivot to adjacent or unrelated topics. And the second, firms that proactively address key issues in their pre prepared remarks before analysts ask about them in earnings call Q and A have superior stock performance compared to those that were stopped responding reactively. So what we’re going to look at today, the data set that we’re looking at and this analysis was stood up on top of is S and P market intelligence machine readable transcripts. The time period we’re looking at is Jan two thousand and eight to September 2004, and we’re looking at the WOSN 3,000.

Okay. So let’s have a look at an example here. The first thing we need to do is identify the question and answer pairs in the earnings call and process them. In this example, we show Caterpillar’s second quarter twenty twenty four earnings call and a question around adjusted margin on lower sales. What we do is we push this question to Snowflake’s Cortex LLM summarization function.

And what that does is it gives us a summarized question, given to that 2023 performance, should margins be adjusted on lower sales and is this due to pricing? Okay, well, why do we do that? Well, summarization does four things. It does noise reduction, it improves semantic matching, there is a standardization and comparability And then lastly, there is some computational efficiency to be gained by doing that. So let’s look at the question and answer pairs, what we actually do here.

So first of all, we start off with the original question and answer in their long form. Then we summarize those questions and answers. And then what we do is we use large language model embeddings. We vector embed the text. So the LLM vector embeddings represents text as a numerical vector.

What this does is it preserves the semantic meaning for efficient processing downstream. And by vector embedding the text, we can now identify whether the answer to the question is on or off topic by calculating the cosine similarity score between the question and answer vectors. So a high cosine score indicates that the answer is using concepts and language similar to the question, I. E. It’s on topic, and a low cosine score equates to the answer being off topic.

We do this for every question and answer pair in the earnings call, and then we get an average cosine score for the entire call. So what we do downstream once we’ve done this feature generation? So we want to see if on topic executives outperform their off topic peers. We’ve just run through the feature engineering. Next, what we’ll do is we’ll form portfolios.

So what we do is by taking the average cosine score, we resample it to the end of the month, we rank the companies in each sector and then what we do is we go along the top 20% of companies with a high Cosan score and remember that’s a high on topics score and then we short the companies with a low Cosan score on companies who are off topic. We then look at the 114 returns, which we have FAMA adjusted for FAMA French adjusted for market value size and momentum. And then we’ve also adjusted the forward returns for some natural language processing signals, sentiment, language complexity and numeric transparency. So here are the results for the Russell baskets. So, you can see here on the long side, the Russell three thousand generates statistically significant alpha of 190 basis points and that’s with a hit rate of 61% and the smaller cap Russell two thousand generates 200 basis points with a hit rate of 62.

On the long short side, the Russell three thousand generates three ninety basis points of alpha with a 63% hit rate and the Russell two generates four fifty basis points, again with a very strong hit rate of 63%. So pure alpha signal from identifying on or off topic executives on an earnings call. So now we’re going to move on how we calculated the proactive and reactive score. For this, we used prompt engineering, for an LLM to pretend it was an executive on an earnings call and to answer the questions. So the context that we gave the executive, the LLM executive to answer the analyst question was just the pre prepared remarks and any proceeding answers to the previous question.

So for example, if there were 20 questions on the call, for the twentieth question, we gave the LLM executive the pre prepared remarks plus the answers to the preceding 19 questions for it to answer. And then we do the exact same process as we did previously. We take those features and we form the portfolios going long, the top 20 of pro active companies, shorting the bottom 20% of reactive companies. And we see the alpha results here. So again, long short portfolio, on the long side, there was a three generates statistically significant alpha of 74 basis points, hit rate of 53%.

And the smaller cap Russell II generates just under 100 basis points there, 96 basis points with a hit rate of 61%. And on the long short side, the Russell three, one hundred and seventy three basis points, 55% hit rate and then the smaller Cap Russel two, small alpha there, two forty basis points with a hit rate of 57%. So again, a pure alpha signal from just identifying proactive and reactive executives on an earnings call. So just going to jump into now a couple of examples, going back to the Caterpillar example. One of the questions from the earnings call was backlog increased by $300,000,000 Was this due to pricing or an increase in order volumes?

Well, higher sales and order volumes were actually covered in the prepared remarks by Andrew Bonfield, the CFO. And when we posed that question to the LLM executive, the answer was the backlog increase was due to a mix of higher prices and increased order volumes resulting from new orders and a dealer inventory changes. That came out with a Cosent score of 0.89, putting it in the 80 percentile and this indicated that the executive was being proactive. So what was the actual original executive answer? The original executive answer was price had significant impact while volumes fluctuate quarter by quarter, backlog remains healthy.

And how did that executive score? Eighty second percentile and the executive was answering the question and on topic. So we look at how did Caterpillar perform two weeks post that earnings call when the S and P 500 was down 2.16% and Caterpillar actually outperformed, it returned seven point three percent two weeks post the call, so a 9% active return of the S and P 500. Onto another example, this is taking a question from Golden Ocean Group’s first quarter twenty twenty three earnings call. So the question was, could you talk about the FFA markets as Capes large vessels are in backwardation and smaller vessels are in contango?

Well, FFA markets was not covered in the pre prepared remarks by the executive. The L and M answer was the FFA market croissant score, tenth percentile, so the executive was being reactive, I. E, this topic was not covered in the prepared remarks and the executive was reacting to the analyst’s question. How did the executive actually answer the question? Our comments are more in the longer term perspective, so I won’t be able to comment specifically on the FFA curve.

I would say that that’s not even going off topic. I think that’s changing the topic or just bluntly not even answering the topic. Cosan score is 0.69, fifteenth percentile. Executive is clearly answering off topic. What happened to Golden Ocean Group’s share price?

Two weeks post the call, the S and P 500 was up 1% and Golden Ocean Group dropped seventeen point three percent two weeks post the call. Okay. So we’ve identified two alpha producing signals. One is, a proactiveness and the second is on topicness. But what what happens if we create four communication styles from those two signals?

So the first one we looked at is a proactive and on topic manager. So this is an executive that is giving the analysts everything that they want to know in the prepared remarks. And when the analyst ask a question, the executives remaining on topic to the question asked. The second is proactive and off topic. So proactive in the prepared remarks but answers the question off topic.

The third is reactive and on topic. So even though they didn’t cover the topics in the pre prepared remarks, when analysts do ask about those topics in the Q and A, executives remain on topic to the question asked. And then you’ve got the entire flip side, you’ve got reactive and off topic. So these are executives where they haven’t given everything that the analysts are looking for in the prepared remarks. And when those analysts go looking for that information with their questions, the executives go off topic.

And the performance is quite telling. So you can see here the blue line, the proactive and on topic executives significantly outperformed their reactive and off topic peers. This is a backtest that was done over the past sixteen years on the Russell three thousand. So proactive and on topic managers generate two forty seven basis points of alpha per year. And the flip side, their reactive and off topic counterparts generate negative two fifty six basis points of alpha year.

So that’s a differential of five zero six basis points on the long short side from those two communication styles. So what we’re looking at here is a table of those returns. So the top left quadrant that you can see here is a proactive and on topic manager and the bottom right quadrant is a reactive and off topic manager. Essentially, what we did is we did a dependent sort on proactiveness. So we looked at the proactive cosine score, we put that into three buckets, into three tertiles.

And then within each of those tertiles, we tertiled it on the on topic score. And what that does is it gives you nine distinct portfolios. And what you’re looking at here is the return of those portfolios, the T stat in the brackets and the hit rate percentage below that. So firms with the most on topic and proactive executives outperform those with the most off topic and reactive executives by more than 5% per year. The spread of on versus off topic is larger when executives are reactive and the spread of proactive versus reactive is larger when executives are off topic.

But an interesting exercise to do is to rebase the returns in the table. So if I’m looking at the top left proactive and on topic quadrant here, I can see that 100%. That represents the maximum return that you can get from this strategy. On the bottom right, the 0% there that you can see represents the zero return that you can get from this. So the interesting thing is that it is the combination of the two evasive behaviors, both reactiveness and off topic alignment that signals underperformance.

So managers are significantly penalized if they’re both reactive and coupled with off topic. It makes sense, right, they haven’t covered some key topics in the prepared remarks that analysts are looking for. And then when analysts actually go and try and find information from the executive on those topics, they’re avoiding the question, going off topic and potentially being evasive.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Hey, Liam, fantastic. So far, we’re getting a lot of action through our Q and A widget here. I see a question has just come in. So just to clarify on this analysis, I’m going to rephrase the question a bit here. So what you’re basically saying is that you could be the most off topic executive, but as long as you’re proactive, you can earn $0.75 on the dollar and as long as you’re on topic, even if you’re the most reactive, you can earn $0.69 on the dollar.

Is that the way to understand this?

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Yes, that’s exactly right, Dan. Yes, so you can be entirely you can be an executive and be entirely off topic, but as long as you are proactive in the presentation, you’re not penalized as much. And the same, you can be an entirely reactive executive on the earnings call, but as long as you’re answering the analyst questions and remaining on topic, you’re not penalized. It’s when both of those characteristics are blended in an executive that they’re really penalized. When they’re both reactive and off topic, there’s significant deterioration to the returns of that company.

Okay, so we’ve kind of run through, we’ve shown empirical results that these two behavior signals are efficacious of forward returns. But why? We’ve kind of experienced the what, but why are they experiencing these returns? Well, when a manager or an executive is in the earnings call and they are answering questions, what does their one year forward gross profit look like? So reactive and off topic managers, about one year from the earnings call, generated around 12% growth in their gross profit.

But proactive and on topic managers have around 2.5 times that growth. They generate 31% growth in their gross profit one year prior to the earnings call. So essentially what that means is that you have executives that are exuding some confidence because they understand their business very well and they can probably understand if there’s any headwinds or any operational inefficiencies in their organization in the coming twelve months. So their non evasiveness breeds transparency, they’re willing to answer every question and remain on topic and they’re not evading or hiding anything from the audience.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: We’ve got another good inbound here, Liam. A question, did you look at whether there was any multiple expansion within the company? So just sort of dovetailing on what you were saying there, it looks like firms can either appreciate and value via stock price through multiple expansion or through improving actuals. And so you’re showing improving actuals here, which argues that there’s real improvement in the firm. How about perception wise?

Did we see any growth in the multiple that the stock trades on for the proactive and on topic firms?

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Yes, there was some slight growth in that. The main effect on the multiples basically came from the actual next slide I have, but essentially proactively addressing key issues reduces speculative uncertainty, so it actually leads to a lower risk premium. So the more transparent you are, the potentially the lower the risk premium you have. And what that can do is it results in in a higher valuation multiple as investors pricing stability and there’s some predictability around the future earnings growth. So very well timed question there from the audience.

Thank you. And then the other economic rationale that we have is strategic foresight and competitive positioning, right? So firms that proactively address investor concerns, they demonstrate strong risk management and strategic foresight. And what that does is it signals operational strength. Confident firms with durable competitive advantages are more likely to engage in clear direct communication and then firms in weaker positions may avoid key topics signaling underlying vulnerabilities.

So like I mentioned on the previous slide with the gross profit growth, if you’re an executive and you know that your twelve year outlook isn’t that strong, it puts that executive in a weaker position and they avoid key topics and they may try to avoid difficult or hard questions from analysts. I’m going to hand it over to Henry Chang. Henry is going to run through a little bit of a coding tutorial on how we took the machine readable transcripts and pointed it to the LLM API and came up with these two scores, the proactive score and the on topic score. I’ll hand it over to you, Henry, there if you want to share your screen.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: And while Henry is pulling that up, I’ll just let the audience know as when Henry shares his screen, the media player should get larger within the webinar console. So the slides will still be visible on one side, but the demo is going to occur in the media player and that should resize automatically for you. As a reminder, everything in the webinar console is resizable, movable. So if you need to adjust, now is a good time to do that. Go ahead, Henry.

Henry Chang, Quant Analyst, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Thanks, Sam. Thanks, Liam. So in my part, I’ll be covering how to actually start from the transcript and divide those two signals that Liam just mentioned. So for the purpose of today’s demo, I’m pulling up Caterpillar’s Q2 twenty twenty three earnings call transcript in a PDF format, but keep in mind that on the back end, we have 196,000 transcript in machine readable format to be processed systematically. So let’s have a look at this transcript.

So in the transcript, you can have a look at all the participants. So there are two CEOs that attend this earnings call and there are also analysts from investment banks that jump onto this earnings call and ask the questions. So there are two sections in an earnings call. First, they start with the presentation. So this is when the CEO and the CFO jump onto the call, tell everyone how much money they’ve made in that quarter and they also talk about other things like risks, outlook and basically provide details of the finance of that company.

And then there’s a second section which is the Q and A. So this is a section where the investment banking analysts, they jump onto the call, they heard all of the questions they heard of the pre prepared remarks that the executive just gave and they asked questions around those topics. So you can see here that these are different analysts and here the executive takes turns to answer those questions. The demo that Liam just gave in the case study was this question that came from Temi Zakaria. She is an equity researcher from JP Morgan and her question was on the backlog.

So backlog increased by RMB300 million and she was asking if that’s purely driven by pricing or an increase in the order volume. So now I’m jumping on to Snowflake and show you how we process this systematically on the back end. So let me pull up the same transcript. It’s the second quarter twenty twenty three and the company is Caterpillar. So in here you can see this transcript.

We are starting from the Q and A pairing table. So essentially what it says is that we have everything up from the very first question, which is normally just greetings, paired to the answers. So we have all the question and answers pair running from the first to the end. And on average, we have about 20 to 30 of these Q and A pairs in an earnings call transcript. On the back end, we paired all of these together so that we can process them, we can do all the vector embedding, the cosine similarity calculation that VM just mentioned and here I’m going to show you how powerful it is our machine readable transcript product is.

So it gives you the details of the transcript. So basic information like the call date, so this earnings call was conducted on the 08/01/2023. It’s the second quarter of twenty twenty three and you can also see the headlines. So these are all just basic information of the earnings call, right? Nothing too surprising.

But here I’m going to show you how that really the part that how amazing our machine readable transcript is. It’s about how we can link each of the questions to the person that’s asking the question. So we actually have our professionals dataset that allows you to map each of the components from the transcript to the person that’s asking a question. So here you can see that Temi Zakaria was on here and you can see her question pro ID. So this allows you to map this person to the estimates.

So it’s a very powerful tool that allows you to map the questions to the estimates so you will be able to analyze things like whether in an earnings call, if an executive is only picking is picking more bearish than bullish analysts who ask the questions or stuff like mapping this to the estimates and allows you to sort of predict sort of the outcome of the company. And then you can also do that for on the answer side. So you’ll be able to map that to the person who is answering that question by the pro ID. So you know that some of them are coming from the CFO and some of them are coming from the CEOs and this allows you to analyze the language that each of the person is using in answering these questions. So it opens up tons of NLP analysis work that you can do to the transcript.

So jumping back to our signals, what we did was that we vector embed both the questions and the answers and then we can calculate the coherence similarity between them. That’s for the first signal, the on topic signal. And we also have the second signal, which is the proactive and the reactive signal and that will have to generate the LMM response. And here is the prompt that generates all that. So as Liam mentioned, the prompt first started with pretend to be a top executive, please answer these questions that came from analysts and then we provided with 60% of the pre prepared remarks that the executive gave and then we asked the same question that the analyst asked.

So now let’s take the example of that question that came from Temi Zakaria. It’s a twenty fourth question in the component order, so let’s select that and we can also have to answer that corresponding to that question. So what’s happening on the back end is that the prompt I just showed you, we are giving that to an LMM and the LMM is generating the LMM response on the fly. So here you can see that this was the question. It was on the 300,000,000 increase in backlog and here’s the executive answer that we just saw in the PDF and now this is the LM answer.

So as Diya mentioned, we also summarized all three of them for consistency and for standardization. Here is the summary of the question. So indeed, it was talking about 300,000,000 increase. Here’s the answer. The executive answered that increase was used to both the both pricing and the volume.

The LMM answered similarly. It’s about pricing and the volume. So from here, you can vector in-depth both the question and the answers and here are your signal scores. With that, I’m going to hand back to Dan and he’s going to introduce Roman from Pronto.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Thank you so much, Henry and Liam. That was a fantastic deep dive into how we construct these signals. To quickly recap, we built these signals using machine readable transcripts using an off the shelf large language model. The pre calculated signals for this research are now an integrated part of Pronto NLP, providing actionable insights to investors. Pronto NLP also includes many other signals, including those generated with a fine tuned, purpose built large language model designed specifically for financial applications.

And what we’d like to do now is to help us understand the ProntoNLP approach and how this enhancement aids in the generation of the signals. We are going to turn it over to Ronan Feldman to discuss a little more about Pronto. Ronan, over to you.

Ronan Feldman, Founder, Pronto NLP, S and P Global Market Intelligence Company: Thank you, Dan. Basically, what you see here is we take an earning call, we break it into its sections, like the presentation part and obviously the Q and A pairs. And then we break it further into sentences. And if the sentences are complex, we break it even into multiple phrases. For each phrase, we identify the sentiment that we have for that phrase, positive, negative and neutral.

Then we also identify the importance, how important is that particular phrase within the context of the whole section. So we have high, medium and low in terms of the importance. We can use it when we calculate scores in the signals, we can use the importance in order to provide weights. Then we also have an explanation. The explanation is extremely important because it’s like a guardrail to make sure that there are no hallucinations.

We look at the explanation and we see if it really correlates to the actual text. We look at the numbers that are in the explanation to see if they appear inside the text. If we see that there is no connection between the explanation and the actual text, we actually run it again. So that minimizes the chances of any hallucinations that we may get from the LLM. One of the nice things that we get from the LLM is that events are generated automatically.

There is no predefined taxonomy. So unlike a lot of other competing products where you have a predefined defined taxonomy and then where there is a new topic, you do not discover it until you manually change it. We use the LLM to automatically detect new topics. The problem is that there are 2,700,000 topics that were identified by the LLM. That’s way too many for any quantitative signal.

And this is why we use the embeddings of all the instances that the LLM identified and cluster them into 110 events. When you use actually our platform, which is part of the offering, you do get the original LLM tech. So you can actually see it and you can consume it using the API. Let’s go now to an example that actually utilizes the topics that we identify. So you saw previously that we identify all those events.

And you can see that combining all the amazing work that Dan, Liam and Henry did, we combine it with the topics that we identify. And then you can actually find interesting peaks for specific topics that are connected to off topicness, reactiveness, so to see what topic actually are exactly the topics that executives like to avoid. And let’s look at the first one. The first one, if we can see in 2021, we remember the supply chain issues during COVID. And that was a topic that both executives that were off topic, they did not like to discuss.

The next one, we can see is a recession. So this was in 2022. Consider there was a big jump in terms of the negative sentiment related to a recession and that again was the main topic for both executives that wanted to avoid answering the direct questions and when the questions are around recession, usually they try to find some detour. And the last one that we can actually get here is margin, which was in 2023. And again, for all of those executives that were below the score that you can see or the 0.8, we see that there was a big increase in such topics for both executives that try to avoid questions or find any way to go around them things around margin.

So back to

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: you, Dan.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Thank you, Ronan. That was a great deep dive on Pronto NLP and a fantastic webinar so far, folks. We’ve got plenty, plenty of time for Q and A and a lot of questions coming in. So looking forward to that session. Before we jump into the questions, we’ve got a polling question up.

To what extent have you incorporated large language models into your investment management workflows? And we’ll give everyone just a few minutes, a few seconds to fill that out there. Lots of folks at different parts of the journey and lots of considerations to be made before bringing this in. Okay, we’ve got another ten seconds here to fill that out. Again, folks, there’s a Q and A widget in the webinar console and we’ll be shifting questions coming in, in droves here.

That’s great. Keep them coming while you fill out that polling question. All right, let’s take a look at our results. We actively use LLMs only 8.3%, experimenting 25%, exploring 33% and not currently using 33%. So still a very early part of the journey for many folks.

And I think this hopefully will help with getting started on that process. Okay. So let’s jump into some of the questions we’ve received so far. I’ll give the first one over to Liam. A question came in, how do you account for sector specific variations in executive Q and A when constructing your signals?

I think you addressed that, but maybe you could just recap real quick.

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Sure, sure. So I’m going to be on topic here. The best way to do this is probably repeat the question. So how do we control for sector variations in the portfolio construction? What we do is we obviously construct the on topic scores and the proactive scores.

And then what we do is we go into at the end of every month, we go into each sector and then we rank within the sector. So we’ll get the top 20% and the bottom 20% in each sector and then we combine those 11 secondtors, top 20% and bottom 20%. And what that ensures is that there’s an equal representation of sectors in the long portfolio and in the short portfolio.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Fantastic. So sector neutral, equal representation in long and short. So we don’t have a sector tilt in any of those. Here’s another one. I really like this question.

The the ask the LLM, is this question on topic, was it addressed in the prepared remarks?

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Do you want me to take that one, Dan? Sure. Yes. Well, there’s a few reasons why we didn’t do that. One is that it’s probably too subjective for the LLM, so and also it would be a binary outcome for the LLM to determine whether or not the answer was on topic or not.

So it would either say that the question was on topic or was off topic. So it would be a binary assessment and it’s not a continuous quant assessment like the cosine score. So, the LLM doesn’t necessarily do this well. So if you go back to the Golden Ocean answer, technically the LLM might have said that that was on topic, right, because the executive mentioned the FFA curve, but quantitatively, it was off topic. And, you know, we’ve obviously published this research.

It’s along with a coding notebook and there’s a rag engine that we stood up on the back end for this and there’s a couple of reasons why we went down that route. We need consistency in responses from the LLM. Technically, you could ask the LLM, is this question on or off topic? And then you could ask the LLM the same question again and it might give you a different answer. So something where you’re relying on the LLM to be very subjective gives you very inconsistent results.

So I could run it back just today and tomorrow if I ask the LLM again, I might get varying results altogether. And so the way we did it this way is we ring fenced the LLM to generate a very refined feature and then we pipe that feature into our backtesting framework.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Yes, that’s a very comprehensive answer. So yes, so quantification to your point, you sort of quantify it as opposed to just labeling it with a binary label. And then, if cosine score goes from zero to one or minus one to one depending on whether your vectors are all positive or not,

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: it’s

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: certainly one might think arbitrarily that off topic is less than 0.5 or something. But I think you were finding that most of the off topic answers were zero it’s really like about a 0.8 threshold that kind of divided the universal on the medians. Is that right?

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Yes, that’s correct. And actually, we have a slide in the appendix, I just put it up on the screen there, that might kind of help answer this subjective question, right? So we did a bit of an experiment where

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: we

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: asked an LLM to look at the Q and A of an earnings call and we gave it two prompts. The first prompt said, you are a financial expert and then asked to score the Q and A section from very negative to very positive on a scale of minus two to plus two, so five increments. And then the second prompt, we just did not include a financial expert. We just said score the Q and A on a very negative minus two to a very positive plus two. And you can see here in the chart that the financial expert prompt came out with a mean of one.

And then when we excluded the financial expert from the prompt, it actually came out closer to minus one. So very small changes and the LN can be very subjective. So you don’t get these consistency in responses when you ask the LOM a very kind of broad based question.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Makes sense. So the vectorization and the cosine score is all very consistent and well controlled, whereas the LOM responses has more variability. This actually dovetails with another question we’ve got and maybe Ronan, you could jump in on this one as a generic question. What are the biggest challenges in applying LLMs in the financial markets and how do you address those in both this research and Pronto NLP?

Ronan Feldman, Founder, Pronto NLP, S and P Global Market Intelligence Company: So I think one of the main issues is first you need to structure the input in the right way. In this case, we did it for earning calls. We actually do it for any kind of financial content like filings and then you need to accommodate for a lot of things that you need to filter. So just the pre processing until you get really clean text that is structured in the right way is very important. The other thing is I want to go back to the point that Dan mentioned before.

We actually do heavy fine tuning to the Lama models in order to get to a really good financial LLM. So we use over 10,000 tagged paragraphs using a bootstrapping approach, the classic teacher student framework. And we saw that that alone, if you do it in the right way, gave a huge boost in terms of the alpha that you get out of the signal.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Maybe Liam, coming back to you, we’ve got a few questions here around comparing this approach to traditional sentiment analysis, Did you control for the sentiment of the call when you were calculating your returns and what other sort of considerations might have been made?

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Yes, let me just push it to the slide with the backtest results. Yes, so you can see here on the third bucket there on the backtesting when we computed the portfolio returns, we looked at the one month forward returns. We did actually control for sentiment in the 114 returns. So what we did is we stripped out the Fama French for residuals, but then we actually looked at natural language processing signals. So sentiment being net positivity.

So we looked at the Lachlan McDonald dictionary that was published, I think, in 2010, and we looked at all the positive words from that dictionary in the call, all the negative words, and you can look at a ratio of the net positivity. So we actually stripped that positive sentiment out of the signal. So it’s a pure alpha signal. It doesn’t have that sentiment variable embedded into

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: it. Got it. So these and how about correlation wise? Do you see any major correlation between earnings call sentiment and these other signals?

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: No, actually. We did some time on Macbeth, a regression on it and it actually came out very, very strong. So the on topic score has got about 80 basis points of a coefficient with a very strong T stat of around 3.5 and that’s after we controlled for seven or eight fundamental factors and three or four sentiment factors. So no, it seems to be kind of a unique on topic and proactive signal that we’re after finding here. It’s not correlated to sentiment, which makes sense really when you think about it, right?

Because sentiment is looking at whether or not the executive was speaking positively or negatively, right? But theoretically, I could be answering a question on or off topic and still have a positive or negative angle on it. So I could be answering a question off topic, but be very positive about how I was answering it off topic, right? So it is an accretive signal to sentiment. The way I like to think about it is, this is more of a behavioral signal rather than a sentiment signal, right?

We’re identifying behavioral characteristics of the manager on the call and the behavior is how do they answer the question? Are they on topic or off topic? And then what’s their presentation like? Are they proactive and reactive? So I would say it’s mutually exclusive to this sentiment.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Henry, this next question I think is for you here. Can you talk a little bit about the large language model that was used? You mentioned LAMA, which LAMA model was used? And how much of the proactive on topic signal is using the original transcript product, how much is part of Pronto NLP?

Henry Chang, Quant Analyst, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Absolutely. So we use the LAMA 3.18 b model. And the reason that we use this model is because at that time, we were looking for an LMM that has large enough context length. That is a big thing for us. Because if you think about it, an average earnings call transcript has about 10,000 tokens in its prepared remarks and another 10,000 tokens in its answer.

So we need to find a model that’s large enough to fit all of these texts in. GBT 3.5 was an option at that time but then due to the context length constraint, we have to go with LAMA. And in terms of whether this is built on top of Pronto, at that time, this was purely done on machine readable transcript But then after we get those results, we can combine this signal with Pronto, which is another value add and strengthened result that we have.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Excellent. Thank you. Liam, coming back to you. On these signals, could an executive deliberately go off topic to avoid discussing bad news? And how often do we see executives going off topic during earnings

Ronan Feldman, Founder, Pronto NLP, S and P Global Market Intelligence Company: calls?

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Good question. So could an executive purposely go off topic to avoid answering questions, is that what you asked?

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Sure. And I think it’s just a clarifying sort of question as to what you’re trying to

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: capture. Right. Yes. We’re essentially trying to capture evasiveness, right, or the executive not wanting to cover a particular topic. So that’s what we’re trying to capture when we’re looking at the on topic and off topic from the executive.

And it seems to be systematically when you look across the Russell three thousand, it is efficacious and it is quite a strong signal. So executives, when if they just exhibit that one characteristic of just not being able to answer the question and remain on topic, it’s a very poor sign for forward results. And when you think about it, there’s two reasons why you might have an executive who goes off topic, right? One is that they just might have the competency to answer the question or they might know. And the second one is that they’re purposely pivoting or going off topic.

Both of those reasons are bad, right? One is evasiveness, which is not good news and the other one is the executive potentially doesn’t understand the question or the business model or the operations associated with it. I’m sorry, Dan, what was the second question, Russ?

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: How often do executives go off topic? I think you had a slide towards the end there on the number of off topic and reactive questions and I think there was an absolute sort of number. Do you have a sense of what

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Yes. So actually, this is quite interesting actually. So if we look at a cosine score threshold of about 0.8 both on the proactive score and the off topic score, you can see here that it kind of hovers around, let’s say, 28% or 30% of executives who are reactive and off topic. So it’s quite a sizable chunk, maybe anywhere between a quarter to just under a third. And actually, if you look at this chart, you can actually see that there’s some spikes here in the fourth quarter, right?

And the reason we think that there might be some spikes in the fourth quarter is that the fourth quarter earnings call is normally going to be centered around the full year results. So when executives are delivering their prepared remarks, it’s mainly going to be centered around financials and there might be a lot of room for the topics in there. Hence, you get this spike in reactiveness in the fourth quarter because they’re discussing full year results. And also, you see that in them being off topic as well in the fourth quarter. And that’s potentially because they might be focusing on the financial results or they might be prioritizing other components in the earnings call.

So they have less room for spontaneous discussion.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Fantastic. Maybe one more question. We’ve got about five minutes left and all three of you maybe can weigh in. How should those that are interested in adopting large language modeling in their process and generative AI in general think about the approach, how should we get started?

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Well, there’s one way you can get started. We actually published, let me jump on to the so if you scan this QR code, you’ll be able to get access to the paper every row, but in this paper, we also have a coding notebook and that is a very comprehensive thousands of lines of code in there in order to stand our readers up on machine readable transcripts, generating the data frame, getting those Q and A pairs, vector embedding the text, doing the cosine similarity scores, the whole shebang. Everything that we’ve covered in the presentation today and on the research is, you can see that in the coding notebook. If you click a link on the PDF, it will bring you to a non compute coding notebook where you can view all of our code, so fully transparent. That’s one way that you could successfully stand up some LLM integration onto your textual data suite.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Okay. This has been a fantastic discussion and I want to thank all of our speakers, Liam, Henry, Ronan for sharing your expertise today. For those who want to revisit today’s session, a webinar replay will be available. You can also check out the related content widget, which should have links to the white paper, the coding notebook additional resources. On behalf of S and P Global Market Intelligence, thank you very much for joining us.

We look forward to continuing this conversation. Have a great day ahead, folks.

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Thanks, Dan. Thanks, folks.

Ronan Feldman, Founder, Pronto NLP, S and P Global Market Intelligence Company: Yes. Thanks, Dan. That was wonderful.

In an effort to boost sales and prioritize customers, new CEO Brian Niccol has made changes he says will help the Seattle-based coffee chain get ""back to Starbucks.""

Under Niccol's leadership, Starbucks has reversed its open-door policy, unveiled new and returning coffeehouse amenities, in addition the menu overhaul and corporate layoffs.

Starbucks has said it would begin to ""optimize"" menu offerings, resulting in a 30% reduction in both beverage and food items by the end of the fiscal year.

As of this week, a selection of ""less popular"" beverages, including several Frappuccino blended beverages, will be removed from the menu. A full list of Starbucks beverages being cut can be found below.

""We’re simplifying our menu to focus on fewer, more popular items, executed with excellence. This will make way for innovation, help reduce wait times, improve quality and consistency, and align with our core identity as a coffee company,"" Starbucks said in a statement.

How many Starbucks locations are in Oregon?

Oregon has around 400 Starbucks locations. To find a store near you, visit the Starbucks store locator at starbucks.com/store-locator.

See list: Starbucks cuts Frappuccinos, other 'less popular' beverages

The drinks were cut for one of three reasons: either they weren't commonly purchased, complex to make, or were similar to other beverages on the menu.

The Royal Breakfast Latte, White Hot Chocolate and several Frappuccino blended beverages are among the beverages set to be cut.

Here's the full list, according to Starbucks spokesperson Erin Stan:

Espresso Frappuccino

Caffe Vanilla Frappuccino

Java Chip Frappuccino

White Chocolate Mocha Frappuccino

Chai Creme Frappuccino

Caramel Ribbon Crunch Creme Frappuccino

Double Chocolaty Chip Creme Frappuccino

Chocolate Cookie Crumble Creme Frappuccino

White Chocolate Creme Frappuccino

White Hot Chocolate

Royal English Breakfast Latte

Iced Matcha Lemonade

Honey Almondmilk Flat White

New and returning items coming soon to Starbucks

While some drinks face an imminent retirement, Starbucks has plans to bring back ""beloved"" Lavender beverages and will also introduce a new Iced Cherry Chai and Jalapeño Chicken Pocket in the spring.

Starbucks lays off 1,100 corporate workers

In addition to menu and policy changes, Starbucks revealed last week it would lay off 1,100 corporate employees.

The announcement, summarized in a press release, came a month after senior leaders began ""evaluating the role, structure and size of"" its global corporate divisions.

The retailer has also made the decision to not fill ""several hundred"" open positions. The move does not apply to baristas and others who work in Starbucks stores themselves.

""I recognize the news is difficult. It is not a decision the leadership team took lightly,"" Niccol said in a statement. ""We understand the real effect this has on partners’ lives and their families. We believe it’s a necessary change to position Starbucks for future success.""

Ozery Bakery, Vaughan, Ontario, offers Morning Rounds, portable flatbreads in flavors like Blueberry and Apple Cinnamon, as well as Snacking Rounds, which are bite-sized.
“Anything you can just pick up and eat in one bite I feel like is the biggest thing for people right now,” Demi Kontos, commercial strategy and analytics, Kontos Foods.
“Snacking has been a big trend.” Tortillas are well-suited for the snacking and convenience trends, observed Jim Kabbani, chief executive officer of the Tortilla Industry Association (TIA), as many producers already offer smaller sizes for products such as street or mini tacos.
Kontos Foods’ pre-grilled panini breads have been popular with foodservice operators and consumers alike for this reason.",,,,,,,https://www.bakingbusiness.com/articles/63398-snacking-convenience-big-trends-for-tortillas-and-flatbreads,2025-03-07 10:16:34.352921,ID21,Kraft Heinz,,Lucas Cuni-Mertz,"The line between meals and snacks has become increasingly blurred, with many consumers, especially younger ones, replacing traditional meals with frequent snacking throughout the day. Tortilla and flatbread producers are playing into this with snackable products that offer consumers the on-the-go convenience they desire.

“There’s a clear shift toward smaller, snack-sized formats, reflected in products like mini naan dippers, mini soft flour tortilla bowls and street taco-sized tortillas,” observed Julia Mills, food and drink analyst, Mintel.

Ozery Bakery, Vaughan, Ontario, offers Morning Rounds, portable flatbreads in flavors like Blueberry and Apple Cinnamon, as well as Snacking Rounds, which are bite-sized. The rounds are marketed as offering “none of the crust and fuss of sliced bread.”

“[The rounds] can be used for everything from snacks to wraps to breakfast,” said Sabrina Pacitto, marketing manager, Ozery Bakery. “By keeping flavors fresh and exciting, we help make mealtime more interesting, encouraging customers to enjoy our products across various occasions.”

Kontos Foods, Patterson, NJ, recently introduced flatbread minis, 2-inch cocktail flatbreads ideal for kids’ lunches, meal prep or catering events.

“Anything you can just pick up and eat in one bite I feel like is the biggest thing for people right now,” Demi Kontos, commercial strategy and analytics, Kontos Foods. “Snacking has been a big trend.”

Tortillas are well-suited for the snacking and convenience trends, observed Jim Kabbani, chief executive officer of the Tortilla Industry Association (TIA), as many producers already offer smaller sizes for products such as street or mini tacos. Tortilla makers just need to remain nimble and quickly adjust their portfolios and innovation strategy to meet these evolving consumer preferences, he said.

The desire for convenience extends to foodservice as well, where Kontos said operators are looking for flatbread and tortilla products that require little preparation and can help them save on labor. Kontos Foods’ pre-grilled panini breads have been popular with foodservice operators and consumers alike for this reason.

“The grill marks create a great presentation, and operators don't have to do anything to them to achieve that fresh-off-the-grill look,” Kontos explained. “Our breads heat up very easily, so it just saves time, it saves labor, it saves money. That's a product big that's skyrocketed this year.”",https://www.bakingbusiness.com/ext/resources/2025/03/06/0306-Kontos.jpg?height=635&t=1741273973&width=1200,N
